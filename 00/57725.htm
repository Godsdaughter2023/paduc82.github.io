<h2>            Windows 10 Display Shuffle Doesn&#39;t Work</h2>
                    <p>My computer came with Windows 10 installed. &nbsp;I usually set the background to shuffle pictures from a folder on my system. &nbsp;I have all the settings set up as I like, however, it never changes. &nbsp;It stays on ONE photo and I have to manually right click on the
 desktop and select view next image (or whatever that says) to get it to change. &nbsp;I have it set for shuffle every 10 minutes, but it will remain on the one picture indefinitely!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone else have this problem and if so, have you fixed it? &nbsp;If you have, please tell me how to make it work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read where someone has 438 photos in the folder they use, but it shuffles only a few, well that's not my problem, my problem is it doesn't shuffle any photos, at all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be helpful and I'll try them all til something works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Want to change to Windows 8 from Windows 10 on a new laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I've just purchased a new ASUS laptop that has Windows 10 installed, but I need to use Windows 7 or 8 for my specific software requirements: Anyone know if I can just install Windows 7 or 8, or will I have to find another laptop that hasn't been upgraded
 to 10?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Software designed for Windows 8 works with Windows 10, in fact, most of the applications I have are from Windows 7 and they work just fine under Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will first need to go to the manufacturers website for your model computer and first find out if there are Windows 7 native drivers available. A lot of computers that come preloaded with Windows 10 do not have native driver support for Windows 7 by the
 manufacturer. If there are no native drivers, you will have to consider returning the machine and purchasing a machine preloaded with Windows 10 Pro with downgrade rights to Windows 7 Professional. Or look through the manufacturers catalogue for systems already
 preloaded with Windows 7, usually the business line will have these options. </p>

<h2>            Programs and Apps always open in full screen mode.</h2>
                    I am using windows 10 on a desktop and 17 inch laptop. Since the latest round of updates many programs and apps open in full screen mode and not the size and position of last use when closed.&nbsp; With the large screens that I have, this is frustrating and
 annoying.&nbsp; I did NOT have this problem before the updates.&nbsp; Why would the updates change a perfectly good function.&nbsp; The program is called WINDOWS, not WALL.

            I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />This is normally caused by a program interfering.  You can help relieve it by turning off all freeloaders at Startup, following Step 4 in this checklist:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.
<br />
<br />If that's not enough then I'd complete the rest of the steps which  go over  the install to make sure it is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done.
<br />
<br />To program a windows to open where you want it, open and drag it to the position and size you want, then click the middle "Maximize" box several times.  
<br />
<br />There are also small 3rd part apps to assure that the size you want for the Windows is maintained, like AutoSizer and Sizer.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Are you sure you don't have Tablet Mode enabled? Press Windows key + A then toggle off 'Tablet Mode' in the Quick Actions area of the bottom.
<br />
<br />If you want the Window's position and size to be remembered, then
<br />
<br />    Open the Window and size and position as you like
<br />    Holding down CTRL, click the white X in the red box to close the Window (in the top right of the Window)
<br />
<br />Next time, Windows will attempt to load it in the position. 
<br />
<br />Windows 10 unfortunately has a way to of ignoring these small, but very important customizations. Your only option might be just to resize them the way you like again.

            Thanks Andre.&nbsp; I tried what you suggested and it did not solve the problem. Your last comment that Windows 10 has a way of ignoring things,is probably correct and is what is so frustrating about Windows 10.&nbsp; The other frustrating thing is I have had my
 laptop for 2 years, and it was after a recent windows update that this problem developed. No other software was loaded or installed.&nbsp; It was the Windows update that caused the problem.&nbsp; I appreciate that the updates help to protect my computers from evil forces.
 I just wish that the functionality would not change with the updates.

 them, just like countless other people have who I have helped with this very same problem - not one of whom ever came back to report it again!

<h2>            What is the Windows 7 SP1 convenience rollup suppose to look like</h2>
                    <p>I did a 7 clean install.</p>
<p>Installed SP1</p>
<p>Installed KB 3020369</p>
<p>Installed KB 3125574</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look at the installed updates, what I see are a few updates, 5 of them and&nbsp;2 were there before installing the rollup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of importance I see Update for Microsoft Windows KB3125574 and KB3020369 marked as Successful.</p>
<p>I also see Windows Update Agent 7.6.7600.320 marked as Successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shouldn't I see all the updates that the rollup did?</p>
<p>Or is a reference to the KB all that will appear?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, after I did the rollup and rebooted the PC and went to check for updates it&nbsp;has been running for about 7 hours and all it sez is Checking for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time and effort.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 freezes if inactive for a few minutes. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> contrabardus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 freezes if inactive for a few minutes.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Reopened, not really solved. </span>
</strong>Found a workaround for this. See my post below for details. It's the "Shut down Hard Disk after..." feature in the power savings area that seems to be causing my freezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an odd problem. This has been happening for a few days now and I'm at a bit of a loss about what the problem is exactly. It seems to have started after a recent Windows update, but I'm not sure exactly what specific element has screwed things up
 for me and it may have taken a bit of time for me to notice the problem due to the nature of it. I wouldn't know when to roll back my system to even if I was willing to try, and I'm not at this point.<br />
<br />
If I leave Windows 10 alone for more than a few minutes, it freezes. This happens without fail and it's consistent. Any more than five minutes give or take a minute or two and it's frozen hard and requires a hard reset. Ctrl alt del doesn't work, windows key
 doesn't work, alt tab doesn't work, nothing but the power button or the reset button on the case has any affect.
<br />
<br />
There is no error message, there is no spinning wheel mouse icon, the mouse pointer doesn't move. It's just frozen and no input does anything. The screen just has a still image of whatever was displaying when it happened and audio is also dead, no system sounds
 or anything. There was sound once, but it was when I had a game running and left it too long, and it was just that locked up audio buzzing sound. It's a hard lockup of my system and not just the video getting stuck.<br />
<br />
It also doesn't matter if something is running or not. It happens even if I just have the PC sitting on the desktop with nothing running.. If I have a video or game running, it happens then too. As long as I'm not actively inputting something with an input
 device such as the keyboard, mouse, or a gamepad it locks up. If I pause a game to go get something to eat it's frozen when I come back, if I'm watching a video and get up to go to the bathroom it's locked up when I get back, it doesn't matter if I pause whatever
 it is or leave it running. No input from me, means a hard freeze after a few minutes without fail.<br />
<br />
If I'm doing something, typing, playing a game, or whatever, it will run for hours uninterrupted. No problems whatsoever. I've got Fallout 4 and I've played for several hours without any problems as long as I'm sitting there and actually playing the game. The
 same goes for anything else as long as I'm actively doing something, web browsing, watching videos, whatever, as long as there's frequent input from the mouse, keyboard, or some other device, everything runs fine.<br />
<br />
It's like the PC is trying to go to sleep or go into an idle or power saving mode from a lack of input, fails to do so, and is crashing hard as a result. The problem is I've disabled everything that would do that.<br />
<br />
I'm running Windows 10 x64 Home edition. I have an i7 3770k, 16Gb of Ram, two Radeon HD 7970s in Xfire [doesn't matter if this is on or off], and my boot drive is a SSD. It's not a new system and Windows 10 has been running fine on it for several months now.<br />
<br />
I've already disabled all screensavers, there are no scheduled tasks or updates screwing with anything. They all happen in the middle of the night and nothing is pending. All my drivers are up to date, caches have been cleared, and everything runs fine as long
 as I'm there and active. The usual suite of common updating software such as Adobe, Java, and virus definitions are also up to date, so that isn't it either.<br />
<br />
I have already disabled shut downs and sleeping in the power settings. Every power setting has been adjusted so that my PC never shuts down on its own and was already set that way to begin with. I've double checked and everything is still set the way it should
 be. I've already turned off Link State Power Management in all power settings. I also disabled usb selective suspend, turn off hard disk after...,&nbsp; made doubly sure the sleep settings were disabled,&nbsp; and switched the IE Javascript Timer Settings between Performance
 and Power Saving, all with no effect on the problem. It still locks up if I don't touch anything for a short time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have AMD's new Crimson drivers, but this was happening before I installed them. That's not the source of the problem. I installed the new driver earlier today in the hope of maybe fixing the problem and it had no affect on it.<br />
<br />
I've scanned for viruses, malware, and adware with multiple programs. My system is clean.<br />
<br />
My hardware temps are fine, all system monitors show a clean bill of health and no unusual activity spikes in my hardware. Task Manager, processes, and services don't show any extra or unusual programs running. Nothing is out of the ordinary when this happens
 outside of there being no input for a bit.<br />
<br />
There are no error messages popping up at all. No BSOD or indication of any problems outside of the freezing itself. It just locks up suddenly and once it does no input does anything except for a reset using the tower's power buttons.<br />
<br />
Kind of at a loss here and it's super annoying. I've lost a few hours worth of gaming progress and I hate having to hard reset all the time due to this mess and I've got no clue how to make it stop doing this at this point. I do not want to go back to Windows
 7 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas about what this might be and how to fix it?</p>

<p>Hello Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have exactly the same problem as this person.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I running a Fresh install of Windows 10 Pro 64 bit, which randomly freezes the entire computer, three or four times a day.&nbsp; No mouse, No control Alt-Delete.&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>After searching the Microsoft forums, and other web sites, it seems as if<strong> thousands of people are experience the same Windows 10 FREEZING problem.&nbsp;</strong> The only way to get the computer working again is by
<p>
</p><p>I've tried every "normal" trouble shoot idea presented on this, and other forums.&nbsp; The real issues is, Windows 10 should NEVER freeze, requiring the power supply to be switch OFF on the back of the computer, during normal usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>
        </p>

            <p>All right, I figured it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was an issue in Power Settings after all, specifically the 'turn off Hard Disk' setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was set to 'Never' by default in all my power settings profiles. However, even though it said it was set to never trigger, it was actually set to trigger at a low value. Something like five minutes or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to turn each individual one of my power settings timers on and see if any of them locked up the computer after the correct amount of time had passed because it was bugging me that it seemed to happen at around the same time interval regardless
 of how many resources the PC was using and only if I left it untouched during that time. Even the slightest twitch of the mouse on screen would prevent it, which seems to indicate it was some sort of sleep timer issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure enough 'turn off Hard Disk' locked everything up when it triggered after I set it to ten minutes at exactly ten minutes, requiring a hard reset of my system. This worked three times in a row.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, I cranked it up to 100 minutes, and sure enough that seemed to clear it up while I was using the PC, but when I left it on and went off to do something else for a couple of hours, I came back and it was locked up hard.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I set it back to 'never' again, the problem vanished and hasn't happened since. I left my PC on overnight [I don't normally do this] just to test and everything was working fine in the morning when I went back to it. No freeze, and the issue seems to
 have cleared up completely, at least so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently the update screwed up the default 'never' value of this setting and set it to a low variable without changing it from 'never' in selection box somehow. It was something like five minutes or so despite reading as 'never'. Changing it to something
 else, and then putting it back to 'never' again got rid of the freezing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it's worth noting that this setting shouldn't lock up my computer even if it is set to trigger. There's still a problem in there somewhere because doing something should wake up the disk that gets shut down, and instead it's just hard freezing the
 PC. If I set it back to a time interval, it still freezes, meaning I can't use this power saving feature even if I wanted to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm booting from a SSD and not a HDD. That may have something to do with it, and this is just a workaround for a broken setting, not a real fix.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're having this issue, try going into your Power Settings, select the one you're using, and go into the advanced settings and find the 'turn off Hard Disk after' setting. Even if it's set to 'Never' already, change it to something else see if it still
 freezes after the time has passed, restart, and then set it back to 'never' again and give your PC another restart.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I did this it hasn't locked up again unless I set it back to trigger and wait the set amount of time. Then I have to reset my PC to unfreeze it again because it still doesn't 'wake up' like it should when triggered. This feature is broken on my system
 and has been for the last update or so, no idea why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd recommend doing this to all the Power Settings profiles you have just to be sure if you're having this freeze issue.</p>

            <p><span>Hello Contrabardus,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I really liked your idea of going in to the Advanced Power Settings, and specifically selecting 'Turn OFF Hard Disk after’: NEVER. &nbsp;I had previously selected all other Sleep and Hibernation modes
 to OFF, but for some reason I didn’t select 'Turn OFF Hard Disk after’: NEVER.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you recommended, I tried selecting various times for the
<strong>'Turn OFF Hard Disk after’ </strong>to activate.&nbsp; Unfortunately, my new Windows 10 computer didn’t ‘freeze’ as predictably as I was hoping.&nbsp; In fact, when I selected 'Turn OFF Hard Disk after’ 2 minutes, it took a full two hour before it froze.&nbsp; (requiring
 a hard reboot)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I was hopeful that selecting 'Turn OFF Hard Disk after’: NEVER, would eliminate the freezes, but unfortunately, it didn’t work.&nbsp; This strategy did reduce the number of time the computer freezes
 during the day, to 2 or 3, which is down from 5 or 6 times a day.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>My current hardware is:
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Motherboard: ASUS Z170 PRO GAMING – Updated BIOS</span></p>
<p><span>Intel: i7 6700</span></p>
<p><span>WINDOWS 10 PRO&nbsp; 64-bit (Clean install)</span></p>
<p><span>Kingston SSD:&nbsp; Windows 10 PRO installed on the SSD</span></p>
<p><span>Secondary HD: Seagate Barracuda 1 TB
</span></p>
<p><span>NO graphics card. (Using the integrated graphics on the new Intel chip): Latest Updated Intel drivers</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Although your idea didn’t work out, I actually still believe you are correct, that the issue is related to the secondary Hard Drive (Seagate Barracuda 1 TB) timing-out.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A colleague of mine, a had a computer built, with exactly the same parts, at exactly the same time, by exactly the same person; and he does NOT have a single problem.&nbsp; The only difference is:
 I added my old Seagate Barracuda 1 TB hard drive, which contained my old data.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I also unplugged my old Seagate Barracuda 1 TB storage hard drive from the computer.&nbsp; I was hoping with the hard drive physically disconnected, the freezing might stop.&nbsp; Unfortunately No.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I tested the CPU and motherboard integrity, by downloading and running Prime95, which stress tests the CPU and RAM memory extensively. &nbsp;&nbsp;The cpu test is heavy floating point math and the RAM
 portion, reads and writes GBytes.&nbsp; After an amazing 16 hours of rigorous stress testing, the computer perfectly passed all tests.&nbsp; And hour after it finished, while it was idling, doing absolutely nothing, is when the computer froze again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I believe, when Windows 10 is installed, if there is a legacy secondary hard drive attached to the computer during the installation process, Windows 10 installation process will be corrupted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I’m at a loss, and have completely run out of ideas.&nbsp; Please let me know if you have any ideas.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you very much.

            <p>Confirmed that it doesn't make the issue go away, just delays it for longer. It also makes it less consistent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's still a hard freeze, I'll come back to check on a download after leaving it for a while and everything will be locked up. Same goes if nothing is running at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It takes an hour or so of inactivity for a freeze to occur, making doing things like downloading large files, such as games, a huge pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did the troubleshooting and neither produced any results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just suggests that I set my power plan to 'a more efficient power plan' which is useless to me as I use my PC primarily for gaming, which is a high power consumption activity. Put simply, that defeats the whole point of why I built my PC the way I did,
 which is to turn up the settings on demanding games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot does not fix the problem. It still freezes after a while. This is unsurprising as I regularly manage my startup and disable and clean out bloatware and unnecessary apps from launching on startup to begin with. I still tried it and it had no
 effect on the issue. I also regularly run anti-virus, malware, and adware scans and clean such things from my PC on the rare occasion that they do pop up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No idea what the problem is, but it is super annoying when I'm trying to download large files or watching a long video where I'm not using any input for a while, such as a streaming feature film or something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a problem, not as bad as it once was, but it's still a seriously irritating issue that my PC keeps locking up this way.</p>

            Keyboard drivers are unrelated to being unable to move the window by selecting Move then dragging. &nbsp;This issue only occurs when using two monitors. If I disconnect one monitor and reboot, the problem disappears. This is a not a driver issue.

            <p>The reason I can't click and drag the title bar is because the other screen is often turned off, and if a window is opened on the other screen I have no way of moving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alt+Space -&gt; M -&gt; Arrow keys works, thanks! But there is still a bug in Windows - it should be possible to drag a Window using Alt-Space -&gt; M. Does that work for you?</p>

            <p>I can only check with visible windows on a single monitor, but it seems A,t+Space, M places the move cursor in the Title bar, where it responds to Arrow keys but not click+drag.&nbsp; However, if you click once without dragging, you return the cursor to a normal
 state but it is now located on the Title bar, &amp; click+drag should work.</p>

<p>Hey JustMe9808</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to post this on the Xbox Forums. I'm so sorry you are experiencing an issue such as this and I very well understand the struggle and frustration that comes with one not being able to maintain your save data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason why your save file is not being retained could have something to do with either your network configuration or perhaps some corrupted files in your game. You can first try to
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/how-to-uninstall-reinstall-game-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
re-install</a> the game and see if you still reproduce the same issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your save data for any games on Windows 10 should be automatically saved up to the Cloud. Minecraft has an auto-save feature that as soon as you exit the world, your world and progress with your character will be saved immediately. However you can alternatively
 you can <a href="https://help.mojang.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2961769-backing-up-minecraft-worlds?b_id=5408" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
copy your world</a> to make a back up of it to save locally. Additionally if you are looking for where the
<a href="https://help.mojang.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1480874-where-are-minecraft-files-stored-?b_id=5408" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
files for Minecraft</a> are stored in your PC with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go ahead and give this a try, and let us know the results!</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t Open Word &#40;but it does open&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelbonanno  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Open Word &#40;but it does open&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Each time I try to open a Word document, I get the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The command cannot be performed because a dialog box is open.&nbsp; Click OK and then close open dialog boxes to continue."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click OK and don't have to close anything.&nbsp; The document then opens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to use the following steps to troubleshoot:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Search</strong> and then click <strong>
All files and folders</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type officeav.dll.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. In the <strong>Look in</strong> box, click <strong>Local Hard Drives</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Click <strong>Search</strong>.&nbsp; When the search result is displayed in the right pane, not the path of the Officeav.dll file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Locate the Officeav.dll file, right-click <strong>officeav.dll</strong>, and then click
<strong>Rename</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Type officeav.old, and the press ENTER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Restart your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's start with number one.&nbsp; When I click "start" and then "search", there is no "All files and folders" option.&nbsp; I can click on "documents", "apps" (formerly known as "programs" when Americans could handle two syllables) or "web".&nbsp; So, right out of the
 gate, I have to deal with the condescending "Cortana" - I'm one of the few Americans who realizes that you have not appropriated an actual cloud - and, of course, when I type in officeav.dll, I'm directed to the web and the Bing search engine, although I want
 Google to be my default search engine.&nbsp; Then I'm directed to several "fixes", some of which require me to download something I don't wish to download because I've been burnt by these before - you know, you download it and, next thing you know, you're paying
 for something you never intended to buy.&nbsp; Also, Norton comes up as having something to do with this problem.&nbsp; I use McAfee and have nothing to do with Norton.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, given that I don't want to use all of the "resources" that Microsoft is trying to force me to use, how do I get rid of this annoying problem.&nbsp; I'm 68 years old, been using computers for over thirty years and, in the beginning, was played every time I
 had a problem.&nbsp; Please stop playing me and help me solve what is probably a problem simple enough to fix that&nbsp;I've typed all of what&nbsp;I've typed for nothing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and this problem started after an "important" update that took enough time for me to grow a beard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You've dumbed down most Americans and I may have been dumbed down and not know it.&nbsp; I'd like to think I'm not, but that's the beauty of how Microsoft and the rest of our corporate government works, right?&nbsp; Sort of like a Pavlov dog thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I just get rid of the unnecessary, illegitimate and annoying message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Michael Bonanno</p>

            Hi Michael.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features, highlight Microsoft Office, choose Modify, then Repair.  This should fix it.  
<br />
<br />You can right click Task Bar, choose Cortana, then Hidden.  She should go away.
<br />
<br />You can set Google as your search in any browser's Options or Settings.  
<br />
<br />Then use the Start button search (click button, type search) for files or programs onboard only.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Which version of Microsoft Office or Microsoft Word is it? 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features 
<br />Scroll down to Microsoft Office
<br />Select it
<br />Click Change
<br />
<br />Now, wait while the repair wizard starts up.
<br />
<br />Choose the type of repair you would like to perform. Depending on the severity or availability of your Internet connection, you could try the first option, Quick Repair, which is much faster and tries to fix the problem without a data connection.
<br />
<br />If that doesn’t resolve the problem, then go back and try the Online Repair option. For my particular issue, I ultimately had to use the Online Repair.
<br />
<br />The repair process is straight-forward following the wizard. Note that you’ll need to save your work and close all Office programs first, and then click Repair.
<br />
<br />Then wait while the repair process runs.
<br />
<br />You will notice the repair experience is similar to a fresh installation. The amount of time it takes will depend on your connection speed and what the issue is.
<br />
<br />You will see your Office apps light up in their respective colors while the repair completes.
<br />
<br />Once the installation is complete, restart your computer just to be sure and launch your apps and verify if the problem you were having is resolved.

<p>I am having the same problem as Michael Bonanno. &nbsp;&nbsp; I am running Windows 10 and using 2007 Microsoft products. &nbsp;&nbsp; Starting a few days ago (today is June 16, 2018), whenever I open a Word document, I started receiving<span> the message&nbsp;</span><span>soft&nbsp;</span><span>"The

</p><p><span>I have tried the suggestion that you made to Michael twice, but still receive the same message. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have some other thoughts/suggestions that I could try.</p>

<h2>            Sending out blanket emails</h2>
                    <p>I sent out 3 emails&nbsp;containing about a &nbsp;dozen email addresses using bcc.&nbsp; Those 3 are&nbsp; stuck in my Out box.&nbsp; One&nbsp;of the emails that is stuck in my Out Box--I will subsequently get an error message (Ox800CCC79)) indicating the email address that is an invalid
 address.&nbsp; The other two emails stuck in my Out box does not give me an error message at all; they just don't send.</p>
<p>Questtion #1 - Am I to assume none of these email addresses listed in the emails receive it???</p>
<p>Question #2 - I am unable to get rid of the error message when I attempt to send it again.</p>
<p>Question #3 - If I retype and resend the two blanket emails that do not give me an error message, indicating a certain email address that has an invalid mailbox, how do I know which address is giving me a problem and causing the whole email not to send.</p>

<h2>            Unable to access files from OneDrive Web</h2>
                    <p>*Original Title: One Drive access</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installed Windows 10 on my laptop. Expected to be able to access my One Drive Web page from Explorer, which has files synced with my desktop computer. Found only laptop files under One Drive in Explorer. Tried to create a workaround by making a shortcut
 to One Drive on the desktop of my laptop (confusing, I know). Didn't work. Shortcut takes me to a blank page. Clicking an icon above does take me to my regular page, but that seems clunky. What am I missing? Clicking on One Drive in Explorer should take me
 to One Drive on the Web where my desktop files are stored and synced.</p>

            Thanks but those links did not help. One Drive on the laptop still does not take me directly to my files stored on the Web. Funny thing is, it did work with Windows 8.1, so it was something I did in the update that caused the problem.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Recently I tried to go through the licence transfer process but it does not appear to complete fully. &nbsp;On Xbox.com I get to the following stage:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi766.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fxx307%2fMattLoaf%2fImages%2520For%2520Forum%2520Posts%2fOther%2fUntitled1.png" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my Xbox 360 I get to the following stage:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi766.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fxx307%2fMattLoaf%2fImages%2520For%2520Forum%2520Posts%2fOther%2fIMG_0617.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I download the pack it completes extremely quickly, shows a tick as if it had been purchased already and the content does not appear in the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone know of a solution?</p>

<p>Im having EXACTLY the same issue. And im redownloading all DLC again from my console. But, it is not the new licenses and are not small in size. They are the Full DLC and now there are two of everything on my console. One from when i done the HDD transfer,
 and One from the Download. </p>
<p>I have spoken to customer support and they told me to delete the oldest one, being the one i transfered and couldnt play offline. Im @ work atm so will check how things go this afternoon and let ya'll know</p>

<h2>            use gmail for mailto&#58;protocol</h2>
                    When assigning a program to a file type or protocol, the two options for the mailto: protocol are Windows Live Mail (which launches that program) and Google Chrome (which just launches a browser window...not gmail).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any way to get the mailto: protocol to launch gmail? &nbsp;(I installed the gmail notifier and checked "used gmail for internet mailto: links" &nbsp;but it doesn't seem to override this setting).</div>

<div><br />
<div>Is the google mail notifier supposed to override the program that's selected as the default program for the mailto:protocol? As I said above, I have to either select Windows LIve Mail or Google Chrome. Windows 7 won't let me add any other option.</div>

<div>Sorry, I should have been more specific. It does launch but I've declined to register as a user. I don't really want to have to get the automatic updates, etc., (Windows updates are too burdensome as it is.)</div>

<div>As I said, i can only choose between WLM and Chrome when setting my mailto: defaults. (Why is Chrome even there?? It's not a mail client). &nbsp;And the Gmail notifier for Windows 7, which is apparently supposed to be a work-around, doesn't seem to work for
 me. &nbsp;Mailto: links continue to open whichever program (WLM or Chrome) is currently selected as the default even when I've selected "use gmail for outgoing mailto: links" in the notifier set up.</div>

<p>Hi Doughlas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Virtual machine is 16GB dedicated RAM and 127GB of disk space.</p>
<p>The OS is installed on an SSD. I have re-installed the VM but still each applications takes sometime to appear fully.</p>
<p>

    <title>My single System Restore Point is growing in size....How is this - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> budguinn  say:</h3>
<h2>            My single System Restore Point is growing in size....How is this possible&#63;</h2>
                    <p>As the title says, the restore point created yesterday started at 24mb......six hours later this same restore point was listed as 237mb......early this morning the same restore point was showing that it was using 430mb.&nbsp; The same restore point is now listed
 as taking 2.1gb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not turned the machine off, because it will delete all restore points on shutdown.&nbsp; It only has one restore point.&nbsp; I am getting the size by looking at the 'configure' button on the System Protection screen.&nbsp; I just checked it as I was typing this
 to make sure I gave you the right screen, and it is now at 2.92gb.&nbsp; It has grown .8gb in fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>Can you explain how a restore point, which is a snap shot of my system at one point in time, can continually grow larger and larger?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never had this problem with Windows 7, only with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have asked about this before, but the support staff only reply once to a question, whether their answer cures the problem or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to see the previous questions that I've posted they are under my name.....somewhere on your system.</p>
<p>

            <p><span><span>Hi Bud,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. I am sorry to know that you are facing issues with Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I do appreciate your efforts and time. Do not worry, will assist you with the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to delete the system restore point which you have created and run SFC scan and then try creating restore point again and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Summary</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. This article describes how to
</span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></span></span><span> to scan your system files and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7 or Windows Vista. If a Windows
 Resource Protection (WRP) file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected. For example, some Windows functions may not work, or Windows may crash.
</span><span>System file check works on Vista, Win 7, Win 8, Win 8.1, and win 10&nbsp;<strong>
</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to try the&nbsp;steps provided,&nbsp;in the link below in order to run SFC scan on your computer.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93</span></span></a></span></p>

            <p>Hello SA,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ran sfc.scannow&nbsp; three times and every time it has come back with no repairs necessary.&nbsp; If you had read my other posts you would have seen that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have left the machine in 'sleep' mode for three hours and the original 27mb restore point has now grown to over 10.5gb.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>My question on this latest ticket is how is this possible for a restore point to change over time?</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The restore point has grown over 371,000 times the original file size.&nbsp; Again, how is this possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone there able to answer a simple question?&nbsp; This is my third or fourth ticket on restore points and I get nothing other than canned answers.</p>

                    <p>Hi Sirs,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got HP Pavilion x2 12 with windows 10.&nbsp;I tried to operate Shamela&nbsp;Library from&nbsp;the&nbsp;micro ssd memory, and tried from external HDD&nbsp;&nbsp;but failed. Then tried to install&nbsp;Shamela Library, but&nbsp;without success and got the following messages:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Unable to open archive file</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- could not extract support files - setup will abort</p>
<p>
</p><p>N.B. the a.m. library works with me on Windows Vista, 7 &amp; 8 without problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance &amp; looking forward to your reply.</p>

<br />
<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Perform the procedure to repair the system files:
<br />Follow these instructions: press the Windows + X keys and select Command Prompt (Administrator) or Windows PowerShell (Administrator), in the window that will open, you must type the commands in their respective order:
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />• DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•  sfc /scannow 
<br />
<br />Each of these actions can take a few minutes, so it is important to execute one at a time. When finished, you must restart the PC.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

</p><p><strong>Question: </strong><em>Is it possible to use skype out from Cuba to call land lines and cell phones in Canada? Just voice not video.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, from Cuba, you can call&nbsp;Canada's landline and mobile numbers.&nbsp;You just need a&nbsp;calling subscription or Skype credits to cover the calls.</p>

 when I put PC Print on my other computer as well.&nbsp; It worked fine &amp; now that computer gets this error message when trying to open those files as well.&nbsp; Thank you

    <title>uninstalling McAfee - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            uninstalling McAfee</h2>
                    I got a puzzle for you all. I uninstalled the McAfee Internet Security or whatever, but the McAfee Security Scan Plus simply won't respond to the uninstall bit. When I first tried to uninstall it told me that there was an error and asked if the program
 had worked before (I said yes because it had). Now I'm not sure if I simply deleted it or if moving the "mcuicnt" and McAfee ICO file as well as McAfee Internet Security app (which I didn't know was still on my comp till now) to the recycle bin made that an
 issue (they aren't deleted yet, they are on my desktop as I moved them back out), but as of right now none of those things will open.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I open the properties of the McAfee Internet Security and go to any anything besides the "shortcut" tab it starts on it tells me that the "target box is not valid" and that I need to "make sure the path and file name are correct."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But I guess thats a bit off topic. I'm worried about the Security Scan Plus (which I actually used today and it worked so I take back the deleting the program part. Sorry if this is so disjointed and confusing). It refuses to respond when I uninstall and
 even when I find the uninstall app and let it "make changes to my computer" it doesn't do anything. I tried restarting my computer but it won't work.</div>

</p>
<p>That's a direct link to the download of McAfee Consumer Products Removal tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It should remove almost all McAfee products and almost all of their settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The usual way most would uninstall McAfee is to&nbsp;&nbsp;uninstall&nbsp;all McAfee products from&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Program &amp; Features in windows control panel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then run that tool for cleanup.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you deleted the Program folder rather than uninstalling it - the proper way would
 be to reinstall it,, then uninstall it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that removal tool probably fix you up.</p>
