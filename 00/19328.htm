<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I upgraded my phone software to latest version 40.0.0.5*&nbsp; and after that when i play music, the player does not exit and keeps running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any pointers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi.. Thanks for the suggestion , but it did not help. I found that playing original licensed songs downloaded from nokia music is the problem. After i play a original song , the player does not exit. If i do the same using a song loaded from elsewhere it
 works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guess there is a license thing which prevents from closing.. Any software updates recommended?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>These bugs do happen when updating a software.</p>
<p>Try re-installing the software and if that doesnt work try reseting your phone&nbsp;by doing the following steps..</p>
<p>1. Back up all&nbsp;your files and contacts</p>
<p>2. Turn off your phone</p>
<p>3. Press the Green + Red + Camera Key</p>
<p>4. Turn your phone&nbsp;back on while still holding the buttons</p>
<p>5. Then let go after.</p>
<p>This should have reset your phone.</p>
<p>If it comes up for a lock code its 12345.</p>

<h2>            Keep the Windows 8.1 features</h2>
                    <p>I've been testing the new OS Windows 10 and asking myself if there is anyway to keep the features of 8.1 shortcut on the left corner so people can have option to choose the new windows features 8.1 or the old style&nbsp; buttom that I think is very backwards
 from old windows features and not making people happy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your attention</p>

            I agree. I love the fact that I have a new way of using my computer right alongside the classic interface and programs. While giving traditional desktop users the design they prefer is a very good thing, I hope MS doesn't think that everyone prefers to
 work that way.<br />

<h2>            Empty Junk Email  Folder on Safari on iPhone</h2>
                    Is there way to directly empty out the Junk Email folder instead of deleting them and having them going into the Deleted Items folder on the outlook.live.com site on Safari (iPhone)?&nbsp; There is an Empty Folder option when I'm on a computer browser, but
 cannot seem to find it on the mobile version.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Junk Email Filter helps reduce unwanted email messages in your <strong>Inbox</strong>. Junk email, also known as spam, is moved by the filter away to the
<strong>Junk E-mail </strong>folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Junk Email Filter evaluates each incoming message to assess whether it might be spam, based on several factors. These can include the time when the message was sent and the content of the message. By default, the Junk Email Filter is turned on and the
 protection level is set to <strong>Low</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the emails which you are trying to delete will go to the deleted folders it helps you to restore or recover the deleted emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using the browser or the native mail app to access your account in your mobile?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post to us with more information to help you better.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To <strong>delete the Junk Mails from the Outlook account using the&nbsp;Safari browser</strong>, I suggest you to follow the below steps.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>You may see the <strong>Check mark symbol </strong>next to the <strong>+ symbol
</strong>on the <strong>top right corner.</strong></li><li>Click on the<strong>&nbsp;Check Mark symbol first </strong>and <strong>select the Emails you want to delete.</strong></li><li><strong>Once you select the emails</strong>, you will be able to see the <strong>
Delete Bin symbol </strong>below.</li><li>Select the <strong>Delete action </strong>and the emails will be deleted from the Junk Folder.</li></ul>
<p>Please post to us if you have any further queries to help you better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, I know this can be done, but it&nbsp;then mixes ALL of the junk emails with my deleted emails from Inbox that I might actually want to find and recover later in the Deleted Items folder.&nbsp; I would like to just be able to Empty the Junk Emails folder bypassing
 the Deleted Items folder, like I am able to on a non-mobile version of the website.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This option when you delete the junk and moves to deleted folder happens so that you may retrieve the emails you need them.</p>
<p>
Outlook.com will recover as many messages as possible and put them in your <strong>
Deleted</strong> folder. When they're back in your <strong>Deleted</strong> folder, move the important ones back to your inbox or other personal folder because the
<strong>Deleted</strong> folder gets cleaned out periodically.

            <p>There is no way to empty the junk mail folder from mobile interface. It's something Microsoft have not implemented ("empty junk" is not same as deleting emails because it permanently deletes all folder content, not move to Deleted Items, and is much safer
 to do because junk is often malware). I have no idea why their mobile interface has so many deficiencies. I have to login to my PC to do many things that Microsoft only implemented on Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very narrow minded to think mobile people want only basic capabilities. This holds Microsoft back in the market place -- such as the disaster of Windows 8, where all customers were plunged back into the Stone Age due to minimal or basic capability in apps.
 Put all capabilities into mobile UI.</p>

            There is a solution for this ridiculous change in mobile hotmail. &nbsp;If you download a browser app (like puffin) it will load your pages in a fully functional format. Thus, your empty junk option is intact. &nbsp;What angers me is that these changes are done
 purposefully, fully intending to frustrate the users who will inevitably use Hotmail anyway. &nbsp;Blessings -

<p>I got the same problem. 2 solutions which both work for me:<br />
1. Hard reset,<br />
2. When calling and experiencing the problem try to turn the volume up and down, this way the audible volume will somehow some way come back.</p>

<p>Hi Deian,<br />
<br />
I understand that this user encountered an issue when displaying his profile picture in Outlook client. Based on my experience, I suggest you try the steps below:<br />
1. Update your Outlook client to the latest referring to the article below.<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2625547" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to install the latest applicable updates for Microsoft Outlook</a><br />
2. Try to create a new profile and then add the account into the new profile.<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to create profile and set up an e-mail account in Outlook</a><br />
3. Follow the instructions in the article below to repair Outlook client.<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-NZ/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Repair an Office application</a><br />
<br />
If the issue persists after all the steps above, I’d like to confirm some more details below for further research:<br />
1. Is this user the only one encountered this issue in your organization?<br />
2. Which Outlook client are you using, Outlook 2010, 2013 or 2016?<br />
3. Could you let this user check in Office 365 OWA (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>) to see if the issue also appears in OWA?<br />
<br />

    <title>Should I stay or should I go &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Should I stay or should I go &#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been&nbsp;an Insider using Windows 10 builds as they are rolled out since January 2015. Currently I have rolled back to Windows 8.1 Pro on my PC and Laptop, both have the Get Windows App icon in the Systray, and I have reserved Windows 10 as per instructions,
 so all I have to do is wait until, on or after the 29th of July 2015 to upgrade to Windows 10 RTM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So with all the concerns over Product Keys and Activation, I am better off as I am, or should I go back to the latest Windows 10 build, and if I do, will I always be a "Beta Tester" as an Insider for Microsoft ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the final RTM Build 10.0.<strong>10176</strong>.16384.th1.150705-0552 has already been decided, you may read about it here:-</p>

            <p>Thanks for your replies, I was rather hoping someone from Microsoft would address my question. So OK, when I upgrade to Windows 10 RTM from Windows 8.1 Pro via the Get Windows 10 App in my Systray sometime on or after July the 29th. Will my copy of Windows
 10 be automatically activated and licenced to me at my Microsoft account email address via my Windows 8.1 Product Key ?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is so much confusion in these Forums relating to Activation/Licencing and Product Keys, and that was the determining factor that made me give up on Windows 10 Preview Builds, and roll back to Windows 8.1 Pro.</p>

<p>The safest option is the one you have selected to roll back to windows 8.1 and update via the GWX icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you will get a prompt on or near 29th July 2015 to give you details to update to windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it will be automatically activated and licenced to the PC (motherboard actually&nbsp;+ license product key).</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, it is not directly connected to your Microsoft account. Your email address you used to reserve window 10</p>
<p>did not have to be a Microsoft email it could be any email address. It was just used to give you more details</p>
<p>on what to expect with Windows 10. You could skip the email notification when reserving and you will still</p>
<p>get a prompt on your pc via the GWX to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you run&nbsp;via windows&nbsp;update&nbsp;(through the GWX icon) and update to windows 10, &nbsp;your pc details&nbsp;will
</p>
<p>update the Microsoft Licensing server to transfer your valid windows 8.1 pro key to a valid windows 10 final
</p>
<p>release key.</p>
<p>You will then be given details how to either create a windows 10 ISO or download the windows 10 final ISO.</p>
<p>You can then delete/format your hard&nbsp;drive&nbsp;and reinstall on the same pc a fresh copy of windows 10.</p>
<p>This new install of windows 10 will also be fully activated. You can repeat formatting and reinstalling but</p>
<p>if you change your motherboard then you will need to buy a new copy of Windows 10.</p>
<p>Also&nbsp;if you format your computer and try to reinstall your old windows 8.1 pro it will not activate.</p>
<p>You cannot go back to using window 8.1 pro unless you buy another copy of windows 8.1 pro with a
</p>
<p>different retail product key. It is a permanent one way transfer from windows 8.1 to windows 10.</p>

<p>Thanks for that info Max, since my PC is pre 2012, my Win 8.1 Product Key is not embedded in its BIOS, I do however have that key on file on a USB stick. So I guess I will have to activate Win 10 RTM manually using that key ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will be interesting to see the Windows Update screen in the final RTM build as an Ex Windows 10 Preview Insider who does not want builds via Fast or Slow rings, just Windows 10 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">The odd thing is, when I upgraded to Windows 10 build 10162 from Windows 8.1 Pro on my Laptop which has its Product Key embedded in its BIOS, I was not asked to Activate Windows 10, and on checking its
 Activation, it was Activated ? Also, the Settings Icon in Start and on my Taskbar was a pale blue, (cyan) colour, and not the purple colour as is seen in Windows 8.1, and was also so in Windows 10 on my PC !</p>

            Non of the WP8 phones have FM as of now, but hopefully the <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/How-to/wp8/basics/windows-phone-8-update-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
next update</a> will bring FM functionality to these devices. But, I am afraid 620 hasn't the hardware to support this.

</p><p>I'm a little late to this conversation, however, this may help others.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My document was over 150 pages and had section breaks throughout. Pagination started over a few times where it shouldn't have, and the "Continue from previous section" option did not work. I turned the Show/Hide tool on and found that the problems was caused
 by having consecutive section breaks like this:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>----------------------------Section Break Continuous)-------------<br />
</p>
<p>----------------------------Section Break (Next Page)--------------<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I deleted the extra Section Break and then used the "Continue from previous section" option and it finally numbered the pages straight through the document.

            <p>The "Continue from previous section" option is section-specific, meaning that you have to change it for every section. As you have noticed, this is a bit more tricky if there are excessive section breaks present. However, you can always (temporarily) expand
 a section by adding some paragraphs and then access the Page Number Format dialog box.</p>

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Outlook for MAC believe its most up to date version 15.11.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running 4 exchange emails from Outlook not had any trouble until recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Starting having issues sending larger files, it would just crash out take forever to send. I am now on faster net connection this issue now seems to be resolved.</p>
<p>2. I am now on all my 4 email accounts getting a 18493 could not synchronize record error and bottom right showing inbox uploading 0/1 which I have no idea what this is?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to deal with company who do exchange, but they said was issue with Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does not affect me sending or receiving, but this error comes up every few minutes.</p>

            <p>Hi Arshad</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reply, I actually managed to fix it this morning. I had tried what you mentioned but that didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What did work though is below, in inbox properties, I clicked on Empty Cache, now the issue is gone and no more trouble.</p>

                    I am unable to open www.outlook.com and microsoft.com at times but when I try to log in to my outlook.com account it says "outlook app is currently unreachable" - I have multiple outlook.com accounts and I can log into one of them but not the main account.

<h2>            Word Online-Issue with hyphens displaying</h2>
                    <p>Hey there,<br />
</p>
We are trying to leverage Word online for concurrent editing and have encountered an issue with how non breaking hyphens are viewed on computers. The hyphens show up in the reading view, however, they do not show up in the editing view. Many reviewers can't
 see the hyphens correctly and then make unnecessary"non-corrections" based on what they're viewing.
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            In a quick test, I see that Word Online does not support nonbreaking hyphens. Editing a document in Word Online seems to remove any nonbreaking hyphens that were previously created in the desktop version of Word. I recommend that you post feedback on this

<h2>            Blurry images in word document</h2>
                    Hi.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I use MS Office 2010. I used to paste some PNG format images in an empty word document and take their print outs until now. The images were also very clear.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But recently I fiddled with the print options and now if I paste the same images in an empty word document, they are appearing blurry, even before printing them.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I need to fix this. Please help me out on this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If all else fails, I am even willing to uninstall the whole application and re-install it again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

            Hey Doug!
<div><br />
<div>Thanks a bunch for your timely reply. I can't believe I am this stupid, but the problem is resolved. It was only that I zoomed in by 20% and after that the file always opened in 120% view. That is why the image was looking blurry. When I change back to
 100%, it is back to normal.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was scared there for a while but this is so funny. There was a lot at stake over this.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Again, appreciate your timely help.</div>

<p>Excellent questions Michael and it shows you have a deeper understanding than not only most consumer users of Windows, but even most of those also&nbsp;typically consumer volunteers or even the now mostly contract workers with the Microsoft tag&nbsp;under their avatar&nbsp;within
 these forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's not surprising, since unlike in the past where helpers here were often working in the computing profession in business, today most are less highly trained consumer users themselves, though still dedicated to helping others understand what most consumers
 need to know to&nbsp;have basic protection and safety using a home PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The primary difference in my case isn't current status, since my own use&nbsp;now is&nbsp;as a consumer, but rather my past history working as a computer tech, network manager/administrator and eventually a security professional in education, business and as a consultant
 for businesses of all types including national, international and government customers.&nbsp; The key difference though is that I was one of only two people that have been involved in helping with the Microsoft security products in these and previous versions of
 these&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;forums&nbsp;since the early beta versions back in 2005-6.&nbsp; We also physically met with the developers of the first Windows [Live]&nbsp;OneCare Antivirus commercial suite product during MVP Summits, as well as regularly via teleconference or other methods
 with the&nbsp;Technical Product Management&nbsp;lead for OneCare, it's immediate descendent Microsoft Security Essentials, as well as most of the parallel business products from that time period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the excessive history, but it may aid in understanding why though all of the information I'm&nbsp;about to tell you is documented, few are actually aware or even know what they're looking at when they view it.&nbsp; Sorry, but this will get long, since it
 would take more time to be brief than I wish to spend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting with your key queries, the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/windows-atp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Defender Advanced&nbsp;Threat Protection (ATP)</a>, as you mentioned is really designed for business and requires not only a server, but also certain network management products in order to facilitate its operation.&nbsp; The reason for this is ATP isn't so much
 a product itself as a toolkit intended for use by security professionals within enterprise business to use in order to examine logs, alert notifications and other time synced data relating to potential security events.&nbsp; This process also requires security
 analysis professionals, both within the business as well as Microsoft in some cases, which is why Windows Defender&nbsp;ATP is limited to use in&nbsp;this fashion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should be noted though, that in most cases the types of targeted attacks that ATP is intended to detect and analyze are commonly made against large business or government customers, while consumers are more often&nbsp;treated as mass market, low value targets
 using the&nbsp;common tools (e.g. malware, spam blasted phishing email, SEO, website hijacks, etc.) that you'd expect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/intelligence/criteria" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Potentially Unwanted Application</a> (PUA is Microsoft's term, many 3rd-parties use PUP or Program instead) protection is actually built into every Windows Defender client, it's simply not enabled by default on any of them and is most easily managed using the
 management consoles used by mostly larger business.&nbsp; However, it is possible to enable this using other tools, including a simple set of PowerShell commands documented&nbsp;at the following page.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/detect-block-potentially-unwanted-apps-windows-defender-antivirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Block potentially unwanted applications with Windows
 Defender Antivirus&nbsp;| Microsoft Docs</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with the Microsoft PUA protection is that it's tuned for business, so it contains no true granularity and thus the only choice is to block or not, which for a business might make sense.&nbsp; However, for consumers, where the lines between what's
 desired or not is often less clear, the complete blocking and removal of something like an adware program that gives you something "free" in return for watching ads may not be a desired result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's why you'll often see many here recommend the Malwarebytes Anti-Malware product, since it was designed first for the consumer, with both simple,&nbsp;granular control, and a greater range of optional methods for dealing with these&nbsp;less malicious, questionable
 applications I like to call annoyance-ware.&nbsp; This is also something that most careful users, consumer or not, will never need if they aren't downloading and installing questionable files or programs, since that's how PUPs are typically encountered.&nbsp; I know,
 I've never had one I wasn't purposefully aware of in over 20 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ransomware protection via Controlled Folder Access is another special case, which is more similar to the User Access Control configuration first provided with Windows Vista.&nbsp; The issue that resolved was one of (mostly 3rd-party) apps requiring administrator
 access to operate, when in most cases this should have been unnecessary, so a popup "nag box" was added to require authentication with an Admin account in order to run these requests, eventually causing most apps to resolve these design issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With CFA, the issue is requiring legacy access to specific Windows system and other app&nbsp;folders via archaic, direct file system access techniques that Microsoft has been attempting to wean developers off of for years, so similar to UAC, the CFA configuration
 allows manual (e.g. annoying) configuration of a workaround to allow those badly behaving apps still requiring this access to operate despite these design flaws.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Along with reporting these flaws via telemetry back to Microsoft so they can contact offending developers, the annoyance of this requirement itself is enough to get some to solve the problems due to the customer support issues this creates.&nbsp; Moral of the
 story here is that if you must use CFA to get an app to work, either update to a newer version that fixes the problem, contact the vendor of the app to have them fix it, or do what I do and dump the app for something more modern that's being kept up to current
 security standards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally to address your general question about how enterprise focused security initiatives like ATP affect the consumer user's PC.&nbsp; This isn't clear because most see this as a product, which though portions of the client piece are included in certain business
 versions of Windows, you've already seen above are really just part of the tools required to make the server aggregation and logging work in order to allow central access and analysis, whether automated or by a security professional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point is that ATP isn't really the issue, since it's clearly not useful without all of the above.&nbsp; However, if you think about what it allows, the results of the analysis of new, unknown attacks will often identify new malware, servers and even techniques
 being used in truly sophisticated attacks against high profile targets.&nbsp; The final result of this will likely include new malware detection and removal definitions, detection engine code and malicious web page or server identity additions to the SmartScreen
 Filter system now integrated into Windows 10 as well as the Microsoft provided browsers where it's existed for years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So even if a consumer can't themselves use the enterprise focused security extensions, they benefit indirectly via general intelligence and directly when new specific malware or malicious systems are identified and added to Defender or other security products,
 including those Microsoft supports through industry partnerships and 3rd-party agreements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll also quickly mention that Microsoft has integrated portions of what they term ATP into their Outlook Email, Office 365 and certain other online products like Azure, though from what I've seen identified, I really just think of these as parallel portions&nbsp;to
 SmartScreen, though they include more sophisticated items like the wrappers around URLs in email messages which detect malicious script on-the-fly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, this is only a partial picture, since I finally got tired and decided this is where I should stop.&nbsp; I do think it covers most of your questions though, even though as I guessed it got quite long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will say that it's nice to see that the testing groups are finally catching up with the Microsoft security apps to some extent and can identify what those of us with inside knowledge always knew, that Microsoft is playing a different game of trying to
 protect their customers, while 3rd-party products are trying to sell themselves, so they tune for the tests.&nbsp; Maybe some day the tests will be better than the products, but in truth that's unlikely, since technical&nbsp;testing always requires better technology
 than the products being tested, which with something as sophisticated as cloud-based, dynamic anti-malware protection performing heuristic, behavioral and emulation based analysis on the fly both on the client and in the cloud, there's really nothing available
 that's sophisticated enough to test it thoroughly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I gave up on the tests years ago&nbsp;other than as a basic sanity check for something in the top 10 or 15, which is about the best granularity you can expect.&nbsp; Everything else they determine is really just random noise, since the malware world changes too fast
 to test in a coherent fashion.</p>

    <title>Blank Entries in Address Book - possibly from contacts synced from my - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Blank Entries in Address Book - possibly from contacts synced from my phone</h2>
                    <p>Folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Outlook 2007 on a Windows 8.1 Samsung laptop.&nbsp; I have an issue with the address book which I think is related to syncing from my HTC One using HTC Sync Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, when I click on the "To:" button on a new email it brings up the Address Book which has a lot of blank entries at the top of the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I think that this is dues to contacts synced from my phone is as follows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I added a contact into my phone which I later synced using HTC Sync Manager.&nbsp; The contact appears in my contacts folder but the display name is just the email address which I updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then wanted to send an email to the contact so started a new email and clicked on the "To:" button.&nbsp; Lots of blank entries so I search (with "Name only" selected) and don't find it.&nbsp; I then click on "more columns" and it find the entry but the Name and
 Display Name column are blank but the email address column is correct.&nbsp; If I double click on the entry and click ok then nothing is populated in the To field of the email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I scroll down the list there are a number of entries that have just the E-mail Address column filled and this contact appears here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if I go into the contacts tab, search for the name, open the contact and click the Email button in the Communicate group then it starts a new email with the correct email address and display name in the To field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if I delete the contact and add it from within Outlook then it appears in the Address book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is fine for the contacts that have an entry in the E-mail Address column but what about those that are blank?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have any blank contacts showing and i have tried using scanpst.exe to repair but no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks to me like the Address Book view is corrupt or there are blank entries in the contacts that I can't see except in the Address Book view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to get rid of the blank entries?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Malcolm.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I've got a few things to update the post with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In reply to your question - in the folder view there is no contact folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in relation to my issue I have the following additional information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp; The blank entries seem to be related to entries in my contacts that only have a first name and no email address</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; If I have added a contact in my phone that has an email address and sync with Outlook then the entry doesn't show up</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; If I open the contact an save it then it appears in the list but only with the E-mail address column filled</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; If I then alter the File As entry in Outlook then it appears in the list with the Name and Display Name field filled in as well</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>

<h2>            Excel 2016 Fill Justify Command does not work&#33;</h2>
                    So im trying to use the fill justify command. I tried it from the editing ribbon on the home tab, and added the "fill justify" button on my quick access toolbar and nothing seems to work. When I highlight the text string and cells below to fill and click
 the button the screen flashes but nothing happens? Is there some flag switched off or on somewhere that is preventing it from doing what it is supposed to?

<p>
</p><p>Maybe this will help. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to make some assumptions that -</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; You have Outlook installed on your computer.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; You have the login name and password you use to access Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several ways to access the Outlook.com servers depending on whether you want to use the Excahnge ActivceSync, POP, IMAP, or SMTP.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have only used the Exchange ActiveSync so I can't give you much advice on the other options other than to suggest
 that you Google the phrase "mail servers for outlook.com" to get more information on the other options.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the outlook.com Exchange Activesync to exchange emails between my desktop Outlook and Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The server name I used to access Outlook.com is eas.outlook.com.&nbsp; I came across a site that mentioned using m.hotmail.com for the server name but I have not tried it.

</p><p>I tried this solution, it did get rid of the error BUT now when I click on "Sync" the browser doesn;t respond at all. same as true with FireFox, no Chrome was installed in this PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing to note though, this problem only happens to my colleague when he's logged in but under my profile everything is working just fine.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Vetabz,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Please choose other browsers such as IE, Edge to check if you can set up OneDrive normally by click sync button. Please also check this
</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Enable-users-to-sync-SharePoint-files-with-the-new-OneDrive-sync-client-22e1f635-fb89-49e0-a176-edab26f69614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">article</span></span></a><span>
 to make sure your colleague have the right settings about OneDrive.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If this issue still exists after choosing other browsers, to check whether this issue is related to browser settings or add-ins, please reset your browsers(</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17441/windows-internet-explorer-change-reset-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">IE</span></a>,

<p><span><span>If your colleague still can’t start OneDrive via browser, to check whether this issue is related to OneDrive sync client settings, I suggest you reset OneDrive sync client to check
 if this issue persists. You can follow the steps below to do that:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Press the Windows key + R.</span></li><li>
<span>In the Run window, enter: %localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset&gt;Click OK.</span></li><li>
<span>Open the Run window again and enter: %localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe&gt;Click OK.</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Regarding “this problem only happens to my colleague when he's logged in but under my profile everything is working just fine.”, Please let me know which Windows account and which
 computer(yours or his) your colleague is using when this issue happens.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Besides, please also share with me the related info if this issue still exists:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>The version number of related computer’s OS(Win+R&gt;type CMD&gt;OK) and OneDrive.(Right click OneDrive icon&gt;Settings&gt;About)</span></li><li>
<span>What have you changed before this issue happen?(E.g. Install application, update OS/Office)</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Neo</span></span></p>
