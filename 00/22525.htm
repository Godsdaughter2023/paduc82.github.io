<h2>            Outlook 2013 IMAP - Deleting attachments from Sent messages</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the above mentioned problem. I configured my IMAP mailbox following my ISP instructions and everything works fine with the following exception. Once I send messages they are automatically moved in the Sent items folder. In order to save the limited
 IMAP mailbox capacity I would need to delete heavy attachments from Sent items, but once I remove them and save the modified message, they are still present with the original message dimensions.</p>
<p>I always did this operation with my old Outlook 2003 without any problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone can help? Thanks!</p>

<p>Dear Girish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>once sent the message with attachments, it goes directly in Sent items folder. I go there, I open the sent message, I right-click on the attachment and click on "remove attachment". I confirm and the screen go back to Sent items folder but the attachment
 clip and the message dimensions remain the same. The most strange thing is that if I open again the message the attachment is disappeared, while the clip is present and the dimensions are unchanged! I made a double check on another machine running Outlook
 2003 and the attachment is actually present. If I delete it from the Outlook 2003 machine it is definitely deleted and the same change is reflected also on the machine running Outlook 2013 after few moments. This time the clip is disappeared and the message
 dimensions are decreased.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think there's something we can do, also considering that my ISP is the biggest in Italy and with high probability many other person have the same problem with IMAP mailboxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help. Ciao,</p>

<p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens when you perform a Send/Receive after the attachment is removed in Outlook 2013?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also create a new profile in Outlook, setup the email account and check the behavior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer to the following article on how to create and configure an email profile in Outlook.</p>

<p>I think the problem is resolved.&nbsp; I ran through your checklist and everything was OK with the EXCEL file.&nbsp; Then I noticed that when I opened the ACCESS file that contained tables I wanted to import EXCEL files into.... I saw a message in the upper left corner
 about macros that were disabled.&nbsp; I enabled the macros and was then able to successfully use the Import Wizard.&nbsp; Hope this resolves the problem with other files.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.</p>

 unrequested "upgrade". Anyone know of a hard kill for intrusive, activity-monitoring stuff like this?

            Thanks, but no. It's personal, but I suspect it applies to a lot of people. For example, if you're bereaved or divorced&nbsp;you won't want to delete them from contacts, but you don't want to be reminded of them, and the circumstances,&nbsp;with every email you
 send.

            <p>Hi Spadge O'Rama,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We apologize for the delayed response as we are currently having high volume of support requests. We understand that you don't want to see the "Frequent contacts" when typing in the email address but as what you have mentioned on your original post, this
 "Frequest contacts" that you see is already integrated in Outlook.com and cannot be removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you need further assistance, please feel free to post back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2010 Delayed delivery of appointments not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevin lutz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 Delayed delivery of appointments not working</h2>
                    <p>It appears that there is a bug in Outlook 2010 related to delayed delivery of an appointment email.&nbsp;We are using Lync 2010 as well.&nbsp;You can test this by doing the following.&nbsp; Create an appointment in Outlook by clicking "New Online Meeting", add a few attendees,
 select the File tab, click the Properties button within the Info section, within "Delivery Options" select "Do not delivery before" and set a future date/time for delivery.&nbsp; When you send the appointment it goes out immediately and is not delayed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FYI, I noticed that I can't do delayed delivery of a non-Lync online appointment.&nbsp; Maybe this is an issue when the Lync plug-in is working with Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone confirm if this is a bug or a configuration issue on our end?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            I'm having the same problem on the latest version of O365 (my mailbox has been migrated to the latest outlook.com) using Outlook 2010 as the client. I set the delayed delivery options for a normal meeting request in the message properties dialog, but the
 message was still sent right away. Please open a bug for this, it should be very easy to repro. Is there a way to track the status of the bug on connect.microsoft.com? Why is it so difficult to open an Office bug? Why doesn't Office use connect.microsoft.com??&nbsp;

    <title>Battery Drain issue due to apps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nayanm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Battery Drain issue due to apps</h2>
                    <p>I have came acrossed few&nbsp;apps, which works on windows phone 8, but they tend to drain out the battery. I have faced this issue with apps like whats app and a few games. If I am on whats app for more than 5 minutes it will drain the battery as well as heat
 up my lumia 920 near the camera lens,&nbsp;but works well with Lumia 800 (windows 7.8). I believe they are poorly coded for windows phone 8.</p>

<p>I don't recollect entire list now but we have a few of them and the best is to simply uninstall from my phone. Which bring to question, what is the benefit of having 1,20,000 apps on windows store and only few of them actually works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why aren't the app tested on all the platforms, before they are published to windows users.</p>

The most unhelpful comment in the world is "it works for me."<br />
<br />
My phone has a lot of battery issues, as do many WP8 users.&nbsp; Even MS acknowledge issues as you posted to.<br />
<br />
It is not clear what the cause it to me other than it is not specific to an app... it is more like an OS bug.&nbsp; Why do I say this?&nbsp; Because I have examples of my phone overnight using 10% drain an hour and then suddenly stopping on it's own accord at 5am in
 the morning and then using 0% drain an hour.<br />
<br />
I even have documented a reproducible test case where a phone from hard reset can be shown to demonstrate battery drain until an app is uninstalled - despite the app never being run on the phone.... oddities like this exist in WP8.<br />
<br />
We are all looking forward to an OS update that fixes the battery drain issues - games/apps should not run as background tasks and use lots of battery!&nbsp; The OS should prevent that.<br />

you are mistaken something here.... the comment I made is not unhelpful as it only shows that there is no general issue with one particular app ;-).</p>

<p>The battery drainage over night, I have noticed too. So I checked what my phone does over night and voila it backs up the content. Which explains why I am loosing approx. 10-15% battery each night without doing anything.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The battery usage is an issue...but to be fair, I had an HTC Android prior to my first WP and the battery lifetime wasn't that great there either. I don't know how it is in your case but my battery last 1-2 days and I use it a lot! And more than a day, I
 don't really expect it too last. In the end we are talking about a small device with the power of an average laptop.... that energy has to come from somewhere!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>regarding your last comment... funny you are saying that... cos I remember when WP7 was launched everybody was shouting for exactly that feature that games are running in the background. Now MS implemented that and people are complaining about... I don't
 get it! ;-)</p>

When the battery drainage is 10% PER HOUR, it is not particularily good. :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And before you say it's a fault with the phone... I can make the same phone use 0-1% / hour overnight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And some times it uses 3%/h, other times 29%/h.&nbsp; Yes, that's the peak power usage I've seen on the phone - with it getting physically warm on the back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background tasks are wonderful..&nbsp;and when you've disabled/uninstalled every single one in the settings and it makes NO difference, you know the issue isn't a "background app".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And as a dev, yes I understand background apps can&nbsp;use power, (doh!) but this is not that.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe that some apps remain running in the background after you close them.&nbsp; Apps that are not supposed to be run in the background - like IE and games, and, well anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course I could be completely wrong and perhaps there is some totally other random thing going on - where the baseband chip or GPU component are not getting powered down when apps are put in standby or something... but whatever it is is not consistent.&nbsp;
 And not specific to background apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree - WhatsApp is not specifically the issue.</p>

            <p>OK, Here I did&nbsp;a benchmark last night. I had a fully charged phone by 2:30pm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It went from 100% to 70% from 2:30 pm to 10:30 pm (with&nbsp;minimal usage, browse internet and listen couple of songs on loudspeaker) and was very happy the way phone went. Of course I ensured i didn't touch whatsapp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>at 10:30 pm I started buzzing around with Friends and Family on Whatsapp and as stated faced the same issue, with my phone getting warmer near lens area and within 40 minutes battery came down from 70% to 20%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, battery lasted till morning 6 am again, when i didnt touch the whats app and let it run in the background. I was on 4G connectivity all the time. Today I will test whatsapp on wifi and see if any difference on phone battery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, game which drain out the battery on my Nokia Lumia 920 was Final Approach .. Again playing game for 5-9 minutes will heat up the things&nbsp;but same worked perfectly on Lumia 800</p>

            <p>you see... the thing is...my phone does not heat up at all (at least not noticeably). No matter what I am doing.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That some games use a lot of battery whilst playing..yea..noticed that too on my LG as well as my 8X. But thats something I personally can live with (I know that doesnt help you at all... still wanted to say it :-)).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the apps running in the background even though they are closed... well...yes that is true and not knew. With my LG I had to take out the battery from time to time to stop thoughs apps as my battery went down from 100% to 20% in 5hours without me
 doing anything. Once I removed the battery, battery lasted more than a day again.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly, I cannot remove the battery from my 8X :-(.</p>

            My Lumia is 2 months old, bought and used in India. The battery life is a major cause of worry for me daily. I am no gamer nor music listener in my phone. calls, texts, emails,Whatsapp  maps are the only apps I use on my device. But still the battery is unreliable. The paranoia of sudden discharge from 90/80 to 50% scares the **** out of when on the move. I am now resorting to battery saver the whole time which dilutes the whole point of buying a smartphone and from windows/nokia. It is very disheartening that nokia who were once popular for long battery life is now here.  


I strongly emphasis to keep windows phone users happy, something ought to be done at the quickest possible time to be redundant and not mitigate the problem otherwise. 



Good luck fellow WPs.

            Well my lumia 620 is two weeks old...and i wanted to know if there were any apps in specific which would drain my battery...whats app obviously does...but its a necessary app...what about Book My Show app,The Football App,Zomato app..?...Is there any app
 which could recognise the battery-drainers on my phone and let me know about it or how much battery charge each app consumes?...Battery Consumption is my only matter of concern.

            I assumed you had a Lumia 920 but now I know you do not, that explains why you are not experiencing the same hardships. There are certainly serious problems with the phone that make it unreliable in terms of battery life, overheating and phone reception.
 So very disappointing.

            I have Windows 8&nbsp;phone. I don't use it near as much as any normal user do and reason is that it is my work phone. I might have a call ones a&nbsp;day and once in the while check the emails on it. I didn't download any extra apps, nor I using them, I have my
 private&nbsp;iphone for those needs. Now, the battery life was fine before, but I did noticed in last 2 weeks it would drain batteries down to turning the phone off in a day - day and a half with no use of the phone. It wouldn't bug me that much since I don't really
 use the phone that heavily, but it start turning the phone off and I didn;t realize that and have importants calls that can't get through. Not sure what the heck is going on but I'm start thinking to return/exchange the work phone. It's nice and&nbsp;beautiful
 phone, but the issues with batery life is quite the issue in my opinion especcially when it drains without actual usuage of the phone.

<p>We've seen a few threads where others reported similar failures for either the update or operation of Windows security products on the Windows XP platform, even though that operating system had officially ended support back in April 2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since the last of the Windows Embedded point of sale versions based on the same core components as Windows XP just finally ended the extended support phase on April 9th, this might explain why the more recent change has occurred.</p>

<h2>            cannot send e-mail from outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have just installed Outlook 2010, and what worked fine in 2007 is now an issue. I waas surprised that 2010 can't use a standalone IMAP data file, I had to create My Outlook Data file. The real problem comes now, I setup correctly a GMAIL IMAP account
 and test is, works perfectly, but whenever I send an e-mail it goes under the My Outlook data file insted of running through the IMAP route. Then it stays in the outbox, and when I push send/receive I get an error message. Please let me know how to get this
 issue resolved. (Sending' reported error (0x800CCC13) : 'Cannot connect to the network. Verify your network connection or modem.')</p>
<p>Thanks, Béla</p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide more information before we proceed.</p>
<p>Did you configure any other email account along with Gmail email account in Outlook?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to create new profile and re-configure email-account to check if you are able to send the emails as expected.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do so,</span> refer to the following article for instruction&nbsp;on&nbsp;how to create a new profile.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If issue persist, you may start the computer in clean boot mode and then try to open Outlook and check if it works as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting the computer in clean boot mode would disable all the non-Microsoft applications and the antivirus, which could be one of the reason for the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer the article below to start the computer in clean boot.</p>

                    Hello, I have a Lumia 640 with Windows 10.&nbsp; Since I updated to Windows 10, I have many issues with trying to share photos.&nbsp; I have tried to resize and cropping the images to minimize the file size.&nbsp; I have tried to share them via all the options: outlook,
 onedrive, SMS,&nbsp;tap to share to my SP3, and nothing works.&nbsp; I need to get those pics off my phone somehow.&nbsp; What used to be a 5 second process with Windows 8 is costed me over 4 hours now.... not to mention the day to day crashing of Windows 10 on my phone.&nbsp;

</p><p>It's tough to provide an answer when the problem seems so far outside of the "normal" experience.&nbsp; Something is definitely not right though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you storing the pictures on the main memory, or on a memory card?&nbsp; If they are stored on the SD card, what happens when you move the pictures over to the main memory of the phone?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Autorecovery</h2>
                    Hey, I've got word 2016 on my Mac,&nbsp;and I had a document which I didn't save (dumb). While doing other things my mac went out of battery and turning it on again made the document go away. I searched around and found the auto-recovery file and in it was
 the document but with like only 20 words or so. I checked if I had autosave on and it should save every 10 min, what happened? I desperately needed this file, and now I'm kind of in a bind.

            <p>Hi VetleEllbro,</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>AutoRecover can help Word recover a file that you were editing after a power failure or other problem that interrupts Word while you are editing the file. If Save AutoRecover
 Info option is enabled, the autorecovery file will be saved on the: <strong>~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Library/Preferences/AutoRecovery/</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The save every box determines the interval you want in saving AutoRecover information. You stated that you have configured 10 minutes’ interval, the file recovered on
 the path above, is the last file saved by your AutoRecover option.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Another option is to enable to Always create backup copy, as this will create a backup copy of the previous version of your file. You may want to check the MVP’s explanation
 regarding this option on this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/autosavebackups-in-office-for-mac-2016-preview/aa1f55a4-6df6-49de-a2e8-de033de2f688">

                    I got a virus on my computer recently and it changed the homepage for IE11 on Windows 10.&nbsp; After removing the virus, and confirming several times, IE11 still goes a random website, some blocked by Norton, upon first launch.&nbsp; If I then press the "Home"
 button, I am directed to the correct homepage afterwards and even when opening a new tab.&nbsp; The webpage is always correct when I check it in 'Internet Options'.&nbsp; I am assuming there is a file somewhere that has been corrupted and need to fix it.&nbsp; Please help.

            <p>Hi Ned,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are the steps that you have done to resolve this issue? </p>
<p>
</p><p>To reset your Internet Explorer, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Select <strong>Tools</strong> (via the Gear Icon) &gt; <strong>Safety</strong> &gt;
<strong>Delete browsing history</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Make sure to uncheck <strong>Preserve Favorites</strong> website data and check both Temporary Internet Files and Cookies then click
<strong>Delete</strong>.</p>
<p>3. You will get a confirmation at the bottom of the window once it has successfully cleared your cache and cookies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also Add-ons can cause browsers to run slowly and crash, or they might pose a security or compatibility risk. You can turn off specific Add-ons to help increase your browsing speed, or if you suspect they're causing problems for Internet Explorer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To turn off Add-ons<br />
<br />
1. Open <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>, select the <strong>Tools</strong> button , and then select
<strong>Manage add-ons</strong>.<br />
2. Under Show, select All Add-ons and then select the Add-on you want to turn off.<br />
3. Select <strong>Disable</strong>, and then <strong>Close</strong>.</p>
<p>Tell us how it goes.<br />

            <p>Hi Karina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I did was to run Norton to multiple times to delete the infections.&nbsp; I then deleted the browsing history of all my browsers and all the cookies I had.&nbsp; I also ran the "Use Default" for the homepage, under the Advanced tab I ran "Restore Advanced
 Settings" and "Reset" IE settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same problem still occurs of IE11 opening to some random website upon first launch only.&nbsp; I can then navigate to any website I want without and issue and pressing my "Home" button will navigate to my homepage.&nbsp; Is there a script somewhere that controls
 navigation during first launch?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I really would like to do at this point is to delete IE11 and reinstall a fresh copy.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
</p><p>There is a possible reason that malware can cause trouble in your Internet Explorer . Since you mentioned that you already run the Norton multiple times, you can try to repair or reinstall Internet Explorer. Follow the instructions in this

    <title>Create playlist on PC and transfer to Nokia 301 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> papagoejoe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Create playlist on PC and transfer to Nokia 301</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone figure out how to add playlists from the PC to the Nokia 301 music player,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can transfer my music collection with Windows Media Player, but playlists createt in WMP will not show up in the Playlists menu on the phone.<br />
<br />
To listen to a playlist with specific tracks on my phone, I have to create it on the phone and individually add tracks to it, but considdering that the 301 supports microSDHC cards up to 32GB, that seems like a poor and timeconsuming solution?<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions?<br />
<br />
I've tried both Nokia Suite 3.5.34 and Nokia PC Suite 7.1 with Nokia Music, but none of these applications seems to be able to perform the task, and neither does manually copying .wlp, .pla or .m3u files to the phone. The files will not be reconnized by the
 file browser either.<br />
<br />
Of course I have updatet the media library and even restarted the phone, but still only playlists created on the phone are playable.</p>

<p>Well I haven't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a workaround I assign each item on the playlists to the same genre and browse by genre instead of playlist, when I listen to music on the phone.<br />
<br />
You have to be real careful though to do that <em>before</em> you sync the tracks to your device, because updating the ID3-tags on the phone from WMP does not seem to work once the file has bee transfered, so you have to delete the file from your device and
 resync it, if you make a mistake.<br />
<br />
The clear disadvantage of this solution is, that you have to give up the genre information stored in the tracks if you make a playlist that is based on something other than genre.<br />
<br />
Maybe an update for the musicplayer to support .pla playlists would be worth considdering.</p>

<p>Well basically he is suggesting the same thing I was, except he suggest editing Album Name instead of genre,<br />
<br />
But that means giving up the original album information and this way it is also impossible to add the same track to multiple lists.<br />
<br />
I really think the music player should be updated to support at least .m3u and .pla playlists, since there is no support software from Nokia for this model.</p>

<p>What trick?<br />
<br />
As I wrote in my original post, I have tried PC Suite (with Nokia Music), and that doesn't work either..<br />
<br />
I might add, that both .pla and .m3u playlists are available and visible on the phone through both Nokia Suite and PC suite. They are just not playable or visible on the phone.</p>

<p>I've tried placin them pretty much everywhere, the files get tranfered and are visible in the file browser, they are just not playable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best trick so far is to use Genre or Album Name i the ID3 tags as hacked playlists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another one I've read is to use the app KD Player, which suppots auto playlists. I've read it should be compatible with Nokia 301, but I haven't been able to get it to play on my phone..</p>

<p>I have the playlists showing up in the music player but then I get the error "No media files found" when trying to play them. I can't find playlists I've created on the phone anywhere in the filesystem either. All in a all a great shame!</p>

<p>If anyone is still reading this and if there have been developments, pleeeeease post or if anyone knows where in the filesystem the playlists are stored that would be nice.</p>

    <title>Trouble accessing hotmail email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> germanshepherd_cdx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble accessing hotmail email</h2>
                    <p>Good evening:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two active&nbsp;Microsoft email accounts; one is Hotmail and the other Outlook.&nbsp; It is not feasible for me to</p>
<p>not use or to delete either of the email accounts.&nbsp; My problem is since my windows 10 upgrade, when&nbsp;using the windows 10 mail app&nbsp;that&nbsp;installed with my&nbsp;upgrade,&nbsp;I can not access more than three&nbsp;weeks of my emails in my Hotmail email.&nbsp; In addition, there
 are multiple emails missing from my Outlook email&nbsp;when using the windows 10 mail app that installed with the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I access Hotmail via the windows live url; it automatically logs me into my outlook account&nbsp;of which&nbsp;I do have access to all of my outlook emails.&nbsp; Is&nbsp;there any way for me to&nbsp;get around not having access to my Hotmail emails via the website?&nbsp;
 I must add that&nbsp;I am not happy with Microsoft's decision to automatically assume that&nbsp;people&nbsp;do not wish to or should not&nbsp;have&nbsp;multiple email accounts&nbsp;be available when these multiple&nbsp;accounts&nbsp;had already been established.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, the only way I can access&nbsp;all of my&nbsp;Hotmail emails is via my windows phone which is running 8.1 and I do not plan on doing a phone upgrade at this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do appreciate any help with this problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>GermanShepherd</p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestions.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>However, I&nbsp;do have the most recent browser since I have already upgraded to Windows 10 as I&nbsp;stated in my original question</strong></span><strong>.

<p>I did&nbsp;&nbsp;access my outlook app that came with the windows 10&nbsp;upgrade; upon doing so and&nbsp;opening the app&nbsp;I reactivated my outlook account, and I followed the prompts to add another account, upon which I then added my Hotmail account.</p>

            That was one of the suggestions on support. It wasn't on but I checked the box to turn it on. It didn't work. I am still getting the same error code message. Thank you for your reply.

<h2>            Windows Defender on MS Windows Server 2008R2</h2>
                    <p>I am running windows defender on 2008R2 Server that host my DFS shares and replicate folder/files across sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While i am doing a scheduled scans using windows defender tool, it takes more than 4-5 days to complete the scan even when the folder size is not more than 500 GB and it is all local data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a little skeptical about the reliability and strength of Windows defender in comparison with third party products like symantec, mcfee. But this is free that is why i wanted to give it a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know should it take that long to scan?</p>
<p>How reliable / smart is windows defender to catch 0 day attack?</p>
<p>Should i even run Windows defender on a windows server 2008 r2?</p>
<p>

            Yes, you will need a separate license , but depending on your licensing agreement with Microsoft, you might have it through your volume licensing agreement. It is better to discuss it with your local Microsoft support team.
