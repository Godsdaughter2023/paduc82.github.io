<h2>            VS 2015 Community inoperability</h2>
                    Since upgaridng to Win 10, I am no longer able to run the simplest Hello World program. I get MSB 8036 which says it cannot find Windows SDK 8.1. I've reinstalled Win SDK 8.1, (as well as 10.0); I've uninstalled resinstalled, repaired, VS 2015 Community.
 ... and it never runs.&nbsp; It used to run before installing Win 10. Any suggestions would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.

            <p>I solved the problem by uninstalling VS2015 Community from my computer ... permanently. I'm now happily programming again using VS2008. I am convinced that the problem was a clash with Win 10.</p>
<p>Thank you.<br />

    <title>You&#39;ll need administrator permission to delete this folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tuckercox  say:</h3>
<h2>            You&#39;ll need administrator permission to delete this folder</h2>
                    <p>I have searched through Microsoft Community postings on this topic of "permissions to delete folders" and "failure to enumerate" keeping me from deleting folders. I&nbsp;have implemented 2 or 3 recommendations to delete folders and sub-folders, some successful,
 some not. I have deleted some folders and sub-folders that earlier attempts to delete prompted the familiar messages about "administrator permission," and "failed to enumerate objects in the container" and so on. My point is that over the past two years, i
 have made many efforts (20? 30? - I stopped counting) to delete files from this <em>
external drive</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>100% of the folders i refer to are on this external drive. No folder on this drive has anything to do with how my PC operates. My PC runs exactly the same, if the drive is powered up or turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Folders i cannot delete look like they might contain programs or program data or OS-related files. For example, I cannot delete
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Common Files</span> (a big sub-folder) in
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Program Files</span> and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Program Files (x86)</span> folders. I cannot delete the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Google</span> sub-folder (another large one) in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Program Files (x86)</span>. When i try to delete sub-folders in the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Windows </span>folder on this drive i get the familiar lingo about permissions and a message that says "unexpected error 0x80070091 kept you from deleting this folder." Curiously, the familiar pop-up window shows files being deleted. The pop-up that i refer
 to is the one with the file count rapidly increasing and a delete speed graph moving from left to right. But, when i click on properties for the big
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows </span>folder, no sub-folders have been deleted and, all of the sub-folders appear on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would this option work: back up to the cloud files on this drive that i want to keep and reformat the drive? Can i reformat or do i still need permissions to change the folders in question? Before i take this step, i thought i would post a request for advice
 and give it one more try. I'm at the end of the line. If I cannot delete or reformat, i taking this drive to a local expert and pay to rid myself of the pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to use this drive to back up my Office 2016 files, pictures, videos and Desktop , no more and no less.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Win 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice appreciated. Thank you in advance. Tuck</p>

            <p>It is most unusual to copy system folders to a backup device and it actually serves no purpose. This is why I was wondering whether these folders were real or just references to real folders. In the latter case deleting them would have killed Windows. Your
 report confirms that they are real and that they were made two years ago by means that are not entirely clear. You can do this to delete them:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Log on under an admin account.<br />
2. Click the Start globe.<br />
3. Type&nbsp; cmd.exe&nbsp; in the Search box.<br />
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter<br />
5. Click "Run as Administrator".<br />
6. Type the following commands and press Enter after each:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; taskkill&nbsp; /f&nbsp; /im&nbsp; explorer.exe</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (this will cause the desktop to go blank)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; explorer.exe</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (this will restore the desktop)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exit</p>
<p>7. Use Windows Explorer in the usual way to delete the unwanted folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If still unable to delete the folders then you need to seize ownership of them, then give yourself full access rights - see here:<br />

<h2>            Slim Eject Button Stopped Working</h2>
                    
<p>My console is 6 months old, and today the eject button just stopped working. Ejecting via the dashboard/controller works fine, but not the touch sensitive button. Suggestions?</p>

<p>My only suggestions are, check that there isn't a piece of tape or something over the eject button, sounds silly I know but my son decided it would be fun to place a piece of black insulation tape over the eject button on my console, took me a good hour
 to spot it while the little lout was laughing in his bedroom.</p>
<p>Other than that you need to arrange a repair i'm afraid.</p>

<p>It seems that you have 3 options here</p>
<p>1.As "ThingOnAString"said make sure that there is nothing on the Eject button. also try wipeing the eject button with a DRY clean towel, with the console unpluged</p>
<p>2.Just keep ejecting from the dashboard (yes its annoying but it works)</p>
<p>3.Get a repair(Your console is only 6 months old. Your warrenty is still active :) you get a free repair that takes a month)</p>
<p>Hope this helps </p>

    <title>Missing header in auto-forwarded Windows Live Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonyaffe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing header in auto-forwarded Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    <p>When I auto-forward email using WLM, the header that normally appears when manually forwarding mail (i.e., that tells the new recipient who sent the original email) is missing. This makes it impossible for the recipient know who sent the original.<br />
<br />
Surely there is a way around this. I want auto-forwarded mail to look exactly like it does when forwarded manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!</p>

            <p>I'm running build&nbsp;16.4.3528.0331</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of my email accounts is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. I am training my replacement as registrar, and have created a Message Rule that forwards all mail received by this address (i.e., where&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** is on the "To" list) to my
 replacement's personal email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This works, but with amajor problem: he receives the mail without the standard "origianlly sent by" information that is put on the header of manually forwarded mail. That is, there is no system generated header that identifies who sent the original emai.
 He receives only the body of the original, as if sent by *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. This means he doesn't know who sent the original email and and is unable to reply to that person.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see any provision for configuring header on/off in the auto-forwarding set-up.</p>

<p>If your account is the default admin account then you are out of luck on this forum. It is prohibited to provide answers on how to crack passwords. If your account is not the default admin account and the admin account is not password protected you can boot
 your computer in safe mode choosing to log on the admin account and delete the password for the account in question. You do not need to know the password for the account in question in order to delete it from the admin account.</p>

<p>So I would assume your account is still under the US region? You can check the region of you account here:
<a href="https://www.commerce.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.commerce.microsoft.com</a>
</p>
<p>If that is the case, you would be getting the US marketplace on your console and if you were to change your region back to Aus, you will lose the currency. The only advice I can give is to spend the money before changing your region as you will still be
 able to access the content you buy.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have a sight impairment, need to use a very large monitor, and have the resolution set at 1360 x 768.&nbsp; The display is set to medium, 125%. &nbsp; I use Skype in my work and am trying to resize it so that I can type a message reply without having to move the

            Following a Norton Technician Speaking to me on the telephone and running thier Support-LogMeInRescue.exe I was promised a call back from Service Supervisor Norton in two hours . This has not occurred . Does anyone suggest a stand alone firewall other
 than windows firewall which will block .dll accessing the internet?

<p>Graye , because the virus definition is here:<br />
<br />
<span>A computer virus is a type of malicious software that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code. When this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be "infected" with a computer

            Depending on the platform the games were made for, there may be an emulator available that will let you run them. Searching for the platform name and "emulator" may yield results. If they are DOS based games, DOSBox is one such emulator.<br />

<h2>            Gears of war 2 &#40;disc version&#41; not installing.</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;I own the disc version of gears 2 for the 360 and when I put it in my xbox one I get an error. It says "this game isn't playable here, for a list of xbox 360 games playable on xbox one go to xbox.com." with an error code. I've already checked the list to
 make sure it's compatible and I've rebooted my console a few times but the disc just never installs. What can I do?</p>

<p>Hello angelgamer85 , to fix this problem hold down the power button on your xbox until it turns off, unplug it from the wall, leave it off for about 1 minute, plug it back in, turn it on. once its on go to your settings, go to your network settings &gt; advanced
 settings &gt; Alternate MAC adress &gt; clear, it should prompt you to restart, once it turns back on by itself try re inserting and reinstalling disc, should work.</p>

<h2>            Hellkite Drake &#40;red dragon&#41; glitch&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I dont know if this is common knowledge or not, but I thought&nbsp; I would share anyways. If you want a quick 10,000 souls and to be rid of the Hellkite drake heres the easiest way to do so. If you go up the tower in the Undead Parish the one that has the Black
 Knight atop it, after you dispose of him you should be able to look off the edge and to the left of the tower and see the dragon. If he is there 1 arrow is all it takes to kill him. I dont know if this is a glitch or not, but I do know that he didnt always
 appear, I had to respawn everyone a few times, and once&nbsp; I heard him growling at the closed gate and saw his shadow&nbsp; I knew he was there.&nbsp; Climbed the tower shot him with the bow once and easy 10,000 souls and a shortcut. Hope this helps anyone who is having
 trouble with this beast....</p>

<p>The dragon comes back but I cant see him from the tower so it might be a bug. Then if you go to the bonfire he flies away but comes back when you try to cross from underneath. Help cause I want to kill him.</p>

<p>it dawned on me that things work different when your not hollow...so use humanity at a bonfire and then go to the top of the tower. it worked for me. i may have gotten lucky but then again it could be the trick.. give it a shot.</p>

<p>i wasnt human when i did it, i just kept resting at the bonfire closest to the blacksmith, and killing everything on my way to the tower and eventually he showed up to where i could see him from the tower, it took me like 3-4 trips to get it to happen.</p>

<p>Guys 2 quick questions, i finally managed to kill the knight on the tower but i don't see or hear the dragon. i can see his shadow when im under the bridge and hear him but when i go to the top of the tower nothing, i vaguely remember that i may have downloaded
 a patch for this game could that be preventing me from seeing the dragon from the tower ?</p>
<p>Second is the repair kit worth buying from the merchant ? my drake sword has degraded not a lot but i want to know if it is useful to buy the kit ?</p>

<p>I didn't see the dragon for the longest time either. &nbsp;And then out of the blue last night I climbed up the tower and heard him roaring. &nbsp;Sure enough, there he was. &nbsp;Not sure what triggered his return though?</p>

    <title>Hitman&#58; Genius Or Scam&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> azrael008uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hitman&#58; Genius Or Scam&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So at first glance it's unclear what to make of the new "Hitman".</p>
<p>The game releases with a single level and there are more available later.</p>
<p>Are they hiding the rest behind a paywall?</p>
<p>Are they releasing an unfinished game?</p>
<p>Well as the months go by you get more of the game released.</p>
<p>It's not behind a paywall either. &nbsp;It's just released a month later, and then another and another.</p>
<p><span>"When the game launches in March 2016, you’ll enter a world of assassination and visit fashionable Paris, the sunny coast of Italy and the hustle of the markets in Marrakesh. In the following months, you’ll have access to one new sandbox location per
 month; Thailand in April, USA in May and Japan in June".</span></p>
<p>So while some people have been up in arms about the way this game is being released and decrying it as an abomnination and something they will never support... are they right or are they about to miss out on a good thing?</p>
<p>The game claims to be wanting to delivery very large locations and that it wants to assign multiple missions in these areas.</p>
<p>Apparently you'll get a call and a target to eliminate and there will be many targets to eliminate in the area.</p>
<p>So they're not scamming us on the content if they're giving it for free. &nbsp;They're not short changing us if the levels are going to be so huge that it's a virtual assassin's playground.</p>
<p>Here might be where the genius is since... Square Enix might be pulling a bit of a "Bungie" here and devised a way to keep hold of a MacDonald Generation's attention span for longer than a "Long Weekend Rental".</p>
<p>By releasing these cities in stages they keep injecting something new into the game even as time passes. &nbsp;Much like "Destiny" injecting new life into the same old play as you slowly unlocked and uncovered Legendaries and Exotics.</p>
<p>Despite many peoples early misgivings when we knew no real details of how this game was releasing... are Square Enix on to a potential winner here or are we all just getting taken for a ride?</p>

<p>Personally it's a step too far, of course it's behind a paywall, just one that requires you to pay full,price up front for episodic content, or buy an intro pack then go pay as you go. &nbsp;There is no "free" content that I can see?

<p>Played the original Hitman and thought it was the equivalent of watching paint dry. Not saying I wouldn't play the upcoming game...I'm just thinking how much they would have to pay me to do so. ;-) And even then no longer than a "Long Weekend Rental".</p>

<p>I enjoyed "Absolution" and ended up playing the Chinese Market level again and again and again.</p>
<p>It did create some amazing gaming moments... best of all when my Hitman stumbled across the exit, turned around only to see the target strolling casually past him... Silenced pistol to the back of the head that went unnoticed for the 2 seconds it took me
 to slip out the exit door and be showered with a bunch of Uber Stealth awards that I probably didn't deserve.</p>
<p>But then other titles came out and as fun as Hitman was I kept letting myself get dragged to other things... would come back... play the Chinese Market again to get back into it... get distracted again by new games before playing onto further levels.</p>
<p>Perhaps I wasn't the only one who did this.</p>
<p>Some people play their games to death for all the achievements. &nbsp;Some people play their games to death because they can't afford anything else. &nbsp;Some people play their games to the very end because they enjoy them.</p>
<p>Square Enix will know just how much of "Hitman Absolution" was actually played.</p>
<p>It would be interesting information to see what percentage of players completed what percentage of levels.</p>
<p>Maybe this had something to do with their new presentation.</p>
<p>Maybe they simply haven't built the rest of the game.</p>
<p>Sounds like this is going to be a bit like "Metal Gear Solid's" preview release but on a larger scale.</p>
<p>I might give it a go but I'll be kicking myself if they swindle us down the line.</p>

<p>I'm torn with this, I really like stealth games but am a little unsure about this business model. In some ways it almost feels like the preview thing for games such as elite dangerous in they are using the money to fund further development of the game, but
 this is a major developer not someone just starting out and using it as a kickstarter.</p>
<p>This is where I'm a little dubious, if they feel the need to do this are they in money trouble and may not be able deliver the full game later on?</p>
<p>I think if anything I'll just grab the intro package for £11.99 to get my Hitman fix, see how it plays etc then take it &nbsp;as it comes as to whether I pay for the upgrade later on, in total I think it works out about £3 more which I can live with.</p>

<p>Its neither, its impulsive laziness is what it is. Typical "we want money now and we cant wait till the game is finished" mentality. So we will finish a level and sell it to you, my god what a mess this industry is. I almost hate it ! Its just going to get
 worse,trust me. How long do you think it will be till we have paid patches ? Ridiculous ? yes, but if I shared with you all the gaming garbage practices that are happening now ,20yrs ago, you would have called me insane and paranoid.</p>
<p>Sell you're <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> game when its finished FFS ! stop being in a rush to make your stupid money !
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> its like these companies are run by 5 yr olds. NOW NOW NOW !</p>

<p>Its more developers telling you how to play, I don't think its even a comparison to destiny, destiny is a shambles in their business model, but your not going to be able to just value for money until its out.</p>

<p>I'm not really sure what Enen just said.</p>
<p>"Destiny" certainly told us how to play and millions of us jumped &nbsp;through their hoops for the promise of rare rewards.</p>
<p>"Destiny" also wasn't a shambles of a business model. &nbsp;It's a very successful franchise.</p>
<p>I was feeling positive towards this until I learned that the game is going to be deposited in little episodic turds.</p>
<p>So grab the tutorial and 1st city for 15 of your American Earth Dollars and pay again for everything else that's released.</p>
<p>I don't see these releasing anywhere under £10.00 in the UK and at over a tenner a pop with 6 locations we're looking at the chance to pay over £60.00.</p>
<p>Well this just went from "Interesting" to "Get Stuffed".</p>

    <title>Switch user on the computer when account is locked. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Switch user on the computer when account is locked.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello! I've been looking to a solution forever, but nothing that was suggested helps.</p>
<p>I have a netbook with Windows 7 Starter edition installed on it. I have two accounts - mine (Administrator), and my daughters. My daughter's account has parental controls installed on it, including the one that&nbsp;prevents her from logging in after her bedtime.
 This would just lock the computer while she is still logged in. The problem is, there is nothing I can do to get rid of that locked screen that only has her account picture and password under it, so there is no way for me to log in as myself or shut the computer
 off. On my other computer with Vista on it, there was a shut down button and a switch user option so I could easily log back in as myself.</p>
<p>I tried finding "change the way users log in" in my control panel and it's not there. Sometimes I would press something randomly and it would prompt me to a screen with user options, but I have no idea what it is that I am pressing. Please help! Much appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

 on your username (or user group).&nbsp; Here are&nbsp;the types of permissions you can have:
</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 You need to be an administrator or the&nbsp;owner to change permissions (and sometimes being an administrator or even an owner isn't enough - there are ways to block even them from access (though a smart administrator knows these ways and can get around them -
 but usually shouldn't because they were denied access usually for a very good reason).&nbsp; Here's how to change folder permissions in Vista:
</span><span><a href="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/</span></a></span><span>.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
To fix this problem with the folders, take <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
ownership</span> of the folders or the drive (as an administrator) and give yourself full rights.&nbsp; Right click the folder/drive, click on properties, go to the security tab and click on Advanced and then click on the Owner tab.&nbsp; Click edit and then click the
 name of the person you want to give ownership to (you may need to add it if it isn't there - or it may be yourself). If you want it to apply to sub-folders and files within that folder/drive, then check the box for replace owner on sub-containers and objects
 and click OK.&nbsp; Back out and now there's a new owner for the folders/drive and files who can change permissions as needed.&nbsp; You can now change them from read-only (even if the main folder says they still are read only - you can have access yourself as the owner).&nbsp;
 You can keep them as read-only for other users and guests and even administrators (though they can take ownership themselves and gain access if they so desire and there really isn't much you can do to stop this except protect the folder with a password using
 a 3rd party product.&nbsp; Here's more information on taking ownership of a file or folder:

<h2>            Mic Issue - Mic wont pick up voice.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all.</p>
<p>This is the first time im using a support forum since having an Xbox console and this is the first problme I've had. Hopefully you guys can help.</p>
<p>About 2 days ago, my mic decided not to work, its the standard mic you get with your console. Ive tried numerous youtube videos, the troubleshooting guides on the forum here and other forums as well and have had zero success.</p>
<p>Whilst I'm in a party, mic connected, the circle to display if you're chatting is in bold, or open, as in its picking up noise. I game in a room by myself with no other sounds. I can be on the home screen, quite and the circle still appears to be picking
 up sound. My friends in the party say they can hear static or white noise, like low frequency on a low volume (If I can describe best). I can confirm this myself as I've tried the Skype test call via the app. My voice isnt picked up yet it says that it is.
 My mic has no visible problems and doesn't appear to be broken. Im not sure what the cause of this is? My controllers, as well, arent broken. I look after the gaming stuff :))
</p>

<p>Im not sure if ive explained clearly enough. I hope this problem can be fixed.</p>

<h3> hershey444  say:</h3>
<h2>            Messed up Outlook 2007 trying to undo new account and reimport. </h2>
                    OS: Win 7; Office Enterprise 2007<br />
<br />
Yesterday I just imported years of folders (.dbx's) from OE to WLM.&nbsp; Ditto address book/contacts.&nbsp; The folders are in WLM as Storage Folders as Imported Folders followed by many many folders and subfolders. &nbsp; All was well but decided I hate WLM.&nbsp; ('nother story
 for 'nother day)<br />
<br />
So I tried Outlook and used the Import Wizard.&nbsp; It only picked up my new .eml's from the past day.&nbsp; It didn't get any of the Imported Folders under Storage Folders.&nbsp; I was hoping it would ask me to browse to the copy of the OE .DBX files, but it did not.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So I went looking in %localappdata% and my store for them.&nbsp; I wanted to plop the Imported Folders in the "right" place.&nbsp; But it didn't work.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So I went surfing to look for info and found an article about how to import OE folders to Outlook.&nbsp; But it said I had to do such and such
<em>before</em> I created an account.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I deleted my Outlook account so I could start all over again. That didn't seem to do much, so I deleted the .pst file.&nbsp; Then I tried to uninstall just Outlook and find that I can't.&nbsp; Then I tried the "change" option
 to uninstall but nothing happened.<br />
<br />
So now I am in a circular loop of errors with outlook. It wants a .pst file really badly!&nbsp; I just want to start from scratch and UNDO the last hour or so.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This is the article that I was reading about importing for OE to Outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/HA010943871033.aspx<br />
<br />
I just saw that it says it applies to Outlook 2003.&nbsp; Ouch!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
So, is there a way to achieve what I want?&nbsp; Can I get the .DBX data imported to Outlook 2007 if I can fix up the program?<br />
<br />
Or can Outlook 2007 import from WLM?&nbsp;&nbsp; The import wizard did say something about WM, but not WLM.&nbsp; I forget now and can't get back to it to see.<br />
<br />
Wendy<br />
p.s. sorry long, but thought detail might help.

            Windows Live Mail will export to Outlook. (That's the way you want to do it, because if you import mail from another client into Outlook, loads of important date parameters are changed to the date of import. Exporting keeps these dates as they were originally)<br />
I suggest you do Control Panel-Mail-Show Profiles-Add and create a new Outlook Mail Profile. Create a new pst file for it as well.<br />
Then in WLM do File-Export-Messages and choose Microsoft Exchange. Don't worry, that will give you the option to export to Outlook.<br />
