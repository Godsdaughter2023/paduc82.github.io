<h2>            Microsoft Virtual WiFI Miniport Adapter not working Code 31</h2>
                    Ive been the usual route to update and or roll back the driver but no joy.&nbsp; Apparently the device has a configuration problem that prevents it from working properly (Code Err 31) Any suggestions?

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>What is the make and model of the computer? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A <strong>Code 31</strong> error is caused by any number of reasons that prevents Windows from loading the driver for a particular hardware device.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span>The <strong>Microsoft virtual wifi miniport adapter</strong> is a new feature in Windows 7, Wireless Hosted Network:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd815243(VS.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0072c6">About the Wireless Hosted Network</font></span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This device is just a virtual device and it should not affect connecting the wireless network with the physical wireless adapter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</span>
<p><strong><span>Method&nbsp;1: </span></strong><span>Check if you have all the latest Windows Updates installed. If not, install them and check.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Also, check for any optional updates which might have the related drivers. Refer the below mentioned link.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Install-Windows-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">Install Windows updates</font></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong></p>
<span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I’d suggest you to uninstall and re-install only the wireless network adapter drivers
</span><span>from Device manager </span><span>and check if that fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>Before uninstalling the drivers from the device manager, make sure you have a backup of the installation files.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It’s a good idea to create a restore point before uninstalling the drivers. A restore point is a representation of a stored state of your computer's system files. You can use a restore point to restore your computer's system files to an earlier point
 in time. Restore points are automatically created by System Restore weekly and when System Restore detects the beginning of a change to your computer, such as when you install a program or a driver.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer the following Microsoft article for more information on creating a restore point:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Create a restore point</strong></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-restore-point" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0072c6">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-restore-point</font></span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Visit the manufacturer’s website, download the latest wireless drivers and save it on your hard disk.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To uninstall the wireless connection from Device Manager,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. Click <strong>Start</strong> , type <strong>Device Manager</strong> in the Start search box and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Locate <strong>Network adapters</strong> and expand the same.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Select the wireless connection, right-click and select <strong>Uninstall.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>d. Restart the computer, if prompted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Drivers should get installed automatically after restarting the computer.</span></p>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method</strong><span><strong>&nbsp;3: </strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to update the chipset with the latest drivers and also other available drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. </span></p>

<h2>            Xbox one crashing&#47;Turning itself off during games.</h2>
                    
<p>Since yesterday i cannot play black ops 3 (Zombies or multiplayer) for more than 2-10 minutes without my xbox completely turning itself off. And no this isn't an issue with the sensor i've seen that happen, there is no noise made the system just shuts down.
 It has happened to me before on elder scrolls online but only a handful of times, black ops 3 is completely unplayable due to this.<br />
<br />
To test if this was an issue that would happen to any game i play i went on fallout 4 and even started broatcasting so a friend could watch, and ended up broadcasting for 1 hour 44 minutes with a total play time of over 2 hours. Didn't crash or have a single
 issue once. The reason i'm posting this here is because there is clearly issues on xbox's side considering this has happened to other games, i am aware black ops 3 has MANY problems.<br />
<br />
What i'm wondering is - is there any way to fix this? Do i need to wait for treyarch to patch black ops 3? Do i need to wait for microsoft to release their new update? The current xbox one software has gone to **** the closer it gets to being released so this
 may be likely.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me or let me know if you're having these problems too? Or if you've fixed it?</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>CrazyPurpleFish,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Xbox turning off by itself certainly isn't normal behavior. Do you or anyone you live with use Smart-Glass? I've seen where this type of issue with the console just shutting down has been due to one roommate having a good laugh at the expense of
 someone's game time. Also, you said that this does happen with other games, but then said that it does not. It would really help to see if this is isolated to this one game. Also I would suggest uninstalling and reinstalling the game. To do this, press your
 menu button from the COD 3 tile, and then selecting manage game. From there you can uninstall it. After it's uninstalled go ahead and reinstall the game to see if the same issues pop up.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Can&#39;t format USB drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ozgadgetguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t format USB drive</h2>
                    <p>Got a brand new XBOX One S yesterday. Set it up, immediately it updated to the latest software.</p>

<p>I am having problems adding a 4TB Seagate USB 3 external drive. </p>



<p>First off it had no "format" option so I used a partition manager to 
delete all partitions, create a single new partition and formatted it as
 NTFS.</p>



<p>That got me the format menu. I followed it through all the way, 
selected the final "format storage device" and nothing happened – it 
just went back to the storage menu.</p>



<p>I tried various other things, adding it with a blank partition 
(without formatting) etc and can't get the format menu back. I tried 
exFAT, NTFS, no partition at all.</p>



<p>I've tried partitioning/formatting with the built-in Windows disk tool and also two 3rd party utilities.</p>



<p>I have done a hard reset, I have even returned the console because I 
thought it may be a hardware issue but the new one behaves the same way.</p>



<p>I have also tried a 1.5TB Seagate, 960GB SSD and 500GB Hitachi. Can't
 get the format menu to even appear on them. The drives are recognised, 
just no option to format for use for storage. These are all USB 3.0 
portable drives by the way. I've tried all USB ports and two different 
USB 3 cables. All cables and drives work fine on my Windows laptop.</p>



<p>Just spent a fruitless hour with XBOX "tech support" who gave me 
nothing new to try and eventually told me all my drives must be 
incompatible and to go speak to the drive manufacturers. Yeah, right. So
 basically support was useless.</p>



<p>What I need is some <em>real</em> tech support where they diagnose 
using logs etc and find out what is going on but the guy I spoke to said
 there was no option for that.</p>



<p>I'm open to any other ideas...</p>

<h2>            Xbox Slim powers on but there is no green lights on front and won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t synch controller. </h2>
                    Hi we had a electrical storm tonight. The power flickered on and off a couple times. Once it went steady we turned our Xbox slim back on. The system powered up and on the tv displayed the screen to pick a profile to log in with but the green light on the
 front of the console isn't lit. I turned the controller on and it just flashes green. So I press the synch button on the controler and the Xbox. The synching light on the controller spins but the controler won't synch up to the Xbox wich has no light on the
 front at all. I went in the other room and turned on our Xbox arcade it works fine and the controller synced to it when I pushed the synch buttons so the controler is not the problem. Any help would be appreciated.

<p>Hi, try disconnecting the power supply from the mains outlet, remove the power cable from the console, press the power button several times to drain all remaining electrical current from the console, reconnect the power cable and give it a try.</p>

<p>Hmm, honestly at this point it's sounding like that console likely is going to need a repair. &nbsp;To build on EggsBoxJuan's suggestion, you could try leaving it unplugged for several hours just to be super, super sure.<br />

    <title>Xbox One S shutting down randomly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One S shutting down randomly</h2>
                    <p>My Xbox One S recently went for a Microsoft service due to a video issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it has returned the video issue is resolved but the console is randomly shutting down. When I first turn the console on after being left for a few hours it will last around 20-30 minutes before shutting down. If I turn it back on after this it will
 shut down within a few seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds to me like an overheating issue, but I have moved the console out into an open area so no air vents are obstructed and the same problem occurs?</p>
<p>

            Sounds like it may be overheating.&nbsp; Make sure all vents are free of dust and debris and the console is well ventilated.&nbsp; It sounds like you have already done everything correctly and if this continues you should go to your account/devices and set it up

            Mine does the same thing its because the way they made the xbox one consoles are cheap.. they will not take responsibility to claim of what their products are giving the customers.. which to me is bull microsoft failed hard time this generation and they
 are still doing so by assigning blame and giving out troubleshooting steps that do not work.. however it should only do it once every other time its not a major issue but it needs to be fixed.. but they wont fix it unless if its major and its going to lose
 them cash.. so dont hold your breath on them actually fixing anything thats past their standards.. these troubleshooting steps are awful should be reconsidered with the rest of the console 360 had one big issue other than that youve never had as many issues
 with the 360 as you did this console.. xbox one is nothing but a cash grab.. facts&nbsp;

            Updates are cumulative meaning when you install the latest build, it has all bug and security fix from previous builds. However, it is recommended to deploy builds as soon as possible.

 a better 8.1 RT port, but where can I get a copy of RT?</p>

            This is not possible -- the Fire Tablet runs Android operating system, and the company that built it does not supply drivers for the system chipset hardware to make the Windows 10 OS run on it.

<p>In addition to Shawn's advice, if you <em>could</em> install Windows on the Fire, its storage capacity would be eaten up faster than you can say "WTF?" Allow&nbsp;me to &nbsp;expand the topic a bit. Most RT devices will easily become Android devices. The 8 &amp; 10 inch
 tablets are Android devices with significant modifications. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My interest is because the Fire OS/Android OS has an excellent CPU and is a true quad core making it significantly faster on a better OS.&nbsp; Both offer additional storage with a micro SD card and have a basic 32 gb storage with 2 gigs of memory. It is sold
 close to manufacturing/marketing cost due to the modified Android 4 and even Lollipop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is Microsoft has finally gotten&nbsp;it right with Win 10. In my opinion Win 10 is better than then the alternatives. I even like Win RT&nbsp;albeit a&nbsp;stop gap OS to get Win in the wild.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So no one here has tried to port RT or 10?&nbsp; It is easy to port an alternative OS to&nbsp;any Windows&nbsp;machine the Mac OS because it is UNIX based and the Kernel is a stumbling block.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My concern is not to brick the device because of the nature of the Kernel in my Android machines.</p>

<p>Please reread my advice about storage space.&nbsp; 32GB will never be enough space to sustain a Windows installation.&nbsp; The Micro SD card won't help. I too have a 32GB Fire tablet and I wouldn't dream of trying to install Windows on it.&nbsp;

<p>Space is one concern but even many mainstream laptops like the HP Stream (one of which I own) only has 32 GB of space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't get me wrong, it's absurdly annoying because of it. But you can use it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it doesn't matter because you can't install Windows on that device unless Amazon supplies the drivers. And that's assuming the bootloader is even unlocked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, you're not in for an easy time. Go ahead and try if youre a techie that likes a challenge. Heck, blog about it even. But you won't get help doing it from Microsoft.</p>

                    &amp; still haven't had time to play it because it is a great system i bet everyone else here can tell you that. I also own the PS4 so i own the best of both worls ( fan of the games ) i don't praise the companies. For those of you who are still on the fence
 about purchasing the X1 or cant choose between the two i would first take a look at how many friends you have on each console then i would make a list of what games that have been annouced for either console interest you more but most importantly make sure
 its what YOU WANT don't let these sony fanboys or xbone fanboys make your decision.

<p>The gamers win for sure when you have competition. I'll be getting a PS4 eventually I'm sure as I always buy every console. I owned both the ps3, xbox 36 and the wii.

<p>if you're like me, and spend 90%+ of your time playing multiplayer games, then the xbox one is the superior system. &nbsp;300,000+ dedicated gaming servers and a console architecture that takes advantage of cloud capabilities and network infrastructure that MS
 has built.</p>
<p>if you like single player gaming and have no intentions of every paying for a plus/gold type membership, then the ps4 is the best system. &nbsp;if gives you a lot of access to apps without membership, and free games if you do have membership, and a technical
 graphics edge overall (something typically needed for single player gameplay).</p>
<p>That's my opinion, but I don't recommend buying both. &nbsp;For that kind of money you can just buy a solid gaming PC that smokes both of these systems.</p>

<p>You feel bad for the fact that this is the single best console I've ever purchased? Whatever dude. People are freaking out about how it costs $500, and yet the PS3 when it launched was $500 for the baseline, no Wi-Fi, 20GB model. Granted that was 7 years
 ago, but still. Stop being so whiny about price. You get what you pay for. (I realize that only the first portion of this post pertains to the OP thread lol)</p>

<p>We haven't discussed the Steambox. It looks like a member of the Xbox family, and it offers 1080p and 60fps for $499.99. Sounds great right? Buy that and the Xbox One and you are laughing! The best exclusives, and the best graphics. No need for a PS4, which
 is great. HOWEVER. Have you SEEN the Steambox controller? What the HELL Is that thing?</p>

<p>I watched a video demo of the Steambox controller. Its just an iPhone touch control scheme built into a controller. They were saying that it gives you the same tactile performance of a mouse, yet on Portal I saw a lot of multiple swiping and overshooting
 of their target. I'm sorry, not interested. I've played a handful of iPhone games, like Max Payne, and both Grand Theft Auto titles on an iPhone 5. All of which originated on a Dualshock 2, and they were almost unplayable due to the wonky on screen analog
 stick. Don't even get me started on the camera controls. Thats where this controller fails.</p>

<p><br />
A projector is nothing more than an external monitor.&nbsp; Usually you just press a key combination on the laptop to tell the system to use the external monitpr eoither in EXTEND or MIRROR modes.&nbsp; The fn + F8 key on Dells, I believe.</p>
<p>When you upgraded to Windows 7 on this laptop (<em>what laptop model&nbsp;is it, by the way</em>?) - did you then get the proper Windows 7 drivers for the video/graphics device that is in the laptop or just use the generic ones?</p>

<h2>            Unable to install Windows 10 after using Dban tool to cleanup the files.</h2>
                    <p>One computer (LG 22v24, all-in-one) recently slowed to a crawl.&nbsp; It had no important data that wasn't backed up so we were going to do a clean wipe and reinstall.&nbsp; Using a bootable USB, I ran DBAN on the C:/ (1 gig, SCSI) and D:/ (500 gigs SATA) drives.&nbsp;
 &nbsp;It booted and ran, with several errors on the D:/ drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We assume the D:/ drive has bad sectors that have not been repaired.&nbsp; (We were writing to it a lot and getting errors from some secure deletion programs, e.g., Eraser could not erase file tips.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would boot from a Ubuntu USB but not really run or install (boot disk confirmed working on another computer).&nbsp; For some reason Gparted USB boot disk would behave similarly (boot but not really run).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using a Win 10 bootable USB, it will boot to the usb.&nbsp; It cannot complete repairs.&nbsp; If I try to install, it hangs (for days).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to run chkdsk, C:/ "is not a valid entry."&nbsp; &nbsp;D:/ results in "cannot open volume or drive."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have unplugged everything, held the power for thirty seconds, now I am rebooting.&nbsp; &nbsp; It's hanging at the manufacturer's screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any way to repair the disk via a bootable usb?&nbsp; (Or LAN to a computer with Win 8?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Can someone hack my computer by asking me to  right click on my computer and press cntrl &#43; r&#63;</h2>
                    After a recent phone from a supposed Microsoft Technician, where the person asked us to run all sorts of things on our computer, and showed us a list of all corrupt files, is there a possibility that they are running malicious software on my computer?&nbsp;
 I know it wasn't clever to fall for it but there was a lot going on at the time and we just panicked.<br />
<br />
If anyone could advise that would be great as we are worried we will lose all files or have accounts etc hacked.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            It depends on what you entered in the Run box <span style="font-weight: bold">
after</span> you pressed CTRL+R.<br />
<br />
Typically, these scammers tell you to type "eventvwr" after pressing CTRL+R and then scare you by having you look at all the "Warnings" and "Errors"&nbsp; or they have you type in some command and magically know what's on your computer.&nbsp; See, e.g.,
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-system/who-is-world-pc-tech/99b5f77b-1fe0-4277-98c2-25368ae06ba3">

<br />
As long as you didn't allow the caller to access your computer (usually by going to LogMeIn or some similar website and entering a password they give you), you're probably OK.<br />

    <title>BSOD &#40;DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE&#41; upon waking Surface Book 2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chickenmatt5  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD &#40;DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE&#41; upon waking Surface Book 2</h2>
                    <p>My Surface Book 2 (13.5" i7 w/ GTX 1050) on Windows 10 Version 1809 has a roughly 3 in 4 chance to, upon waking up, trigger a DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE blue screen a couple minutes after waking up. During the couple minutes between waking and crashing,
 random components of both the OS and any programs I have open will lag and glitch out in random ways. I used to have Windows Hello enabled, and I could tell if I would trigger the BSOD because the IR camera would not enable and the lockscreen would freeze
 on the Windows Hello dialog. Disabling Windows Hello has not stopped the BSODs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted a fresh install of version 1709, and before adding any other software or performing any updates, I experienced the same BSOD behavior. I am now up-to-date on Version 1809, and I have ensured all my drivers are up-to-date. I have NVIDIA GeForce
 Experience installed to ensure my graphics driver is up-to-date, however before I reinstalled 1709 I did not have GeForce Experience installed and still experienced the BSODs. I installed the latest driver pack from
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56261" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page</a>&nbsp;(SurfaceBook2_Win10_17763_1805009_0.msi). I have tried sfc /scannow, Windows Memory Diagnostic, Surface Diagnostic Toolkit; all these tools report no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been emailing Surface support for almost a month and they have stopped responding, despite assuring me they were working on a solution. This problem began mere days after my hardware warranty expired, otherwise I would have already made the 2 hour
 drive to the nearest Microsoft Store to tell them to fix it.</p>
<p>

 or solve my problem, leave a suggestion. Thank you.</p>

            Hello chickenmatt5,
<br />
<br />First of all uninstall Nvidia driver with DDU in safe mode
<br /><a href="https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dr...</a>
<br />
<br />This is a non-Microsoft website. The page appears to be providing accurate, safe information. Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.
<br />
<br />Then reinstall Nvidia Graphics from Nvidia website and DO NOT reinstall GEForce Experience.
<br />
<br />Tell me what is your antivirus
<br />Task manager &gt; startup tab &gt; post a capture
<br />
<br />Hope this helps, and let me know if you have further problems!

<p>Hi&nbsp;Patricia.Guenot, thanks for your reply. I successfully used DDU to uninstall my NVIDIA drivers, and then installed drivers from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/144363/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this page</a>. Below
 is an image of the completion screen of that driver install. I ensured I was in airplane mode for the install, but after I enabled wifi, Windows Update installed something called "Surface - Monitor".</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Below is my startup page from Task Manager. I experienced the BSOD before installing any of the programs enabled. I do not use an antivirus program other than Windows Defender.</p>

            Hi chickenmatt5
<br />
<br />Bith minidumps definitively list your Nvidia graphics card device driver as the cause of your System crashes . . .
<br />
<br />Perhaps an older driver would be more compatible with your System . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />Restart your PC once done . . .
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, go to the Nvidia website and look for an older version of that device driver and install that . . .       
        </p>

<br />If you have BSOD in safe mode too, it could be a hardware issue.
<br />If not, I suggest you reset your pc

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant restarts without making any changes, and clean install never completes</h2>
                    <p>I've been trying for a week to install Windows 10. I can't install from desktop because my activated Windows 7 Pro is an OEM install and the installer will not accept OEM keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a clean install using the download assistant to download an ISO and make a DVD. The boot installer would not install windows 10 unless I formatted my drive, so I did that. The installer then never completed - it would restart at the appropriate stage
 but once restarted, with the blue Win10 logo and the spinning progress icon, the installation froze, every single time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I therefore reinstalled Windows 7, started the ISO download all over again in case the ISO was bad, and repeated the same process all over again, to failure again.<br />
<br />
I then reinstalled Windows 7 again, used the download assistant to produce a bootable flash drive installer instead, and tried that. Exactly the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's clear that a clean install is never going to work, so I reinstalled Windows 7 yet again and I have tried using the upgrade assistant. It has failed so many times, and I have downloaded the windows files so many times now, that I just keep them, all
 backed up, so when I start the installer again it verifies all the download files fairly quickly, then starts "getting your upgrade ready". It usually gets stuck at 99%, but after restarting it a number of times I can get it to complete. It then says that
 it is restarting my PC, gives a 30 min countdown to automatic restart, or I can press a button to restart now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the restart, Windows 7 is there, happily pretending that nothing has ever happened. There is no Windows 10. Every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been through the forums, other people have this problem. Can anyone at Microsoft provide any useful answer here? Otherwise there will be at least one less Windows 10 device come 29th July.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Update and more problems: I got so sick of this that, almost out of spite, I ran three different Win10 install methods at once from the desktop - I ran the ISO clean installer, ran the Upgrade web installer, and ran the Windows 10 upgrade Assistant. While
 the Upgrade Assistant was waiting for me to press Restart, the web installer restarted the PC itself, and for the first time the PC booted to the black screen with "Upgrading Windows" at the top, and a circle with the percentage inside. It got to about 15%
 when I decided to leave it overnight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next morning, it was at 17%. Still was hours later. Having no other option, I reset the PC, which then booted to a message about rolling back to my previous version of windows. Win7 started with an error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We couldn't install windows 10" with "0xC1900101 - 0x20006 The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during REPLICATE_OC operation"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already turned off all fancy BIOS options, unplugged everything except my keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MGADiag.exe has given no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is (and always have been) a self-build, no wild overclocking of anything like that, just quality parts. Built for stability and performance. AMD CPU and graphics, SSD drives, no issues with RAM clockspeed or CPU clocking, I keep it clean and simple
 for gaming and video.</p>

            <p>I've offically given up. Two long chat and remote access sessions with MS tecchies has helped not at all. They did all the usual tweaking and simply told me to reinstall again using the upgrade assistant, and if that didnt work, format my drive and start
 again with a fresh install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fresh install from an empty drive hadn't work the first five times I did it, so unsuprisingly it didn't work the sixth time. MS said that my computer is just incompatible, even though the checked and said it was perfectly compatible. I had unplugged
 every single device - all that remained was motherboard, PSU, a single hard drive, and a simple VGA monitor. Even keyboard and mouse had been unplugged during setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I smell a rat in this edition of windows. I have to work for a living and can spare no more time for this, so I've missed the free upgrade offer, and if this is what i have to look forward to, I will be damned before I pay for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 startup error with ci.dll &#47; ntoskrnl.exe</h2>
                    Windows 7 cannot&nbsp;start up and&nbsp;system recovery options cannot repair automatically. It looks like ci.dll and ntoskrnl.exe is causing the issue. I have run System File Checker (sfc.exe) on all Windows startup files and everything checks out okay.

<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
BCCode: 7E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0x0000007E&nbsp; which is also 0x1000007E<br />
<br />
</strong>This error is usually a driver&nbsp;issue and display adapter (video) driver is the most suspect
<br />
though it could be others.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs, hardware (heat) and
<br />
major software issues can also cause the error. When you get to the driver section of the<br />
troubleshooter use my generic methods in the next message and then return to the<br />
troubleshooter if needed. <br />
<br />
Have you added hardware recently or updated drivers? Be sure to look in Control Panel -
<br />
Windows Updates to see if any drivers were updated there. Other lessor possibilities
<br />
include antivirus/anti-spyware/security programs.<br />
<br />
When you get to the driver and memory sections of the troubleshooter refer to the next
<br />
message to update drivers and test memory and then refer back to the troubleshooter
<br />
if needed.<br />
<br />
=======================================================<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 7E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0x0000007E&nbsp; which is also 0x1000007E <br />
<br />
SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check has a value of 0x0000007E. This bug check indicates that a system thread generated an exception that the error handler did not catch.<br />
<br />
<strong>Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code<br />
<br />
</strong>If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer,
 call the manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.</p>
<p><br />
If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p><br />
These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>
SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED Parameters
<p><br />
The following parameters appear on the blue screen. <br />
<br />
<strong>Cause <br />
<br />
</strong>The SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check is a very common bug check. To interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>0x80000002: STATUS_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT indicates an unaligned data reference was encountered.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>0x80000003: STATUS_BREAKPOINT indicates a breakpoint or ASSERT was encountered when no kernel debugger was attached to the system.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION indicates a memory access violation occurred.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>For a complete list of exception codes, see the Ntstatus.h file that is located in the inc directory of the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK).
<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolution<br />
<br />
</strong>If you are not equipped to debug this problem, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make sure you have enough disk space. </p>
</li><li>
<p>If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Try changing video adapters. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>If you plan to debug this problem, </strong>you might find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter 2 (the exception address) should identify the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p><br />
If exception code 0x80000003 occurs, a hard-coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but the system was started with the
<strong>/NODEBUG</strong> switch. This problem should rarely occur. If it occurs repeatedly, make sure that a kernel debugger is connected and the system is started with the
<strong>/DEBUG</strong> switch.</p>
<p><br />
If exception code 0x80000002 occurs, the trap frame supplies additional information.</p>
<p><br />
If you do not know the specific cause of the exception, consider the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hardware incompatibility. Make sure that any new hardware that is installed is compatible with the installed version of Windows. For example, you can get information about compatibility with Windows&nbsp;7 at the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=246806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 7 Compatibility Center</a>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Faulty device driver or system service. A faulty device driver or system service might be responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts, and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver. Disable or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS
 file system, you might be able to use Safe Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you must start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.
<br />
<br />
If the problem is associated with Win32k.sys, the source of the error might be a third-party remote control program. If such software is installed, you can remove the service by starting the computer by using the Recovery Console and then deleting the offending
 system service file.<br />
<br />
Check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help identify the device or driver that is causing bug check 0x7E.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS might to try to resolve the error. You should also run hardware diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, that the system manufacturer supplies. For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual
 for your computer. <br />
<br />
The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is lack of disk space for installation and system BIOS incompatibilities. For problems during Windows installation
 that are associated with lack of disk space, reduce the number of files on the target hard disk drive. Check for and delete any temporary files that you do not have to have, Internet cache files, application backup files, and .chk files that contain saved
 file fragments from disk scans. You can also use another hard disk drive with more free space for the installation. You can resolve BIOS problems by upgrading the system BIOS version.<br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen
<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other
<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or <br />
PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (Check for BIOS and driver<br />
updates.)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on
<br />
your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed:
<br />
load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that <br />
created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the<br />
make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - <br />
write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything <br />
as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this
<br />
will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard <br />
if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) <br />
and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get<br />
their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System<br />
&nbsp;Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR <br />
SCANNER - check manually by model. <br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using<br />
the methods above is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker <br />
and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations<br />
in Windows Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install<br />
drivers which will usually be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new<br />
driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones manually if
<br />
you wish.<br />

==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible <br />
even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed <br />
in system behind slower&nbsp; memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out <br />
to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<h2>            Skype continues to reduce usability with every version - why&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,<br />
I would like to understand the thinking by Microsoft behind the continued drive to reduce the usability of Skype with every new version. Instead of keeping something that was already good (who remembers being able to share a portion of their screen, direct
 drag of files out of the skype window, a compact and unobtrusive chat window, most commonly used contacts where you want them...) every version wastes more space, is harder to see with reduced contrast, and loses things that were good about skype.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is Why?&nbsp; Is Microsoft trying to drive us all away from the huge investment they made in Skype. Are they sad because they are not monetizing it the way they want.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would have thought it would have been much better for Microsoft, and us, to keep the great features of the original Skype, and improve the behind the scenes stuff - reliability for example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has a real suggestion as to why Microsoft keeps going this path, please add your tuppence worth. Maybe Microsoft will notice.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Is there a &#34;Filmstrip&#34; equivalent view in windows 7 as there - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patrico12345  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a &#34;Filmstrip&#34; equivalent view in windows 7 as there was in XP&#63;</h2>
                    I've recently updated from windows XP to 7 and now I realize there isn't a handy function like the filmstrip view from XP in 7. I know there are people who are talking about the preview pane and all that, but this feature does not allow for the quick rotation
 of photos and automatically save them. Much more, the preview pane doesn't even offer a larger view of the photos like the XP filmstrip had.
<br />
<br />
So I'm curious if there is a way I could get a filmstrip equivalent. I know I was browsing through some other sites and ran across this web page which appeared to look useful:<br />

            With the preview pane turned on (Organize-Layout-Preview pane), you can resize it so that the selected picture is even bigger then it was in XP's Film Strip view.&nbsp; Just click and drag on the vertical line separating the preview pane from the file list.<br />
<br />
The files can still be rotated by right-clicking, but the shortcut key Control+Shift+-/= doesn't work.<br />

    <title>Help with Photoshop CS6 on Surface Pro 4 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crimsonnephilim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help with Photoshop CS6 on Surface Pro 4</h2>
                    I recieved a Surface Pro 4 as a gift to use as a graphics tablet.&nbsp; I installed Photoshop CS6 Extended to it, but I ran into the issue of the UI being too small.&nbsp; I've already looked into workarounds and fixes for the scaling, but haven't been successful
 in finding something that will work.<br />
<br />
I tried using the registry fix with the manifest, but CS6 is still scaling way too small to be useful. I also tried disabling/enabling scaling in the Compatibility tab in Properties. Any help with getting CS6 to scale properly?
