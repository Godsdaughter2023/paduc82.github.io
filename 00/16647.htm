    <title>Restored Excel file from previous OneDrive version now saying - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Restored Excel file from previous OneDrive version now saying can&#39;t find part of the file&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I had a problem with OneDrive on one of my computers which meant re-installing it and then re-syncing. As a result, some of my files reverted to the wrong versions but I used the versioning tools built into OneDrive to get back a previous copy by clicking
 on the Excel title bar and choosing one from a day earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have the following two messages come up each time I open the file, despite it having the correct name and no apparent external links (I've done the Name Manager check and the search for .xl using Ctrl+F):</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what is going on that is causing it to refer back to the previous version, and more importantly how to fix it?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help offered.</p>

<p>A small follow-up: I tried a Save As... with a new filename. When I open the new file, macros are disabled initially and these two messages don't occur. When I then enable macros, the messages happen again. So it's likely something to do with a link to a
 macro / VBA script although when I go into the VB editor and look at the code I've written, there are no references to workbooks outside the current one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have push buttons on the main sheets linking to the VBA, but I've gone through each one and checked they only reference the current workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if that information helps or makes things worse!</p>

<h2>            mystery email contacts</h2>
                    <p>When I begin to type a name into the "TO" list names appear that are not in my Contacts list. In a couple of cases, the name that appears is also in my Contacts list but with a different email address. That leads to problems when a personal email&nbsp;is misaddressed.
</p>
<p>Example:&nbsp;&nbsp;My own Contact list = a person's private email but the 2nd email address that shows up = the person's work email. I need to eliminate the second email addresses &nbsp;that I don't want.</p>

<h2>            Not receiveing emails with attachments in Hotmail.</h2>
                    <p>I use Hotmail on my phone, directly by logging into Outlook.com and through the Outlook application.
</p>
<p>I can send and receive emails, normally without issue. </p>
<p>Occasionally, I will not receive an email&nbsp;that has an attachment. I don't get anything, the body, the attachment, nothing.</p>
<p>I wouldn't even know about the mail if I wasn't either expecting it or if people didn't reply to it.
</p>
<p>I have had people resend multiple times without success. </p>
<p>I have them change the address rom my Hotmail account to my MSN account, and it works no problem.
</p>
<p>I know of this happening at least twice, and in both cases there was an attachment.
</p>
<p>I do not know of any non-attachment examples. </p>

            It was a shot in the dark, I guess you don't use Webroot&nbsp;&nbsp; here is the wiki:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webroot_Software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webroot_Software</a>.&nbsp; I suppose you have looked at the sent folder on the senders computer and checked your inbound email.&nbsp; That you haven't deleted the email using a different
 device (mobile..).&nbsp; I thought you could see the email, but not the attachment?&nbsp; If an attachment is in a format like TGF you may have to use another software to view them.&nbsp; But if you are not getting the email from this person at all (any email from that person).
 That sounds like the junk mail folder check was a good idea. Add their address to your address book.&nbsp; Not sure what else to tell you.

<p>On at least two occasions, I have not receive an email&nbsp;that has an attachment. I don't get anything, the body, the attachment, nothing.</p>
<p>The mail does not appear in my junk mail folder, the sender is not blocked, I do receive some emails from this sender, so I don't need to add this person to my address book.</p>
<p>It is not the size of the attachment, the attachments on this last email were 43K and 36K.</p>
<p>I do not think that the sender receives any notification that the mail has not been delivered.
</p>
<p>I know the mail was sent, and sent to the right address because someone else on the to line replied all and I got that reply.
</p>
<p>I believe this to be a server side problem. If so I can't be the only person experiencing it. But due to the infrequency, and lack of notification, it may go unnoticed most of the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it&nbsp;does have something to do with the sender/attachment. I don't know what, but if a sender sends the same attachment twice, I don't get either email. Change the destination email address from Hotmail to MSN and the mail goes through with attachment
 no problem.</p>

            Have you since been able to get that specific attachment?&nbsp; All I can think of that is left is that your system rejects that specific file attachment. Perhaps it is a file attachment your computer has specific instructions to reject?&nbsp; Compare the attachment
 type time sent, to your arrival without the attachment, vs the other&nbsp;mail recipients and the distribution list to make sure some trick isn't in play. Then compare the file type of the attachment and handling instructions of the successful arrival to the failed
 arrival, do&nbsp;you have similar types of attachments on your computer.&nbsp; Failing that, I have no idea why the randomness occurs.&nbsp; I Lastly,&nbsp;you could check system logs for a record of events that occurred at those particular times.

<h2>            Creating Calendars from Command Line or the like</h2>
                    <p>In connection with configuring a One-to-many calendar sync, I need to make a new calendar as a subfolder in the users calendar folder.</p>
<p>So when viewed in Outlook, the folder structure would look something like this:</p>
<p>Mailbox %username% </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&gt; Calendar </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&gt; New calendar&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to make then subfolder calendar, other then logging on with the user and making the folder by hand?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a number&nbsp;of one-to-many sync's I need to configure, and I would really love to be able to make a script that could create a new calendar on a number of user, in one go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have to manage the group of users who have these extra calendar. sometimes adding, sometimes removing users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the moment we are running Outlook 2010 up against a Exchange 2010</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NB: I have the same problem with syncing Contacts, but a script works with creating a new subfolder calendar, it should be able to do the same with a new subfolder contacts</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            You could do it at client level with a vbs-script via the Outlook Object Model but it might me more convenient to do this at server level via PowerShell.<br />

Not clear about this.&nbsp; Have a Win 10 license for regular use on the computer. Want to run Insider Software via a separate drive on same computer. Ex: Run day-to-day on standard license and swap SSD to Insider SSD to test Insider version. Cannot run Insider
 as daily driver as I am in FAST ring.

    <title>Nokia 6230i as GPRS modem problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> feet---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 6230i as GPRS modem problem</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I've been using my Nokia 6230i (bought Dec 05) as a GPRS modem to synch my inbox on my HP Ipaq (via bluetooth) for a few weeks now and everythign had been dandy. However in the last week I've been having GPRS problems. I can connect and my mailbox will start
 synching with the Exchange server fine and pulling down attachments and then all of a sudden the GPRS connection will drop out without any warning and the synch will not complete. It says something like "GPRS connection ended" on the phone screen. The same
 thing happens when I just browse the internet on my Ipaq, the GPRS connection drops out, sometimes after a few minutes, sometimes after 20 seconds or so.<br />
<br />
I've tried changing alot of settings on the phone and Ipaq and the only conclusion I can come to is that the phone maybe malfunctioning. The firmware on the phone is 03.50.<br />
<br />
What is the lastest firmware update for this phone and is their a problem with GPRS known with this firmware version?<br />
<br />
Can anyone give me any advice.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance. :)

            have you considered the issue may be with the ipaq?<br />
<br />
the test would be to use another phone as a modem for the ipaq and see if the same thing happens(use your sim in it).<br />
<br />
it could also be an issue with the network, the fact it says gprs connection ended might indicate there is a signal issue.<br />
<br />
after all that, if you think the phone is faulty go here:<a href="http://www.nokia.co.uk/nokia/0,8764,76918,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.co.uk/nokia/0,8764,76918,00.html</a> and you can find the nearest engineer.

- The phone connects seamlessly to the device using either IR or Bluetooth - the symptoms are identical so the problem does not lie with the mode of connection between the phone and the device<br />
- The device can be a Pocket PC (in my case an IPaq) or a laptop (in my case an HP/Compaq nc4010) - the symptoms are identical so the problem does not lie with the other device<br />
- The device initiates the GPRS connection through the phone and can access web services; I have tried internet, email, and even a VPN tunnel - all work...<br />
<br />
...except that after about one minute the phone bleeps and tells me that my "GPRS connection ended". The device is still frantically trying to access the net, but after a while has to give up and tells me my modem has lost the connection. This happens whether
 the device maintains traffic or not.<br />
<br />
Using the phone itself to connect, using either the built-in browser or Opera Mini, the GPRS connection is strong and healthy for as long as I need it.<br />
<br />
I did send a webform email to Nokia support but their reply was - not surprisingly - that "the problem is likely to lie with the other device". I don't think so. Seems to me there's a built-in disconnect-on-idle timer that doesn't recognise that there's traffic
 when the GPRS connection is used by a device other than the phone itself - but I'm not a phone techie. I do hope there is one out there...<br />
<br />

the only problem with that idea is that gprs is idle for most of the time.<br />
<br />
with gprs the connection is always on, the way you are billed is when data passes over the connection. there isnt really an idle time with gprs, unlike with gsm data where your connection would time out. equally there is no setting on the 6230i that controls
 this :(<br />
<br />
the guys at nokia are possibly correct, there may be something on the pda that times out the connection over bluetooth if it is idle...

            Hi - thanks for responding!<br />
<br />
I only activate GPRS when I'm actually surfing, so the connection is generally idle for less that half a minute at a time.<br />
<br />
The problem isn't only with the pda but with the pc as well. There doesn't seem to be a setting to control idle timout on the pda, but there is on the pc and it's disabled. Besides - the connection is dropped while the device (whichever device) is busy trying
 to access a web service, so the connection is definitely not idle!<br />
<br />
I know there's no setting to control idle time-out on the phone. God knows I've been looking for one. The question is if there's a built-in function that is not user-configurable.<br />
<br />
Could it be - is there the slightest possibility - that the problem actually does lie with the phone after all? Just a thought...<br />
<br />
My firmware in 3.50 - is there a later, and if so how do I go about upgrading? (and would that solve the problem...?)<br />
<br />
Regards.

            take it in to a nokia engineer and get the latest firmware installed, that would clear it up if it were the phone.<br />
<br />
i agree with the others, gprs just cannot time out like that, it would need to be a process controlling the modem that would close the connection (dont forget, in this instance the phone is just a modem, nothing on the phone will affect performance).<br />
<br />
the only other concevable thought is that the network is disconnecting you after a while to get more users online...<br />
<br />
its the same with some pay as you go dial up ISP's, they disconnect your modem after around 2 hours

While finding answers on internet I found the following info: http://www.mobile-review.com/articles/2004/nokia6230bt-en.shtml<br />
It might be Bluetooth in the phone causing the problem. I have the problem of bluetooth disconnect too when transfering files through OBEX (around 400K or more).<br />
I just had my phone for 3 weeks now, and I am going back to my phone-supplier on tuesday. I am a business user who travels very much, and can't accept this.

            Hi All,<br />
I am from India and I just purchased the same instrument, 20 days back and have been facing the same problem since then.<br />
<br />
Initially I had bluetooth connectivity problem while exchanging data, i contacted Nokia care center and they replaced the faulty handset! Fortunately that bluetooth problem is now resolved in this new handset, the GPRS modem problem described above is still
 there!<br />
<br />
I think it's inbuilt modem fault, disconnecting everytime after 1+ minutes. I have tried every kind of settigs with my Compaq Notebook modem configuration! Even tried Nokia bluetooth modem driver, but no success!<br />
<br />
So, this Saturday i am gonna visit Nokia Care again and find out the resolution...<br />
<br />
If anyone find solution please do post it here....:)<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Nirav<br />

            Hi,<br />
So it's the same problem here, and it's definiteley phone related. I have 2 phones: Nokia 6230i from work and SE W800 for private use, both on Vodafone. I connect to internet (BT / GPRS) with both phones from 2 devices: laptop (toshiba tecra s1) and ipaq (hx4700).
 The connections through the W800 are working perfectly, the connections through the 6230i get dropped after a few minutes. To be sure I tried to connect through a colleage's phone that has exactly the same provider settings (6310) which worked perfectly as
 well.<br />
So the 6230i sucks as a GPRS modem. Did anyone out there solve this problem?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Rob

            no, its not a phone issue. if it were then everyone would have this problem when they browse the web on the phone, send an mms or use the phone as a modem with any device.<br />
<br />
its only ipaq users who have this issue, so it is an ipaq issue

            OK - let's try this again: we've tried this both on iPaq's and on PC laptops and the result is the same. We've tried it with different SIM cards and with different network providers, and the result is the same. With another handset, however, the problem
 goes away.

<h2>            Outlook Flagged Emails have wrong Due date after I installed To Do</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Tasks in Outlook 2016 on Window successfully for years.&nbsp; I flag emails with a Due date so they appear on my To-Do list in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My timezone is UTC + 10.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is set correctly on both Window and Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This week I installed Microsoft To Do on my Windows 10 PC.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then, I am having problems with the Due dates of my flagged emails in Outlook.&nbsp; If a flagged email has Today as the Due date and I then change the Due date to Tomorrow, the Due date changes correctly to Tomorrow briefly.&nbsp; After a few seconds the Due
 date then changes back to today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tied uninstalling Microsoft To Do and restarting Windows but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this problem?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I found the fix for this issue, it i something to do with the Microsoft TODO app.</p>
<p>ALL you need to do is:</p>
<p>- Install Microsoft todo app from app store</p>
<p>- Connect it with your account office/home</p>
<p>- Go to settings of the app -&gt; Connections</p>
<p>- Uncheck flagged email.</p>
<p>- It will ask that the messages will be deleted say yes(It wont delete the actual email)</p>
<p>- Voila issue is fixed!!</p>

<h2>            Your phone app - gets stuck &#34;refreshing&#34;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;This has been a problem for a week or so now. Before this, it would try to refresh, and if there was any kind of issue with it connecting with my android phone, it would just report that refreshing was unsuccessful after a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;But now, it sits there "refreshing" for hours sometimes, and even if you close it down and re-open it, it will still be refreshing, and won't stop until it feels like it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Meanwhile, stuff like WhatsApp still work fine using my PC. So my PC can clearly still see my phone and communicate with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Any ideas? Cheers</p>

            So it sounds as if it might be an issue with your Android phone. What application is your phone using when you see this issue? What is the OS on your PC?

<p>No offence but I think you may have misunderstood what is happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have "your phone companion" on my Android phone, and "Your Phone" running on my Windows 10 PC. When I have the "your phone" app open on my PC, it usually gets push notifications when I get text messages on my phone. If for any reason my phone is off,
 or on night time mode for example, the "your phone" app on the PC will refresh itself just to catch up with any messages it may have missed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;It usually refreshes for a couple of minutes at most. If my phone is off for example it will try to refresh and then say it couldn't connect to my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Instead, whenever I start up the app on my PC, it starts refreshing immediately, and won't stop. Even if you close it down and re-open it, it carries on refreshing, and gets stuck, so won't actually connect to my phone at all. The app simply stays stuck
 in a loop and you can't do anything with it.</p>

<p>OK, I got it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I just got my first Android Phone so I am still pretty new at it. It definitely is not a Windows Phone (lol)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I assume that Wi-Fi is ON and in the PC app, under Settings ALL the sliders are ON.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the app (Your Phone Companion) when you open it on your device it says on the main screen that Your phone and PC are linked. Also, if you click the Settings icon (upper right), under accounts, your Microsoft account is showing correctly. Also, under Settings,
 mine says under "check for updates that the version is: 3.4.3_58680, mmx-3.3.0-1903.11001</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yours is the same then I think I might try uninstalling from BOTH my device and PC. Reboot both the device and PC then reinstall both</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is all I can think of and would probably try if it were mine Steve.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

 do I do know?&nbsp; Do I send my device back or wait for the USB cord.? What are the steps to be taken if I need to return my device and how long will it take and the cost involve?<br />

            <p>Hi KawaiolaSniffen -Brown,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your forum contribution!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest to wait until the cord is there and if your issue with the error 5 is still persistent with the new cord, send your device in.
</p>
<p>Please have a look at the following link:</p>
<p><a href="https://service.zune.net/en-us/Pages/Welcome.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://service.zune.net/en-us/Pages/Welcome.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the Zune Service page you have to register your device first, if you haven't already done it. Then you start a repair request to send in your device for repair. When you follow the instructions, you will find out the costs for your request at the end
 before you finish it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know, if you have any further questions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind Regards, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Svenja J.</p>

<p>It isn't possible in a comboBox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can be done with a Microsoft Forms 2 Frame (From More Controls)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would need to play with the properties as a minimum adding a scroll bar vertical and changing the scroll height.</p>

            I suspect you want to be able to make the font larger to view events. Sorry, but Microsoft has given up almost no options to adjust size for fonts. You only get small, medium, large for lists. This does nothing for calendar events.<br />
<br />
Preferences &gt; Fonts<br />
<br />
If this is a feature that you consider useful, be sure to let Microsoft know by sending them feedback (via the Send Feedback command in Outlook’s Help menu)<br />

    <title>Receiving HUNDRED&#39;s of Junk Mail Items - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Receiving HUNDRED&#39;s of Junk Mail Items</h2>
                    <p>Is anyone else being "harassed" with junk mail in their outlook email accounts?. I'm now receiving on average a hundred per day.&nbsp; When I try and block I get the message "the email address or domain name you entered is not valid. Valid entries include *** Email address is removed for privacy ***".&nbsp;
 So I go through the process of deleting them and then when I empty my trash I get the following message "Anna/Katrina/Flipcoin ect requested a notification be sent when message ........ is deleted. Do you want to send receipt?". &nbsp; Obviously I say No to All.&nbsp;
 Is Microsoft doing anything about these messages getting through to their customers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankyou</p>

            Lucky me, woke this morning to 257 JUNK MAIL items.&nbsp; Unfortunately I have to SCROLL through them all because even though I have said to never block a particular domain name and email address, they continue to go into my junk folder along with the real
 JUNK.&nbsp; This is becoming a very frustrating 10-15minute job every morning.&nbsp; Is outlook going to have some program that will automatically delete this type of mail.

</p><p>I hope they come back with something helpful - you're not alone though! I've had my account for 17 ish years and I am thinking of retiring it as it's getting that bad.</p>

<br />
That web page includes the section "The YTM and YTC Between Coupon Payment Dates", which demonstrates the use of YIELD.<br />

<br />
No, I do not believe that web page describes the math.<br />
<br />
As I explained before, according to Excel Help, YIELD uses the PRICE formula to solve for "yld" using the "Newton" method (aka Newton-Raphson method). [1]<br />
<br />
And as I explained before, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
Alternatively, note that the yield to maturity is the IRR of the cash flows.<br />
<br />
So we might use the Excel RATE, IRR or XIRR function to convince ourselves that the YIELD function is returning the correct value.<br />
<br />
Here is how....<br />
<br />
Yatie wrote previously:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Face value - 100<br />
Price - 103.05<br />

Excel calculation for yield show: 3.426%<br />
(using YIELD(settlement,maturity,rate,pr,redemption,frequency,basis)</p>

<br />
When you ask a question about Excel usage, it is important to show us how you are using Excel -- the
<br />
You neglect to tell us the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">actual</span> settlement and maturity dates that you used, as well as the
<br />
5.8 years is an odd number of "years to maturity".&nbsp; 0.8 years is about 41 weeks and 4<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">.2</span> days(!). [2]<br />
<br />
I will assume you mean 5 years 41 weeks, since then the result from YIELD is closest to 3.426%.&nbsp; Also, I will assume a 30/360 basis.<br />
<br />
With those assumptions, YIELD results in about 3.4259%.&nbsp; My set-up is as follows:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fpublic.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1p3LP00Eki0JzhJS9iBVX2vLE7OvmKB_n_d2-YiW9eA6QdyxmlA3Yl29bhjwaOaWg5WbWt7_VCXavjK3wOxkeQ3w%2fyield%2520tutu.JPG%3fpsid%3d1" /><br />
<br />
B2 contains the formula =EDATE(B1,5*12)+41*7.<br />
<br />
C2 contains the formula =YIELD(B1,B2,B3,B4,B5,B6,0).<br />
<br />
The cash flows are set up in E1:E13 (dates) and F1:F13 (amounts).<br />
<br />
</span><span style="font-style: italic">The formula in E14 is =EDATE(E12,6), the next coupon date after the redemption date.&nbsp;
</span><span style="font-style: italic">The formula in F2:F12 is<br />
=100 * $B$3 / $B$6.&nbsp; The formula in F13 is</span> <span style="font-style: italic">
=B5 + 100*B3/B6*(E13-E12)/(E14-E12).</span><br />
<br />
G1 contains the formula =XIRR(F1:F13,E1:E13).<br />
<br />
Note that the XIRR result is significantly different:&nbsp; 3.4544% instead of 3.4259%.<br />
<br />
In part, that is because XIRR assumes compounded interest, whereas semiannual coupons are computed using simple interest.&nbsp; That is, the annual rate is divided by 2.<br />
<br />
H1 attempts to adjust for that with the formula =2*(SQRT(1+G1)-1).<br />
<br />
Note that the result is "close":&nbsp; 3.4251% instead of 3.4259%.&nbsp; There are many possible reasons for the difference.&nbsp;&nbsp; But hopefully that is close enough to demonstrate the math and "prove" the YIELD result.<br />
<br />
<br />
-----<br />
[1] When I used the PRICE formula to detemine "yld" using Solver, I got a very different result.&nbsp; At this point, it is unclear whether I made a mistake or that is not the correct formula or both.&nbsp; But I am very suspicious of the formula in the PRICE, as it
 is described.<br />
<br />
<br />
[2] [EDIT] Arguably, 0.8 years is 41 weeks and 5 or 5<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">.2</span> days.&nbsp; I rely on the US Truth in Lending law, which specifies that a year consists of 52 weeks, not 365/7 or 365.25/7.&nbsp; But I cannot say with impunity that
 that law applies to US bonds, much less to whatever bonds Yatie is talking about.<br />

<h2>            Print titles&#62;Rows to Repeat at top - Not working</h2>
                    
<p><span>I'm using&nbsp;Excel 2010 in Office Pro Plus.&nbsp; I am a long time&nbsp;Excel user with intermediate+ skills, and very comfortable using the "Print titles&gt;Rows to Repeat at top" command -&nbsp;but
 this spreadsheet has me baffled.</span></p>
<p><span>I am trying to select the top row(s) to repeat (print)&nbsp;on a single tab, two page worksheet.&nbsp; The selection process works fine, but the top row doesn't show on the second page in
 Print Preview, or on hard copy.&nbsp; When I re-enter "PT&gt;R2R@T", all settings show as desired - just not getting the<em>results</em>&nbsp;desired!</span></p>
<p><span>At first, I thought it might be because I was trying to select rows containing cells that were merged horizontally as well as vertically (a 4x5 cell "box").&nbsp; Because of the merged
 cells, selecting rows 1-2 actually selected an area equivalent to rows 1-5.&nbsp; I tried selecting both just row 1 (horizontal, but no vertical merged cells) rows 1-2 (contains the v&amp;h merged "box"),&nbsp;rows 1-5, and rows 1-7, (thinking I would get above &amp; below
 the "box") -all&nbsp;with the same disappointing results.</span></p>
<p><span>I also tried inserting a new row 1 at the top, with no merged cells or formatting, typed TEST in cell A!, and selected&nbsp;only row 1 as my "PT&gt;R2R@T"&nbsp;- still no titles on the 2nd page.&nbsp;
 I also cleared&nbsp;the print area, thinking that might have been a problem.</span></p>
<p><span>I don't think&nbsp;these would be&nbsp;contributing issues, but the spreadsheet is one page tall, by two pages wide.&nbsp; I also have two "lookup" tables, one of which is split when printing.</span></p>
<p><span>Suggestions?</span></p>

            I am hoping to solve this as well.&nbsp; Very frustrating, Office Pro 2010 new from the box, less than 2 weeks old, I cannot find a fix.&nbsp; Help, Microsoft?

            If you only say I have the issue it is not going to help, you need to provide clear information to help you.<br />
Is the file saved on a network?<br />
Did you try repair the file and then try to work with the file?<br />

            Hi Hunter, not saved on a network, just my hard-drive.&nbsp; I have not repaired the file, I would not have guessed I needed to repair anything.&nbsp; When you say repair, are you mentioning to repair just the workbook file (all of my files do not let me repeat
 rows at the top), or is this a known issue w/ Excel, and this is a fix that will fix all of my files, and Excel itself.&nbsp; In my issue, the section to be able to select any features under Page Setup - Sheet - I am unable to select Print Area, or Print Titles.&nbsp;
 I am just wondering if there is a larger issue w/ Excel?&nbsp; In any case, I appreciate your time.&nbsp; Tim
