<p>I have been having the same problems as here:<br />

<br />
<br />
and dozens of other places on the internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had my Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit 4GB RAM SSD since late 2009, and it is for the most part worthless to me. A couple of thousand dollar plus unit, absolutely ineffective for my work. It has caused a complete cessation to my productivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the Intel(R) ICH9 Family USB Universal Host Controller, not the Nvidia addressed elsewhere.</p>
<p>I have never been able to transfer large files (video vob for example), without every single one of my external hard drives freezing up. If I can get them to complete the transfer at all, it takes hours. It doesn't matter if it's USB, Firewire, eSATA, Seagate
 drives, WD drives, it just doesn't matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried every single conceivable possible fix for MONTHS, and am giving up and going with a Mac if somebody doesn't address this. I've seem class action suits being discussed as this is so rampant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are not inexperienced hacks I'm reading post after post after post after post from, including myself (studio engineer/electronic degree'd, etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way I've been able to barely hang on this long is by using my old XP machine, where everything works as it should. That won't be happening much longer as the processor is failing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will then have no choice but to go Mac.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why in the world is this not seriously being addressed???&nbsp; I have been reading these intelligently described posts for over half a year?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP US!!!!</p>

<p>Not sure how relevent, but FWIW;</p>
<p>Win7 Pro 64 bit, 4gb, AMD790X chipset. As an experiment I transfered a 41.3gb file to an internal, it took 17 mins. I dont have sufficient space on my external&nbsp;usb connected ide drive, for this size, but I did transfer 3.5gb with no problem. I often transfer
 2gb or so to a usb stick without problem. I've also transfered 4gb over my network without issues. Transfers have been done via simple copy/paste or using a backup/copy program.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>thread originator here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>One of the problems I've read over and over is that there is no real commonality to this. So many different Windows 7 set-ups, most with 64-bit; some 32-bit. Here's another pertinent thread:</span></p>
<span>Windows 7 not reading external hard drive</span>
<p><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7hardware/thread/630f7c23-3dff-4df3-8557-d7897e42549d</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>They are all over this forum and all over the internet. I have replaced every single driver, chipset, bios, setting, pairs of underwear, you name it, I have tried it, over and over for many months, including again this weekend.</span></p>
<p><span>I didn't include this info above, but my laptop is a Dell Precision M4400.</span></p>
<p><span>I have set up dozens of Mac's and Window's systems......I ran four media studios and a computer assisted learning lab in a college for years. I HAVE NEVER ran across a problem that couldn't be figured out, especially in NINE months, the length of time
 I've had this uselessness. But, but, there are people with these systems who have never had these problems....people I know with Sony's, etc., that have no idea what this is all about.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>What kind of quality control was done on this?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I am halfway through designing my most likely soon-to-be new Mac, barring some actual responsibility exhibited. Any lawyers out there reading this interested in a class action suit, stay tuned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Pathetic; ridiculous</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Oh, what the ____...here's my set-up:</span></p>

<p>Since some peoples, as you say have no problems, then it would appear that any such problem was system/hardware specific, and not thus a general win7 issue.</p>
<p>Did you try; msconfig, hide all MS services, disable the rest, then in Start Up, disable all, then reboot and accept the warning, then try a transfer?</p>

<p>Palcouk,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted to run through every available driver update, every external drive interface transfer (I have four external drives), etc., in a logical manner chronicling every combination, change, performance specs, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have spent around 30 hours since your post doing this (and too many hours to even begin to count in the months prior). Starting with Dell updates and moving on to Seagate and Western Digital drive updates, to Windows 7 Device Manager -&gt; Update Driver,
 etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have installed, uninstalled, tested, retested, changed settings, retested, documented transfer speeds, transferred file after file, on four different drives, to each drive, from each drive, with each interface each drive supports (USB, Firewire, eSATA),
 over and over. Chip sets/drivers/controller etc., etc., etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did as you suggested (I had already done this weeks ago, but wanted to do it again to cover all bases, again): msconfig -&gt; hide all MS services -&gt; disable the rest -&gt; rebooted -&gt; accepted the warning -&gt; and transferred via each interface to and from all
 all four drives. This constituted 12 sets of data. eSATA transferred at greater than 100 MB/S both to and from the two WD drives (the two Seagate drives do not support eSATA), just as it had done before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>USB transferred from all four drives at greater than 25 MB/S, transferring to each drive was more difficult to determine, as it would start out around 130 MB/S, and then experience write bursts eventually settling at around 25 MB/S. The length of time was
 somewhat slower that the time it took to transfer from the drive, but was in the same range.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Firewire transfers would not work. They would start on all four hard drives, then stop, occasionally starting again, but if they were going to complete, it would take hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of these test results were exactly the same as they were before I hid all MS services, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then changed the msconfig settings back as they were and ran all tests again. I had the same results as with the MS services off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>****From this point on I will address ONLY the IEEE 1394 Firewire issue as it is the most troublesome issue****</p>
<p>I then went to my Device Manager -&gt; Update Driver ("Search automatically for updated driver software") for every device and controller, etc. Every single attempt resulted in this: "The best driver software for your device is already installed"/"Windows has
 determined the driver software for your device is up to date".</p>
<p>This includes the IEEE 1394 Bus host controllers.</p>
<p>Now, at some point during this 30 hour testing period, scanning multiple forums (including many, many social.answers.microsoft.com threads &amp; many sevenforums.com forums and several other technical forum sites dedicated to Windows 7 problems), one forum thread
 (and I cannot recall which one, unfortunately) addressed a similar issue, though not this specific issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It recommended going to the&nbsp; Device Manager -&gt; IEEE 1394 Bus host controller -&gt; Update Driver -&gt; Browse My Computer For Driver Software -&gt; Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer (the Ricoh 1394 OHCI Compliant Host Controller was my current
 controller) -&gt; Select a different device driver (specific to this other issue in the thread I am referring to above).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, I didn't see that I had anything to lose by trying a different driver than the one that the Windows 7 Device Manager already said was "The best driver software for your device is already installed"/"Windows has determined the driver software
 for your device is up to date". The one that the Windows 7 Device Manager said was the best up to date driver already did not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, on a whim, I selected the 1394 OHCI Compliant Host Controller (Legacy).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then reran all the tests via the Firewire interface, and all 4 drives, both Western Digital MY Book models and both Seagate ST 3 models all resulted in successful&nbsp; transfers at over 35 MB/S from the drives to my Dell M4400, and similar speeds to the external
 drives from my computer (though they exhibited similar bursts as they did via USB, but still functioned properly for the most part).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONCLUSION:</p>
<p>For the most part, I now have a functioning system relatively capable of performing the work loads it was (should have been) designed for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It took an unacceptably ridiculous amount of time for me, the customer, to tune it to the point to where it functions as it should have out of the box, or at the least, with a minimum of adjustment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result of my tests and reading all the forums on these external hard drive transfer problems with large files, there does not appear to be a checklist of settings and/or adjustments to go down in a logical sequence. A lot of it seems to be random, with
 certain required settings and results dependent upon other changed settings, and not in a repeatable manner of fashion. I have not seen anything such as a logical approach to this on any Microsoft related site, or in any of the responses by the tech support
 in any of these forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, and to that point, when attempting to update drivers in the Device Manager, the message "The best driver software for your device is already installed"/"Windows has determined the driver software for your device is up to date" comes up time and time
 again, when that clearly is not the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No customer should be expected to have to do this kind of research, put in these kind of man hours, and eventually stumble upon the right combination of settings just in order to make a several thousand dollar investment perform to spec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An even more frightening prospect of this is that there are going to be even more and more combinations of settings and devices to deal with as time goes on, and that points to this problem becoming bigger and bigger as future generations of the newer OS's
 are produced, unless and until Microsoft addresses these issuse at the level at which they should be addressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And perhaps this is not entirely a Windows 7 issue, but it is at the very least an indirect result of Windows 7 issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to all the people who have contributed a little information here and there on all the different forums in regards to these issues, and to those who have not yet been able to bring your system up to speed, I wish you the best of luck.</p>

<p>I have had the some problem ever since I switched from vista to Windows 7 x64. I have come to the conclusion that it is a windows based problem, I have some files that are 10 to 12gb.</p>
<p>They all freeze, thus every time I want to transfer a large file from my external hard drive I have learned that putting it in SAFE MODE will allow me to do whatever file transferring I</p>
<p>want. I just did a fresh install of windows 7 just to be sure, tried to transfer a 2.14gb file and encountered the mysterious freezing??? I Reset the system started in SAFE MODE, then&nbsp;</p>
<p>the transfer went fine. There was nothing running except the Microsoft OS that's it!!! It is a pain in the ____ but every big file transfer just switch to SAFE MODE. I will continue to look&nbsp;</p>
<p>for a better solution,&nbsp; until then good luck with this fussy OS.</p>

<p>Thanks for this. 1394 OHCI Compliant Host Controller (Legacy) worked on my machine - Dell Precision 690.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some additional information for all of you struggling with this. I was running XP on this system and then upgraded to W7 64 bit. I also have an eSATA dock that I can put raw drives in -- works well. Right after installing W7 I started consolidating files
 to the 2TB drives in the eSATA dock. Transfers were going along just fine. I had the system set to auto install updates from MS. Yesterday, after the install things went south with the file transfers. Basically I started having the same problem that everyone
 else has talked about in multiple forums. Since the updates totaled about 1200 items, there is no way that I'm going to go back through them to see which one has caused the issues. Suffice to say, from my POV, it is an MS W7 issue. One of the updates they
 sent has caused a conflict with the IO on people's machines.</p>
<p>Now off to see if I can get the external USB drives to work again.</p>

<div>am using a dell inspiron 537mt, completely u pdated and bios flashed to latest version. initially, my WD external drive (1tb mybook essential) worked great. i dont recall updating anything... however i was doing some work and swapping around external drives.
 once i had finished, plugged my wd drive back in, transfers would burst to about 130mbps, then would scale down to around 20mbps then freeze. i would get error messages on my browser that would say 'waiting for cache'. once i unplugged the drive, everything
 would pick back up and resume normal operation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>after about half a night of searching around, i was messing with the user privileges on the drive, discovered that my account name was missing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>so, i added myself to the list with full read/write permissions and what do you know, everything works again. not sure if my account was deleted off that drive somehow, but readding it to the permission list with full read/write seems to have done the
 trick.</div>

            My old Simpletech 1TB external HD (WD internal) over ESATA never gave me problems in WinXP. Once I upgraded to Win7 Pro, the drive would freeze when copying (either to or from it) large files (&gt;10GB for me) and then "disappear" from explorer. Funny thing
 is, it would not happen while in Win7 under a Ubuntu virtual machine (VMWare).
<div><br />
<div>Anyway I did the privilege "refresh" as you stated and the problem is gone.</div>
<div><br />
<div>DEFINITELY a Windows 7 issue.</div>

            Sorry to revive an old, dead thread. Did anybody try an alternative to windows cut/paste/copy functions? There are more robust command line operations you can use (eg robocopy) and also third party alternatives like supercopier. I have had the aforementioned
 problem and resolved it by using these methods. I am running w7 64bit, 890fxa-gd70 mobo, 8gb ddr3 ram, phenom II x4 970, 1tb wd black.<br />

<h2>            Alienware gets slow performance after sleep mode</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Alienware 15R2 with a Core i7 of 2.6GHZ (6th Generation) and 16GB DDR4 of Ram memory, also an envidia GTX 970 of 3GB DDR5... Everytime i put my laptop to sleep and right after i turn it on,&nbsp; the system gets sluggish, especially while moving between
 cells in excel and typing on the search bar of google chrome or explorer, its more evident when i'm trying to erase a text with the back space button pressed, it get very slow... The problem got solved once I restar, turn off and on, or hibernate the machine...
 However its boring that every time that my laptops gets on sleep mode, i have to restart it... All comments will be very appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Shutdown itself abruptly&#47; parallel port driver failed to start....</h2>
                    <p>Gentlemen/ Ladies</p>
<p>
</p><p>Needs a little help here, my computer windows shutdown itself abruptly. EventViewer stated that : the parallel port driver services failed to start due to either because it is disabled or it has no enabled devices associated with it...Service Control Manager...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was no blue screen of death, just simply shut down abruptly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran the sfc /scannow and found corrupted windows files and thankgod was able to repair successfully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a lots of trouble shooting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. put new thermal paste between heat sink and intel chip/ graphic cards, currently temp is around 40C</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. chkdsk for over 3 hours, came back no hardware error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. memory diagnostic test also ok.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. used malwarebytes &amp; anti-rootkit, scanned in safe mode, turns out clean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I was able to use sfc scannow to repair, but seems to me it does NOT solve the root of the problem, which I am trying to.....WindowsRestore seems can't address the origin of the problem either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not have any new stuff,...nor installed any new software lately....</p>
<p>
</p><p>here are my computer spec:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Vista Ultimate 32 bits</p>
<p>4 GB RAM/ 350 GB 2 SSD Harddrives with Intel RAID, chip: intel 2.6 Ghz,&nbsp;</p>
<p>1900 x 1200 blu-ray screen, Nvida graphics card</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be appreciated, thanks</p>

            <p>A parallel port is a outdated port,it was used for printers,10 yrs ago...Now,USB replaced it,&amp; 10X faster.</p>
<p>Heat paste is only used in the processor/heat sink,no other areas should it be installed,the intel/chip</p>
<p>sink rarely gets hot enough,but could be used..Either way,is RAID configured between 2 HDs,or are</p>
<p>you in "RAID" ready mode,the intel software for RAID/HDs is matrix storage mgr,get that from intel.Plus,you need</p>
<p>to set for RAID in the BIOS,advanced chipset,set for enhanced.Also,if a controller is failing (parallel),one might</p>
<p>install a new MB battery,read owners manual...Also,go to intel.com/support/drivers-software,run the intel-update</p>

            <p>Hello Andrew E,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for yr reply, ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I remember those parallel ports, that's why it is so confusing for me....I use USB cable for printer, 10-key number touch pad and for other devices....except the external speakers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the thermal paste, I checked around and watched many youtube videos, graphic card / heat-sink is another area is needed. Anyway, overheating is NOT the reason why it triggers the shut-down, that's for sure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, my laptop is running RAID, already configured, BIOS is also set for RAID already, and checked the matrix menu and no problem from RAID either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you tell me further about the &nbsp;parallel controller and MB battery ? These are not something I know.</p>

<h2>            Xbox not connecting to wifi</h2>
                    It has been 3 months that I haven't been able to connect to xbox live for more than 5 minutes. I use to use the black Microsoft wireless adapter but that stopped working so I bought a new netgear adapter it worked for a day and stopped. To test the Microsoft
 adapter I went to my friends house and used it on his Xbox and it worked. When plugging the netgear adapter into my computer it worked too. I have about ten other devices that can easily connect to the Internet but my Xbox won't. There is nothing in my routers
 block list so I am completely stumped. I even tried using my friends xbox slim in my house and the wifi worked. Could my Xbox be broken, I have tried everything I could think of

<p>Hello ZOMBIE SQUIRELS,</p>
<p>I Hope This Helps!</p>

What is required to connect to Xbox LIVE using a wireless connection?
<div>
<p>A wireless network connection lets you connect your Xbox 360 console to Xbox LIVE without using network cables. This allows you the freedom to move your console further away from your network hardware (your router, gateway, or modem).</p>
<div>
<p>Here is what you need:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>A high-speed Internet connection such as cable or DSL<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;Satellite and 3G or 4G mobile connections are not recommended because you are likely to experience slow performance or lag.
</li></ul>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li>A router, gateway, or wireless access point </li><li>An Xbox 360 Wireless Networking Adapter (original Xbox 360 console only) </li></ul>
<div>
Connect a wireless adapter (original Xbox 360 console only)
<div>
<p>If you have an original Xbox 360 console, you need to add an Xbox 360 Wireless Networking Adapter to your console.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;If you have an Xbox 360 S console (which has built-in Wi-Fi), skip to the next section.</p>
<p><strong>Connect the wireless networking adapter:</strong></p>

<h2>            Backup of Win 7&#58; I don&#39;t want to create a system image every time</h2>
                    <p>I back up my computer almost every day, and it takes a long time (45 minutes or so), creating a system image each time. I should think it would be unnecessary to create the system image every time, and it just slows things down. The Windows "help" screens
 from the Backup and Restore menu say you can choose which files to back up and whether to create a system image, but they don't say how to do that, and I can't find it.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>Thanks, Frederik! Worked like a charm. I got discouraged when the Change Settings screens went to &gt; "Select where you want to store your backup," and didn't realize there was more to come if I pressed "continue"!</p>

<h2>            Mouse cursor sticks on edge between monitors</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so I have a multi monitor setup for my pc, and when I try to move my mouse cursor between monitors 1 and 2 it sticks if I don't have enough momentum. It does not happen on any of the other "borders", only between 1 and 2. This is driving me utterly
 crazy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to stop this? Why is it only happening on one of the four borders I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For info all monitors are ran at 100% scaling and resolution is 2560x1440, and monitor 3 is my main monitor.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There can be few reasons why you encounter this issue. To be able to isolate concern, try to do a power cycle on all of the monitors, and see if the issue persists. If so, we suggest that you check if there is a release of updates for your display and mouse
 drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

<p><span>Hi nickyt232,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 installing Windows vista sp2 using the windows update?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you have any security software installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The error 0x800<strong>7</strong>3712 may issue may occur if the Component-Based Servicing (CBS) manifest is corrupted.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You will need to perform repair installation of Windows vista using the installation disk.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>An In-Place upgrade is actually a repair installation using the upgrade option. If you have installed Service Pack 1 for Windows
 Vista and your original Windows Vista DVD does not include this Service Pack, then the Upgrade option will be disabled, thus preventing you from doing an in place upgrade. The reason for this is that, by installing Service Pack 1 your system is, in effect,
 newer than that of your original Vista DVD (the only exception to this is if you have a slipstreamed copy of Windows Vista including Service pack 1).</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore, if your original Windows Vista DVD does not contain Service Pack 1 you will need to Uninstall Service Pack 1 from
 your PC prior to attempting the upgrade.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong>: &nbsp;After performing In-Place Upgrade, your personal data and installed programs will not be removed but
 we may need to run Windows Update to install all the available updates for your system to update these system files to the current version. This troubleshooting process is time consuming and may take several hours to complete.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>===============================================================</span></p>
<p><span>Please make sure you&nbsp;<strong>Backup</strong> any and all important data before proceeding. Please see:&nbsp;<strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Back-up-your-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Methods
 for backing up your files</a></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Always make sure you have&nbsp;the means&nbsp;to reinstall your programs, either through an install disk or having access to the installation
 files.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>How to perform an in-place Upgrade</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Before you perform an in-place Upgrade follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>1. &nbsp;Disable or uninstall all security software’s on the computer.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove all third party CD and DVD burning software.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Click on Start, in the start search box type appwiz.cpl and press enter.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the left side click on “Turn Windows feature On or Off”.&nbsp;<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncheck the following three components and then click on Ok.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>.Net Framework 3.0</span></li><li><span>Remote Differential Compression</span></li><li><span>Windows DFS Replication Service</span></li></ul>
<p><span>Start the in-place Upgrade.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Steps to perform an in-place upgrade:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Exit all programs before you upgrade to Windows Vista. These programs include browsers and media players.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Insert the Windows Vista DVD into the DVD drive.<br />
3. When the “Install now” screen appears, click on “Install now”.<br />
4. On “Which type of installation do you want?” screen, click Upgrade and follow the instructions to install Windows Vista.<br />
<br />
<strong>Once the upgrade is complete, follow the steps as below.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>1. Click on Start, in the start search box type appwiz.cpl and press enter.&nbsp;<br />
2. On the left side click on “Turn Windows feature On or Off”.&nbsp;<br />
3. Put a check mark against the following three components and then click on Ok.</span></p>
<p><span>.Net Framework 3.0<br />
Remote Differential Compression<br />
Windows DFS Replication Service<br />
<br />
<strong>Warning</strong>:&nbsp;Before you perform an in-place upgrade, you should be prepared for a worst case scenario that results in your existing data on your computer being deleted. This data includes personal data, settings, hardware driver information, and
 software programs. If a worst case scenario occurs, you may have to reinstall all programs. Make sure that you back up personal data to disks or to other external storage devices before you perform an in-place upgrade.</span></p>

<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968279" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968279</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After the repair installation is completed use the below link to download the standalone package of Windows vista sp2 and install it after disabling
 the security software available on the computer. </span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=a4dd31d5-f907-4406-9012-a5c3199ea2b3&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=a4dd31d5-f907-4406-9012-a5c3199ea2b3&amp;displaylang=en</span></a></span></p>

<h2>            Slow login and unlock when not on domain</h2>
                    My Toshiba R830 with a corporate domain connected build of Windows 7 x64 has a long delay when
<span>
<span>
i</span> try to login on startup or <span>
wakeup</span>. This behavior&nbsp;only happens when connected to a network that is not my works.
<div><br />
<div>Doesn't happen when:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Connected to the corporate LAN or Wifi</li><li>No Wifi or LAN is available or switched on</li></ul>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Happens when:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Wifi and/or Lan is connected to a network that is not a corporate one.</li></ul>
<div><br />
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>The newer Toshiba's stupidly don't have a hardware wifi switch so i can't simply switch it off before i start it or wake it. The Techs just shrug and say that it can't be solved with our builds (!).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It an anoyance, especially with the wake up thing. I do have local admin rights so if anybody knows of any group policy settings i could fiddle with, im all ears?</div>

<h2>            Log-in is Blocked</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, several months ago my xbox live account was hacked into.&nbsp; The subject proceeded to buy around $100 in microsoft points and spent them all. I noticed one day while I was at work, and decided to log in from my phone - it showed that I was last online 2
 minutes ago at the time, playing a game I did not own.&nbsp; I immediately contacted customer support via phone and they told me they would start an investigation and freeze my account so the hacker would no longer have access.</p>
<p>Several weeks later I received an email that stated that the investigation showed no signs of wrong doing and my account was open again.&nbsp; Suffice to say I was upset that I would be getting no refund, but at least my account would be open.&nbsp; When I tried to
 log in on the website it said my account was blocked, as well as on my console.&nbsp; I proceeded to contact customer support via phone two additonal times.&nbsp; The first time they called the escalation department and told me my account was now open.&nbsp; After this call
 I attempted to log on and the same blocked account error came up.&nbsp; I called back again, and the representative told me that everything was ok on "their end" and told me to reset my password.&nbsp; I did several times, which did nothing to remedy the situation.&nbsp;
 I was told that the escalation department would be contacted and was promptly disconnected.&nbsp; I have not heard back since and it has been weeks.</p>
<p>At this point, I would just be happy to have some form of access to my account so I could at the very least cancel.&nbsp; I am tired of paying for a service that I have no access too and no means to cancel.&nbsp; I am becoming very distrought that no one has helped
 me despite my efforts in contacting xbox support.</p>
<p>I'm running out of places to turn too, and work a night shift, so I hardly have time or are awake to call again :( Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><span>1) You can not be 'hacked' over XBL. Please take a moment to read and practice
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-us/pages/xbox-live/how-to/account-security.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Account Security for XBL</a>. Just an FYI, you should be using an e-mail account just for your XBL account that you do not use for any other service or website.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2) As mentioned above, have you tried recovering the account since the support ordeal? If not I would suggest you try that.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>3) You say their investigation showed no signs of wrong doing. Do you have anyone else living in your household that had access to your console and account?

<p>I did not give out my password or share any of my information. &nbsp;Like I said, the last I was able to log on, someone had been playing a game that I do not own.</p>

    <title>3DBuilder Supports generated by slicer are too sturdy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darrenrstarr  say:</h3>
<h2>            3DBuilder Supports generated by slicer are too sturdy</h2>
                    <p>I just printed a cable manager for my rack which I designed. It's basically a cage of 4mm diameter pipes connected to a mounting plate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To accomplished the spacing which I wanted, I enabled raft and supports. But when the 3d print was finished, while the rafts and small supports extruding from the rafts where fine, the supports generated elsewhere were simply too solid. I almost couldn't
 remove them without destroying the piece I wanted.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi kbrowndorf,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>IBM 4019 Laser printer is only compatible with windows 3.0, 3.1, 95, 98. I would suggest you to try to install the drivers from the disc which might
 have come with the printer in windows 98 compatibility mode. If this does not work, you might have to think to upgrading/purchasing a new printer.</span></span></p>

<p>Are you asking about installing these games on Xbox One?</p>
<p>If what you want is to redownload them on Xbox 360, please follow the advice posted by pyr0lyzer.</p>
<p>If, however, you are wanting to install these games on Xbox One, then unfortunately for the games you mention there is no cross-buy feature and you will need to re-purchase these for the Xbox One.</p>
<p>Sorry this isn't the ideal solution, but I hope this helps.</p>

<h3> microsoftuser_  say:</h3>
<h2>            My computer will not boot up due to corrupted files. Any suggesting on how to fix this&#63;</h2>
                    &nbsp;(I suspect it is from not being shut down properly). So i tried using my Windows 7 upgrade disc to do a clean install, but it won't let me either; it stops half-way and says some files are corrupted and unreadable. So i did some research on the Internet
 and tried using the sfc /scannow in the dos prompt (I can only enter the prompt through the Windows 7 upgrade disc) and i get a return message saying there is an 'installation pending' and needs to restart. I restart and still no boot up.
<br />
<br />
Then i tried using this command in the prompt: sfc /scannow /offbootdir=c:\ /offwindir=c:\windows - but i get a return message saying,&nbsp; "Windows Resource Protection could not start the repair service." I've heard i need to use the correct drives, e.g., substituting
 'c:' for 'd:' but i still get that 'Windows Resource Protection' message. Any suggestion on how i can fix this? Thanks in advanced.<br />
<br />
What if i try uninstalling my anti-virus from the dos prompt? Maybe it is my anti-virus that is causing the 'Windows Resource protection' message? Or perhaps I am using incorrect letters for the drive location?<br />

            I tried installing Windows 7 using the Custom Install and it ran an incomplete installation, then i tried formatting the hard drive using the Windows 7 disc as a boot up and it also seemed to run an incomplete format. Then i tried installing Windows 7
 again using custom and this time it does not detect a drive to install windows (It says there is no media). So i guess my hard drive is broken; or maybe I broke it... well thank you all for your assistance, I really appreciate all your feedback.<br />

<h2>            certmgr.msc add certificate for all users on a single machine</h2>
                    <p>I have a certificate for a website and I can only install it using local admin, (to the local admin account) ie: Only local admin can go straight to the site as the certificate is installed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are another 5 users that use the same machine and I'd rather they did not install the certificate themselves due to "user" issues.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way of installing the certificate, either through certmgr.msc or another method, to ensure ALL users can go to this site without having to install a certificate?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do the other 5 users use standard accounts?</span></p>
<p><span>If yes, then you will not be able to install the certificate on it. Instead, you may have to use your administrator privilege
 to install the certificate individually on each user account.</span></p>

<h2>            Computer starts but nothing is displayed on monitor.&#40;No error beeps&#41;</h2>
                    I recently installed Windows 7 on a desktop that I had Windows XP originally installed on. &nbsp;I validated windows key and started installing programs. &nbsp;After downloading and installing an anti virus and all windows upgrades I hooked up remote desktop and
 used my laptop to remote in to my desktop. &nbsp;30 minutes after using remote desktop the connection was lost and my computer stopped working. &nbsp;It seems to turn on okay but there is no output to the monitor and there is no beeps during boot. &nbsp;I was thinking that
 the BIOS may need to be flashed but I can not access the CMOS to do so.

            The problem with my computer having no video output at all was solved. &nbsp;I tried 2 different video cards, 2 different monitors and even tried reseating the processor to make sure it wasn't overheated so then the problem did seem to lie within the BIOS so
 I changed the CMOS battery and still had a problem. &nbsp;I let it sit for a day with the new battery in and it booted up but said there was a BIOS error and let me reboot with last know good configuration. &nbsp;
