<p>Hey there SimoniacFrame!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue. </p>
<p>If I were you, I would start troubleshooting by removing your profile and then redownloading it back to your console from Xbox Live directly as outlined in How to add or remove a Microsoft account on Xbox One.
</p>
<p>When you get a chance give those steps a try and let us know how that went. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading, hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            Windows Vista restart when I download a torrent file</h2>
                    
<p>I use Windows Vista Home Edition 32 bits.</p>
<p>I am&nbsp;trying to dowlnlaod a torrent file, but it causes windows to restart.</p>
<p>I first used Vuze&nbsp;to download the file, but when windows restarted, I uninstalled it and used mTorrent but windows restarted. I later tried to download different torrent&nbsp;files, but windows just restarts.</p>
<p>Opneing Vuze or mTorrent only without the download does not cause windows to restart.</p>

<p><span>Hi Diana</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your response.</span></p>
<p><span>The first thing I did before writing the above was to scan my PC with 3 different anti-virus: malware bytes, trend micro and PC doctor, no infections showed. As for OneCare scan,
 there are so many posts on this blog warning against the&nbsp;damage it causes to the registry.</span></p>
<p><span>When you say Check the same in clean boot, do you mean scan for virus infections after a clean boot? can this be done in the safe mode also?</span></p>

<p>Hi Diana</p>
<p>I am writing to follow up. I downloaded today MS Security Essentials and scanned my PC.</p>
<p>It detected an infection with <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">TrojanDownloader:Java/OpenConnection.EM</span></strong> which seems to be integrated within Java.</p>
<p>Its funny that 4 other top anti-virus softwares did not pick it up.</p>
<p>I know that Vuze uses Java, do you think that&nbsp;is why&nbsp;my PC was rebooting automatically?</p>
<p>Any additional advice about this matter would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Diana</p>
<p>Thanks for responding.</p>
<p>This occured 3 times now since 09/06.</p>
<p>I am not an expert with reading event logs, but&nbsp;all the system windows logs&nbsp;describe them as&nbsp;an "unexpected shutdown".</p>
<p>There is a : <span><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The start type of the Windows Modules Installer service was changed from demand start to auto start</span></em>message showing right after the event.</span>
</p>
<p>It occurs only when&nbsp; downloading and/or installing updates without any&nbsp;error messages before or after.</p>
<p>I have my updates set to auto, so I cannot tell if it happens in clean boot or not.</p>
<p>I have scanned with 3 different anti-virus, nothing was detected.</p>
<p>I am wondering if you could help me having my log files reviewed?</p>

    <title>Having trouble upgrading to windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cordath  say:</h3>
<h2>            Having trouble upgrading to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>So I would like to install windows 10, but I'm having some problems. First of all the windows 10 upgrade icon wasn't appearing in my task bar. I found a fix for that, but when I click on it, a screen pops up and then closes again instantly. I went into windows
 update to see if anything changed there, and yes indeed, there is a button saying my reservation has been confirmed, along with an option to "view confirmation". But again, clicking on it brings up a window that closes instantly, so I have no idea if its just
 saying that or if I really have a spot confirmed.&nbsp; I tried using a method involving downloading windows 10 using command promp, but no luck there either. I tried this method: http://www.cnet.com/how-to/jump-the-line-and-get-windows-10-right-now/&nbsp; but again,
 no luck.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did however read somewhere that you need to have all of your updates for windows 7 installed before being able to upgrade, but here is yet another problem. Ever since I got this copy of windows 7, it has been refusing to install the internet explorer
 11 update. Not sure if that has anything to do with it, but its there. Please help! This is getting rather frustrating.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computers specs are:</p>
<p>Processor: Intel Core i7 5820k</p>
<p>Motherboard: Asus X99-A </p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>As you have already register Windows 10 and have an issue in upgrading to Windows 10. I suggest to download the ISO file and install Windows 10 on your computer.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Where can I download Windows 10?</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can upgrade your current PC to Windows 10 by going to the Windows 10 Software Download page to download the Media Creation Tool. The Media Creation
 Tool can be used to create a USB or DVD media to upgrade your current PC to Windows 10 or install Windows 10 on a different PC.<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the instructions on Windows 10 Software Download page:

<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: When upgrading to Windows 10 from
 media, you must run setup.exe from within your Genuine and Qualified version of Windows 7 or Windows 8. If you want to perform a clean install, you must have upgraded to Windows 10 previously. Performing a clean install of Windows 10 with media without upgrading
 to Windows 10 is not supported and will have activation issues.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Xbox One X Upload speeds</h2>
                    <p>Why cant i get my upload speeds over 2.16mbps? What do I need to do to fix this. I am directly wired into the router. My download speeds are from 600 Mbps to at the lowest 300 Mbps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my computer and cell phone i get Upload of 30 Mbps on wifi on the same router. And it doesn't change for the Xbox One X if its plugged in or WIFI so it has to be an Xbox One issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can some one point me in the right direction.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Music Files not all showing in File Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dickshawjhf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Music Files not all showing in File Explorer</h2>
                    <p>I have recently ripped my CD collection into MP3 format on my PC. Subsequently I have upgraded to Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have noticed that not all files/tracks are shown when opening a Folder (ie CD Album) even though they appear to be present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example Faith Hill CD ripped to MP3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Folder (CD album) 'properties' show&nbsp;THIRTEEN files/tracks to be present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ALL&nbsp;THIRTEEN tracks are recognised and play through Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet when I open the folder only FOUR files/tracks are shown in File Explorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, when I copy the Folder (album) to a USB Flash Drive only the FOUR files appear to be present and playable from the USB drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone explain why the whole album (all 13 tracks) is correctly recognised by Media Player but yet according to File Explorer only 4 files exist even though the Folders Properties acknowledge the presence of all 13 files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should add that this issue MAY have existed before I upgraded to Windows 8 but I have only discovered it since.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for bringing up the issue on Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you’re unable to find all the songs which are on CD in the folder or USB once you copy them.</span></p>
<p><span>However, I would suggest you to follow the methods given below:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Run System Maintenance troubleshooter to diagnose the exact issue.</span></b></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press “Windows key + W”.<br />
b. Type “Troubleshooter” without quotes in the Search box and hit enter.<br />
c. Select “System and Security”.<br />
d. Select “System Maintenance” under System options.<br />
e. Follow the on-screen instructions to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Show hidden folders &amp; files:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps mentioned below:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press “Windows key + C”</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type in Control panel in the search box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click twice on “Folder Options.” The “Folder Options” window will pop up. You will see four tabs. One tab will have the word “General” on it. The second tab will have the word
 “View” on it. The other tab will say “File Types" and the last tab will have the words “Offline Files” on it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on the “View” tab. You will see two subheadings. One will be “Folder views," and the other will be “Advanced settings.”</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Look under “Advanced settings.” You will see several options with boxes or circles for you to check. These options are located in one section entitled "Files and Folders."
 This section has two subsections. One subsection is called "Hidden files and folders" while the other subsection is "Managing pairs of Web pages and folders."</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Look under the “Hidden files and folders” subsection heading. You will see the “Show hidden files and folders” option.</span></p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the “Show hidden files and folders” circle by clicking inside the little circle in front of the “Show hidden files and folders” option.</span></p>
<p><span><span>h.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the “Apply” button at the bottom right side of the “Folder Options” tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>i.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click OK. Close the “Control Panel” window. You will now be able to view your computer's hidden files and folders.<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Give this a go; I’m confident you will find what you need here. But if you face any further issue please reply to
 this post and I'll be happy to assist you further.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for your response. Unfortunately the issue is not resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1 - the Troubleshooter did not identify any problems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2 - I made the changes suggested, but the files are still not displayed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I click on properties for the Folder (&nbsp;ie the CD Album) it shows the folder contains 13 Files with a total folder size of 56Mb, but when I open the folder it only displays 4 of the 13 files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Media Player recognises and plays all 13 files from the folder (album).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should add that the same problem exists across a number of the CD's I have ripped to MP3 ie it's not an isolated incident, but some CD's are correctly displayed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any further ideas ??</p>

            <p>Don't know if this is still of interest for anyone, anyway, I was able to let Windows Update correctly update the driver after i renamed the&nbsp;CIRCoInst.dll file located in c:\windows\system32 folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was the file that windows update wasn't able to... well... update and i tracked that issue via the&nbsp;<span>c:\</span><span>windows</span><span>\inf\setupapi.dev.log file.</span></p>
<p>After I renamed that file to .old, the windows update completed successfully and i am now able to use the remote.</p>
<p>

    <title>My son &#38;amp&#59; I were threatened physically via XBOXLIVE text - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ii x halo x  say:</h3>
<h2>            My son &#38;amp&#59; I were threatened physically via XBOXLIVE text</h2>
                    
<p>I use my son's account because his is a Gold account I pay for, I have a free account but I'm limited so I use his account from time to time when I want to play online. &nbsp;He is 11 years old. I texted a friend of my boyfriend's asking him to relay a msg to
 get in touch w/me to my boyfriend. He responded with threats to me, my son, my home etc. I live in AZ. My boyfriend lives in CA. His friend lives here in AZ &amp; has been to my house, obviously then knows where I live and could follow through on his threats.
 I am sure you can access the messages, it is this account it was done through, II X Halo X, email *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, this is the account I set up for Ashton, my son. I do not like my boyfriend's friend, he is not a nice person but I have never threatened
 or provoked him in any way via xbox or in 'real life' but he has done similar things to this before, and I have filed MANY complaints via XBOXLIVE, where you choose text &amp; communications...text msg or voice msgs or voice chat or in game voice...i've been filing
 complaints that way for months and nothing has happened. HE IS THREATENING ME AND MY FAMILY AND MY HOME PHYSICALLY FOR REAL. It is not okay and I am taking action w/my local police department BUT I feel xboxlive should be accountable as well. He is doing these
 things through YOU. I have filed complaints and seen nothing done. He is not on our friends list, he is on my boyfriend's...there is nothing I can do about that although I have a feeling that will change very soon. I have him blocked from communicating w/us.
 &nbsp;I have him muted...big deal. He can still gain access to our information unless we block everybody from seeing anything and that affects my son's playing ...it isn't fair for his friend's to not be able to see he's online or for him to communicate via text
 or voice or play online JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE TO KEEP EVERYTHING BLOCKED BECAUSE OF ONE PERSON. &nbsp;Access the messages. See the threats. &nbsp;This is my second time this time around trying to get some attention paid to this matter and I am telling you now, if anything
 happens to us and this has not been addressed via YOU, XBOX, XBOXLIVE, WHATEVER WHOEVER then you will have to consider yourselves partially responsible. I am asking for help. I am asking for this to be taken care of. I am asking YOU to do something. Thus far
 I have had extremely nice, friendly, helpful people who have not been able to or have just not done anything. I anxiously await your response. AND...I am unfamiliar w/this process, do I have to check somewhere to see if you've responded or do I get notifications?&nbsp;</p>

<p>My email address is not the same as the one for my son's account. Mine is *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and if there's a way to be notified through that avenue, I'd appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for you immediate attention to this matter. I am a single mom at home w/my 11 year old son &amp; I do not want anything to happen to either one of us. &nbsp;Thank you again.,</p>

<p>Amy Skinner</p>

<p>You can block communications for that specific user if you want. Or limit only messages that you receive from friends alone. Navigate to the person you want blocked profile. under the details there, there is an option to block that person. Feel free to block
 him and correctly setup both your account and your sons account privacy setting. Also for your safety and securty avoid posting your complete email address on public domains. Random people might email you nasty stuff.

<p>Welcome to Xbox live. The Xbox community of gamers is a social network of kids who feel they are entitled to their freedom of expression without fear of repercussions. Unfortunately, there are not many ways to defend yourself against verbal harassment other
 than to change your privacy setting and not to allow others to contact you. </p>
<p>I strongly suggest you monitor what your child plays online as his interactions with gamers in Mature games can get pretty raunchy and ridiculously inappropriate. You can always report people, but by then the damage has been done and your child will have
 heard things that will make your head spin. </p>
<p>Please be careful when allowing your children to play online games. </p>

<p>So I know that you have put you have already blocked communication from this person and filed complaints, that is good. Although once you sent him a message it unblocked him from that so you would have to go in a block him again.</p>
<p>Yes this is a public forum any person with internet access can see this page, only people with accounts can post on it though. And this is a connectivity page so issues with getting connected. Xbox is not any authority figure here; I don’t see what you want
 them to do. Banning is account is the reach of there abilities. That will be done through the complaints it does take a long time for that to happen because there are millions of complaints sent to them probably daily. So if you think about it they can put
 his avatar character in Xbox jail. </p>
<p>So long story short call the police and have them handle your safety. Xbox in Washington State can not help you in any way with this issue. All you can do is set the privacy settings to friends only. Remove him from the friends list, block communications,
 file the complaints and just ignore him. If he is really threatening your life CALL THE COPS. You know who and where he is its there job to protect your safety. I would probably change your emails now and hope your account doesn’t get stolen because every
 one now has the email, name, location and if they really wanted try to find you on facebook and get even more.</p>
<p>As of Microsoft being partially responsible, this is a free speech thing "freedom of expression without fear of repercussions". It is your job as a mother to not allow your 11 year old child to get online and play mature rated games with a bunch of older
 people that hate it when kids get on and talk a bunch of trash. If he was online watching porn would you blame the company that made the computer for letting him on, I don’t think so.</p>

<h2>            Basic Apps &#40;Games, Travel&#41; stuck on &#34;Pending&#34; when trying to update</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I first installed Windows 8 (Pro) it had updates for pretty much every application. Most of them downloaded and installed fine but when it came down to these last two (Games, Travel) they just refuse to download at all and get stuck on pending.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried using wsreset.exe in "Run" to clear the store cache and restarted my laptop also, but this hasn't seemed to help resolve the issue. Any ideas and help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taylor</p>

            <p>2 ways to address this that I've seen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first requires you open a command line with Administrator Priveleges and type in the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>net stop wuauserv</strong></li><li><strong>rename c:\windows\SoftwareDistribution softwaredistribution.old</strong></li><li><strong>net start wuauserv</strong></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second is the open Services.msc and stop the Windows Update service (same as using the commands above, use this if that doesn't work).</p>
<p>At a Run lines, type in <strong>services.msc</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Stop <strong>Windows Update</strong> service</li><li>Browse to&nbsp;<strong>c:\windows\SoftwareDistribution&nbsp;</strong>and rename the folder to<strong>&nbsp;softwaredistribution.old</strong></li><li>Start <strong>Windows Update</strong> service</li></ol>
<p><em>If you have the admin cmd line open, you can use the rename command instead of browsing, but be easier if you're touch only.</em></p>

                    <p>Lately, all my friends are having an issue to join my Minecraft worlds. But I am able to join theirs. This issue has only been currently for at least 2 weeks. I have tried signing out and in Xbox Live and deleting the app and re-downloading it. Unfortunately
 those solutions doesn’t work. I play on my iPad and I have my app updated. My friends play all on different platforms such as Windows 10, Android, Apple, and Xbox. Could someone please help me fix this issue?</p>

            You may want to look at the advanced settings of your worlds and make sure they're not set to private or anything like that. Also make sure they're set to be multiplayer on Live. If you're in the beta you may want to turn off the beta access and revert
 to the more stable version in which case you'd need to delete and reinstall the app again. Sometimes the betas are quirky.

            I have checked my worlds’s multiplayer settings and they all have multiplayer on and allows anyone to join. Also I checked my Xbox Live settings and allows multiplayer. I’m not on beta either, ah. I don’t know why this is suddenly starting to happen to
 me.

<h2>            Unauthorized charges on xbox live.</h2>
                    
<p>We recently had some unauthorized charges on xbox live. I chatted with support and was refunded some charges after the fact that he didnt give me a chance to list all charges. So they only have a one time courtesy refund. I changed my password, added a passkey.
 Well, now it happened again with the security measures but according to Microsoft "they are no hidden charges". &nbsp;FRUSTRATED.. any help as to what i &nbsp;can do, i have already removed my card. Support had said that someone added it back when i was chatting but
 there are no hidden charges!!!!!!!!!! &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Unable to Add Payment Method to Microsoft Store, Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to Add Payment Method to Microsoft Store,  Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently living in Venezuela and my PC's location is set to Venezuela. However, whenever I try to purchase an app from the store it tells me to add a payment method. It opens the "your account" and then "payment &amp; billing"&nbsp;page in the store. When I
 fill in all my credit card details and click on submit, it tells me that the store is unable to add your payment method. The error says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We can't authorize the payment method. Please make sure the information is correct, or use another payment method. If you continue to get this message, please contact your financial institution."</p>
<p>Error Code:</p>
30225-ZVRA9AAAAAAAAAAA-3f92a493-2472-45f6-b091-a7244a6ef103
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Exactly the same thing happens when i try to add a payment method directly from the Microsoft Webpage. The only difference is the Error code is:
</p>
30225-ZVRA9AAAAAAAAAAA-3faab701-9e06-46f6-aabc-0b5a82726e4d
<p>
</p></div>
<p>
</p><p>I have double-checked all my info, it's all correct and I do not have another payment method in Venezuela. At least that i know of.</p>
<p>I've read other threads with this same problem from a few years back, but none seem to have solved it, even after spending hours talking to Microsoft's support team. Does anyone know what i can do to fix this problem? I'd like to buy a few apps and also
 Microsoft's Office trail requests the same payment method and I wont be able to pay for it after the 1month trail is over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance, I hope somone can help me solve this!</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im using credit cards (Dont know how to use Debit card in the store). I've used 2, and both VISA and Master had the same problem. I'll try using a third credit card from someone else and see what happens... If not, then i guess i'll have to talk to Microsoft's
 support. However, from what i've read in other posts they weren't very helpful. I hope I have better luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll keep posting. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the third credit card and had exactly the same error. I talked to someone from Microsoft´s Support with the Live Chat about an hour ago but in spanish, since I posted this same thread in the spanish community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer was that for this specific country (Venezuela), and I guess for anyother country that has the same kind of exchange process and limits with their banks as we do, you have to have CADIVI (the organization in charge of aproving your dolalrs) active
 and your American Dollars availables in your credit card. Since in Venezuela we only get 300 Dollars per year, if you have already used them or dont have CADIVI active, then it's pretty much impossible to buy anything from the Windows Store or the Windows
 Store Website. Even though the prices in the Windows Store are shown in Bolivares Fuertes (Venezuela's Currency), they charge American Dollars to your credit card. So this is why i can't do the transaction.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given this, I also asked if it was possible to use a credit card from another country (lets say a Canadian credit card from a family member) and buy a product from my computer, specifically Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>The answer was that I could try it but that it could be risky, since they didn't guarantee me that once the transaction was made and I got my product, I wouldn't get an error saying that the product bought is only available for another region.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So I would like to verify this information with you</strong>. If my computer has its location settings to Venezuela,
<strong>can I use a credit card from another country?</strong> if this is possible,
<strong>will I get an error with the product key afterwards?</strong> Shouldn't the product key work anywhere since I already have Microsoft office installed (and also with any games or apps I want to buy in the future)?<strong> Is there a way for this to work?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I also asked about Gift Cards, and the guy said that the Gift Card option was not available for latinamerica... So, that's a shame, since it would have been a possible solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, I'm not sure if this is the right place to recommend or give advice to microsoft, but it would be great if they were able to charge in other countries Currency and not only in American Dollars. If you can pass on the advice and complaint to the right
 people, it would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thank you in advance for your next response. Have a good night!</p>

            I have been having exactly the same error and in my case, it was because I was entering the name on the card incorrectly. I was entering:<br />
<br />
Bob P Smith<br />
<br />
when I should have been entering it EXACTLY as it was on the card, ie<br />
<br />
MR BOB P SMITH<br />
<br />
As soon as I entered it EXACTLY as it was on the card, the card was accepted.

            <p>It is a major pain. I simply wanted a copy of Windows 10 for one of our Macs at the office. Chat sales support was useless. Phone support could not understand my American English and I was having to spell every other work I said to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I simply canceled the order. Set up another Microsoft account and ordered from that account with the credit card I wanted to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The card they had on file on my older account I deleted and it still kept defaulting to the number. It was a real pain for such a simple piece of business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has to be the clumsiest software company in the world.</p>

<h2>            How do I get the &#34;Replace and Skip Files&#34; popup Window to always appear on top of all other Windows in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The "Replace and Skip Files" Window appears below the Explorer Window that calls it in Windows 10. It always appeared on top of all other Windows in previous versions. When it does not appear on top, it doesn't look like anything is happening when you copy/move
 files from one folder to another if&nbsp;you don't remember to minimize all Windows (including the Explorer Window&nbsp;you're using to copy/move the files)&nbsp;so you&nbsp;can&nbsp;see the&nbsp;"Replace and Skip Files" Window if it pops up. Please tell me how to make the "Replace and
 Skip Files" Window always appear on top in Windows 10?<br />

            I'll give you 10% credit for your answer. Why?<br />
First off, I specifically said I was using Windows 10. Your instructions for performing the first two methods are for Windows 8.1. Not much good for us Windows 10 users. So I skipped ahead and did the third method. Results:<br />
C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth<br />
No component store corruption detected.<br />
The operation completed successfully.<br />
C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth<br />
The restore operation completed successfully.<br />
The operation completed successfully.<br />
The above didn't help so I found out how to start Windows 10 in Safe mode. That didn't help. So, I found out how to do a clean boot to see if that would make it work. Same result except, by chance, I tried to copy another file to anther folder (after I had
 closed the "Replace and Skip Files" popup Window) only to find the copy file already existed there. But, this time the "Replace and Skip Files" popup Window showed up on top. This implies that any of the things done up to this point made this happen. At any
 rate, I had to reset (Enable) the two Startup Apps I disabled for the Clean Boot and do a restart anyway. So I did that and tried it again. Same result, the "Replace and Skip Files" popup Window didn't show up on top the first time I tried copying a file but
 did after that. So I decided to run the sfc/scannow process. It didn't find any integrity violations. Nor did it fix the problem. I did a restart to see if&nbsp;that would do&nbsp;any good. Same result. So, as it currently stands, it appears the "Replace and Skip Files"
 popup Window will fail to show up on top the first time it's called in a session but will show up on top thereafter - until you restart the computer that is. Thus, you get 10% credit for a partial fix answer.<br />
Thanks, Rob<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
For anyone else who wants to do a Clean Boot in Windows 10, <br />
Open Task Manager (Right click on Task Bar at bottom of screen and select Task Manager)<br />
Select Startup Tab.<br />
Make notes on how you have the Status set for every Application listed. You'll need to to reset them later.<br />
(I press [Print Screen] key and save the picture rather than writing everything down).<br />
Disable every Startup Application.<br />
Now you'll be doing a Clean Boot when you restart your computer.<br />
After you're done, you'll have to do this again to Enable all the Startup Applications you Disabled for the Clean Boot.<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
To Start the computer in Safe Mode:<br />
Press and hold down the [Windows]&nbsp;key&nbsp;while you press the [R] key (brings up the Run Dialog Window)<br />
Type msconfig.exe and Click (OK).<br />
Select the Boot Tab.<br />
Under Boot options Select <br />
[√] Safe boot<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (.) Minimal<br />
Click the [Apply] button.<br />
Click (OK)<br />
It&nbsp;should ask you if you want to Restart the computer when you exit. Answer (Yes) only if you have all your other work saved. If it doesn't ask, do a restart when you are ready.<br />
You will have to repeat this process&nbsp;to turn Safe Mode off&nbsp;(uncheck it) when&nbsp;you're done using it.
<br />
Windows 10 does not automatically revert to a Normal Startup like previous versions of Windows did.<br />

            Hi Bob.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Did you buy a retail Windows 10 package with Key, because most methods don't use a Product Key any longer but use a Digital LIcense, and many retail Product Keys are being onverte to Digital LIcenses in Windows 10?
<br />
<br />What is the Activation Status and Edition showing at the top of the page at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation?  
<br />
<br />Run the Activation Troubleshooter in the same location and report back its findings
<br />
<br />If it uses a Digital License then skip the Product Key during the install.  
<br />
<br />Do the gold standard Clean Install following the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, skip the Product Key screen and choose your licensed version only if offered.  On second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />If you have files that aren't backed up you can use the same bootable media to try to rescue your files using this method:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Bob, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !

<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10

<h2>            Windows Automatically Moving Program Files</h2>
                    I recently installed Windows 10. I did so to a small SDD that I planned on using for nothing more than Windows itself.
<br />
I immediately made sure to edit the registry upon install to set it so that Windows would install to the HDD.
<br />
(The programfilesdir and program files dirx86 at Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion were both changed to their respective folders on the D: drive respectfully). Now whenever I install a program, it tries to install there,
 or at least it will leave a shortcut linking to that drive, though the program will actually be installed onto the C: drive. I can't find any exmaples of other people having this issue and I have no idea what to do. My C: drive only has 120 gbs, and like this,
 it'll be quickly full.

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor, 18 years experienced windows guide. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As, you have made Registry change for Windows to install to the HDD.
<br />(The programfilesdir and program files dirx86 at Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion - both changed to their respective folders on the D: drive respectfully).
<br />
<br />You can move Windows Store apps  also to a separate drive.
<br />
<br />You can set destination folder as mentioned in the refereed website.
<br />
<br />Kindly follow these steps in this site to set installation folder to different drive:
<br /><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-apps-separate-drive-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-apps...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Thank you, Ganesh. I appreciate the help, though the problem I'm having is that the programs I'm trying to install either don't have an option for what directory they're supposed to be installed at and if they do, Windows is moving them forcibly to my
 C: drive. The website here is really only telling me to not click through the installation of a program without checking the install directory, which I try not to do anyway.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            You can move program files to another drive/disk as below: 
<br />
<br />1. Using Registry Editor
<br />
<br />Before you use this method, there are two things you need to do.
<br />
<br />1. Create a folder named Program files (x86) on another drive (eg: D: drive)
<br />
<br />2. Copy "Program Files" and "Program Files (x86)" directories to the new location first.
<br />
<br />Run CMD as administrator and type following command prompt
<br />
<br />Robocopy "C:\Program Files" "D:\Program Files" /mir
<br />Robocopy "C:\Program Files (x86)" "D:\Program Files (x86)" /mir
<br />
<br />Now, continue to see below.
<br />
<br />Step 1: Press “Win + R”to summon the Run window, then type Regedit.exe
<br />
<br />Step 2: Find the following path on Registry Editor and change drive letter from C: to D:
<br />
<br />To Windows 7/8/8.1:
<br />
<br />''HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion''
<br />
<br />Program Files Path
<br />
<br />To Windows 10:
<br />
<br />'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion''
<br />2. Using command prompt
<br />
<br />The second method is to create a symbolic link using Command Prompt. A symbolic link is a bit like the shortcuts to programs, folders and websites which attach to the desktop. When Windows or any program tries to access the folder, the symbolic link redirects it to the new location.
<br />
<br />Step 1: Move “C: \Program Files” fodler to “D: \Program Files”
<br />
<br />Step 2: Type cmd in the search box, click it and run as administrator
<br />
<br />Step 3: Create a symbolic link with mklink. If you do not know how to use it, you can directly type mklink in the command prompt window. You can get some information concerned to create a symbolic link. Then, follow syntax below to create a symbolic link and press Enter finally.
<br />
<br />mklink /D link Target
<br />
<br />Taking create a symbolic link for “D: Program Files” as example, you are supposed to type：
<br />
<br />mklink /D “Program Files” “D: Program Files”
<br />
<br />“Program Files” is the name of your new symbolic link name.
<br />
<br />“D: Program Files” is the path your new link refers to.
<br />
<br />Symbolic Link
<br />
<br />Note: If you have physical disks and want to move program files from SSD to HDD, you need to connect your HDD disk to your computer. Then, your computer will assign a drive letter or more for your hard drive. Finally, you can do as above. Aside by that, there is an easier way to move it from SSD to HDD. You can use disk cloning software to clone entire system drive or hard drive to your HDD.
<br />
<br />Above ways can hep you to move program files to another drive on Windows 10 in a way. However, both ways have its own limitation. For the first way, you may encounter system crash if you misuse Registry Editor. For the second way, there is a risk that users cannot use the programs after moving program files.
<br />
<br />Thus, I think it's essential to make a system backup for your computer. Even if you encounter problems like system crash, you still can restore your computer.

<h2>            Problem with Microsoft Photo Editor</h2>
                    
<p><span>I have thousands of photos on my PC (Vista/IE8) which I've been able to see without problem for years. But suddenly, though I'm still&nbsp;able to import new photos, when I
 try to open them I get the following message: Microsoft Photo Editor - error reading file.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But this seems to apply only to photos, including those I've been able to see in the past, taken on my current camera, a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FS7. Everything else appears
 to be unaffected.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, curiously, I can see the photos in slideshow mode!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I'd be grateful for a solution.</span></p>

            <div>Hi,<br />
<div>1.&nbsp;When exactly do you get this error message?</div>
<div>2. Have you made any changes prior to the issue?<br />
<div><strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong></div>
<div>Try performing SFC scan on the computer.<br />
<div>SFC /scannow is a super-useful command you can use in any Windows version. When the SFC (System File Checker) command is used with the /scannow switch, the tool will scan all of the important Windows files on your computer and replace them as necessary.
<br />
<div>Missing and corrupt operating system files (like many DLL files) are arguably the biggest cause of major Windows issues. Considering that, plus the fact that SFC /scannnow is completely automatic and very easy to use, the tool should usually be one of
 your first troubleshooting steps.<br />
<div>Check the below mentioned link for further guidance on SFC scan –<br />
<div><strong>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>Perform clean boot as some third party program may also cause this issue.<br />
Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.<br />
Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:<br />

</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
<div><strong>Note:</strong> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article</div>

<p>This happened before, but it wasn't important then and now it sorta is so here I am</p>
<p>Anyways, I have some files that are invisible but are still there. I turned on Show hidden files and folders, unchecked Hide extensions, and Hide protected operating system files. The file still didn't show up. I know the file is still there because if I
 re-download the file or re-extract the file from zip or rar to the exact place the file is in, the computer asks me if I want to overwrite the file. Also programs that use the files don't recognize the file is there. I'm on vista and I have an admin profile
 although it's not the first primary admin one. Anyone know whats going on? If you need more info please let me know. Thank you.</p>

<p>Have these been suggested to you .......</p>
<p>1. Have a full virus scan with your AV ( anti-virus ) program.<br />
<br />
2. Do a System File Check :<br />
Start button &gt; search box&nbsp; type&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> cmd</strong>&nbsp; &gt; look up, RIGHT click on<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>cmd.exe</strong></span> &gt; click<strong>Run As Administrator</strong> &gt; in that black and white cmd window, type at the flashing
 prompt&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>&nbsp; &gt; press<strong>ENTER</strong> key.<br />
Note : there is a <strong>Space</strong> between "sfc" and "/".<br />
Sit back and wait. It will take some time.<br />
When done, exit cmd window.<br />
Reboot ( re-start your computer )</p>

<p>I'll let you in for a secret. Neither can I ! ha ha ha.<br />
Suggest that you start a new thread asking for someone to deciphe the cbs log.</p>
<p>However, I asked you to do the sfc scannow for one reason ....&nbsp;to see if it can fix your problem.<br />
So, my question is : can you see the files now ?</p>

<h2>            How to get Virtual PC &#91;re&#93; installed</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Windows 8 Pro installed (German version btw which has a bug that generates the unnecessary capital letters you see in my text). Have two Virtual PC package that I use from time to time: 1 Window XP mode and an old Server 2003 package. The VHD and
 VMC (etc.) files are still there but they appear not associated to any program. And I cannot find Virtual PC in Control Panel - Programs either. So natural thought: I reinstall Virtual PC. After downloading, and untagging the Internet flag on&nbsp;Windows6.1-KB958559-x64-RefreshPkg.msu
 I get the error 0x80096002 "Das Zertifikat für den Signaturgeber für diese Nachricht ist ungültig oder wurde nicht gefunden"&nbsp; (certificate invalid). Have since tried both German and English Version of the package, but the error code and message remain unchange.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any hints on how to repair Virtual PC would be appreciated. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thx &amp; Best Rds</p>
<p>Hubert</p>

            <p>Hello MrProcess,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 8 Pro uses Hyper V as its virtualisation machine. To enable Hyper V see this link from my website:
<a href="http://www.winuser.co.uk/8-1-enabling-hyper-v-in-windows-8.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.winuser.co.uk/8-1-enabling-hyper-v-in-windows-8.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure but this (having hyper V installed) may be the reason why Virtual PC will not install. It is only a guess. I know that, although VMware Workstation will install on Windows 8 it will not run if Hyper V is enabled.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Error Message NETLDR File is Missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mgrant_7912  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Error Message NETLDR File is Missing</h2>
                    <p>Laptop starts (boots) fine manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under auto restart or reboot, e.g. following updates, "NETLDR file is missing" error message is displayed during boot sequence. &nbsp;Then necessary to manually power off and power on the computer to restart. &nbsp;Then restarts fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get it is Windows so definitely use to manually power off, power on as fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I was hopeful there was another solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Home was installed as part of the summer 2016 distro of Windows 10 [had been running Window 7].&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BIOS version/date: &nbsp;03PA.M001.20110312.XW, 3/12/2011</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this hiccup started following one of the updates to Windows 10 as I do not recall it as part of the changeover in OS and all the downloading and restarting that went on to convert to Windows 10 initially.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you with the NETLDR missing error, kindly remove all devices connected to your PC or laptop. (Except mouse and keyboard.)</p>
<p>This issue usually occurs if a bootable device was connected and it has a readable OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After removing all connected devices to your PC or laptop, try to reboot PC and see if it runs smoothly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the outcome. </p>

            <p>John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for not getting back to you.&nbsp; I have been distracted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try what you suggest the next time I have some Windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Powering&nbsp;the computer off and on to reboot or selecting restart does&nbsp;not produced the error.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error has shown up&nbsp;as part of the update process that includes rebooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next time I have updates I will dismount the external hard drive (the only device connected) and see what happens.</p>

<h2>            Programs freeze when Holding a key down. &#34; Saurbraten or the cube 2&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;I'm running aWindows 7 Home premium on a gateway Nv54 series laptop w/ 3 gig ram. also with a Intel 4 series express chipset family w/ 1 gig memory.</p>
<p>I downloaded The game "Saurbraten" and I'm able to access it. However, when i hold in a key, like any key for like a few seconds, the game freezes and i hear a constant beeping. Also when i release the key the game unfreezes. A similar things also happens
 when I&nbsp; type in Microsoft word. When I hold down a key ( like "p") word is able to type the letter and the copies for like one second but then stops and when I release the key then a bunch of copied letters appear. I also hear a pinging noise when I press
 a key and I'm only at the desktop. So i don't think it's a problem with the "Saurbraten" but rather an option that I don't want activated on my keyboard ( Like sticky keys, etc.)</p>

<p><span><span><strong>Hi Camohound,</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>a. Did you come across this issue before?<br />
<br />
b. Except Microsoft and Word and game, does this happen with any other application?</span></p>
<p><span>1. I suggest you to check for the Keyboard settings in Keyboard Properties window.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click on Start, type Keyboard, Keyboard Properties windows will open.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Select the Speed and check for the settings under character type.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. I also suggest you to install the latest drivers for your Keyboard and mouse from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.
</span><span>I also suggest to check settings in Ease of Access Center (keyboard).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Access the below links to know more about Ease of Access Center&nbsp;settings:<br />
