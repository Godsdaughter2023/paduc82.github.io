<h2>            Changing Title of website in Bing and Yahoo Search Engines</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched everywhere for an answer and I am hoping that someone somewhere will be able to help me. I am not an website guru so I created my job's website through godaddy's website builder; which leaves me with no access to the HTML for the webpage.
 I have searched multiple threads, I have contacted godaddy and I have also tried to email someone at bing via an old thread I found on the subject. The owner of this website wants the title changed on these search engines for legal reason's so I am at my wits
 end to try and get this done for them. Does anyone know how I can get my title changed? I did sign up for the webmaster on bing and I verified my website as well.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Question on mail merge to email with attachments macro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jordan fox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question on mail merge to email with attachments macro</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I'm working on getting the Mail Merge to Email - With Attachments macro working and I have my excel data source ready for both main documents, and the main document for the body of the mail message ready. I'm finishing up the main document for the email
 addresses and I'm puzzled.</p>
<p>When I finish the merge I get a table that has the emails, but for every record that woudl have been a repeat email, there's a blank spot. Will this work? I had thought I needed a table with the same # of rows as the # of pages in the body email; ie - each
 row has a new email.</p>
<p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jordan Fox</p>
<p><a href="http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/MailMerge/MergeWithAttachments.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/MailMerge/MergeWithAttachments.htm</a></p>
<p>"Which if you have set it up correctly will produce a document containing a table similar to the following with as many rows as there are records in the data source"</p>
<p>There are as many rows as there are records in the data source (all the blank rows), but the main document with the body of the emails doesn't have this many pages. Is there a conflict when running the macro?</p>

<p><span>and also the Merging with Attachments document that is also on that page which explains how the system is used.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is not actually necessary to have separate attachments as the facility can be used to send just the documents created by the merge itself as attachements, either in the form of Word files or .pdf files.</span></p>
<p>It is a much simpler method of doing it.</p>

<p>Hi JoanD'Entremont,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One possible reason why you're experiencing this issue is that your Gmail account you're using has two-step verification enabled. To help us further isolate this concern, let us try enabling
<strong>IMAP</strong> and use an <strong>app p</strong><strong>assword </strong>to login. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your Gmail account.</li><li>Click the gear icon on the upper-right corner of your screen.</li><li>Select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Forwarding and POP/IMAP</strong> tab.</li><li>Make sure the <strong>Enable IMAP</strong> item is selected and the status should be
<strong>IMAP is enabled</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once done,&nbsp;you need to create an <strong>App Password</strong>. An App Password is a one-time password that you use instead of verifying yourself with two-step verification. To do this, just follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Access your Gmail account.</li><li>Click on your profile picture.</li><li>Select <strong>My Account</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Sign-in &amp; Security</strong>, then scroll down to <strong>App passwords</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After that, you need to enter your Gmail account password again. Once done, you can choose an app and the device from the drop-down menu. Then click the
<strong>GENERATE</strong> button.&nbsp;You will see a password on your screen. Kindly use that 16-digit password in Outlook instead of the regular account password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</p>

    <title>Using Norton&#39;s Power Eraser &#40;Caution&#41;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Norton&#39;s Power Eraser &#40;Caution&#41;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>This is a good tool and a helpful on-line scan that CAN (and often DOES) catch things other scans miss.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like all Third Party Software it has a bad habit of marking files as "bad" that AREN'T "bad".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Case in Point: The Calibre E-Reader. I have been using this program for YEARS for .lrf files (Microsoft Reader files) and eBooks formatted for other readers (Nook, etc) and it does a wizard job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, no...it is not dangerous, it has no Malware (always assuming you have downloaded it from the official site) and it gives you great freedom in formatting your eBooks.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the Norton Power Eraser will tell you it and all its files are BAD and should be removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is nonsense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All it means is that NPE doesn't recognize the Calibre as a friend. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So am I saying don't use it? Of course not.</p>
<p>Just make sure you check the files it is telling you to get rid of before obeying.</p>
<p>They might be okay and might even be something you really WANT.</p>

            <p>This goes without saying, it clearly stated in their official website and this the statement:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<strong><em>there is a risk that it can select some legitimate programs for removal. If you accidently remove a legitimate program, you can run Norton Power Eraser to review past repair sessions and undo them. "</em></strong></p>

            <p>Not necessary since I caught it at the time. I posted this for others who may be thinking of using it as additional protection because not everyone reads the fine print and the number of MVPs and Community Moderators who casually recommend third party software
 (especially virus scanners) without actually making clear the risk before they send people to various links and say DO THIS TO SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM with no warnings at all I just wanted to remark that there are issues here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not everyone is as advanced in tech savvy as you are and not everyone is necessarily even going to notice, at first, that this third party cleaner they were told to use cleaned out some essential .exe files necessary to running windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not, at least, until they try to restart their computer and can't because essential files are missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are you saying? That you would prefer I NOT warn people who may be new to all this?<br />
<br />
And, if so, WHY???</p>

            <p>Put simply, no unskilled user should ever use Norton Power Eraser for the very reason being discussed, since it requires far to much knowledge to be used safely by anyone not fully familiar with the operation of both Windows and every single application
 installed on their PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for warning people via such a post, it's unfortunately a pointless effort.&nbsp; No unskilled user ever frequents forums such as this and only a very small percentage will even arrive here after an event occurs.&nbsp; Even if they should happen to find this via
 a search query, in most cases it will be too late since they'd be finding the warning after the fact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not telling you that you can't do this, only that there are better things you could be doing with your time to help others.&nbsp; More posts here and elsewhere about such edge issues with tools that only knowledgeable users should be using only add to the
 overall "noise" and mass quantities of information that search queries provide.&nbsp; This is why I'm completely clear when discussing such tools myself as to whether they are truly useful to the non-skilled user, since anything else is simply more noise.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You also mention there is a program which is safe and it is incorrectly detected by NPE, so I recommend you to report this program to Symantec so they would investigate and if it pass their criteria they add it to the whitelist , so it won't be detected
 as malware next time.</p>

<h2>            Audio testing in SKYPE</h2>
                    <p>!!!!!!!ONLY MICROSOFT can waste as much of my life's energy as they do!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>That is SO wrong!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the deal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a job interview tomorrow morning at 11:00 a.m. PST.</p>
<p>I have, through Skype, connected and adjusted the video.</p>
<p>Now, I have a headset for the audio. There is no clear, easy concise efficient way to test my headset with the camera functioning and do an AUDIO TEST.</p>
<p>The question is: HOW do I organize the camera, headset and SKYPE to know confidently that the whole system will work when I enter the meeting room for the final interview tomorrow morning--still have not been able to figure out the AUDIO TEST part.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, take me by the hand and lead me to technical success for my employment future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi ,
<br />
<br />I’m a fellow Microsoft customer and also an expert user - happy to help.
<br />
<br />First, go into Skype Preferences (Skype menu then Preferences,)
<br />
<br />Next click on Audio/Video:
<br />
<br />To test your Audio, verify that the bars under the microphone selection move when you speak.
<br />
<br />To test your Video, look at the video of yourself that appears on the bottom side of this menu.
<br />
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />Alexander

            <p>Hello BuddhiRathanayaka:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the follow up.&nbsp; If you have noticed settings are no longer available on your phone this indicates something has changed with the phones OS or firmware.&nbsp; This would most likely be a result of an update.&nbsp; Before doing anything drastic to the
 phone you should try the simply step of soft resetting the phone, Greg outlined this in his previous post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only other thing I can suggest is that you make sure that you are on the camera settings and not the video settings.&nbsp; I have seen phones that have more options available for the camera then video.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the settings are still not there, the only other option you have to possibly get them back is to restore your phone to it's state prior to your last update,
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp7/basics/restore-a-backup-to-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp7/basics/restore-a-backup-to-my-phone</a>.&nbsp; Once the restore is completed, check the camera settings once again.&nbsp; If they are back then you may be left with the decision to have the additional settings or the most
 resent update on the phone.&nbsp; You can try the update again to ensure there was not simply an issue with the update properly installing on the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.</p>

                    <p>The Brave New Face of the company store.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cbdc0368-00aa-48f8-b126-0a75ddf97f8a" /></p>
<p>I am not amused. Even the teenagers will hardly be impressed.<br />
I had a problem with build 10148 that the store did not work.<br />
Couldn't care less, but some way or the other, also the calculator had gone with it.<br />
Maybe that is because of excessive "phoning home" for validating etc., that can be expected of a point-of-sell, thin terminal, that the store leads to.<br />
I wonder who will move to Win 10 in two days from now, even if it is free, apparently.</p>

<h3> vienna10  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 18362.175 &#40;1903&#41; and NVIDIA Driver</h2>
                    <p>Have finally tracked down the frequent restarts on my system. It got to a stage where the system refused to go past the log-in screen last week. It just didn't matter what I tried. Finally managed to start it in Safe Mode with Network, where it didn't restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This prompted me to uninstall the&nbsp;NVIDIA driver and all other related software. Hid the&nbsp;NVIDIA driver after restart and all went well, until I noticed that Windows had downloaded and installed the&nbsp;NVIDIA software again, which resulted in Windows crashing
 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restored the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter in Device Manager and this hasn't changed the last few days. Running without crashes the last four days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could live with that, the only problem is my video cutting software, which refuses to load the video and Adobe Bridge 2019, which disables hardware acceleration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried various&nbsp;NVIDIA drivers, including older ones, all with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just wonder if there is anything else that could be done.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Vienna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very unusual issue you are having. I have been running 18362.207 on my main system using latest Nvidia drivers 430.86 without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did get a few BSOD's while running 18362.175 reporting DPC Watchdog Violations and also Memory Management error. They would occur with just a mouse click.<span> Memory tests found no errors.
</span>So far so good with 18362.207.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if some other driver is conflicting with the video driver somehow. Any other 3rd party software as in AV or utility type program?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggest possibly creating another partition or use a separate drive with a clean install of 18362 and install the nvidia drivers to see if the issue persists. Anything showing up in the logs pointing out what is causing the crashes.</p>
        </p>

            If your display adapter is a GeForce 600 series or newer, you could use Wagnardsoft's DDU to completely uninstall NVIDIA drivers and then try the DCH version of NVIDIA drivers. You have to use Safe Mode to properly run DDU and stay offline to prevent the
 auto-reinstall of the NVIDIA drivers.

<p>Thank you for the reply. No other AV or utility type programs as such. Have disabled all non essential programs from starting.</p>

<p>I do like Don's suggestion of trying the DCH version. The only thing I wanted to get at was by doing a clean install and then the NVidia drivers to see if the issue persists. This would clear up any windows fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not dual-booted in years since using VMware, but just swapping the drive and clean installing you would not require a spare licence as the computer would still activate via your other hardware, eg. mb</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Might even want to run a program like&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(25, 30, 30, 1)">GPU-Z to check the card. Make sure it is seated properly and has adequate air flow to clear up any overheating issue.
 Check the fans on the card. Maybe a good blast with some compressed air available any electronic shop.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggest even swapping the video card, possible that may be causing the issue. You have stated it works fine without hardware acceleration. Might not even be driver related.</p>

<p>I have an NVIDIA GTX 690, which is a dual-GPU card.&nbsp; I am running the latest DCH driver on my public build, but also have build 18922 installed to a small partition on the same NVMe SSD. 18922 is using whatever Standard NVIDIA driver Windows auto-installs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is pretty easy to do a dual-boot clean install to a small partition. The other day I instead created an expandable VHDX file to do a temporary dual-boot install to. It acts like a partition, but only grows as large as is necessary. When I was done with
 it I just had the one file to delete and then removed the reference to it from my boot menu. Clean installs can be done very quickly compared to upgrades.</p>

<p>I kind of figured it was your main system that's why suggested using another drive to eliminate either windows itself or a possible faulty video card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To backup Office 2016 activation on Windows 10/8, go to C:\Windows\System32\spp, and then copy and paste the store folder into a safe place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To restore the activation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure Office 2016 is installed. Close all open Office 2016 document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Command Prompt as administrator. Type net stop sppsvc and hit Enter to stop the Software Protection Platform service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Replace the original store folder with the backup store folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Command Prompt as administrator.Type net start sppsvc and hit Enter to start the Software Protection Platform service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Office 2016 app, and it can be automatically activated.<br />
</p>
<p>Considerations:<br />
1. The activation files only can be restored on the same computer.<br />
2. Windows system installed on the computer should be activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have successfully done the re-activation of Office 2016 by <span>just deleting “data.dat” and “tokens.dat” on clean install and replacing them with the saved ones. You might want to try this if you decide to do the HDD swap and clean install to ensure
 this works for you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: This was done on Retail version, but should also work for VL.</p>

</p><p>It is pretty easy to do a dual-boot clean install to a small partition. The other day I instead created an expandable VHDX file to do a temporary dual-boot install to. It acts like a partition, but only grows as large as is necessary. When I was done with
 it I just had the one file to delete and then removed the reference to it from my boot menu. Clean installs can be done very quickly compared to upgrades.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>worked with a VHDX file with the Insider releases earlier. However, finished deleting it as I needed all the available memory for the "hungry" Adobe installs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do have a spare Samsung SSD, which was to be for another project. Could swap this one with my main SSD and install a new system. This will have to wait a few days, as we are in the middle of a heat wave - 36° C today and no air con. Just using my notebook,
 no PC's......</p>

</p><p>This seems to part of a bigger problem with updates in general.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am stuck with 1123 definition update not downloading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is blocking the intel driver update and 18912 OS update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the store, nothing has updated for two days and the check update dots just go round and round</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both these have been occurring for the last couple of releases and I have cleared them by stopping update services and clearing the softwaredistribution folder. I have run the WU script previously recently discussed</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Office, the insider preview update caused a loss of recognition of licence and I only fixed this by reinstalling Office and then the most preview.</p>

<p>

<h2>            &#34;There is a problem with your account...&#34; when opening online OneNote file within local OneNote app</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a tenancy DirSync connection a small number of staff so that they can have access to SharePoint, Visio and OneNote Online. When one such user logs onto the http://[<em>groupsite</em>].sharepoint.com site on his Windows 7 PC with Office 2013 installed,
 he can access the site successfully. He might then open a OneNote file online. However, if he was to then click the "Open In OneNote" button from the toolbar, and clicked "Yes" to the Microsoft OneNote Security Notice:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b3268fe2-a79b-48a1-92df-e0217394e0f8" /></p>
<p>... and then sign in with the same account to this box:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90ee1771-d791-4203-980b-a44a466daab2" /></p>
<p>... and then enters his correct credentials into the next "Sign In" window, it returns with the following message:</p>
<p>"There is a problem with your account. Please try again later".</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3a0066fc-2932-4d7e-9329-22e79b67051b" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, the following message is returned within the MS OneNote app:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7cb7528e-9a94-4552-8fba-e56ce66ac64c" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>"We couldn't open that location. It might not exist or you might not have permission to open it. Please contact the owner of onenote:https://[<em>groupsite</em>].sharepoint.com/sites/....one#SharePoint Team Site for more information."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user has reinstalled MS OneNote 2013 on the PC with no change. We have also removed all cached credentials from within Windows Credential Manager and rebooted with no success. The user can access all web-based resources such as SharePoint, OneNote and
 Visio, and he can open web-based Visio files locally on the locally-installed Visio app with no issues. This problem is specifically experienced when opening an online version of OneNote locally on a &nbsp;PC that has either MS OneNote 2010 or OneNote 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance that you may be able to provide would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Brian</p>

<p>
</p><p>Just open Office 365 SharePoint online site in Google Chrome. -&gt; Go to pages library -&gt; Select any page in Pages library-&gt; In context Menu click Open in Microsoft SharePoint designer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time SharePoint designer shows windows popup asking for credentials rather than office 365 pop up for credentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the site opened successfully in designer !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>(note that now I see some entry added in<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Credential Manager</strong>)&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to migrate Office 365 University OneNote data &#40;personal - web&#41; to Office 365 Business Premium &#40;Sharepoint&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Last year we bought Office 365 Business Premium licenses from GoDaddy (supplies our Exchange services as well) and one University license from Microsoft. The PC running the University license was stolen then recovered so since re-deployed for (family) business
 use.&nbsp; Now trying to migrate Office 365 OneNote 2016 data from that (University) licensed&nbsp;PC to another&nbsp;Win 8.1 PC running Office 365 Business Premium license.&nbsp; OneNote (Personal - Web)&nbsp;is the biggest challenge in that we have not stored any files in OneDrive
 (personal).&nbsp; Microsoft Global Support (MSG) says support ought to come from GoDaddy but their techs don't seem to understand&nbsp;our problem. We have MS Assure Support but it doesn't apply to this issue&nbsp;per MGS.</p>
<p>Need to know how to move&nbsp;OneNote data and/or re-set defaults as appropriate.&nbsp; Have not found any FAQs on Microsoft website that address this topic.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance to anyone who understands the question and will reply!</p>

<p>hi lara,<br />
<br />
about your requirement, you can share your onenote with the business premium account from onenote app in your university licensed pc. then go to your win 8.1 pc that runs office 365 business premium license, log in to
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/owa</a> , click and open the onenote notebook from the notification email, and click open in onenote.</p>

<p>Thanks James for your reply. &nbsp;I paid for a 3-year Business Premium license so would like to use it. University license expires in 6 mos. I have 3 PCs, an iPhone and an iPad and would like to see the same data everywhere. GoDaddy says to uninstall the current
 (University) software and download Office 365 (Business) from their site. Works fine for Outlook via Exchange. Haven't used OneDrive yet. &nbsp;Is there a way to migrate my OneNote data off University to Business? &nbsp;Right now the PCs running Business show no data
 in OneNote. How to do set-up?</p>

<p>If you have a few notebooks, have you tried File-&gt;Export-&gt;Notebook in the OneNote client on the University licensed PC?
<br />
You can&nbsp;copy &amp; open the packages on your current PC then click Share-&gt; Sites to&nbsp;move the&nbsp;local notebooks&nbsp;to your new tenant.<br />
Then you will be able to open your notes from other&nbsp;devices with your new account.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Jim</p>

    <title>E-mails Deleting on Their Own From Outlook... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            E-mails Deleting on Their Own From Outlook...</h2>
                    <p>I have Outlook 365 for one account... have Outlook installed on PC and phone... and have linked 5 e-mail accounts so that I can see them all in one inbox (effectively removing the need for the Android "Mail" app).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have NO rules in place that would affect emails being deleted. I only have two rules set up that push new e-mails from E-mail Address # 1 and #2 to an "All Inboxes" folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said... I have been seeing that after a period of time (two weeks or more) e-mails are being deleted from my inboxes. I realized this when I went to view an e-mail that was sent to me, that I PURPOSEFULLY left in the inbox so I could go back to it,
 and it was gone. Not in any inbox, not in the deleted items folder. I had to have that person re-email me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I found another e-mail missing and couldn't find. To go further... I found about 6 e-mails from 8/13 and 8/14 in the deleted items/trash folder. I NEVER deleted those or sent them to trash. I was able to recover those but others have been lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why are my inboxes automatically purging? No... I don't have the folders set to show only UNREAD messages. I've already checked that.</p>

            Hi Primus,
<br />
<br />This is extremely bizarre behavior, I'm sorry you are dealing with this right now.
<br />
<br />I'm sure you've set everything up correctly based on the information you provided. I can assure you that although mail may be missing, I don't believe its your Outlook client doing this.
<br />
<br />1. What types of accounts are you using (type and service - ie IMAP/iCloud)
<br />2. How many clients and versions of clients are connected to the 365 and the 5 accounts?
<br />3. If you go to the server copy does the mail show up there if you search for said message? example, go to icloud.com - is it there?
<br />4. Check the deleted folder of each mail server from 365 and the 5 other accounts to see if mail is in there. Its really the only way mail gets deleted from any modern system.
<br />
<br />Thanks!

<p>Thanks for the reply. Let me see about answering those questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have 2 accounts directly through Microsoft. Connected directly by linking in Outlook. I believe they're both 365 accounts. The other ones I have one through Google synced via Pop, and the other are Hotmail accounts also synced via Pop.</p>
<p>2. I have a desktop app and phone app. That's it. No other clients and no other users who have access to these accounts.</p>
<p>3. If I search for the message, so long as it was within a week or two I can find it in the trash by searching for @whoever.com If they are gone, they're gone for good as was the case of a couple e-mails I'm not able to get back.</p>
<p>4. I checked the trash and deleted folders of ALL accounts in case it was moved. The deleted ones were gone for good. Never to be found again. The ones trashed recently are still in the trash folder. I didn't put them there.</p>

            try to reset the phone to factory settings..just back-up tha necessary files that you need then restore it later..and avoid installing applications in phone memory instead install it in mmc..

<p>Hey Lauramihaela, Welcome to the Nokia Discussion forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried to clear memory by erasing your cache memory? this should also free up some extra memory.</p>
<p>You can do this by g<span>oing to&nbsp;the Web application and select
</span><strong>Options &gt; Clear privacy data &gt; Cache</strong><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The 'Other Files' directory contains files such as map information and general files for the Operating system and they cannot be deleted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Ovi Maps has to do a lot of work very quickly so it needs to be installed on C, or it would be too slow. It is not possible for Maps to work properly if installed on other drives.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span>The only solution to this problem is to clear space on C by deleting or moving applications. It is also helpful to configure other applications to use drives other than C for their storage.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span>I hope this helps, please let me know if you have anymore queries and if this helps to answer your issue!</span></span></span></p>

<p>I am experiencing similar&nbsp;problems for the third time since I bought my Nokia C5-03. I hardly have any extra applications installed on de C-drive (Phone memory). Today I deleted my mailbox from Nokia e-mail and I cleared the cache. Now I am as lucky as to
 have 16,8 MB free Phone memory!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my opinion, Nokia has designed a phone with too little memory. I thought to overcome this by installing a 16 GB memory card. But many apps have to be installed in the Phone memory as are for instance the cache and the "Nokia emails", which is why many
 functions of the phone become pretty much useless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I can't use Nokia email because my emails clog the Phone memory. There's no real alternative for me because the email client in the message service (who can save email to the memorycard) only synchronizes the headers. If you want to read a new mail you
 have to wait an annoyingly long time for it to appear on the screen. I use Mail for Exchange (with gmail) now, but I experienced synchronization problems with MfE before, so I hope it will work now. This works within the message service as well, so message
 go to the memorycard.</p>
<p>2. Last weekend I used my phone for navigation. Example: On a 150 km long trip, my phone showed the message "Memory full, press OK" at least 30 times. In some occasions it appeared 3 times within 10 seconds! I wonder whether the police would have called
 this "hands free". My question to Nokia: why do I have to press OK while driving??? (By the way, the navigation was the only application running).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question: What can I do to free up more Phone memory (C-drive)?</p>
<p>A. There is no data that I can delete on C: because I keep everything on the memorycard</p>
<p>B. Cache is empty already</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only solution I see to free up more than 16,8 MB is:</p>
<p>C. Delete applications from Phone memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I check all the apps that are installed on the Phone memory and made a list of some apps that can maybe be removed. I think, except for Whatsapp, they're all apps that belong to the phone software.</p>
<p>1. Whatsapp (4096 kB, can only be installed on C:. I'd like to keep it but is that wise?)</p>
<p>2. Chat &amp; Chat client (3500 kB, I don't use Nokia chat, can this be deleted?)</p>
<p>3. Nokia email (1024 kB, do I still need it now I use Mail for Exchange?)</p>
<p>4. Nokia store (1013 kB: Nokia:&nbsp;shame on you that I have to consider deleting this one from a Nokia phone)</p>
<p>5. Qt &amp; QtMobility (8192 kB: not sure what this is. Is it necessary for the operating system?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to know which apps besides Whatsapp can safely be deleted and of course I am open for other solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Paul</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS On the Nokia-website, the specs of the C5-03 say that it has 128 MB SDRAM. Is this what is usually called the 'Phone memory'? Then, how come that my phone 'says' it has only 75 MB of Phone Memory when I connect it to my computer via USB?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>The 75 MB you mention is probably total Phone Memory.&nbsp; The relevant figure from Nokia's site is "Maximum User Storage: 40 MB".&nbsp; Yes, your phone probably should have come with more built-in storage.&nbsp; The 128 MB is the phone's RAM, like the memory you put
 in a computer, while the Phone Memory (ROM) is like the hard drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have never used a 5th Edition phone, so you may need to hunt around for the settings I mention.&nbsp; I suspect they all exist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Are you sure there is no map data on the phone?&nbsp; Using Nokia's File Manager, there should be a Cities folder on the memory card, but not on the phone.&nbsp; What is your version of Maps?&nbsp; Are you using the latest firmware?&nbsp; The "memory full" errors do suggest
 map data saving to the phone.&nbsp; In Maps, I have a toggle in Options -&gt; Settings -&gt; Maps -&gt; Memory To Be Used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Are you sure no old email or messages are on the phone?&nbsp; You are using the memory card now, but it's possible that old messages remain.&nbsp; I use a switch in Messaging to toggle back and forth: Options -&gt; Settings -&gt; Other -&gt; Memory in Use.&nbsp; Change it back
 to Phone Memory and look for any old email or SMS messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) You can manually delete the browser cache using 3rd party software like Y-Browser (<a href="http://www.drjukka.com/YBrowser.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.drjukka.com/YBrowser.html</a> , scroll down to the bottom).&nbsp; I don't know if this will gain you
 anything, but if you find a folder C:\System\Cache with lots of numbered folders inside (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.) you can safely delete the entire Cache folder and the browser will remake it when needed.&nbsp; If you don't find it, then best to leave this alone for now,
 as you don't want to delete the wrong thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) I assume you deleted any photos from Phone Memory (an Images directory) and other obvious files long ago?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) Some users have suggested that Bluetooth file transfers can get cached on C:.&nbsp; I don't know the details, but if you've ever done this, we can delve in deeper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6) You can certainly delete Nokia Chat if you don't use it.&nbsp; I would keep the other programs for now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Nokia there is just the 40 MB of user storage, and I would be surprised if you could reclaim more than 30 MB total.&nbsp; The phone does need space for Contacts, Calendar, cache, and other overhead.&nbsp; If my suggestions above don't help much, I can
 try again. ;)&nbsp; Good luck!</p>

            Hey!<br />
I just got a Nokia C5-03.<br />
I downloaded some applications from Ovi and saved 'em in my memory card, but I'm unable to find the location of the saved application. Please help. Thanks in advance! :)

<p>Hi <span>hafsah,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Easiest way is to install apps from the OviStore app on your phone. The apps will install automatically. You will find them in the menu under "apps" and submenu "installed apps". At least, that's how it works for me.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you want to look up the saved installation packages on the memorycard you can use the File Manager, which you will find in menu-apps﻿-office.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck,</span></p>
<p><span>Paul</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>PS1 I have a C5-03 that speaks Dutch and I'm not sure if all the menu names are 100% correct.﻿</span></p>
<p><span>PS2 If I were you, I would follow alle procedures mentioned in this topic to keep as much phone memory free as possible.﻿ I hope you won't get all the problems that I had with low phone memory!</span></p>

<p>Hi Thetao,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I typed a more extensive reaction before, but it got lost when I pressed "post". Therefore I just respond to the main points that you mentioned (and some I found out myself).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strange: I can't find the 40 MB Maximum User Storage on the Nokia website anymore (nor the 75 MB). But it sounds very familiar to me. It looks to me as if they removed this from the phone specs, also of other Smartphones by the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday, I deleted some small apps that I don't use (anymore) such as InternetRadio and I also removed Nokia email. Although the apps were below 2 MB together, this freed up over 7 MB of Phone memory (24 MB free now)! I think there were still some old
 emails stored in C: which I couldn't delete any other way. This helped me a great deal already but I tried your suggestions as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. No map data or CITIES folder on C: 2. Switched messages memory to phone (and phone to offline mode) and I did indeed find a forgotten email account with 30 email messages. Not much but I had 24,7 MB free after that. Of course, I put messages memory back
 to the memorycard. 3. Used the free edition of Y-Browser to manually delete the cache folder. Not much data in that, but 25,1 MB free after that. Nice tool, with which you can reach folders that normally stay hidden! Used YBrowser to search all C: for files
 over 300 kB. Only 2 files: boot_space.txt in C:\ (500 kB, contains only the X repeatedly as far as I see, but is probably essential for the operating system) and C:\resource\python25\pyton25.zip (1 MB). It looks like an installation package, but I'm not sure
 if I can delete it. By the way: YBrowser hasn't made a shortcut in one of the menus. Only way that I found to start it was to look for it using the Phone's search function. Is there a way to make this shortcut myself?</p>
<p>4. Yes I did. No Images folder on C: anymore, nor other big files (see point 3)</p>
<p>5. I use Bluetooth for file transfer sometimes, mainly for installation files (such as YBrowser.sis, but I did this one via USB-cable). However, no big files are left on C: so I don't think I have this problem.</p>
<p>6. I tried to delete Nokia Chat yesterday as well (with the other apps), but it won't be uninstalled the normal way as it says "Uninstall cancelled" (not sure about the exact translation since my phone 'speaks' Dutch) ;) Do you know if there's another way
 to get rid of this 3 MB app that I don't use at all?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I may have found an explanation and a solution for the memory problem while navigating. You mentioned the "memory in use" in the map settings. Above that option there's a slide bar for the % of memory that the navigation can use. Standard is 70%.
 I always thought this was about storage memory on (in my case) the memorycard. Another topic mentioned that this the working memory (so the RAM) that the navigation may use. Setting it to 70% means there's only 30% left for other apps that run in the background.
 The other topic states that this is nog enough so the slider should be set to for instance 30% for navigation leaving 70% free for "the phone". From behind my computer, navigation seems much more stable. I'll try this setting in my car soon and let you know
 how it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for thinking along with me so far! There's already 25,1 MB of space, which is great since it was only 7 MB last Sunday. And navigation looks more stable. I'd appreciate if you have some more answers to my latest questions, but if not I think
 my phone will work a lot better already!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards, Paul</p>

<p>The 40 MB limit is still there.&nbsp; See <a href="http://www.developer.nokia.com/Devices/Device_specifications/C5-03/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.developer.nokia.com/Devices/Device_specifications/C5-03/</a> , in the Memory Functions section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>500K of X's in boot_space.txt sounds silly, but it's likely a method the OS uses to reserve space on the drive in case of emergency.&nbsp; I'd be tempted to delete it anyway...but you probably shouldn't.&nbsp; Python is a scripting language that came from Unix, and
 I hadn't thought it came preinstalled with <em>any</em> Nokia phone...but after a quick web search, I'm apparently wrong.&nbsp; Yes, leave it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recall that Y-Browser installs differently than most other programs.&nbsp; Again, I'm not familiar with 5th edition, but look for a "DrJukka" folder in the main Menu view.&nbsp; Y-Browser should be inside, and from there you can put it somewhere more convenient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have never used Nokia Chat either, but if none of these work</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) disabling any home screen plugin/widget for Chat</p>
<p>2) switching the phone to offline mode and rebooting</p>
<p>3) pressing and holding the red End key to stop all data connections and then quickly try the uninstall again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then I'm stumped, too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy I could be helpful, but it seems like you did most of the work! ;)</p>

            Hi Shawn213,
<br />
<br />I'm Tyler, an independent advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />I think that this issue is caused by an error in syncing the shared calendar. I suggest reading the article listed below and follow the instructions with the images and reporting if that solved your problem.

            Something not working wouldn't seem to be a by design behavior.&nbsp; Maybe a known bug/issue between the two would make sense o me. Could you please elaborate why this would be a "by design behavior"?

<p>
</p><p><span>Please firstly try the following method to see the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open an Office client (like the Word client) &gt; Open a blank document and Click&nbsp;<strong>File</strong>&nbsp;tab on the upper left corner&gt;Click&nbsp;<strong>Account</strong>&gt;Sign out&nbsp;<strong>all the accounts</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Remove all the stored Office credentials in the credentials manager (Control Panel &gt; User Accounts &gt; Credential Manager &gt; Windows Credentials).
</span></p>
<p><span>(<strong>NOTE: </strong>This will remove your stored passwords.)</span></p>
<p><span>3. Sign into Office programs, such as Word with the correct credentials.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Open an Office application to sign in with your account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists after trying above, I’d like to confirm the following information for further investigation.</span></p>
<p><span>1. What’s the detailed version of your Office client. Please go to an Office application &gt; FILE &gt; Account &gt; Product Information.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Does the issue occur to both of the HP Envy and the Surface Pro 3?</span></p>

 how that happened.&nbsp; Probably because I am constantly having to rebuild my PC's when Windows 10 creates one of its periodic otherwise non-solvable major problems.&nbsp; I removed the extra Business Accounts.&nbsp; This seems to have resolved the issue.</p>

    <title>I create recipes and need an easy way to format them for both printed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frenchgirl  say:</h3>
<h2>            I create recipes and need an easy way to format them for both printed and web publishing. Any recommendations&#63;</h2>
                    I am looking for a way to make all my recipes have the same format, and to easily publish them to my website and also on paper.
<br />
Word doesn't have a recipe template that I can find.<br />
I use Dreamweaver for the web, not that happy with it, it is cranky and complicated, but it is an old version.
<br />
Any suggestions on how to make this easy and flexible?<br />

            DreamWeaver is not an Easy to get along with I have it and use myself. <br />
<br />
What I do is I have created a Template myself ,<br />
<br />
I first set page setup to 4x6" index Card and clicked on Landscape mode. <br />
<br />
after setup I saved as Template called Recipe.<br />
<br />
Then I use this to open. <br />
<br />
Next I type up the Recipe. and save first as word.docx. Then I&nbsp; go to print Menu&nbsp; choose PDF wait for menu to come up and Choose Adobe Quality PDF.<br />
<br />
I save as PDF file The move a copy of it into my <a href="http://www.phillipmjones.net/Recipes/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Website</a>.&nbsp; If you don't have&nbsp; Acrobat just choose PDF and it will be acceptable.<br />
<br />
Most everyone has Reader on their computers. And PDF works on every Web browser except Safari 5.1 (will work on Lion and Safari 5.1)<br />
<br />
You can save as an HTML page in DreamWeaver. DreamWeaver has a Feature in Tools menu&nbsp; Lovingly called "Fix Word HTML" or Fix "MS HTML"<br />
It converts the MS code for Bold , italic and so on to proper html code,<br />

           title="Daniel G. Grau" aria-label="Profile picture" >

    </ul>
            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Do this:
<div>
<ul>
<li>In the main menu bar, select <i>File &gt; New from template</i></li><li>In the search field at the top right, type "Recipe" (don't even need to type Return)</li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>You will see a list of about 15 user-contributed recipe templates, some nice, some frankly emetic.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For more alternatives, try this:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=&amp;q=recipe+templates+for+word" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Google search for recipe templates</a></li></ul>
<div><br />
Whatever you decide to do, it will pay off if you learn how to use Styles, of which you have Paragraph and Character. Once you've defined the styles you will be using, they can be added to your Normal.dotm template (or saved in a shiny MyRecipeCard.dotm template)
 and you will be able to design really-really uniform-looking recipes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Bear in mind that paragraph styles can invoque other styles when you hit Return, so if you link your styles properly (title, bullets, etc.), you'll achieve a high degree of automatization.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Word lets you Save As in HTML format, but it adds a lot of extra code, so perhaps it would be simpler to just Copy and Paste into your web pages.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Have you tried <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/iweb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">iWeb</a> from Apple? See if you already have it in your
<i>Applications</i> folder.</div>

<h2>            N78 problems</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry if this information can be found elsewhere, I looked but couldn't find it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am having problems with my N78</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>D Pad backlight has stopped working completely - no 'breathing' doesn't matter if I turn it off from the settings.</li><li>The right select button (above multimedia key) does not work at all.</li><li>The red 'end call' button doesn't work at all.</li><li>The 'cancel' key doesn't work at all.</li><li>The screen does not go into standby and stays fully lit when locked. &nbsp;This drains my battery down from full to empty in one day without really using it.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, every now and again the screen will black out (key pad lights still on) and not light up again. &nbsp;I have to turn the phone off and on again for it to return to normal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any idea what I can do to fix these issues? My software version is 21.002. &nbsp;I tried to do a factory reset and it said 'request not completed'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chris</p>
