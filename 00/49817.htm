<p>Hi&nbsp; JenPea78,</p>
<p>Thank you for replying.<br />
<br />
Let’s browse to the location c:\windows\winsxs folder and rename the folder winsxs to winsxs.old.</p>
<p>Then try installing the security update and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Hope the information helps. Please post back and let us know.<br />

<p>Hi&nbsp; JenPea78 ,</p>
<p>As I find you need to install the security update’ Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package ATL Security Update’ before installing iTunes on your computer.</p>
<p>Let’s follow these steps before you proceed with the installation of ITunes.</p>
<p>1. Download and install:</p>
<p>Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package ATL Security Update</p>

<p>2. Also, make sure that you have iTunes installer installed on your computer or else download and install it.</p>
<p>3. Uninstall all iTunes software from Program and features.</p>
<p>a)Open Programs and Features by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking Programs, and then clicking Programs and&nbsp; Features.</p>
<p>b)Select&nbsp; the program, and then click Uninstall.</p>

<p>Also, download and install the Windows Installer Cleanup utility to remove all iTunes software:</p>
<p>Description of the Windows Installer Cleanup Utility</p>
<p>Now run the utility ("Start &gt; All programs &gt; Windows Install Cleanup"). In the list of programs that appear in Cleanup, select any iTunes entries, and click remove. Quit out of Cleanup.</p>

<h2>            My printer has been recognized as a Device by Windows 7, and I am unable to print from it</h2>
                    When installing my Lexmark Prospect SE Pro208 (Print/Scan/Copy/Fax) on to my laptop it was recognized as a Device and not a printer. As a result when I go to print, it is not recognized as an installed printer and therefore I am not able to select it to
 print. Is it possible to reclassify a device as a Printer? If not, how can I fix this problem to enable me to print. Txs, John

    <title>Bluetooth dongle not working. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bluetooth dongle not working.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I am having trouble getting my computer to connect to my Motorola S305 Bluetooth headset. &nbsp;I have a dongle that has worked in the past, but not now. &nbsp;I have tried uninstalling and re-installing drivers. &nbsp;Here's what I think happened: I tried a different,
 older dongle that changed something "deep" in the machine, likely in the registry?--this 2nd, older dongle never worked, but it installed some software. &nbsp;I don't know what to change at this point. &nbsp;All bluetooth and device functions claim to be fine. &nbsp;The
 problem is that when I tell the bluetooth headset in "playback devices" to connect, it doesn't. &nbsp;Sometimes it connects for 1/10 of a second, then stops, as though something in the registry is subverting it and claiming priority. What to wipe/ cleanse/ uninstall?
 &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi johann,</p>
<p>Thank you for your post.</p>
<p><em>"where would the bluetooth software be"</em></p>
<p>Who is the software/hardware manufacturer?</p>
<p><em>"A key error message: when I troubleshoot the audio, even though the S305 headset shows up in "playback devices," the troubleshooter<strong>says the device isn't "plugged in" (it is)</strong>"</em></p>
<p><span><em>"I am having<strong> trouble getting my computer to connect to my Motorola</strong> S305 Bluetooth headset"</em></span></p>
<p><span>How is the device "plugged in"? I understand we are using the term "plugged in" to&nbsp;reference&nbsp;to the Bluetooth connection.</span></p>
<p><span>It seems like the device isn't connecting as an audio device. Thus, it would not appear to the troubleshooter as "plugged in".</span></p>
<p><span><em>"this 2nd, older dongle never worked, but it installed some software"</em></span></p>
<p><span>It's likely the software it installed was the drivers for the device. You'll have to remove those from the Device Manager.</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest booting the computer into Safe Mode and removing the hardware profiles for all Bluetooth dongles, then boot back into Normal mode to reinstall the 1st dongle.</span></p>

The thumbnail for a movie would be the first frame. If you re-edit <br />
your movie and add a different photo to the beginning...that should <br />
be the new thumbnail.</p>

 sure there was not just a tiny piece of a clip on the front of my video. the first pic of a pelican is&nbsp; the first frame. then a pic of my self and then 5 sections of video of an everglades airboat ride.&nbsp; when i post it on face book or just look at my lists

<h2>            Creating file shortcuts in Windows 10</h2>
                    When I right click on a file and select Create Shortcut, the file highlights but in Windows 7 it was the shortcut that was highlighted making it easy to cut the shortcut and paste it into another folder. Is there a setting that can be changed in Windows
 10 so it highlights the shortcut not the file?

            Hi PooleParent, actually I never noticed this before . . .
<br />
<br />Sorry there is no setting in Windows to change that behaviour - focus is set back to the original file . . .
<br />
<br />Your best option is to report this to the Windows Feedback, press Windows Key + F to open the Feedback Hub and report this bug, the developers monitor that hub regularly and will hopefully resolve this

            Currently, that feature is not implemented at this time. Here is how you send in a suggestion to the Windows Engineers so they can hopefully add it:
<br />
<br />Included with Windows 10 is an app called Feedback Hub. You can launch it by opening Start, type: feedback or scroll down to ‘F’ then click Feedback hub.
<br />
<br />After launching Feedback hub, click the Feedback tab. Choose the kind of report you want to send to the Windows Engineers. This is important, because there is a difference between tweeking something versus fixing a bug.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />    A suggestion could be add the option to have different mouse pointer colors.
<br />    A bug could be, every time you click the Start button, it does not open or the Microsoft Store app presents an error every time you launch it.
<br />
<br />Error codes and the ability to reproduce the error you are experiencing is important. Some issues you might experience in Windows 10 could be attributed to anomalies or network problems. So, make sure you have exhausted all the troubleshooting options before you submit a report. For instance, if you are unable to connect to the Internet, make sure your drivers updated; you have ran the built in troubleshooters (Start &gt; Setting &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshooter) and even Restart the device.
<br />
<br />When you have decided which one you would like to submit, choose the appropriate radio box. For this article, I am going to submit a ‘Problem’.
<br />
<br />Below that, enter a descriptive title for your problem.
<br />
<br />Next, click in the details box and enter some details of the problem. Be clear about the problem, what happens when you click XYZ. Include the error code if there is one. Along with that, include details about the system you are using, such as the make and model. Here is a basic run down of what you can provide to help engineers diagnose the problem:
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />    What is the exact make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Click System summary
<br />
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />    What have you done so far to troubleshoot the problem?
<br />    How long has this been happening?
<br />    Have you installed any new software or hardware drivers since you started experiencing this problem? If so, what are they and are they designed for Windows 10?
<br />    Have you checked the manufacturers website or contact support to find out about compatibility, updates or support for Windows 10?
<br />    Do you have a system restore point created you could go back to?
<br />    Does the problem occur in other user accounts on the computer?
<br />    Which version of Windows did you upgrade from: Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 1507, 1511, 1607, 1703, 1709?
<br />
<br />Please avoid rants, off topic discussion, profanity and insults – be respectful. Engineers are reading your feedback and instead of telling them about your history in computing and personal problems, they would rather know about the problem concerning Windows 10 at hand. You will also have the opportunity to provide follow up replies.
<br />
<br />Choose the category the problem relates to. Since my problem affects the desktop, I will choose the ‘Desktop environment’, specifically ‘Windows Spotlight’. If your issue relates to Microsoft Edge, choose that and the area of Edge affected.
<br />
<br />Next, add evidence of the problem. The Feedback Hub makes it easy to add examples of the problem you are experiencing. This is especially great for reproducible bugs. You can attach a screen capture, file or recording. For my bug, I will go with with Recreate my problem. When you are ready, click Start capture button, then go through the steps to reproduce the problem. When complete, click Stop capture.
<br />
<br />
<br />The information will be attached automatically. You can still remove or review the recorded screenshots used in your recording. You can also keep a copy of the feedback if you want or go ahead and immediately Submit it for review.
<br />
<br />If you want to review your report, click the ‘Continue using Feedback Hub button’.
<br />
<br />Click the My feedback tab, then click on the report, which should be at the top of the list.
<br />
<br />Get Your Bug Report Some Attention
<br />
<br />Here is how you can make some noise and give your report the attention it deserves. You can share the report with family and friends or even key folks on the Windows Engineering team. Click the Share menu at the top right hand corner of the Feedback hub screen; a Short Link will be generated.
<br />
<br />Click Copy Link, which you can send in an email or instant message; or click Share for more options.
<br />
<br />If you have Twitter installed, you can launch that app.
<br />
<br />You can tweet the problem to key folks on the Windows Engineering team or find folks who work on specific parts or apps bundled with Windows such as Photos. Not everyone is on social media, so this is completely optional on your part.

<h2>            svchost.exe groups... My personal mystery&#33; Please HELP</h2>
                    <p>So this is a first comp. assistance other than my brother that i've been vexed enough to ask about. I'm self taught in most fields, but have my tattoo license in 4 states over my 13 yr, career, and proficient in all fields of construction (started at 13yrs
 old), and an amateur inventor/tinker. I'm versed in computers although self taught So there are many gaps in lots of places. So here I have come to you, hopefully you wonderful ppl can enlighten an otherwise very dim subject for me. These svchost are ate up
 in my sys. Ive been threw lots of dif sites info on the sub and everyone dances around the real question? Well I would like to be the voice for the question to the answer for everybody! So here we go;</p>
<p>I need to know about specific clusters of services that are running under the process .exe in question. Because I know what the process does, but need to know...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The clusters (like what kinds of services that are known hi-risk and "Guilty by association" , because only base knowledge of Win 7 nes. serv. are explained)
</p>
<p>2. If these dif. clusters of serv.'s can be turned off through the process page or is it better to stop each serv. individually?</p>
<p>3. Is there a program that can help identify the .dll that is responsible and in connection what its function and info traffic list?
</p>
<p>4. How if pos. would one go about disabling the troublesome services perm.? If serv. is shared by sys or chosen programs how do I turn them off everywhere but only the sum of what I want is being allowed to operate?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If whoever wants to take this treat me like an educated NOOB I would appreciate it and we could all have fun while we work and learn : ) You know the type, a "respectful smart...butt" LOL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance to the person bored but versed in the subject to answer me</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use <strong>Task Manager </strong>to view services that are running on your computer. You can also find processes that might be associated with a particular service. (A process is a file, such as an executable file ending with a file name extension
 of .exe the computer uses to directly start a program or to start other services.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking <span>Services</span> at the bottom of the Services tab opens the Services Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in, where advanced users can view more details about services and configure additional options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you right-click a process on the Processes tab and click <span>
Go to Service(s)</span>, but you do not see any highlighted services, then the process does not have any services associated with it, regardless of whether processes from all users are shown or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you need any further assistance, please post your query on Microsoft Community Forums and we’ll be glad to assist you with it.</span></p>

<h2>            Parental control time-limits being bypassed</h2>
                    <p>I recently used <em>Parental Controls</em> to lock my daughter's User account after 11pm. Despite not knowing the Admin Password she has been able to change the Time settings in Vista, enabling her to bypass the time restrictions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I initially changed the Admin password, but she still was able to change the time. I then tried to block the&nbsp;use of the

            <p>Hi Anne, <br />
<br />
You can go to regedit and see if somehow, your daughter has changed the permissions on who can change the system time. Normally, you have to be an administrator to do so but we can look and see if her account is there.
<br />
<br />
Go to start. In the start search field, type in Regedit. </p>
<p>Scroll thru and expand the following setting: <br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation</p>
<p>With the TimeZoneInformation highlighted, at the top menu, go to Edit. <br />
Select Permissions. <br />
On the Security tab, check to see who has permissions on this key. <br />
<br />
By default, it should be:<br />
Creator Owner<br />
System<br />
Administrators (Your name as administrator should be listed here)<br />
Usesrs (Your name should be here also as administrator)<br />
</p>
<p>If you daughters name is here, then highlight the name and click remove. <br />
Then click OK.<br />
<br />
Be careful in the registry as changes here are final once you have clicked OK and close out of the registry. If you have any questions, don't make changes and reply back here and I will help.<br />
<br />

    <title>External HDD not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tedadair  say:</h3>
<h2>            External HDD not working</h2>
                    Bought my Surface Pro 128GB a few weeks ago. I use a 1TB LaCie Rugged external HDD to store all my files, but I cant seem to get it working on the surface.
<div>here is a link to the exact drive I use: http://www.lacie.com/products/product.htm?id=10553</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- as far as I can tell it&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;initialised&nbsp;when plugged into the surface which si why it&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;show up in My Computer, but when I try to initialise it comes up with a "I/O device error"</div>
<div>- the HDD still works on every other computer I have access too, both PC's and Macs so I do not&nbsp;believe&nbsp;its the HDD.&nbsp;</div>
<div>- It doesnt use external power, or have a port for additional power support. Just connects via the USB 3 cable.</div>
<div>- I have tried a bunch of other HDDs on my surface, a mix of WD and other LaCie drives(but not the exact same as mine) all that are 750GB or less and dont use external power.</div>
<div>- I have tried reformatting the HDD on another computer to FAT32 but it still did not work.</div>
<div>- I have also tried different USB cables.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Im thinking its possible this particular drive&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;work with the surface? I hope not. But any help or info would be great!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>thanks,</div>
<div>Ted.</div>

<h2>            viewsonic td2220</h2>
                    Has anyone had experience using a View Sonic TD2200 monitor with the Surface RT? It is marketed as a multi touch device for Windows 8.
<br />
<br />
I contacted View Sonic but their response was that they weren't sure all the RT touch aspects could be accessed via the
<br />
TD2200 because no one there had ever tried.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<h2>            Issues while taking screenshots</h2>
                    <p>Original Title : Windows 8, Screenshots Are Black</p>
<p>
</p><p>So just the other day, if I needed to take a screenshot, all I had to do was hit "print screen" and paste it to Paint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I haven't updated ANYTHING and this doesn't work anymore. I search around and find out that you're supposed to hold down the Windows key while doing it. I try this and, for some reason, it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I try to take a screenshot of a video player and my screen pauses for a second, turns the player black, and then takes the screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my screenshot just has a black box where the player should have been.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix this bug? My screenshots were working just fine the other day, now they're completely worthless.</p>

    <title>Play saved games from 360 on Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Play saved games from 360 on Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys</p><p>I installed both Star Wars Fore Unleashed games on my Xbox One and both reported having previous saved games once install was complete. But when I try to play it, it only offers me a chance to save to the cloud, and says there are no saved games available. I previously saved to the 360 itself, so I thought it was strange it originally said it found saved games, so I don't know which report is correct.</p><p>Has anyone any experience with this? Can I move them from the 360 to the One like I can move them from 360 to 360?</p><p>Andy</p>

            <p>Hi there, xbox one accesses saved games for 360 via the cloud. You can transfer these from your 360 - there's a guide on how to do this below.</p><p><br /></p><p><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/games/game-setup/cloud-save-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/games/game-setup/cloud-save-games</a><br /></p><p><br /></p><pre>___________

<h2>            How do I rearrange or reorder the storage folders in WLM&#63;</h2>
                    I was VERY surprised to learn that Windows 7 does not support Outlook Express. &nbsp;I loved OE because it allowed me to use business and personal identities. &nbsp;I have imported all of my personal folders and subfolders from OE but don't like the alphabetical
 order. &nbsp;I tried dragging and dropping folders but that did not work. &nbsp;I was able to establish the two different email accounts (personal and business) but would love any suggestions on reorganizing the storage folders because I utilize a bunch of folders.

            <p>Folders are arranged alphabetically (after restarting the program) below the 'special' folders (Inbox, Drafts, Junk, Sent and Deleted). To put them in an order to suit you, give the folder names prefixes:</p>
<p>1 Zygote<br />
2 Yukon<br />
3 Wilhelmina</p>

<p>Have you tried the console on a different wall outlet? If you have and the result is the same, please see if you can use a friend's power supply, to see if that resolves the issue.<br />
<br />
If neither of those do the trick, I'm afraid the console&nbsp;will need to be repaired. You can set one up (and check warranty status)

<p>My best guess is to try a different wall unit, try a different wall unit and try a different AV/HDMI cable because faulty wires could the issue as well. I doubt it's the RROD (Red Ring Of Death) because those are very rare on Slims and the lights that you
 describes don't match up to its description. Best of luck and hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            how to seperate windows in taskbar</h2>
                    <p>windows 8. i have it set to never combine. when i up open a program, for example firefox and google chrome, i have to use both for school, they show up as separate windows/tabs or whatever you call them in the taskbar. but they are fused together. i cant
 separate or rearrange them. when organizing i would prefer to have a firefox window then a chrome, then another firefox and so on, but it has all of the same program stuck together and it makes it hard for me to navigate.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/use-the-taskbar&nbsp; it says: </p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
Note
<ul>
<li>
<p>All open files from the same app are always grouped together, even if you didn’t open them one after the other. This is so you can see all of the previews for that app at the same time.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>is there anyway to change this? i dont want my windows stuck together, it makes it hard to jump from window to window because i cant organize it. is this a mandatory feature of windows 8 or is there some way to turn it off?

            <p>Sorry for the bad news, there is no way to turn that particular group off. &nbsp;It's actually not new to Windows 8, this was first done in Windows 7 (it was the default in Windows XP and Vista also, but back then you could turn it off.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of the taskbar, you might try making more use of the browser tabs. &nbsp;It's basically the same (except it's at the top of the screen instead of the bottom). &nbsp;But those get to be in any order you want. &nbsp;You can even re-arrange them later (which you can't
 do in the old taskbar).</p>

<h2>            I accidentally changed write permissions on my c&#58; drive. How do I reset them&#63;</h2>
                    I have been recently trying to figure out how to access my iPhone/Apple files to restore to a device without iTunes. Somewhere in the process, I've managed to change my permissions to write to my library folders (Pictures, Videos, etc.). When I click on
 an image and choose "Save As," when the destination folder is "Pictures," I get the following error:
<br />
<br />
"You can't save here. Please choose another location." <br />
<br />
How do I restore/fix my permissions on these folders? <br />

            Analysing this problem via a forum is getting a little difficult as it requires a close examination of the permission structure of the problem folder. I suggest you get a computer-savvy friend to assist you. Alternatively you could set up and use a new
 account, following this guide:<br />

 did not work - I've already tried it). It seems like everybody is giving up on me, but I'd even be willing to share my laptop with a trusted person so they could examine the Security settings in my file structure.

<br />
Thanks<br />

Sorry, my answer remains the same as before. Here are the options I see for you:<br />
<ul>
<li>Ask an expert to physically examine your machine.</li><li>Create a new account, then transfer all information from the old to the new account.</li></ul>
I am aware that you already tried creating a new account. Unfortunately you only said "did not work". As a minimum you need to report<br />
a) What exactly you were trying to do when you struck a problem, and<br />
b) What happened, and<br />
c) What messages you saw on the screen (verbatim, please!)<br />
<br />
Note also that System Restore will <span style="font-weight: bold">not lose</span> any data. However, since this has been going on for some time, it is doubtful that you have any useful restore points left.<br />

    <title>Can&#39;t start Windows firewall. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t start Windows firewall.</h2>
                    Windows 8 ASUS 64x intel i5 processor <br />
<br />
I noticed that I cannot download apps or update them from the marketplace app in the start screen. I was just recently<br />
hit with the famous "Win Defender Virus" and it screwed with my computer quite a bit thinking it was an actual message from my computer. I removed by my self with the help of YouTube and miscellaneous downloads. And my best guess is that it broke my firewall
 and I cannot manage to restore my firewall settings so that my apps can connect to the internet etc. But when I click "Use recommended settings" it gives a little circle like its working or something but it doesn't actually do anything. I have Norton Security
 Suite installed so I am using as a substitution. So please leave any suggestions of any kind that could help me resolve this problem. Thank you.<br />
