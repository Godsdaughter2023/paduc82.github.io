<p>Hi, is it possible to insert a calculated formula in a pivot table that calculates mode? When I insert a calculated field, =MODE(Net Paid),</p>
<p>the table populates the new field as #NA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to make this work? I am using excel 2003.</p>

<p>I have a problem that I've never had before. I probably did something to the security controls and now it's blocking any sites from running any java scripts. example. FICS and chess.com. the internet blocks me from running java from those sites and site
 like it. I want to know two things:</p>
<p>1. how do I let only specific java things run but block everything else?</p>
<p>2. how do I set the security back to its original settings?</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016, how to link to Outlook 2003 contacts.</h2>
                    <p>August 5, 2017, I had the worst tech support agent in my life. &nbsp;I am over 67 and started using PCs in 1986, and from 1993 to 2010 was a professional software developer, using and creating custom MS Access, SQL Server, Visual Basic, bar code, and radio frequency
 apps, and at the end of my career, wrote three full-blown, secure, eCommerce websites using MySQL, HTML, JavaScript, and PHP. &nbsp;I'm a CPA with a Master's. &nbsp;You have heard of at least six of my clients. &nbsp;OK, enough of my credentials. &nbsp;I needed help due to old
 age and ill health with linking to my Outlook 2003 data files; all my contacts for 20 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't show in this chat, but I specifically told the first Microsoft agent I did not want to use Outlook for email and only for my Contacts and Calendar data files. &nbsp;What did I end up with? &nbsp;My "commercial/public" gmail account now going to Outlook,
 so I won't be able to view that account while I'm out of town for a couple of weeks. &nbsp;My "friends" gmail account is still on Chrome. &nbsp;The agent rearranged my taskbar without permission, set up two-step log in to my "commercial" gmail account without my permission,
 and did not do the purpose for my call: link to my Contacts or Calendar data files, &nbsp;I watched her fumble around on Windows 10 for over an hour. &nbsp;I was so tired, it just didn't register that my email was showing up, but not my Contacts or Calendar. &nbsp;Horrible.
 &nbsp;This person shouldn't be allowed to answer the phone, much less remote in as a tech support agent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone who knows how to delete the email forwarding from Gmail to Outlook 2016 and can tell me how to link to my old pst files?-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Hello Scott :) You reach Technical Support, it seems we are having issues loading your Outlook to your computer. May I ask
 if it is your 365 Personal which you are using there?</span></p>
<p><span>10:37 am</span></p>
<p><span>Me</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Yes</span></p>
<p><span>10:37 am</span></p>
<p><span>Me</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Trouble opening. The whole Office 365 is on the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>10:38 am</span></p>
<p><span>Me</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Excel and Word have worked fine for months.</span></p>
<p><span>10:38 am</span></p>
<p><span>Ma. Francia P</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Oh! I see, now that's what happened. Nothing to worry, let me do my best to help you on it. May I know what is the error
 message you are getting there?<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>10:38 am</span></p>
<p><span>Me</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>I get a dialog box wanting a password. It is not clear (as usual with MS) what password to use, gmail or Windows 10, neither
 work.</span></p>
<p><span>10:40 am</span></p>
<p><span>Ma. Francia P</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Alright then, may I know what is the email address there that's having an issue?</span></p>
<p><span>10:40 am</span></p>
<p><span>Me</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Telephone support cannot find my account by looking at my email:
<strong><em>000000</em></strong>@gmail.com</span></p>
<p><span>10:40 am</span></p>
<p><span>Ma. Francia P</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Alright then, thanks for additional information. Scott, may I please have your contact number so that in case we get disconnected
 accidentally, I will be able to reach you back? </span></p>
<p><span>10:41 am</span></p>
<p><span>Me</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>I have used that name to sign into Windows 10 several time</span></p>
<p><span>10:41 am</span></p>
<p><span>Me</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>000-000-0000</span></em></strong></p>

<p><span>Ma. Francia P</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you! Scott, since you have an active 365 subscription with us, you are entitle with unlimited Office&nbsp;technical support.
 And&nbsp;in order for me to further isolate the issue, will it be okay if I remotely access your computer and check everything for you?<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>10:42 am</span></p>
<p><span>Me</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>The phone agent just kept arguing with me and said she couldn't find my account. We went around in circles for 15 minutes
 with me giving her all my info, loading Word and Excel. Nothing works</span></p>
<p><span>10:42 am</span></p>
<p><span>Me</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Yes, remote is what I wanted.</span></p>
<p><span>10:43 am</span></p>
<p><span>Ma. Francia P</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>I do understand you, no worries, let me assist you on it :) and thanks! Before we start, please save and close any of your
 personal documents. I would like to inform you that you will be connected on a secure network. I will not be opening any of your personal files or folders.</span></p>
<p><span>10:43 am</span></p>
<p><span>Ma. Francia P</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>In any case you feel uncomfortable with the remote connection, you have the right to disconnect the remote connection right
 away by clicking on the Red X in the applet.</span></p>
<p><span>10:43 am</span></p>
<p><span>Me</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Everything is ready for you.</span></p>
<p><span>10:44 am</span></p>
<p><span>Ma. Francia P</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Great! To start, please use internet explorer, go to
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">support.microsoft.com/help</span></a><span> click on "I
 accept" then use this code: <strong>000000</strong> and click "Connect to technician". Please download and run the applet. That will allow me to have a full remote access on your computer. Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span>10:44 am</span></p>
<p><span>Ma. Francia P</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Hi there! Here is our case number anyway: 1396631589 and as I check here, you have two different types of Office. Can we
 remove that Home and Student 2016?</span></p>
<p><span>10:56 am</span></p>
<p><span>Me</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>You can do whatever is necessary. I want to link to my data files, and after this mess I probably won't use Outlook 2016,
 just get the info in a reliable app.</span></p>
<p><span>10:58 am</span></p>
<p><span>Me</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Do you think MS did a good job with Windows 10? I don't. I think it is a buggy mess with frequent large updates required.
 UGH!</span></p>
<p><span>11:02 am</span></p>
<p><span>Ma. Francia P</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Actually, nowadays, Microsoft do a lots of updates and improvements not only in the Office but mostly is in Windows. That's
 why there is some negative impact still of upgrading while we are in the process. But don't worry, our Research Engineers is on it :) Let me check your Outlook again.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>11:04 am</span></p>
<p><span>Me</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>I put in my gmail password for that account. Should I try Windows 10 password?</span></p>
<p><span>11:05 am</span></p>
<p><span>Me</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>You there?</span></p>
<p><span>11:09 am</span></p>
<p><span>Ma. Francia P</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>It seems it didn't accept neither password. May I ask what data you wish to get? Is that under of Contacts, Inbox or maybe
 Calendars? <br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>11:09 am</span></p>
<p><span>Me</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>The files you see in File manager are the outlook data file and the archive files that I want the data from. Maybe I should
 just open in Excel and forget Outlook?</span></p>
<p><span>11:11 am</span></p>
<p><span>Me</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>It is Contacts and Calendar. I did not use Outlook for email when I quit using Outlook 2003 due to illness in 2014.</span></p>
<p><span>11:19 am</span></p>
<p><span>Ma. Francia P</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Hello. Please check. We already add your data files here.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>11:36 am</span></p>
<p><span>Ma. Francia P</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>And we don't get the credential prompts anymore</span></p>
<p><span>11:36 am</span></p>
<p><span>Me</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>OK, it looks like you have it set up with both my gmail messages and my old data. Since I am not going to use this mess,
 I guess it is OK for now. Does it require a password to log in to Outlook? Do you need you download Office 365 again? It looked like you uninstalled it.</span></p>
<p><span>11:39 am</span></p>
<p><span>Ma. Francia P</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>I just added your old data file there so that you will be able to see the mails :) And nope, no need to put your password
 again. We already eliminate the prompts. Anyway, can I make this case as resolve as your first contact with me?</span></p>
<p><span>11:41 am</span></p>
<p><span>Me</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Looks like you got it. I appreciate your help. I'm sure you can understand that if it takes an expert an hour to set up Outlook,
 I will not use it in the future. I will figure out a way to transfer the data to a reliable app. Maybe I'll try to import into gmail. But, I do not trust this 2016 Outlook to function correctly. Close the case if you want.</span></p>
<p><span>11:44 am</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Ma. Francia P</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>I do understand you, but setting up only needs a correct server Settings for the account works correctly :) and I do appreciate
 you staying along the way.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>11:45 am</span></p>
<p><span>Ma. Francia P</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>No problem Scott</span></p>
<p><span>11:45 am</span></p>
<p><span>Ma. Francia P</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>We are just one click away if you need anything :) Will there still be anything else that I can further assist you today?</span></p>
<p><span>11:45 am</span></p>
<p><span>Me</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>No thanks. I am not upset with you personally. I think MS is getting worse everyday instead of better. Wrong mind-set at
 your company. The world doesn't revolve around MS, but your apps act like they are the only apps in the world. I have already made plans for when Office 365 rental expires. I only use Word and Photo Manager, with the occasional Excel. I am a retired software
 developer and if you can't figure out this stuff and I can't figure out this stuff, then it is very poorly programmed.</span></p>

<h2>            Currently in Insider Preview, Eligible for full upgrade&#63;</h2>
                    Before my upgrade to the windows 10 Insider Preview, I was running windows 8.1 that was verified for eligibility for a full upgrade when the final release of Windows 10 is out. If I'm running the latest build of Preview, how will I know that I am able
 to get the final version when it comes out. Or is it just an update in the windows system by default when it releases on July 29th? Thank you for answers!

            Re:&nbsp; random task assignment<br />
<br />
The following is far from perfect, but can get you close to what you need.<br />
When set up on the worksheet, pressing the F9 key presents a new solution.<br />
You should check for duplicate assignments and unbalanced workloads.<br />
With some manual adjustments you should have something workable.<br />

    <title>How many people can share a shared mailbox in outlook&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wanderlustde  say:</h3>
<h2>            How many people can share a shared mailbox in outlook&#63;</h2>
                    <p>We are an incoming group tour operator located overseas and our customers are located in the US, so almost all of our business is done by email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our team is considering setting up a shared mailbox as a central location to store email conversations sent to and received from customers and service providers before, during, and after their trip. We custom design and run about 400 trips a year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each trip would have its own unique folder in this shared mailbox according to year and trip code.<br />
</p>
<p>Are there limitations on users? 25 people would need to access the shared mailbox.
</p>
<p>They all have their own exchange licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are the other limitations?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for your help.</p>

<p><span>Hi WanderlustDE,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Your time is appreciated. The maximum number of subfolders should be 10000. You can refer the link below:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The shared mailbox data is stored on server side. If your Outlook is in cache mode, the shared mailbox will cached local. And it will sync with server side. If you have a large shared mailbox, it will take more time to sync your data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Are you using the same version of Office?</p>
<p>If no, then I wouldn't transfer the toolbar files.</p>
<p>If yes, and you've created the toolbar manually and you're using xl2003 or<br />
older, then...</p>
<p>Go back to the old computer<br />
start excel<br />
make a minor change to a toolbar<br />
Close excel<br />
look for a file named *.xlb with the correct last date updated time/date<br />
property.<br />
(use windows search)</p>
<p>Copy that file (to a thumbdrive???)</p>
<p>Then go to the new pc<br />
Do the same thing</p>
<p>Then look for that *.xlb file.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Copy that *.xlb file to the folder that holds that just modifed version of the<br />
*.xlb file.</p>
<p>======<br />
If you're using different versions of office, then don't do this.&nbsp; The icons<br />
don't always do the same thing between versions.</p>
<p>In fact, I'd say go back to the old pc and do a print screen (as a reminder of<br />
what icons you've used in the past).</p>
<p>Then go to the new pc and do the Tools|Customize stuff.</p>
<p>You'll find that you'll have icons that you really don't need to add and even<br />
better, you'll find that you have more choices to add to your toolbar -- invest<br />
a little time to skim through all the new (and old) tool icons.</p>
<p>========<br />
As for MSWord, I <u>think</u> the manually modified toolbars are kept in your<br />
normal.dot file.&nbsp; But again, don't copy the old one over if you're not using the<br />
exact version of office.</p>
<p>========</p>
<p>ps.&nbsp; Don't forget any personal.xl* workbooks that you may have created on the<br />
old pc!</p>

<h2>            Office 365 and Windows Live account clash stopping log in</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>before the moderator directs me to another similar question, please don't--I've read everything I can see on here and nothing has worked. I've also tried contacting support, and keep getting pushed from support department to support department. I hope someone
 can help. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have a Windows Live account - my old Hotmail account. I have an Office 365 account. The email address for my O365 account is setup as an alias for my Windows Live account, and so I logon to both systems using the same email address with different passwords.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>All of a sudden (apropos of nothing) my Windows Live login has stopped working. I receive the following error message</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You're currently signed in with a Microsoft account as *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, but that account can't be used with Outlook Web App. Please sign out of your Microsoft account, then sign in to Outlook Web App with the account you use to read your organization's email.

<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have tried reading widely, logging off everywhere, clearing caches, using InPrivate tabs, different computers ... *everything* ... but still get the same message everytime I try. I can logon to mail.office365.com and those other Office-related services
 using the Office 365 account details, but that doesn't help me. I have a calendar published to my Windows Live account from Outlook at work, and the inability to logon has stopped that calendar updating ... which is screwing my calendar across all of my devices
 (including Surface Pro 2 which is otherwise great). </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please help someone...</p>

                    <p>I have an office 365 business premium account &amp; have a SharePoint calendar (the only thing I am using SharePoint for) &amp; a couple of weeks ago, it just stopped working on iPhones using the SharePoint mobile app. It works fine via website URL or through Outlook
 (on desktops), but the iPhone app is necessary! I am currently being told by Microsoft that it is a Godaddy problem &amp; they can't help me, but I've spent waaaay too long going in circles with godaddy &amp; need some results!</p>
<p>Iphones are all 7 with IOS 10.x.x or 11.x.x versions</p>
<p>What has broken the mobile app for SharePoint &amp; how do I fix it???</p>

<h2>            IE8 does not remember wireless LAN settings</h2>
                    Upon booting up my laptop, IE8 cannot connect to the internet, while Firefix does. Every time I start my computer with Windows 7 Pro, I have to click on Tools, Internet Option, Connections, LAN settings, and click on "Automatically Detect Settings" for
 IE 8 to connect to the Internet. Unfortunately it does not remember this setting after I shut down the computer. Firefox always connects&nbsp;to the internet right away with no problem...

<p>Hello again,</p>
<p>Here are the anwers to your questions:</p>
<p>I ran the Microsoft anti-malware program; I chose the "deeper" check and it ran for a few hours and found nothing.</p>
<p>My&nbsp;other laptop is&nbsp;about 4 years old, a Dell D620 running Windows XP Pro, and the LAN settings are NOT set to 'Detect Automatically" and Internet Explorer 8 works just fine on that one. A long while ago when the problem was first occuring, I painstakingly
 checked every parameter (laptops side by side) and found no settings difference that I could see (the menus are slightly different in Win XP vs. Win 7).</p>
<p>In response to some of PA Bear's earlier comments: I re-installed Outlook connector, as well as&nbsp;the drivers for Broadcom and WLAN from Dell's driver download and re-booted every time. No change... the problem is still there.</p>
<p>I also connected the computer by cable to the router and started it up. The problem was still the same. Earlier this spring when the problem first occured, I had tried to connect directly to the modem, with no succes. I still had to go into Internet Explorer
 and change the Lan settings every time I boot up.</p>
<p>I still have to read Kai's suggeted readings but any ideas as to how to remove left-over codes from Norton would be welcome: I remember that altough I uninstalled it after getting my computer back from the Win 7 installation, PA Bear had mentioned that it
 still could have left some residiual stuff that could be creating my problem.</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>
<p>&nbsp;Addendum: I read the information contained in the links, but was not able to see any clue as to the cause of my problem.</p>
<p>However upon thinking some more about the suggestion that the problem might be caused by another program and that I should check that all the Dell drivers were up to date,&nbsp;I re-installed the drivers for the WiFi card as mentioned before.</p>
<p>A while later&nbsp;I tried deleting the Dell QuickSet&nbsp;utility program and re-installing&nbsp;the most recent version which I downloaded from Dell.</p>
<p>After re-booting, the problem has disappeared!!</p>
<p>Thank you again for your help, and I hope that this solution may be of help to others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Addendum; added Aug 31st 2010:</p>
<p>Just to let everyone know that my IE 8&nbsp;is still running fine... but now&nbsp;without the "Automatically detect&nbsp;settings" box having to be checked.... I didn't change that setting, so go figure! Before, I had to check the "Automatically detect&nbsp;settings" box for
 my IE8 to connect to my home page, but now I don't... and I didn't uncheck it myself. Before, the setting did not stay activated or checked after rebooting, but now it doesn't seem to matter.</p>
<p>I repeat : I&nbsp;did not change anything after the above re-installation of QuickSet and after which the problem disappeared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing I can see that may have be related&nbsp;to this "intermittent" problem is the fact that I travel and login to various hotel WiFi Networks, and this is only to put in a password and clicking on "accept conditions"; nothing else, no tweaking of Internet
 connections setup or anything else.... just a&nbsp;simple logon.</p>
<p>So now the problem has disappeared again without any obvious reason or any direct intervention on my part. Thank you,&nbsp;Microsoft, for your wonderful programming changes done 'behind the scenes', you&nbsp;seem to be modifying things without the customer's awareness
 and creating problems that come and go away by themselves. Either that or you have created a very unstable program. No wonder people switch to Apple.</p>

...the non-Dell Win7 "upgrade" path you used&nbsp;may have something to do with all this, too, especially&nbsp;since it wasn't an In-Place upgrade. Laptops (and especially three-year-old Dell laptops) can be particularly finnicky when it comes to a clean install of Windows
 (especially when a Norton application's thrown into the mix). At best, you'd want to make very sure that your wireless card's drivers were not only Win7-compatible but Dell hardware-compatible as well.<br />
&lt;/QP&gt;<br />
Source: My post above w/timestamp Wednesday, April 21, 2010 5:54 PM</p>
<p>My gut instinct still tells me&nbsp;that above may have something to do with this.</p>
<p>Then again, "[the] fact that&nbsp;you do not have problems with Firefox or mail accounts accessed in OL via POP3 (I assume) but only&nbsp;with&nbsp;Internet Explorer, (Windows Live?) Messenger and when accessing your Hotmail account in OL via Outlook Connector" remains
 a real head-scratcher (that Norton application notwithstanding).</p>
<p>Good luck. Perhaps Kai will have some more ideas or someone in the Networking forum?</p>

    <title>MS Word style cannot set particular font size - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MS Word style cannot set particular font size</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
I have an MS Word document with a paragraph style. It has font size set to 10pt. However, when I apply it to the text in the document (which has size of 12pt), the font size of this text does not change for some reason (it stays 12pt). But what's more interesting,
 when I change font size for the style to 9pt or 11pt, the font size of the text in the document does change! What's happening?..</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
Steps to reproduce:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Open&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ukefdh8wr8zkvs1/style%20problem.docx?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the
 example document</a>&nbsp;in Word 2016</li><li>
Select word "consectetur" in the first line</li><li>
See how it has size 12 and associated style "Code sample"</li><li>
Open "Modify Style" dialog for the "Code sample" style</li><li>
See how it has font size set to 10pt</li><li>
Change font size for the style to 9pt</li><li>
Click OK on the dialog</li><li>
See how size of the selected word changed to 9pt</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
The font is Courier New. If I set the size to 10pt explicitly, it works.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
What the hell? What's so special about 10pt size? Why this particular size is ignored?</p>

<p>If you modify the document default font size so that it matches the font size of the Normal style, you can successfully set the point size of
<strong>Code sample</strong> to whatever value you like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recent versions of Word have a connection between the document defaults (in the Manage Styles dialog box) and the Normal style which usually becomes apparent only in table cells. However, your document illustrates that this is relevant also in other situations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, was the document originally created in Word for Windows or in some other program? (There is a style called "apple-converted-space" which suggests a different origin.)</p>

<p>Hello ShashidharBalachandra,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just want to verify, when you said quitting and reopening the app, are you pertaining to just simply exiting and relaunching the app again? If yes, what you can do next is to logout and log back in to OneNote to avoid authentication
 problems. If you need more information about resetting your credentials you can check this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fix-sync-issues-in-onenote-for-ios-or-android-3d7fd4e9-0fb9-4983-9853-b61b263b0f78" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft article</a></strong>. If that doesn’t help, you can uninstall and reinstall the OneNote app. To uninstall
 and reinstall the OneNote app, you can follow these steps:</p>

<h2>            Varied Resource Allocation to Single Task</h2>
                    <p>I have a resource scheduled to work on a single task but the percentage allocation will vary during the time they're assigned. For example, from May to July, the resource will be 20% allocated to Task A. From August to September, they will be 50% allocated
 to Task A. Finally, from October to December, they will be 100% allocated to Task A. How would I accomplish this in MS Project (I'm using 2010)?</p>

            <p>First assign the resource at 100%, which is the default.</p>
<p>Then use the task usage view to edit the work on each day.</p>
<p>Assuming an 8 hour day, you need 1/5 x 8 hours = 1.6 hours.</p>
<p>Before editing the work, set the task to be fixed duration with effort driven off.</p>
<p>This will ensure that the duration does not change when you edit the work.</p>
<p>Then 4 hours each day, then 8 hours each day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, are you sure that you want to have just one long task.</p>
<p>Would it not be better to make it three separate tasks of shorter duration?</p>

            <p>OK this&nbsp;formula calculates the week number (even [dare I say it] better than the inbuilt excel function)... I'll explain why&nbsp;first, take a look at how the function handles the weeks between 2010 and 2011...</p>
<p>Take =WEEKNUM([<em>serial num</em>],[{1,2}]) which is the Excel Function for US week numbering, should week 53 be week 1? or is there only 1 day in week 1 of the US calendar this year? (some years do have full 53 weeks in them&nbsp;eg the end of this year...)</p>

<p>This is&nbsp;tested from 1972 to 2071 and are no problems for these years.</p>
<p>To pull the week day starting from Saturday then this part of the equation is used...</p>
<p>=IF(WEEKDAY(<strong>B5</strong>,1)+1=8,1,WEEKDAY(<strong>B5</strong>,1)+1)</p>
<p>So with this in mind you could use this in part of the week number calculation - say the date is in B5, the week day is in C5, then&nbsp;in D5 put the following&nbsp;formula to calculate the week number :</p>
<p>=INT((<strong>B5</strong>-<strong>C5</strong>-DATE(YEAR(<strong>B5</strong>+4-<strong>C5</strong>),1,4))/7)+2</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Mail Merge not working in Word 2011</h2>
                    Hi all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The following problem is stopping me from doing my job so any help or direction to the right post will be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Background:&nbsp;</div>
<div>Just bought a Macbook Pro, installed Office 2011 as part of Office 365 package. Have been using Office 2007 on Windows Vista laptop for last couple of years. Have a spread sheet in Excel which is data source for a mail merge (directory type) in word.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Problem:</div>
<div>Trying to do the same mail merge on the mac in Word 2011 using the an Excel 2011 copy of the datasource, but the merge is not working. I used to filter a column that would select the records to input into the final merged document, but when I try to set
 up this simple filter now I get the following message:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<span>Word could not merge the main document with the data source because the data records were empty or
<span>Word could not merge the main document with the data source because the data records were empty or
 no data records matched your query options.</span>
<div><br />
</div>

            The other answer is a good work around, but the fact that my first row was empty never occurred to me. &nbsp;I scrolled up and voila, I had miss-numbered an entry and it ended up as the first row when I sorted.&nbsp;

    <title>Multiple Attachments in Publisher Email Mail Merge Does Not Work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> colin b halliday  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple Attachments in Publisher Email Mail Merge Does Not Work</h2>
                    <p>When using Publisher 2010 or earlier, you may set up the publication to mail merge with a list of recipients and send each an email of the publication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Options section of the "Merge to E-mail" dialog allows you to attach MULTIPLE files to be sent with the email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However it only ever sends the topmost attachment in the list of attachments, never any more than one attachment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hello George, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Auto-save feature help in minimizing the possibility of losing your work during a crash. For Android devices, there is no option for you to change the interval but as long as you make changes to the file the auto-save feature periodically saves the changes.
 You can try and observe the feature if you use Excel on android again. </p>

                    <p>I can understand the need for a 50,000 files limit between Groove Music and OneDrive.&nbsp; This isn't my problem though.<br />
<br />
I'm transferring from Rhapsody to fully integrate my Xbox One, Windows 10 and Windows Phone experience.&nbsp; However, I've built-up an extensive track list and after paying for the Groove Music service, began porting over the list.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
NOTE:&nbsp; These are simply My Music links, no downloads to One Drive or local music folders as of yet.<br />
<br />
I'm finding that my main Groove Music app will add tracks well past the 50,000 track limit.&nbsp; However, when I log-in to my Groove account on the Xbox One or another Windows 10 system running the Groove Music app, the 50,000 track limit still applies for some
 reason.<br />
<br />
It seems like the 50,000 limit on files is bleeding over into the Apps on Xbox One and Windows 10.&nbsp; As these are simply My Music / Favorites links, I feel that this limit is arbitrary for simple streaming links.</p>
<p><br />
I would like to see what I can do to add a Product Suggestion to have this limit for the Xbox Groove Apps removed for streaming links.&nbsp; I don't care about the 50k limit for downloadable files as that's the reason I went to paid&nbsp;streaming&nbsp;solely through music
 services like Groove Music or Rhapsody.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your view of this and I hope to at least add to the conversation about how to make Groove Music a more solid option versus other streaming music services.&nbsp; Have an excellent day!</p>
