<h2>            How do I set background color of several cells in the row as a function of values in a column&#63;</h2>
                    <p>You guys are great!&nbsp; I have created a golf weekly report for the McInnis Men's Club it includes names, new handicaps, Last Gross score, Last Low Net, Last Game played, Dollars won, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to high lite a player if he has not played the last week. I have a column with the Team number for each player. If the number is 0 then he didn't play and I want to high lite his row with a light grey background. I now do it manually but I'm sure
 there is a better way.&nbsp; I've tried, =IF(H1=0,B1: I1 "grey") but it didn't work.&nbsp; Also, I've tried conditional formatting but don't know how to change a background color of a range, (B1:I1), to grey if H1 is 0..&nbsp; I've attached both a PDF file and excel file
 of my current spreadsheet. I'm not sure if they came through or not.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            Having serious connection drop issues on My RT-AC3200 Wireless</h2>
                    <p>I have Comcast 125MB Download and 20MB Upload speeds but my ASUS RT-AC3200 wireless routter keeps dropping connections and making my wireless network very unstable. It was an expensive unit and I was hoping for much better performance from a top of the line
 unit like this. I know it's fairly new so the Firmware updates are still in developement but I keep hoping for a new firmware update that will help solve this issue. It drops connections all throughout the day. I don't know if it has something to do with us
 using the AUTO on the channel selection or using the Adaptive QOS but something isn;t working right because my phone and everyone elses wireless devices are always losing connection. This is especially a problem with several apps that require a steady connection
 like Clash of Clans which disconnects very often and is the easiest app to notice the constant disconnections due to it's high sensitivity to unstable internet connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If ASUS Techs could please look into the RT-AC3200 connection problems and get out a great firmware update that helps stabilize it as soon as possible or give us some good feedback as to what settings are best for a stable connection that would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks - www.djemir.com&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook Email Not Syncing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deborah slattery  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Email Not Syncing</h2>
                    As of the last upgrade, my Outlook email is not syncing properly. For the past few days and up until this morning, my Spam and Inbox weren't syncing but my Sent and Trash were. As of this morning though, my Spam is syncing, but my Trash isn't. If I restart
 the Outlook app, the messages that I was able to see on my PC but not on my cell suddenly appear on my cell, but if I want to see further emails coming in through during the day, I have to restart the app each and every time. I have tried uninstalling and
 then reinstalling Outlook and it doesn't fix the problem. I have checked everything I know to check such as sync schedule etc. Is anyone else having this problem with Outlook email on their cell phone?

            It didn't fix it. I have a Samsung Galaxy s6. When I chose Settings-General&gt;Mobile Devices on Outlook, there was no cell number, but rather just the word "OK" listed which was also how it appeared in the link with instructions to fix sync issues but I
 thought it was strange why a specific cell phone number wasn't listed. Why is that? I then clicked on the trash can to delete the partnership anyway, clicked on Save, and then powered off my phone. I restarted it, went to settings in Outlook on the phone and
 did a reset of Outlook at the bottom of the page where you are instructed to click if you are syncing issues and that will reset Outlook and my mail still has not synced. I also tried sending a test email to my email address which is a Hotmail address and
 it did not arrive in my cell phone Outlook email inbox but it did on my PC.&nbsp; Re the question about how the acct is set up as far as IMAP Exchange Pop, I'm afraid I don't know what that means.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            To add to my last reply, in Outlook Settings &gt; Sync Email &gt; Pop Option &gt; Let Devices and Apps Use POP, it is marked No. The POP Setting says Access Disabled. Under IMAP it lists the server and port etc.

            It didn't work so I am removing the Outlook app from my cell phone. No one should have to spend the amt of time that I and so many others with this problem have had to spend and/or perform the number of checks and/or work arounds to simply be able to access
 their email from their phone. Microsoft made it impossible for me to use MSN as my home page on my PC because I had Adblock Plus and now with these issues with their email app on the cell phone, I'm bailing on them. Thanks for your time and responsiveness
 though.

            <p>At some point, when the display settings were moved from Control Panel to the Settings App, the checkbox to Shuffle the desktop slideshow pictures was no longer included.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been suggesting this in the Feedback App every time they release a new build that continues to have this feature absent, but it seems that no one is listening...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's frustrating, since every time I upgrade to the next build, and every time I set the desktop background to SlideShow, it always returns to the FIRST image in the series. And since the pictures are displayed in the exact same order, I have to right-click
 on the desktop and click on 'next desktop background' almost TWENTY TIMES to get to where I was before.</p>
<p>
Losing this feature is detrimental for us who have hundreds of desktop images we'd like to shuffle between, which gives the desktop a fresh look every time, where there's a little surprise every day, seeing a new nature or city view...</p>

    <title>Stop auto correction and auto formatting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sandram12  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stop auto correction and auto formatting</h2>
                    Excel likes to correct text that I type and to turn the text into dates, e.g. "2/2013" is turned into "Feb 2013". Unfortunately I'm not entering a date but something that could be viewed as a date, but it is in fact something else. So I want to turn off
 this auto formatting.<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I know that it is possible to format cells as 'text'. I have a lot of different spreadsheets and formatting&nbsp;hundreds&nbsp;or thousands of rows and columns seems like a waste of time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I know that it is possible to a add a leading apostrophe. This is a lot of extra typing. In addition I sometimes forget to add the apostrophe in front of my text. So this solution results in extra work because I have to proofread the spreadsheet after
 I have entered the numbers making sure that I added the&nbsp;apostrophe&nbsp;to each cell.</div>

<div>I have used Excel for over 17 years now and have never ever needed the auto format feature. Is it possible to turn this feature off on my computer? I want to to turn it off in the settings dialog or the windows registry on time . The result should be that
 for all spreadsheets I ever edit on my computer the feature will be turned off. There should be no auto formatting ever on my computer for cells formatted as general.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've searched the web and found&nbsp;hundreds&nbsp;of forum entries by people wishing to do the same, but no solution.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is it possible or do I have to live with the auto format?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If it is not possible, where can I submit a feature request?</div>
                </div>

            <p>Thank you for your feedback. The short answer is - no at this time. The feature is designed with the assumption in most cases, when people type date-like strings (or time-like, or number-like), they would want them to be typed as that data type. Auto-formatting
 does more than formatting - it determines the type of the data, and that in turns typically gives better experience and functionality around the inpout that you typed (e.g. you can do arithmetic on numbers; you can sort dates by their calendar order; you cannot
 do all of this on text).&nbsp;For the minority of cases, like yours, where the date-like input is actually not dates, there are the two options that you mention. Formatting cells as text can be done in bulk (entire ranges, columns, rows or sheets), so should not
 be very time consuming, although of course it does take an extra step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although this feature is not currently available in Excel, Microsoft is committed to continuously improving your experience with our products. This feature is now in our list of desired features.</p>

            I still can't do this - I have no option to change incoming calls. I think the software must be faulty. It's annoying because by the time you hear the phone it's too late.

            <span>Hi PaPla,<br />
<br />
To pay your Office 365 subscription by invoice, your subscription needs to cost over a certain amount of money (this amount varies by service location). So if your subscription is under a certain amount of money in your location, it is not possible to pay by
 invoice and you can only pay by credit card as said in the article below.<br />

<p>Hi Edward,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for query in our forum. I assume you want to create a diagram in Visio after you import the data from Excel. But after my test, I have the same result as yours. (I created a Cross Functional Flowchart in Visio first. Then create
 a Excel file with the data you provided. Last I click Quick Import in the Visio. )
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Visio won’t create a diagram when you just import the data. If you want to create a diagram in Visio, you need to click the shapes from the left collection(Shape Data window) then drag the data from External Data to the shapes. After
 you doing like this, the Data Graphic Fields starts to activate. To better help you, I want to share a article with you, it may help you understand how to

<p>In office program, there is no option for "update now". (only three options left, missing the most top update now choice).</p>
<p>And I have also enabled the Windows update to update other Microsoft applications.
</p>
<p>I have rebooted my machine couple times, and manually click on "check for updates" for windows update times. Nothing happened.</p>
<p>Downloaded office 2013 SP1, (proplussp2013-kb2817430-fullfile-x86-en-us), give me prompts that "There are no products affected by this package installed on this system".</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 new exchange account creation issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 new exchange account creation issue</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've just switched to the newest Outlook 2016 in Windows 10 Pro. I'm trying to set up my e-mail account and it fails with the "This action cannot be completed. The connection to Microsoft Exchange is unavailable. Outlook must be online or connected to complete
 this action".</p>
<p>However, I can successfully connect using same auto discover settings from: my iPhone &amp; iPad iOS Outlook app, OS X Outlook app (2015), iOS Boxer app, OWA, android Mail app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, basically, the only configuration that does NOT work is Windows + Outlook. this really sounds ridiculous, but it is how it is.</p>
<p>Any advises on how to address this? Or my idea to try to switch to windows from mac was really bad at its core?</p>

<p>Hi AndreyStukalenko,<br />
<br />
This issue could be related to multiple factors, so I suggest you follow the steps below to troubleshooting this issue:<br />
1. As you just switched to Windows 10 system, some system files might be corrupted during the updating process, so I suggest you run a tool to scan the integrity of all the system files and replace possibly corrupted files.<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</a></p>
<p>2. To identify if there are add-ins in Outlook client which lead to this issue, firstly start Outlook client in safe mode.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; For Windows 10, click Start, and then in the Search dialog box type in Outlook.exe /safe .<br />
If Outlook launches in safe mode.<br />
&nbsp; 1) Click File, then click Options, and then click Add-Ins.<br />
&nbsp; 2) Select COM Add-ins, and then click Go.<br />
&nbsp; 3) Click to clear all the check boxes in the list, and then click OK.<br />
&nbsp; 4) Restart Outlook, but not in safe mode.<br />
If Outlook starts and the error does not appear, this indicates a conflict with an add-in. Begin adding the add-ins one at a time, restarting with each add-in that is enabled. This will allow you to figure out which add-in is causing the issue.</p>
<p>3. If the issue persists when starting up in safe mode, you can refer to the article below to repair you Outlook client.<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Repair an Office application</a><br />

<p>Now it "allowed" me to add the account, all verification passed and it said that "Outlook must be restarted to apply changes". However, the new account did not appear in the list and after restart, outlook failed with "The connection to Microsoft Exchange
 is unavailable. Outlook must be online or connected to complete this action". </p>
<p>And the "added" account still is not on the list after restart.</p>
<p>Again, I have MB Pro with OS X El Captain and Outlook 365 for Mac open just to the left and everything works there. I've even tried to delete this account and add it again - it worked with no issues. But not for Windows version of the Outlook.

<p>Hi AndreyStukalenko,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
Since you have run all the tests above, and the issue persists, I will suggest you use the Office 365 Support and Recovery Assistant tool to help troubleshoot this issue. The tool will check your Outlook client and setting. It may find out the error of the
 client or other settings of your account and will return some error message or suggested solution. Please refer to the article below to download and use the tool.<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Using-the-Office-365-Support-and-Recovery-Assistant-12cd632c-d672-4782-b0ce-beb82b511525" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Using the Office 365 Support and Recovery Assistant</a><br />
<br />
if this tool returns with error message or still can’t resolve the issue, please post back with the detailed error message for further assistance.<br />

<h2>            Deploy Office Add-ins from Office 365</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to deploy (a test version of) a custom Office Add-In following&nbsp;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Deploy-Office-Add-ins-in-the-Office-365-admin-center-preview-737e8c86-be63-44d7-bf02-492fa7cd9c3f?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in my Admin Center (the new preview), in the Settings menu, there is no "Services &amp; add-ins" menu, only an "Apps" menu. However, this menu (or any other available menu) doesn't have the "Add an Office Add-In" option as mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am aware that there are other options to deploy add-ins, but this option seemed the best for having selected end users testing the add-in (without having to access the Trust Center etc. on their machines).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to web sites using IE11 and Chrome after recent Windows security update. Error&#58; &#34;This page can&#39;t be displayed&#34;.</h2>
                    <p>Good morning,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using an HP laptop with Win 7. My preferred browser is IE11 but I also use Firefox and Chrome for testing purposes - I am a web developer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the recent (a few days ago) Windows update I found that IE11 could not connect to any websites - failed with a message "This page can't be displayed". I was still able to use Firefox and Chrome to connect. A couple of days later I received an update
 notification to Chrome so I applied that and now Chrome no longer accesses websites, failing with a message "Unable to access the network". Firefox still works but is also giving me notifications that it has an update ready and I'm really afraid to apply this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also downloaded Safari and it was unable to connect to any websites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>E-mail works fine and I can "ping" various websites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried at home and in a coffee shop with the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reset the IE11 default settings and I do not have a proxy server enabled</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recall having this or a similar problem about a year ago and eventually fixed it but I can't remember what I did...sigh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd really appreciate some suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tony</p>

    <title>Windows 10 and Outlook 2013 &#40;365&#41;, Constant permission denied - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eric kal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 and Outlook 2013 &#40;365&#41;, Constant permission denied to single pst file with previous fixes applied</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here is the case, and do apologize for being a similar thread but it seems warranted due to the unique regularity of the issue. I have a client that decided to hap-hazardly upgrade his primary work laptop to Windows 10, and seemed to get the brunt of
 every bug in Windows 10. The main issue which doesn't want to go away is the pst file in Outlook after 5-10 minutes or so / closing and re-launching of the program, give the error " Cannot start Microsoft Outlook. Cannot open the Outlook windows. The set of
 folders cannot be opened. File access is denied. You do not have the permission required to access the file c:\user\~user~\Documents\Outlook Files\Outlook (1).pst"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll list the current problems that the system has had in order as I'm unsure of the relevance to the problem but all occurred after the update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driver errors (Fixed)</p>
<p>User directory tree permission error / corruption (fixed)</p>
<p>Start menu and taskbar virtualization failure (fixed)</p>
<p>Outlook unable to launch application / load Outlook(1).pst due to multiple databases open {supposed SQL issue despite having no SQL system running} (fixed)</p>
<p>Outlook&nbsp;Denied PST (unresolved with previous posted fixes)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have applied the fixes to both the permissions and the compatibility of "run as admin" with no long term fixes. The permission issue I have replaced every old permission / owner ship setting three times over in which it works for a time then goes back
 to the same problem. I have back tracked off of the "Outlook" system account to the local account, and I have reinstalled Office 365 once with the web installer which gave me a few restarts of the system before it reverted to the same problem again. &nbsp;I was
 unable to install the 64 bit version the last time I attempted to push a fresh install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything that comes to mind, and more but due to the constraints by the user of "retain all the data from the Outlook(1).pst account" I would have just made a new profile as the other 4 accounts work with out issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last thing that I have as an option is to do a system revert, but I figured I would through this issue to more versed people with Microsoft Outlook products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any input that can be offered.</p>

            <p>Hi TeK Knight</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do apologize for the delay in the response and follow up with the end results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The client and myself did attempt the method you mentioned with no changes in the response of the account. (I'm pretty sure that Office 365 Outlook wasn't even letting us proceed past the account initialization without any account details.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end what the client ended up doing on his own was used outlook to copy emails from one account to another dummy account to hold the old emails while creating a totally new account in outlook and .pst file and then moved all the old emails back into
 the new account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the creation of a totally new account the issues that the client was having has since stopped with no aftereffects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again thanks for your help and Merry Christmas.</p>

    <title>When my phone is away from WiFi for more than 1 day, only pictures - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gfordham  say:</h3>
<h2>            When my phone is away from WiFi for more than 1 day, only pictures take on the last day will auto upload to OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>I am experiencing a problem that appears to repro 100% of the time.&nbsp; The problem is that only photos taken on the same day that I have WiFi connectivity are uploaded to OneDrive, anything taken on previous days are not uploaded.&nbsp; Here is&nbsp;a repro:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Over a period of 2 days do not connect Windows Phone to WiFi.</p>
<p>2) Over this 2 days, take pictures on both days (phone is set to auto upload to OneDrive highest quality (requires WiFi).</p>
<p>3) On the 2nd day, connect phone to WiFi</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you connect the phone to WiFi, only pictures taken on the same day (the 2nd day) will upload to OneDrive.&nbsp; Pictures taken on the first day are not uploaded and the phone says there are no pending uploads.&nbsp; No imagine this on a 2 week trip!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that pictures taken on previous days are uploaded later, during some kind of scheduled task on the phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi George,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This appears to be a bug with the OneDrive sync feature. &nbsp;Can you add your vote to one of items in the Windows Phone section on the User Voice site? &nbsp;I suggestion this one,
<strong><a href="https://windowsphone.uservoice.com/forums/101801-feature-suggestions/suggestions/6498038-proper-sync-for-photos-backup-to-onedrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Proper sync for Photos backup to Onedrive">Proper sync for Photos backup to Onedrive</a></strong>, it
 has over 200 votes on it now. &nbsp;Be sure to include the text that you posted here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the auto upload is not going to work, I would suggest connecting your phone to a PC and copy the pictures from the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft and other companies use the User Voice site to solicit bug reports and feature suggestions from the end users.</p>

    <title>Internet Explorer Mobile Favourites disappearing over time - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andy patrick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer Mobile Favourites disappearing over time</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to synchronise Favourites between my home PC (Windows Vista Ultimate, Internet Explorer 8, Sync Center), my phone (HTC Touch HD with Windows Mobile 6.1) and my work PC (Windows XP SP3, Internet Explorer 7, ActiveSync 4.5).<br />
<br />
<strong>Important note</strong>: the same problem used to occur on my old phone (MDA Compact II with Windows Mobile 5.0) and I first reported the issue three years ago, didn't get an answer and gave up. The internet on my new phone is much more usable and useful,&nbsp;so
 I would very much like a fix now.<br />
<br />
Basically what happens is that I add Favourites to my Mobile Favourites folder on one or other PC, sync to the phone, and everything appears to be fine... to begin with. At some point over the next few days (and the next few syncs), Favourites will disappear
 from that folder one or two at a time - usually from one or other PC first, then from the phone - until finally there's a bunch of empty folders but no Favourites.<br />
<br />
I mentioned this issue recently in&nbsp;the thread at <a href="http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsmobile/thread/9a4c1ca4-9016-4fcc-829c-125f27323c18#page:2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsmobile/thread/9a4c1ca4-9016-4fcc-829c-125f27323c18#page:2</a>&nbsp;but another issue took focus so I am reporting it here separately. In that thread, I mentioned that on my work PC, I created ten "test" Favourites,
 and by the time I got home, only seven remained on the phone to get synched with my&nbsp;home PC&nbsp;(the first three, alphabetically, had disappeared). They've now all gone, from both phone and both PCs. I've not&nbsp;yet nailed down exactly when they disappear, but strongly
 suspect it happens on a sync.<br />
<br />
I'm not at work at the moment, but have attempted to repeat the test at home. I've created ten Favourites on my home PC and synched several times. So far, all ten test Favourites remain on both home PC and phone. So it may be an ActiveSync 4.5 or Windows XP
 issue - but that's just conjecture at this point.<br />
<br />
<em>However</em>, I have noted that the phone itself has a whole bunch of additional Favourites that have never made it as far as either PC. I am not sure whether they came as Mobile IE Favouries with the phone, but suspect they began life as Mobile Opera Bookmarks
 (because I know the phone comes with Mobile Opera as the default browser) - in either case they are Mobile IE Favourites now, but do not get synchronised onto either PC, despite being in the same folder (on my phone) as my test Favourites.<br />
<br />
I have done any number of soft resets and would be open to setting up any test cases as required. However, I'm not going to perform a hard reset "just to see if it fixes it" as was suggested in the other thread - it affected my old phone too, so is not specific
 to my phone and won't be fixed by a hopeful hard reset.</p>

            Like you, I have had problems in the past syncing Mobile Favorites.&nbsp; I sync 7 devices over 6 PCs and there was always an issue syncing the mobile favorites.&nbsp; I would delete a favorite, sync and in a day or so it would reappear and visa versa as well.&nbsp;
 It was a huge pain.<br />
<br />
Eventually I deleted all of my Mobile Favorites and then created one folder on one PC with all of the favorites I wanted.&nbsp; I then copied the folder to the other PCs and performed a sync with all my devices.&nbsp; It seemed to work but I must admit that I have kept
 the favorites to a minimum. <br />
<br />
The issue you have with them slowly being deleted is somewhat baffling as to why that occurs.<br />

            Many thanks for your response. Just one bit I need clarification on please:<br />
<br />
<em>&gt; Eventually I deleted all of my Mobile Favorites and then created one folder on one PC with all of the favorites I wanted.&nbsp; I then copied the folder to the other PCs and performed a sync with all my devices.<br />
<br />
</em>When you say you "created one folder on one PC"... as a Favourites folder, or a standard file-containing folder that was synched with the devices using file sync instead of Favourites sync?

            If you open up your Favorites Folder on your PC, there is a folder inside that is called Mobile Favorites.<br />
<br />
Once I had the Mobile favorites just as I wanted it, I copied that folder to my other PCs.&nbsp; I've not had an issue since (although I'll be honest, I don't use it a lot).

            Thanks for your suggestion. As I understand what you're saying, it's not really any different to carrying around a USB storage key with my Favourites on it and copying them from one machine to another (except the phone replaces the USB key), which is basically
 what I did&nbsp;when I was using&nbsp;my old phone. Not really "synchronised" in any automated sense, and if a Favourite is added in one location, it doesn't appear in all the others unless you add it to each yourself. As my new phone has significantly more powerful
 internet features than my old phone, this isn't really enough for me this time, though I can quite understand why you're satisfied with it. Perhaps someone else has some thoughts?<br />
<br />
On the plus side, the ten "test" Favourites that I created yesterday&nbsp;on my home PC still exist on both my phone and home PC, suggesting that the problem is probably related to ActiveSync 4.5 and/or Windows XP (which is what I'm using at work, and haven't synched
 these test Favourites to yet). The ones created on my phone still haven't synched to the home PC yet though.<br />
<br />
It does seem to be another feature that hasn't had even the most basic test coverage, though. Nor, given the complexities of a Windows Mobile device, does it seem to be the most complex feature... next to the modern miracles of GPS and TV through your mobile,
 you'd think "keeping the same 1KB files in three places" would be pretty trivial.

<br />
In essence yes.&nbsp; It was just a one copy and transfer to all PCs that I was using.&nbsp; After that I have just been using the syncing process.&nbsp; I think in my case that I had so many PCs and devices and had so many changes that somehow never seemed to catch up in
 the very strange sync process I use.&nbsp; ( I really need to think about using Exchange).<br />
<br />
I believe that if you do it once, that it should work .... at least I hope so.

            Unfortunately, I am still seeing the same problem when I sync with more than one PC. It's fine synching my home PC to my phone, but as soon as my work PC gets involved as well, Favourites start disappearing. This happens even if I first "force the issue"
 by copying the Favourites over manually.<br />
<br />
Perhaps someone else can make a suggestion, as this is something that Jack has already given up on, on his own phone? (Can't expect him to help me get it working on mine if it defeated him :-). Perhaps someone from Microsoft can explain how to make this very
 simple feature work?

            I'd like to thank Jack again for attempting to offer an alternative method but unfortunately I'm still losing Favourites and it's still adversely affecting the usability of my device. And, despite reporting this a week ago, there's still no response from
 MS.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else seen this? Does anyone know how to fix it? Can anyone from MS explain what is happening and how to fix it?

            Thanks for the suggestion. Unfortunately, the number of times my phone has synched, unchecked the sync, soft resetted (probably 20+ times this month)... yet this remains an ongoing&nbsp;problem, and was even on my old Windows Mobile 5.0 phone. So I think there's
 more to it than that. Thanks anyway!

<h2>            IE 11 stops working and shuts down after opening</h2>
                    <p>Immediately after opening Internet Explorer 11 on my Windows 10 PC I get the system error box stating that Internet Explorer has stopped working. &nbsp;A problem caused the program to stop working...... see screen shot below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0fc4d8f4-5634-4ebf-9429-3c8fd1f0587d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0fc4d8f4-5634-4ebf-9429-3c8fd1f0587d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After I click the button Close Program I get the exact same error box as above popping back up within a few seconds. &nbsp;And the message at the bottom of the screen saying "A problem with this webpage caused internet explorer to close and reopen the tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click the close program button again. &nbsp;This time I get a blank webpage saying that "we were unable to return you to bing.com"..... see screen shot below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/421f5798-aa48-4d1c-8ed8-d7ab8b6e7d69" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/421f5798-aa48-4d1c-8ed8-d7ab8b6e7d69" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time I close and reopen Internet Explorer the exact same thing happens. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I ran the windows trouble shooter on Internet Explorer Performance and Internet Explorer Safety. &nbsp;Neither resulted in a problem fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next I turned off Internet Explorer from the Turn Windows Features on or off setting and rebooted. &nbsp;Then turned it back on and rebooted. &nbsp;This did not have any impact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I scanned my PC for viruses with Windows Defender and the report came back clean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the Internet Options dialog I deleted all cache, cookies, active x, passwords, everything. &nbsp;Still IE will not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google Chrome continues to work just fine however, which is how I'm able to write this question. &nbsp; Other programs that are communicating with the internet are working just fine also. &nbsp;Internet Explorer seems to be the only program not functioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody please help to get internet explorer working again???</p>

            <p>Hello Andy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern and we appreciate the detailed information you have provided us of the issue you are facing. Let me assist you to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As an initial recommendation, I suggest you to check for the latest updates in Windows 10 which helps the PC&nbsp;to make optimal&nbsp;use of Windows 10 capabilities as well as fixing&nbsp;any missing&nbsp;links in performance of the operating system.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">To check for updates now, go to <strong><span>Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update,</span></strong> and select

<p>
</p><p>Now,&nbsp;follow the below methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>Consider the following points and check if it helps to improve the situation.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
&nbsp;
<li>It's a good idea to delete add-ons if you suspect they're causing performance, compatibility, or security problems. Check if the issue still occur while using Internet Explorer in a no Add-on state.<br />
Ref: <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Manage add-ons in Internet Explorer</span></a></strong><br />
<br />
Ensure to disable&nbsp;any third party security&nbsp;add-ons in Internet Explorer. These add-ons can significantly affect the browser if it is unstable.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Install the most up to date version of Adobe Flash Player from the link below.<br />
<a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/distribution3.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Adobe Flash Player Distribution</span></a><br />
<br />
</li><li><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Increase the browser disk space allotment.</span><br />
On the menu again click 'Tools', click 'Internet Options', click 'General' tab, scroll to browsing history, set 'Disk space usage' at 500MB, click 'OK' to finish and check with the results.<br />
<br />
</li><li><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Turn of Hardware Acceleration<br />
</span>On the menu again click 'Tools', click 'Internet Options', click 'Advanced' tab and select
<em><span>Use software rendering instead of GPU rendering. </span></em><span>Click 'OK' and restart Internet Explorer</span><br />
<br />
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>If the above still does not help, try to reset the Internet Explorer settings and check if it helps.<br />

</p><ul>
</ul>
<strong>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
</strong>Try to place the computer in a Clean Boot state and check if there are any third party application/software to be causing the issue.
<p>
</p><p><span><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Disclaimer:</span><span> Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></span></p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></strong><p><strong>
</strong>
</p><p>If it still does not help, try to view the Event IDs in Event Viewer to check for specific events triggering the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To view activities in Windows, I suggest you to open the Event Viewer. To do so, follow the below steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Go to the Control Panel and choose to click on the
<strong><span>Administrative Tools</span></strong> icon.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The above action will open up a new window of the Administrative Tools where you will see the
<strong><span>Event Viewer</span></strong><span>.</span></span></span><span> </span>

    <title>SharePoint Online Storage vs Office 365 Storage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lee palmerxv  say:</h3>
<h2>            SharePoint Online Storage vs Office 365 Storage</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to look for an answer to this but I have not been able to establish exactly what the situation is. Site Collections in SharePoint Online can now be up to 25TB, which is great. However, as far as I am aware the default storage for the SharePoint
 tenant is still only 1TB or has this been raised too?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When talking to clients with large amounts of data that they are looking to migrate I am trying to make them aware that they may need to consider this however I have not been able to find a definitive answer to this. In the article below on limits and quotas,
 under the Limits by Plan section, it says that the storage is 1TB for an E3 plan and site collections are up to 25TB.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/SharePoint-Online-limits-and-quotas-8F34FF47-B749-408B-ABC0-B605E1F6D498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/SharePoint-Online-limits-and-quotas-8F34FF47-B749-408B-ABC0-B605E1F6D498</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to get a response previously but have not got an answer on this so want to make sure as the article says to me that it is ok to have a site collection up to 25TB IF you have the storage for your tenant...which you may not by default. If this could
 be clarified please I would be very grateful.</p>

<h2>            Formatting an APA Level 3 head</h2>
                    I need help on formatting a head in Word for Mac. This is how the paragraph is supposed to look.<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold">This would be my Level 3 head.&nbsp;</span> The rest of the paragraph needs not to be in bold.<br />

Apologies if this is a duplicate question. I thought I submitted it earlier but it's not showing up on the list of questions.<br />

Any help would be appreciated. This is driving me to my grave.<br />

            Hi Sonia:
<div><br />
<div>You DID submit it, I swear... &nbsp;Because I answered it. &nbsp;The Answers machinery is subject to periodic fainting fits and bad behaviour: but it's there now...</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is what I said:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>
That's called a "Run-in" heading in printer's parlance.
<div>
<br />
<div>
It is normally done by applying a Character style over the top of the paragraph style.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
You can cheat: &nbsp;Select the bit that has to be the run-in heading, and apply "Heading 3" style to it.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Word will create the necessary character style and apply it for you. &nbsp;Be careful what you select. &nbsp;If you select too much, Word will apply the Heading 3 Paragraph style instead, which will not give you a run-in heading. &nbsp;You should, of course, format the&nbsp;Heading&nbsp;3
 style to your own requirements.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Styles, of course, are the key to any formatting question in Word. &nbsp;Especially when you are dealing with a document long and complex enough to require APA formatting :-) &nbsp;It instantly guarantees that all parts of the document have consistent formatting. &nbsp;A
 "Style" in this context is simply a "collection of formatting which we give a name to so we can find it again." &nbsp;Useful to look those up in the Word help.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Hope this helps</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Let&#39;s talk about Mac Excel 2011 bugs</h2>
                    I'm pretty sure most of the bugs won't be fixed, even if they are raised. But... at least share them here.
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Try this one:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In VBA, try to DIR a file which doesn't exist. e.g.:</div>
<div>DIR("Macintosh HD:aa.xls")</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A stupid run-time error 68: "Device Unavailable" will pop up.</div>
<div>This very annoying error makes all standard macros which uses DIR to fail. (This is one of the major reasons plenty of Win Excel macro fail on Mac.)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A work around (which looks very stupid), is to replace wherever DIR is used with a call to a macro like the one below:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>Function dirfile(ByVal input_file As String) As Boolean</div>
<div>Dim tmp</div>
<div>dirfile = False</div>
<div>On Error GoTo dirfile_err</div>
<div>tmp = Dir(input_file)</div>
<div>On Error GoTo 0</div>
<div>dirfile = True</div>
<div>dirfile_err:</div>
<div>End Function</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>

            Thank you for posting these bugs. Please keep them coming! The Mac MVPs can give them a little boost in the hope that some of them might be addressed in the next version of Office for Mac.

            <b>Win Macros may fail in Mac Excel 2011 because of invisible characters at end of statement</b>
<div><b>=====================================================================</b><br />
<div><br />
<div>In Mac Excel 2011, when trying to run macros created in Windows Excel, sometimes they may just fail for no reason. No matter how to try to check the macros or debug them, they just won't compile properly and report error.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In such case, go to the end of the statement which VB Editor reported an error, press delete (backspace) to remove the last character (and then type to complete the complete statement again). &nbsp;Now, your macro may run properly.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The problem is, sometimes, Windows Excel macros may contain an invisible character at the end of the line of statement which will cause the macro to fail. (This problem only happen in Excel 2011.)</div>
<div><br />

            <b>Incompatibility of GetSetting in Mac 2011 (vs Win Excel)</b>
<div><b>============================================</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>In Win Excel, the following macro will run happily.</div>
<div>Variable a, b, c tries to obtain values from the registry. If unsuccessful, will be assigned the "default" values of 1, False and "" (empty string).</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>
<div>Sub hello()</div>
<div>Dim a</div>
<div>Dim b</div>
<div>Dim c</div>
<div>a = GetSetting("Test", "Test1", Key:="Option", Default:=1)</div>
<div>b = GetSetting("Test", "Test1", Key:="Option", Default:=False)</div>
<div>c = GetSetting("Test", "Test1", Key:="Option", Default:="")</div>
<div>End Sub</div>
<div>‹</div>
<div>However, in Mac Excel 2011, the line "c" will fail and will cause an error.</div>
<div>This is because, in Excel 2011, you cannot assign an empty string default value in "GetSetting". This is not logical at all. Why empty string is not allowed??!?!?</div>
<div><br />
<div>The solution is to assign whatever other than an empty string in the default value.... (sigh...)</div>
<div><br />

            How?
<div>Mac MVPs?</div>
<div>I was an MVP, and I don't even know how to get the little "MVP" symbol in my name here.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Address in next Office? I think one of the good solutions is to include me in the beta program of the next Office. But EVERY TIME, I need to knock on their door myself instead of they knock on my door.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Frustrated in all dimensions...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Excel is now version 14.3.6. But I feel like I'm still using beta build 1436...</div>

<div><b>VB Project you cannot unlock in Mac Excel even if you know the Password</b></div>
<div><b>=======================================================</b>===</div>
<div><br />
<div>I put a sample file for this stupid bug in my web site:</div>
<div>http://www.vonixx.com/hello.zip</div>
<div><br />
<div>Steps to do:</div>
<div>- In Excel for Windows (e.g. Excel 2013), password protect a VB Project with password like "hello1234!"</div>
<div>- Save the Excel workbook in .xlsm format</div>
<div>- Open it in Mac Excel 2011.</div>
<div>- Go to VB Editor and try to unlock the project with "hello1234!"</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Result: &nbsp;Invalid Password.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Work Around: &nbsp;Unlock the project in Win Excel, and lock the project again in Mac Excel.....</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Good luck.</div>

What you ran into is that the PC version of Excel has several different Security Methods. While has only one. Mac's security method works on any Platform that Office is written for. But but all but the correspond method to the Mac version on PC works only on
 PC. This is another example of MS getting a dig in&nbsp; at Mac Users. <br />
<br />
I know that anything to do with Active-X wouldn't work even if MS could design it. Apple Banned Active-X on Macs when the technology first came out as far more a security risk, than Java of the day.<br />
<br />
But any other Security&nbsp; types other than those containing Active-X should be made equally available on Mac as well as PC.
