            <p>Looks like your PC was running an Insider build which has expired now. Insider builds have an expiry date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would strongly suggest a clean Install using media creation tool-that removes your data but we have a more technical alternate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set your date/time back to an Earlier date using BIOS settings.(I assume that your date/time is correct before changing it)</li><li>Download the ISO file of the latest GA build that doesn't expire using following:</li></ul>

<h3> fjtorsol  say:</h3>
<h2>            Zune corrupting MP3 IDE3 tags and MP4 &#40;&#42;.m4a&#41; tags</h2>
                    <p>I have discovered that Zune software&nbsp;causes MP3 IDE3 tag/M4A tag&nbsp;corruption. I could state this thanks to the modification dates of the affected files which correspond to a time when Zune software was the only multimedia application running.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will randomly delete following IDE3&nbsp;tag/M4A tag values:</p>
<p>- Album art</p>
<p>- Total track number per disk</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deletion of such values will occur&nbsp;under the following circumstances:</p>
<p>- After clicking on the "like" icon&nbsp;(heart) for a song in both the synced devices&nbsp;(when synchronizing)&nbsp;and the computer</p>
<p>- After "SmartDJ" feature completes the files' metadata</p>

            <p>Apparently Zune does not support the "total number of tracks"&nbsp;tag value and also stores album art tag value&nbsp;with a non-standard mime type naming. When tags are updated via Zune the unsupported values are erased and the album art mime type naming is updated
 with Zune's own naming causing the album art to stop being displayed in other media players which use standard compliant mime type naming.</p>

    <title>Nokia E7-00 usb connector failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> icq6000068  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia E7-00 usb connector failure</h2>
                    
<p>For a few months i am enjoying the nokia communicator phone. But lately it has loading problems. As i been VERY careful with my phone (like a proper woman does) i am suprised to see it broke down so quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a technician take a look at it and the conclusion is that the connector inside the phone is faulty! The USB PC cable has the same problems. When i hook it up to the loader or the usb cord the light does not even go on most of the time and when it does
 it goes off by the slightest touch on the phone or cable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now my question is; what can i do? I have warranty still for over a year. But how long would i&nbsp;have to wait till its fixed? Is it at all fixable by nokia? Will nokia accept it under the warranty and not claim its been&nbsp;'improper use'?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any idea's?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your advise and or idea's,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You may have to fight your corner with Nokia Care Point and if necessary demand an independent inspection if it is rejected out of hand; there was a somewhat similar situation with the N900, where certain regions seem to deal with the issue better than others.</p>

            Only a Nokia care center can help you here, as said by aspergerguy, go to another care center if you don't find one useful. There might be one good one around somewhere. This problem seems to be there with some E7, two E7's I used had a lose USB.

            My E7 is currently in the service because of loose USB-port. The symptoms were "no charging" and " no connection on USB".<br />
<br />
I would definetely take the phone to closest NokiaCare especially because your warranty is still valid.<br />
<br />
The following is just my opinion: As a customer You are entitled to a properly functioning device.<br />
If the service claims that the phone has been improperly used, I would do exactly as aspergerguy wrote: request independent inspection to show that is not true.

            The problem is the the connector tongue inside the USB port. I have bend it down with a screwdrive a little bit for proper electrical contact to the USB cable. Everything worked fine since then. In my opinion the Micro USB in general is crab. That is not
 NOKIA fault. Thomas using E7 and E90

<p>Same problem here, repaired under guarantee.</p>
<p>The circuitboard has been changed, and a new emei number supplied.</p>
<p>Works fine now, the mini usb connector now kind of clicks in place which it did not do before if my memory serves me well.</p>

<p>Dear Nokia Support Team,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My USB connector needs to be changed as told by Nokia Care, but the replacement cost is told me as Rs. 8000/- and requires 8-10 working days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindly confirm if I have to shell out 30% of the product cost for its repairs within 1.5 yrs of purchase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's been over a 6 months and I'm very disappointed with NOKIA in general. I can't use my E7 but still have to pay my Orange contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Customer Service" refused to help me and after disputing Nokia's second decision with regards to my faulty E7 handset they cancelled my warranty completely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The E7 clearly has a common fault with poor design of the USB socket and yet NOKIA keeps on saying it's customers fault (mechanical damage).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your "customer support" ls of Sh** and you know this NOKIA! I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM YOU AGAIN!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This company was my first choice 10 years ago, now I've discouraged over 10 people from buying NOKIA's shi*ty products and instead suggested BB or other more reliable devices with customers service that's worth paying money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a problem with Samsung last year and after calling their customer service I received new product within 5 working days and no questions asked. That's what I call customers service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOKIA if you keep looking after your business like you're looking after your customers, soon you'll be looking at other companies from far behind and that's the reality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still have my E7 with broken USB socket and on top of it two large scuffs made by your (NOKIA) so called "Professional Engineers" after they didn't know how to take my phone apart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SHAME ON YOU NOKIA!</p>
<p>I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM YOU AGAIN!</p>

<p>Just to add my 2p's worth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've started having trouble on my E7 with the micro USB either not charging or not connecting. After trying a few different USB-microUSB leads I've found some work and some don't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're having problems might be worth trying a few different leads&nbsp; to see if one works.</p>

<p>Recently, I was made aware that both of our IP ranges have for some reason been blocked in the FBLW15 blacklist. Multiple of our users are now having issues when sending e-mails to Office 365 users. We've tried switching the mail server IP's (that otherwise
 have a great IP reputation) but to no avail. We've also sent a delisting request as per the instructions, but have not received a reply in over 24 hours. This is critical, which is why I'm now reaching out here.</p>

<p>Any clue on what else we can do?</p>

<p>Normally, it takes about three working days for our relevant team to delist the sender from the block list.</p>
<p>If the issue persists after three working days you sent the request, since you are also the recipient in this case, I’d like to collect your tenant information of Office 365 and transfer it to our relevant team for further investigation.</p>

<h2>            Difficulties to understand Micosoft account &#47; Alias. How to &#34;transfer&#34; &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello ! <br />
<br />
First sorry if sentences constructions are wrongs. I'm not english. <br />
<br />
So there is the situation : <br />
I have a microsoft account : *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. On this account, I have an "xbox account" : aaaxbox
<br />
I had many hack problems with the EMAIL *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. Moreover it might have been sell really often because I recieve maannyy mails from "****".
<br />
I'm going to use more Microsoft application, buy things ... so I want to change the Email.
<br />
<br />
What can I do ? <br />
<br />
- Is it possible to transfer all the content from a microsoft Account to another *** Email address is removed for privacy *** ?<br />
Or</p>
<p>- Should I change the "Alias" of my microsoft account to a new mail *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, then delete the actual one&nbsp; ?
<br />
<br />
I think I miss understand things between e-mail and microsoft account. <br />
<br />
I found this (french) link : https://support.xbox.com/fr-FR/my-account/microsoft-account/change-email-sign-in-for-microsoft-account<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for your answer... and sorry for my bad english</p>

            hi i am an independent advisor and would like to help you resolve your issue 
<br />
<br />actually i am sorry to say but you cannot transfer Microsoft account to another email address ..but you can create a new alias and delete the old one ..Microsoft account is usually refried as  the account which you use to have Microsoft services like xbox outlook etc ..all the services are summed up into one account if you use only one account to buy many of Microsoft services ..email address acts as an username to have access to this services and is associated with your Microsoft account ..alias gives you an option to sign in to your Microsoft account 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />if issue persist please do let me know
        </p>

            Dear KFR
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />If you have concerns about security of your account and you there is a way to manage sign-ins in a different way, without deleting or moving content to another account ( moving to another account is not even possible ). Alias is another "name" for our account, however this is still the same account. 
<br />
<br />So here is what you can do:
<br />1. Login to your Microsoft Account and create alias <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12407/microsoft-account-manage-aliases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12407/...</a>
<br />2. Make that alias primary
<br />3. Go to sign-n preferences and disable login to your account from previous account and leave access only by alias
<br />
<br />After this whenever someone will try to login with the account he will be receiving error and will not be able to login in. But please remember that it will be applicable for everyone, including yourself, so please try not forget the new primary alias. Also, I would suggest you to add your phone number as an alias. You will be able to login with it as well and use it for retrieval of account if needed. Please remember not to delete the previous primary alias, as if you will delete it you will lose your inbox and you will not be able to receive emails.
<br />
<br />Also, you can find a lot of suggestions how to secure you Microsoft account here <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12428/microsoft-account-security-info-security-codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12428/...</a> and here <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12410/microsoft-account-help-protect-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12410/...</a> .
<br />
<br />It is also advised to add more security info <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4026473/microsoft-account-how-to-add-security-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/402647...</a> in order to access or retrieve compromised account <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/10494/microsoft-account-how-to-access-a-compromised-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/10494/...</a>
<br />
<br />Also please do not share your account (new alias) and password, pay attention to suspicious emails and do not access links there <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-with-abuse-phishing-or-spoofing-in-outlook-com-0d882ea5-eedc-4bed-aebc-079ffa1105a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-w...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this answers your question and will help secure your account.

<h2>            97-2003 ppt&#47;ppa VBA code</h2>
                    <p>Currently using o2010 (x32) on Win7 (x64)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to revive an old project from way, way&nbsp;back. I've found both&nbsp;a ppt and a&nbsp;ppa version of the file. I've set my RegEdit&nbsp;using the instructions here
<a href="http://skp.mvps.org/ppafaq.htm#6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://skp.mvps.org/ppafaq.htm#6</a> (hopefully I did it correctly-see below, I wasn't sure which way was correct so I did both)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can put the ppa in the add-ins folder and load it as an add-in, but not see the code module in VBA. I can open the ppt, but it&nbsp;just auto-loads as an add-in, and again, I can't&nbsp;see the code module. Basically, neither show up under the VBA Project list,
 both show up in the add-in list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions for next steps? &nbsp;</p>

            <p>So if I understand this correctly, you open a PPT that should have VBA code in it and nothing related to it appears in either PPT itself or in the VBA IDE?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might be that the PPT itself is corrupted.&nbsp; To see if it's a file or PPT problem, create a brand new file based on the MS-supplied Default blank template, add a bit of VBA:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub MitToMePPT()</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Steve, that's a stupid name for a subroutine. Are you SERIOUS?"</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Save it as a PPT, quit and restart Powerpoint, re-open the file and check to see whether you can view the code.&nbsp; If so, save it as a PPA, load the PPA as an add-in and again check to see what's visible in the VBA IDE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, and actually before embarking on the above, check File | Options | Trust Settings, click the Trust Settings button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add-ins section:&nbsp; remove all checkboxes</p>
<p>
</p><p>Macro Settings section:&nbsp; choose "Disable all macros with notification" (ie, give you a warning when a file contains macros, let you choose whether to enable it or not).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Protected view:&nbsp; here I've got 'em all checked and it doesn't seem to interfere with anything (though I have to unblock files downloaded from the internet)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Message Bar:&nbsp; Choose "Show the Message Bar ..." so PPT at least barks audibly when it's blocking something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>File Block Settings:&nbsp; Everything's unchecked here.&nbsp; "Open selected file types in Protedted View" is chosen but since no file types are selected, it's irrelevant.&nbsp; If any of your file types are checked, that might be the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any of those settings needed to be changed to match mine, OK the Options dialog, quit and restart PPT and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as another issue, something's resetting your DebugAddins reg entry from 1 to 0?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this your own PC or one under corporate/IT control?&nbsp; If the latter, they may have policies in place that limit what you can do in VBA.</p>
<p>

<p>connect your zune, and you should get a dialog box asking what to do. If not, connect your zune, then go in the software, into the device section, and copy everything over.</p>

<p>reverse sync...connect the zune, click zune, go to the content, select a bunch. &nbsp;drag down to the PC icon and drop.</p>
<p>this works, but is not always your best solution. &nbsp;if you downconverted music to fit more on the zune, you only get the downconverted version back off the zune. &nbsp;for music, this is optional, but for pictures it is not...they all downconvert.</p>

<h2>            Removing SharePoint 2016 &#34;Limited Access&#34; Permission Level at Group Level</h2>
                    <p>As a newly assigned administrator to MS Office 365, I have observed the assignment of "Limited Access" permission level to members in the system created group when files were shared directly to group members which then preempts their normally assigned permission
 level (Edit)&nbsp; and prevents them from being able to use the Edit functions.&nbsp; I have read the various MS Office 365 knowledge base articles on managing permission levels and the remedies for removing this unwanted permission assignment are hard to understand.&nbsp;
 Our startup company's SharePoint site development has been suspended until I can figure out how to remove the "Limited Access" permissions. I also observed that SharePoint seems to assign permissions differently to pages and to lists/documents, etc</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question #1:</strong> Is there a way to remove the system assigned "Limited Access" permission at the Home Page (site/group) level and achieve the same&nbsp; &nbsp; everywhere for all subordinate pages, lists, documents etc that inherit permissions from the
 Home Page?&nbsp; Can you point me to a blog post or online article that addresses this solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question #2:</strong> Is it possible to do a search to find all occurrences of the "Limited Access" permission level assignment within the site hierarchy?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question #3:</strong>&nbsp; Is there a recommended/best practice to avoid future group members/users from inadvertently causing the assignment of "Limited Access" permission levels?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The limited access permission level includes the minimum permissions that a user must have to access the required location. Users may have limited access if an item (library/folder/document) under the parent site (site/library/folder) has been shared with
 them. We cannot assign this permission level directly to users or SharePoint group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SharePoint automatically assigns <strong>Limited Access</strong> when it’s needed. Let’s say a manager wants to give a user access to a document. The permissions that grant access to the user are added directly to the content, permission inheritance is consequently
 broken, and Limited Access then automatically gives permissions to the user at the site level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you share an entire site collection with edit permission, the user will have permission to edit the content such as page, file, folder etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your 1<sup>st</sup> question: SharePoint comes with some default permission levels
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/permission-levels-87ecbb0e-6550-491a-8826-c075e4859848" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a><span>that you can use, such as&nbsp;</span><strong>Contribute</strong><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><strong>View Only</strong><span>. But if one of those doesn’t meet
 your needs, you can create a new permissions level. It's easier to keep track of permission levels if you don't change the defaults.</span><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">
</span>We recommend that you don’t make any changes to the default permission levels that come with SharePoint. You can’t make changes to the&nbsp;<strong>Full Control</strong><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><strong>Limited Access</strong><span>&nbsp;default
 permission levels.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>2<sup>nd</sup> question’s answer: Navigate to your SharePoint site, click <strong>
Setting</strong>&gt;<strong>Site Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Site permissions. If </strong>
there are items shared with Limited Access, you’ll see a message<strong> “<span>There are limited access users on this site. Users may have limited access if an item or document under the site has been shared with them.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup>: If you want user to have the edit permission on the site, you can assign the permission from

                    <p>Please bear with me, for I'm working at the extremes of my knowledge about Windows 10 et al in spite of having been an Insider since the beginning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there is an Office 2013, for I have it via Office 365&nbsp;Personal on my desktop computer running Windows 8.1.1 Pro&nbsp;and Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet running the 32-bit version of Windows 8.1.1.&nbsp; Consequently, I know the cost of Office 2013.&nbsp; By extension,
 I have an idea of what the cost of Office 365 Personal will be when it incorporates Office 2016.&nbsp; I also know Office 2013 is touch friendly as will be 2016.&nbsp; Well, I think the water is up to my neck now.&nbsp; So, I'll stop before I drown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also know Microsoft has developed the specs, if you will, for developing Universal Apps, which I think are involved with their Continuum concept.&nbsp; In addition, I think I know the beta apps for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint in the Windows 10&nbsp;Beta Store&nbsp;at
 least are Universal Apps.&nbsp; The water is now up to my nose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are these:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will the Universal Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and possibly other Office apps included in the Windows 10 Store be&nbsp;included in the cost of Windows 10 (currently free with conditions)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above noted Universal apps are included in Windows 10, won't that tend&nbsp;to cannibalize the sale of Office 365?&nbsp; For example, I might be able to get along just fine with Universal Word, Excel, OneNote, and Outlook.&nbsp; So, why would I lease Office 365,
 which includes modules I don't need?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, will the Universal Apps in the Windows Store&nbsp;run on Windows 8.1.1?&nbsp; Based on what little I know about the Universal spec, I imagine those apps can be made to run on Windows 8.1.1, but will they?</p>

            <p>Hi Jersey-Devil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting your questions here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are probably already aware; the main difference between 'Office 365' and the standalone Office programs/apps, is that, Office 365 is cloud-based. All your documents are stored in the cloud, and you get absolutely free upgrades to the latest Office
 for free, for as long as you're subscribed to the service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On top of this; it also provides increased cloud storage for your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Universal Apps are not likely to be running on Windows 8.1. The Universal system is flying in with Windows 10, to provide a consistent experience across all of Microsoft's devices: phone, laptop, computer, Xbox and HoloLens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>
        </p>

            <p>Thank you for you prompt and informative reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Inasmuch as I have Office 365 Personal and will probably continue to use it, I apparently don't need the Universal apps provided via Windows 10.&nbsp; Further, Continuum doesn't seem to affect me because my Dell tablet essentially uses the same software as my
 desktop computer, and they even track one another somewhat.&nbsp; Further, my Android smartphone is already running Word, Excel, OneNote, and OneDrive well enough for my purposes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't seem to need Cortana because I have Google Now available on all my devices, and it works very well.&nbsp; All I need is to have my brain connected to Google Now somehow, which may happen sometime in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see a need for Edge because (1) I've been using Internet Explorer satisfactorily&nbsp;since it was born and (2) I can use Chrome if Internet Explorer goes away or becomes a problem.&nbsp; I sometimes use Chrome now, but for some strange reason I've never gotten
 the hang of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't at the moment recall needing any other feature of Windows 10 I've seen so far via the Insider program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I guess I'll probably be staying with Windows 8.1.1, which works very nicely for me, especially with an SSD.&nbsp; Curiously, I can't run everything from the Start screen of 8.1.1, but I can from the Start menu of Windows 10.&nbsp; However, everything launched
 from the Start menu of 10&nbsp;returns to the Desktop when exited.&nbsp; So, that Start menu is of no value to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>&nbsp; I may have had a change of heart since I viewed the Tablet mode of Windows 10&nbsp;differently.&nbsp; I've always wanted to operate from just the Start screen on my desktop computer&nbsp;since the advent of Windows 8.&nbsp; However, Windows 8/8.1.1
 only permits&nbsp;operating from only the Start screen&nbsp;on tablets so far as I know.&nbsp; I believe the Start screen on 8/8.1.1 running on a desktop computer without a touchscreen&nbsp;causes certain pinned items (e.g., Word)&nbsp;to exit to the desktop, which makes the user
 have switch between the Desktop and Start screens.&nbsp; Windows 10 operating in the Tablet mode even on a desktop computer without a touchscreen&nbsp;allows apps, legacy shortcuts, and website shortcuts to be launched from and exited to the Start screen/menu.&nbsp; So,
 it appears the Desktop screen isn't necessary for routine operations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tend to think Windows XP/Vista/7 diehards will not switch to Windows 10 because they're getting their work and play done adequately&nbsp;now, and Windows 10 doesn't seem to offer much improvement.&nbsp; (Of course, giving away Windows 10 for awhile may turn some
 heads.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, the lust for the old Start button/menu, which I rarely used, is still so great, folks are already eyeing Start10.&nbsp; As you probably know, Start10 is an add-on for Windows 10 that provides the old Start button/menu setup.&nbsp; Yep, the diehards apparently
 don't like the Start button/menu on Windows 10 that Microsoft made just to appease them.&nbsp; OMG!</p>

            Thanks!&nbsp; However, I've been using the Feedback app&nbsp;since the Windows 10&nbsp;Insiders Program began.&nbsp; By the way, I think my dream of working only with the Tablet Start screen is dashed because it appears it's impossible to make scalable windows in that mode.

            Outlook for Mac doesn't support that. Actually, most software (except probably for Outlook for Windows) won't support it because it's not a standard feature.
<div>My guess would be that the folks at the MacBU decided not to support it because of how unreliable it was (if the client for the recipient doesn't support it, it's pretty much useless I guess).</div>

<h2>            Using StaffHub with volunteers</h2>
                    <p>StaffHub seems like it would simplify my scheduling easily, but I don't know if I can get it to do what I'd like it to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The company I work for interacts with about 45 different volunteers. Scheduling them can be difficult as we can't just expect them to be available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to have them be able to access StaffHub and put in their availability, so I can do the scheduling of when they are available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is: they don't have corporate email addresses. It doesn't make sense for us to pay for a full 365 license for a person who volunteers for a week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way that they can access StaffHub without us paying for a license for them?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would imagine this would also be of great help to small retail operations, service clubs, and other charities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could let me know, I'd appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Peace &amp; Blessings,</p>

<h2>            Connection problems in Microsoft apps on build 17713</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since updating to build 17713 I can't use Microsoft apps like Feedback Hub, Store and Skype since they don't connect to the Internet. I assume they all have are affected by the same problem since the errors are similar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Store throws a "Check your connection" message with Code: 0x80072EFD. Feedback Hub throws a "We're having trouble connecting" message and Skype shows a "Error loading page" message when clicked on "Sign in with Microsoft" button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before the upgrade to build 17713 all these apps worked correctly. Also this doesn't seem to be an Internet issue since I'm browsing and posting the question from the same PC that has this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did anyone face any similar issues and could help me with this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Failed to install Windows 10 Insider Preview 16215.1000 &#40;rs_prerelease&#41; - 0x80070643</h2>
                    <p>So ever since early Friday morning, I've been trying to install the latest version of Windows 10 Insider Preview, build 16215, and the same thing has happened every time: the update appears to download successfully, and I go to the "working on updates" screen,
 but somewhere along the way my computer restarts a few times in a row and I'm presented with the messages "Attempting to recover installation..." and "Restoring your previous version of Windows..." When I return to build 16199, I go to the update history page
 and am presented with the message "Failed to install on ‎[today's date] - 0x80070643". I have tried everything; the Windows Update troubleshooter, resetting Windows Update components (plus Aggressive Mode)*, full virus scan from two antivirus softwares (which
 turned up empty), and a run through CCleaner to get rid of all the junk. Same error every time. Apparently a lot of other people have had their own problems with this update, and since this is the first one in a while, maybe it's Microsoft's fault. Is there
 any other fix I can try for this, or should I just wait for the next build to come out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>*While r<span>eregistering the BITS files and the Windows Update files as part of resetting the Windows Update components, I found that some dll files failed to reregister, either because they were not loaded or there was
 no place to enter a registry, or something like that. I also found that one or two of the services I had stopped had somehow restarted before I could start them manually.</span></p>

            Unfortunately, none of the solutions in that link worked. Same error code results everytime.

<p>UPDATE: The DISM solution I just discovered did not work; the source files could not be found when I did the restore health command. It said something about "the component store is repairable" after scanning, but when running the restore health command,
 it got to either 88.2% or 98.0% before giving me error code 0x800f081f. I tried using a running Windows installation as the repair source by sharing my C:\Windows folder to my network, but when putting in both the c-drive path and the network path, neither
 worked. Am I doing something wrong here? Is my computer just screwed or missing something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran sfc /scannow. Got to 100% in verification phase, then "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will absolutely not reset Windows unless future builds result in this error as well. I still think it's Microsoft's fault, and I'm mad as hell right now.</p>

            I've been an Insider for quite a while. This is the first time I've had to put up with this. Given that a lot of other people have had problems with this build too, as you've probably seen, it must mean that something happened at Microsoft that resulted
 in catastrophic failure. I'm sure that when the next build comes out, it'll install okay, but I'm shocked at how big of a problem this is for many Insiders. That's why I'm mad. I'm not quitting the Insider program because it's not like my OS has lost all functionality.
 It's just that whenever something fails and everything you try doesn't solve it, hours are wasted and it leads to quite a lot of frustration.

            Have you tried doing a clean install using another HD to see if it is an issue with your system, as all 3 of my systems upgraded with out any issues both boots on each one, all of my systems are older Dell's Optiplex's 780.

<p>&nbsp;We signed up to test WINDOWS, but Microsoft has put a big obstacle in our way with their new update process, UUP.&nbsp; THAT's where the great majority of these problems are, and that's why I agree that we have good reason to be upset.&nbsp; We've had problems with
 UUP and reported them for months, but they've only gotten worse, not better.&nbsp; Microsoft needs to wake up and fix UUP or give us back the greatly superior update process we had before UUP.&nbsp; I've reported this in Feedback Hub, and hope many others do as well.</p>

    <title>Converting Office ProPlus 2010 from Enterprise to Retail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ken rumbarger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Converting Office ProPlus 2010 from Enterprise to Retail</h2>
                    <p>In April of 2014, I had a desktop PC upgraded from Windows XP to Windows 7 Ultimate because Microsoft was ending support for XP. The friend who was doing it for us was in poor health so his son did it for him. He replaced whatever Office was on it with Office
 Professional Plus 2010, but he used an Enterprise version and this was a home PC, so it wasn't activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Product Key for retail Office Professional Plus 2010 that I want to enter to change it over to retail and activate it, but when I click File-&gt;Help-&gt;Change Product Key, there is no response. The words "Change Product Key" change color, the HDD light
 flickers and sometimes a circular spinner appears, but nothing appears to enter the new product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is something set in the options or the registry that is inhibiting the process? Can it be fixed?</p>
