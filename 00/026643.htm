            On the Mac, Microsoft Word has a special view called Publishing Layout View that offers the core functionality of Microsoft Publisher on Windows. Unfortunately, Microsoft Word is unable to open Microsoft Publisher files.
<div><br />
<div>Microsoft Publisher can export Publisher files in Microsoft Word format, but there is no converter for this purpose on the Mac. There may be web sites that can perform the conversion for you.

<h2>            Windows defender offline continually circling</h2>
                    <p>Hi all. My hp wanted to do a bios update so i done that. It worked fine so i carried on and done some surfing and emails. There were also other updates it said needing to be done so i done them as well. Not sure what all of them were mores the pity and i
 cant get into my laptop to check. I went to shut down and noticed some changed settings. Laptop said anti virus and defender were turned off so i went to enable them. I thought id run Windows defender. It was so so slow scanning so i went to offline scan.
 Now my laptop wont boot. Defender is just scanning restarting and scanning again and again. I restarted pushing f2 and reflashed to previous bios but did not help.It also on boot HP screen it says Preparing automatic repair then back to defender and scans
 again and again.Havent had anything to do with w10 as w7 was really good so stuck with it. Peeved i wasted good money on a new laptop with w10... Can someone pls help here. Thanks</p>

            Hi thx for the reply. I tried using the recovery drive but it showed up disappeared and started scanning defender again. It allowed me to go back to previous Bios tho as i save to a flash drive. I havent made a recovery drive/disc as im pretty busy with
 work and only used laptop a handful of times since i bought it a couple months ago . Perhaps thats why it showed and gone when I powered on pushing f key. I dont have installation software either. How can i get that and authentication key as there isnt one
 on laptop like previous versions of windows . Thx

<p>Here's an idea on how it may have happened:</p>
<p>My co-worker got&nbsp;<span>this message:&nbsp;</span><span>"Word cannot open the file because the file format does not match the file extension" and when they tried to&nbsp;open it online, it told them "Word ran&nbsp;into
 a problem opening this online,&nbsp;try opening in word".&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The problem, I realized, was this: &nbsp;I saved it as a .doc (older, simpler format), but I failed to notice that, because I was editing their .docx original document, that little ".docx" bit was still part of the file name. &nbsp;Word apparently
 automatically kept the first one that appears in the file name (.docx) and chopped off the last one (.doc), leaving them with a .doc document&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">named</span>&nbsp;.docx, which is clearly a mismatch for the Word program trying
 to open it.</p>

<div>There is random zooming sometimes as much 1000%.&nbsp; It get annoying when I'm in the middle of a game!&nbsp; I want to be able to turn it off completely! I want to be able to choose if zooming is on or off, I want it off!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;Please tell me&nbsp;there a way to do
 this?&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the link you sent me to, I'm not as concerned with the crashes as much as I am the tabs that didn't restore! Thank you though!&nbsp; I will try the steps it mentioned to stop the crashes, but I want my tabs restored!</div>

            <p>What about the first part of the question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In 'other browsers' restore tab from last session does just that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Edge it sometimes does not. I can't see my previous tabs in history - it is like I was 'incognito'
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like a bug to me.</p>

    <title>Potential Battery Issue with N95-2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> g_elford  say:</h3>
<h2>            Potential Battery Issue with N95-2</h2>
                    I've had my N95-2 for just over a month now and I have to say I am very pleased with it but this morning when I went to use it it was totally dead. Last night before I went to bed I switched it to the silent profile and the battery was fully charged.<br />
<br />
This morning I go to activate the general profile and it is dead. I couldn't even turn it on. I've put it on charge and it started to charge up so that was a good sign but whilst charging I powered it on which again was OK but after powering up it displayed
 (only once) a low battery warning which has not come back up. I've done a bit of playing about, navigating through the menus etc and it's working OK but at the moment is still connected to the mains charger.<br />
<br />
Should I be worrying yet? I cannot work out why the battery would have died on me overnight as I am sure that I left no apps running on it at all, it was just in standby mode. The wifi search is normally left switched on as is bluetooth which I know can drain
 the battery faster but up until last night neither of these had caused any adverse effects with the battery that I know of.<br />
<br />
I was also careful to condition the battery from new i.e let it run completely flat 3 or 4 times before recharging.<br />
<br />
I am hoping this is a one off but would be interested to hear if anyone else has experienced a similar problem or if there is a known issue on the N95-2 with batteries discharging for no apparent reason.<br />
<br />
Thanks

            Actually letting the battery run flat is not a very good thing for Li-ion technology. That was good for NiCd and NiMH but not Li-ion or Li-poly.<br />
<br />
Something may have happened to the device (a bug) that may have caused the situation (something stayed on and didn't turn off). So I wouldn't worry too much about it.<br />
<br />
OF course the batteries or chargers or charging circuit can also fail and cause the problem but a software glitch is more likely.

            g_elford exactly same thing happened with me about 10 days back. My phone was not on scanning for WLAN and BT was off too.<br />
<br />
I fully charged it in the morning and its working fine again; SO nothing to worry.

            Same thing happened to my N95-1 many times with new firmware. Charging may take about 8-10 hours and lifetime is very short. I have new battery and tried also other charger.

    <title>Can I save Multiple Attachments from &#42;MULTIPLE&#42; messages - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> psattler67  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I save Multiple Attachments from &#42;MULTIPLE&#42; messages &#40;with one save&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    I do know that you can save multiple attachments within a *single* email message.<br />
<br />
But can you save multiple attachments across *multiple* messages -- with a single command?<br />
<br />
ENTOURAGE used to allow this.&nbsp; You could highlight multiple messages with attachments, select "SAVE ALL" under the attachment sub-menu, and they would ALL get saved to some specified folder.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
However, my copies of OUTLOOK 2011 (on different computers) do not allow this.&nbsp; If you highlight multiple messages and select SAVE ALL (for attachments), the program only saves the attachments to the FIRST highlighted message.&nbsp; It does not save attachments
 from any subsequent messages.<br />
<br />
Is there a way around this problem?<br />
<br />
I have LOTS of attachments to save, and I would rather NOT have to do this message by message, one at a time.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Peter<br />
<br />

            You can do this with a rule.
<div>
<ol>
<li>Go to <b>Tools</b> menu --&gt; <i>Rules... </i>and create a new rule for the type of account you're using.</li><li>Name this new rule something like "Save All Attachments".</li><li>Set this rule to apply to "All Messages".</li><li>Set the rule to "Save Attachments" and choose a Destination folder.</li><li>Finally, UNcheck the <b>Enabled</b> option. This keeps the rule from running on new incoming messages.</li><li>Save and close the new rule.</li></ol>
<div>To use this new rule select your multiple messages and right-click or Control-click one of them. Select
<i>Rules</i> from&nbsp;the contextual menu that appears --&gt; <i>Apply</i> and select your new
<i>Save All Attachments</i> rule. This will trigger the rule manually and act on all selected messages.</div>
<div><br />

    <title>STOP PUTTING MY MAIL IN JUNK&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> suspense author  say:</h3>
<h2>            STOP PUTTING MY MAIL IN JUNK&#33;</h2>
                    Let me start by saying that I&nbsp; HATE outlook and want my hotmail back!<br />
My latest problem is that OUTLOOK puts items in my junk folder that I don't want there! It has also automatically put 2 email addresses in the BLOCKED folder - both of which I was going crazy waiting for and had no clue why I wasn't getting them.<br />
IT is MY email account, and ONLY I should be the one to mark a NEW EMAIL as junk.&nbsp; If I have moved something into JUNK, then it makes sense that the next time I get one,the system will put it in the junk folder...... but NOT when the email is the first ever
 received from that sender!&nbsp; And why, when I've marked it as 'safe', subsequent emails are STILL routed to JUNK???<br />
God, I HATE Outlook!<br />
Anyone have any advise??<br />

            My email is not set up as exclusive.  The problem is that Outlook thinks it knows better than I what mail should go into my Junk folder!  I understand if a new email automatically goes to junk ----- but it should come to my inbox FIRST and allow me to decide if it is junk, or if it is something I have been waiting for.  Also, if I delete an email without opening, I do NOT want subsequent emails from that same address AUTOMATICALLY routed to my JUNK folder.   Honestly, I do not understand why you've given a computer program the ability to make decisions on what I consider junk!  IF I MARK AN EMAIL AS JUNK, THEN FORWARD OTHER MAIL FROM THAT SAME ADDRESS INTO MY JUNK FOLDER, OTHERWISE LEAVE MY MAIL THE **** ALONE AND LET IT DROP INTO MY INBOX!!!!!!!!

            The functionality you are talking about is not supported, even though you typed it in upper case.<br />
<br />
You asked for advice in your initial post, so I would suggest accepting the way that outlook.com works, or look for an alternative solution. Of course, you could also follow the suggestions that others have provided.<br />

            <p>Hi suspense author,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We understand your concern with your newly received emails that are&nbsp;being directed to the Junk folder instead of your Inbox. However, as my colleague has mentioned previously, it is by default that emails from a sender that is not on your contact list or
 Safe senders list will be directed to your Junk folder. </p>
<p>Please be informed that the best way to make sure that someone gets in your inbox is to add them to your contact list. To do this, just find a message from the sender’s email address and open it. In the message header, you’ll see a link to
<strong>Add to contacts</strong> beside the sender’s name. All you have to do is click that link and the email address will be added to your contact list.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>With regard to adding contacts to your Safe senders list, kindly refer to <strong>
Vivien_M.</strong>'s post for assistance on how to do this.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Feel free to post back if you need further assistance.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>HI, I just want to tell you that this is not a satisfactory solution to the problem presented.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many enders that I have found in the junk folder. on the top of the message it says "we classed it as junk because you don't seem to want them"
<br />
this is wholly unacceptable. if I "don't seem to want them" then I should be ASKED if I want them classed as junk. it should not be done without my knowledge and I have missed some rather important emails and this is actually damaging to my life.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want an option to TURN THIS OFF.&nbsp; I don't want ANYTHING classed as junk unless I press the "this is junk" button.
</p>
<p>This of course, does not apply to the normal junk filters. the ones that actually filter out the unsolicited mail.
</p>
<p>but when a message comes to me from a mailing list, it is solicited. I asked for it. it's my responsibility to unsubscribe from it again if I don't want it any more.&nbsp; it is literally not spam.

<p>
</p><blockquote>I have missed some rather important emails and this is actually damaging to my life.

<p><br />
Seriously, if it has such an impact on you then make it a habit to check your junk folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be an option to opt out of junk mail filtering altogether. It works for most people, but to have complete control over every email you will need to look at another product.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>I want an option to TURN THIS OFF.&nbsp; I don't want ANYTHING classed as junk unless I press the "this is junk" button. This of course, does not apply to the normal junk filters. the ones that actually filter out the unsolicited

<p>
</p><p>What do you see is the difference between junk and unsolicited mail? Bear in mind that an email may look like it comes from a mailing list but that may or may not be the case. An email can be set up to contain anything, so you can't rely 100% on any part
 of it being true.</p>

            You are so right. Typical left wing attitude. They think they know best. As you say; it is up to me to decide if an email is junk.&nbsp; They must have a team in Microsoft, probably left wing uni drop outs, who are given jobs changing around something that
 the average person doesn't want. I see someone remarked that it's free. You could say that about commercial TV.
<strong>We pay</strong> by watching the adverts that <strong>they get paid</strong> for. The strange thing is the emails that are really junk like 'Your Horoscope' or whatever, seem to get through but important messages that Outlook decide are junk get moved
 to the junk folder. How do they know what I want to receive? As I said typical left wing mentality;
<strong>We think it's right so you are going to&nbsp; accept. </strong>I bet they are all Democrats.

    <title>Can&#39;t just type a number 1 in Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karenkoenig  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t just type a number 1 in Excel</h2>
                    I've been using a very simple Excel spreadsheet template that I created a few years ago on Office 2013 as a customer statement.&nbsp; One column is QTY.&nbsp; I use to be able to type in a plain old, number one with no decimals, and I'd get a plain old number one
 in the QTY column.&nbsp; Over the past several months, or since some upgrade, that same template seems to want to change a plain old number one to zero in the column and if looking in the formula bar at the data, it says it's 0.01.&nbsp; If I type in a one -&nbsp; I want
 it to be one, not zero or 0.01.&nbsp; I've tried formatting the number column in all possible ways.&nbsp; I've even tried all options with using the zero decimals rather than two decimals.&nbsp; I've been using Excel for a couple of decades, so I'm no rookie at it.&nbsp; Changing
 it to text would probably work, but I do need it as a number for a formula a few columns away.&nbsp; Such as one item at $9.99 would = $9.99&nbsp; in the total column.&nbsp; Very basic math.&nbsp; I do not want it to be 0.01 item at $9.99.&nbsp; The only way it seems to come out as
 a number one is if I also type in a decimal and two zeros after the one.&nbsp; This is an added frustration for me.&nbsp; If I needed for example a 1.25 quantity, I'd type it that way, but I always only need whole numbers in this particular spreadsheet column -- no
 decimals in the QTY column.&nbsp; Since this started happening, (I think since I updated to the very annoying Office 365), I have to watch VERY closely what I type in the QTY column.&nbsp; Even if I type a number 1, it shows zero and then uses that zero, or possibly
 0.01 times the amount in my formula.&nbsp; So if I'm not careful, I could be undercharging my customers and giving stuff away for free.&nbsp;&nbsp; How would Microsoft like it if your statement only charged me zero (or 0.01) times $99.99 for your software subscription?&nbsp;
 Now that would be a pretty good deal for me then, and I wouldn't have need to complain.<br />

<h2>            my phone keeps blocking sites claiming the site has an invalid security certificate</h2>
                    <p>Randomly, my phone seems to start blocking any website I go to saying they have an invalid security certificate, even highly reputable sites like Google.com or Microsoft.com. If I tell it to proceed to the site anyway, it's usually glitchy and hardly works.
 The only thing that seems to fix it is a factory reset, but that seems to be a temporary fix, since it happens again after about a week. Is there anyway to fix this without resetting my phone?</p>

    <title>outlook 2016 does not open iCloud calendar after windows updated - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harrisonchambers  say:</h3>
<h2>            outlook 2016 does not open iCloud calendar after windows updated</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, a side note on Windows updates:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer recently updated while I was asleep (which<em> is </em>better than while I was using it, but still an uninvited and intrusive change). I was initially happy because I had wanted extensions for edge and had trouble trying to update - it would
 just say "can't update now" or something to that effect. So it finally updated, I installed the edge extensions, and life was good until...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the problem at hand:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened Outlook 2016 to check my iCloud calendar. After clicking on the iCloud calendar to enable viewing it, I received a message that said this or something very, very closely identical to it: "Cannot expand the set of folder.&nbsp; The set of folders cannot
 be opened.&nbsp; The information store could not be opened."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then searched through Microsoft support and did these recommended things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- checked that my Windows, Office, and iCloud were up to date (they were)</p>
<p>- used the office repair tool (had zero effect except&nbsp;apart from wasting&nbsp;a lot of my time)</p>
<p>- went to the iCloud app, disabled contact and calendar syncing with Outlook an re-enabled it (zero effect)</p>
<p>- used the iCloud app repair tool (now the calendar doesn't even appear in outlook anywhere)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know how to make this work again? Anybody had a different solution than the ones I've tried?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated, thanks :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>* I categorized this as Office 365 Home. When I go to Outlook --&gt; Files --&gt; Office Account under product information it says Office 365 ProPlus. Not sure whether this was the correct choice if it's not let me know and I'll recategorize it, if that's an option.</p>

<p>This is what I tried and it has worked.</p>
<p>opened icloud and signed out.</p>
<p>re opened icloud and signed in</p>
<p>I forget the exact words but at the top of the icloud window it said I didn't have my mail, contacts calendars tasks synced, I then clicked on this and it took around 2minutes to sync.</p>
<p>Restarted computer.</p>
<p>My calendar opened and had my events listed BUT could not delete an item, change colour etc. I could add an entry.
</p>
<p>so went through the same proceedure of opening icloud, signing out and signing back in and clicking the statement at the top of window.</p>
<p>Then <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>shut computer down</strong></span> and restarted. It was up and working.</p>
<p>I know this could have been clearer but best I can do when I do not have the screen with error on it now.</p>

 turn off sound for my other accounts that are not Microsoft&nbsp;in my 925.&nbsp; I am not sure what I am overlooking, but I have spent countless hours trying to figure this out.</p>

<p>To answer this we need to know more about your data.&nbsp; In particular how would we determine the "last" cell in column M?&nbsp; If column A is solid data down to the last row, you could just reverse your two arguments:</p>
<p>:=Range("A1", ActiveCell.End(xlDown).End(xlToRight))</p>
<p>(by the way the arguments are XLDown and XLToRight not XLToDown.</p>
<p>Alternatively you might use CurrentRegion, if your data meets the necessary criterion:</p>
<p>Range("A1").CurrentRegion.Select</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The issue may be caused by an improper Windows Update installation. For example, a Windows Update installation interrupted by a crash may result in a corrupted system file. A third-party

<p>
</p><p><span>Let us narrow down the possibilities why your PC encountered this issue. You can follow the troubleshooting steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Temporarily disable your antivirus program before running the Windows Update.

            <p>Hi Laura,</p>
<strong>1.</strong> The 30 day waiting period can<strong> not </strong>be waived.
<p>
</p><p><strong>What should I know about the 30-day waiting period?</strong></p>
<p>Even when you choose to delete your out-of-date security info, MS don't fully remove it for 30 days. This waiting period helps to deter hackers from updating your security info and gaining access to your account without your knowledge.
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">After 30 days, the user of the account will be able to access the security settings and update his/her preferred information.</span></p>

    <title>Delete Policy with Preservation Lock - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Delete Policy with Preservation Lock</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>in my company we had a compliance policy to keep content and delete if it's older than 1 year. When the policy was created, we enabled the "Preservation Lock".&nbsp;<br />
Now, we need to delete this policy because the compliance rules in my company changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is: is it really impossible to delete a policy with Preservation Lock? What are we supposed to do? Can Microsoft support helps us?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Outlook forwarding rule not working</h2>
                    
<p>hello, after my company upgraded to office 365 i can no longer get message rules working automatically. the rule was created in the outlook client and does show up in online outlook as well. the rule will work correctly if run manual but will not forward
 the message automatically.</p>
<p>here is a capture of the rule from the outlook web app</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a4fb7d24-62af-4042-baa2-325b11b1d1dd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a4fb7d24-62af-4042-baa2-325b11b1d1dd" /></a></p>
<p>i have deleted the existing rule after the upgrade and recrecated it<br />
this is the first rule in line</p>
<p>how can i make sure this gets forwarded each night automatically?&nbsp;</p>

<p>hi sabine,</p>
<p>i ran a test from my side and cannot reproduce the issue. to better understand the situation, i’d like to confirm some information:<br />
1.&nbsp;you mentioned that your company upgraded to office 365 recently, do you mean that the admin of your organization has deployed a special environment for your organization such as hybrid, sso, dirsync, etc.? if you don’t know about it, please involve the global
 admin of your organization into this thread to provide the above information.<br />
2.&nbsp;are you an exchange online user or local exchange server user?<br />
3.&nbsp;are you the only one in your organization who encountered this issue?<br />
4.&nbsp;what do you mean by saying “the rule will work correctly if run manual but will not forward the message automatically”? how did you run the rule manually, by clicking the “run rules now…” button in the outlook client?</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6009ba8a-681b-4bac-b1cc-05e43108f36e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6009ba8a-681b-4bac-b1cc-05e43108f36e" /></a><br />
5.&nbsp;if you are an exchange online user, have you tried deleting the old rule and creating the rule in the outlook web app instead of the outlook client to see if it works?</p>
<p>with the above information, we can have a better understanding regarding the issue you encountered.</p>
<p>thanks,<br />
mouran</p>

<p>I Have the exact same issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After migrating in a Hybrid environment. The rule stopped auto sending after the account/accounts were migrated to office 365 .</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you edit the rules and choose run now. It works as it should. But when the mail comes in that is affected by the Rule. It will not auto fire with outlook open or closed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The rule was recreated in OWA . I have even gone as far as to create the rule on another user's profile that gets the same email and send it to a Distribution group. Again the same results. &nbsp;The rule will not auto forward the mail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The rule is a 2 part. Forward mail to group and then move to a sub folder. It does not forward the mail. But does move the mail to the sub folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help on the matter would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run all the provided office 365 connection tests with no errors or warnings. I have logged a call prior with MS . I received help. But it seems we were worlds apart and communication was not happening. &nbsp;After running the run now test she stated its
 working and closed the call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
