<h2>            Hovering mouse pointer over launches the program in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: When my pointer hovers over ANYTHING in Windows 10 it automatically opens programs or selects things without any clicking, etc (using the Synaptics laptop built in mouse pad)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though I have gone to Control Panels and tried to disable this function, I can't change it. &nbsp;The cursor, especially when navigating from one web page and into a new page, selects whatever link it's hovering over. &nbsp;Even the control in the Ease of Access
 Center/Make Your Mouse Easier to Use does not disable this. &nbsp;Does anyone have a solution for this problem in Windows 10?</p>

<h2>            Homegroup</h2>
                    I am running windows 10. My computer says there is no homegroup currently on my network. However I tried to create a new one, It says windows can't create a homegroup on this computer. What can I do?

<p>Try this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Homegroup Password Issues or Joining - Unjoining issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have issues joining the homegroup or resetting the homegroup password, **Then follow the instructions I posted below to fix the issue.**</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should work and how to fix it, this always worked for me. And then you can join Home group and it will show change password for future. You must follow procedures exactly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>**If you can, stop sharing all personal files and devices in homegroup on each computer. Make note of your password if you can or if you have it saved or written down is good. then UN-JOIN the Homegroup on all computers. Restart all computers and log on
 to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open folder options and select in the VIEW TAB - select show hidden files folders and drives. Then UNCHECK the next 4 boxes below that to UN-HIDE selections. Click on apply and to all folders and close out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. **ADMIN PRIVLEDGES NEEDED**</p>
<p>**Do your main computer first and then all others in your Home network**</p>
<p>go to this location: </p>
<p>C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Roaming\PeerNetworking</p>
<p>...and delete all the files and folders in this PeerNetworking folder. **DO NOT DELETE THE "PeerNetworking" FOLDER. Just all files and foiders in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. shut this computer down. Then go to all other computers on your network and do the same thing and &gt;&gt;shut them down.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Then go back to main computer and start up, log on and go to Home Group settings and select join home group. You will get a new password. Copy and paste it on to notepad and save or write it down exactly as shown (Case Sensitive), and complete home group
 setup. </p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Now go to each other computer and go to Home Group settings and select join home group and put in password you just obtained. Once all are joined, go back to File Explorer/Folder Options - view tab -and select - DO NOT show hidden files folders and drives.
 Then CHECK the 4th box down below it to HIDE PROTECTED OPERATING SYSTEM FILES (RECOMMENDED) selection. Click on apply and apply to all folders and close out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: You should make PC 1 the PC that you originally created the original Homegroup and password for if possible.&nbsp; If for some reason after completing process above, it says you are invited to a homegroup and asks you to join it, then enter the old password
 you have. But you should get "CREATE A HOMEGROUP" AND GET THE NEW PASSWORD and then enter it into other PC's Join Homegroup password. Once all computers are joined, then choose your personal files and media devices to share on each PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Now restart all your computers. My advice is to reboot your modem\router first and then restart all your computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. It should look something like this when successful:</p>

<h2>            Family Pack &#40;adult &#38;amp&#59; child&#41; can u change settings for a game where adult which is child playing doesnt have control over ur controller&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I just signed up for a family pack, which i have 2 profiles. One adult and one child! Originally, i wanted the one designated for adult to be main one because I had Hero ranking offline, but found out after contacting xbox live support for 12 days or so,
 343 industries and halo waypoint that you cant exceed over ranking of a sergeant. But one xbox agent told me she thought she could. So, hince i chose my profile akin to have the adult classfication, and sweller the child. Thinking I could keep the ranking
 possibly. Finally, gave up and jjust started over at sergeant.</p>
<p>But now, with the akin having control as adult, and sweller the child, when i am in a game in halo reach, when choosing games to play or making a decison for games, the adult one overrides the child. I was just told by xbox live support that i would have
 to remove my account, which i just purchased the family pack for over $100 dollars. I have full control over the account, because its in my name. I just dont want when my nephew is playing with me to have control over choosing which games to play, can i fix
 that some way?</p>
<p>I want to keep sweller for me to play, because the ranking has more armor than akin. I have Lt colonel grade 3, almost commander and akin has just a sergeant grade 2. I just want to fix some way where the akin doesnt override my controller when choosing
 which game to&nbsp; play. Like say in halo reach, 4 players are fixing to play and your choosing which level to play, either normal, heroic, or legendary one none of above. The akin overrides the sweller controller in choosing which one to choose. Can i fix that,
 thats all i want to do.</p>
<p>Can someone help me? I dont want to have to remove my account, and reorder on my credit card, is there any way around this? thanks joe</p>

<p>Man, you have got to simplify your explanation. &nbsp;I think what you're trying to say is that you've got trouble with the parental controls on your xbox due to the fact that you bought into a family plan. &nbsp;You've got two accounts.... one child, one adult. &nbsp;You've
 made the adult account the primary which means that when that account is active or signed in, your parental controls get turned off. &nbsp;You want to be able to let your family play with both accounts but you don't want the kids to have access to all the adult
 oriented games. &nbsp;Am I on the right track? &nbsp;As for controller overides and such... I'm not following what you're asking or trying to do. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, thats real close to what I am trying to say, thanks for taking time to reply.
</p>
<p>1.I do have 2 profiles Adult &amp; Child (the child has parent one &amp; i have the child) by accident.
</p>
<p>2. All I want to do when were playing Halo Reach is to prevent the Parent from controling my controller on choices like playing Tip of the Spear and you make choice of normal, heroic, legendary or none of the above. The child my nephew which has the parent
 account but a lesser rank of sergeant 3 grade, while my rank is commander autmatically chooses over my controller when your choosing what to play in a game.
</p>
<p>Thats all i want to do is fix it if i can where he doesnt choose what i want to pick in a game. His controller in other words when he chooses which level to play automatically overrides my controller, he has the adult rank profile while i have the child
 rank of commander controller. </p>
<p>I am not sure about parental controls getting turned off when signed in. It seems that when signed in, parent controls take over, and he chooses what to play in a game or what level to play like normal, heroic or legendary or none of the above,
</p>
<p>I want to take that off if i can, and when you go online it automatically signs you in.
</p>
<p>Xbox support told me that to make my child the adult, i would have to remove my account or cancel it, and reorder the year subscription i have for the family pack. This all stated when I had Hero rank online on the adult profile, which i wanted to keep because
 originally that was my profile. I kept hearing I couldnt keep the rank of Hero, so after giving up and having that rank reduced to sergeant online i gave that rank to the child, which now is the parent rank. I have the child rank of commander now, which I
 built up online. So, I want to keep the Commander rank but wanted to know if some way, the child that is playing with the adult profile, if i can remove when were playing online in halo reach where he doesnt override me on controls with the controller or i
 have to ask his permission to do something. </p>
<p>Hope thats simpler to understand. </p>

<p>I have full control online on website, or when playing by myself which i do most of the time, my nephew primarly comes over just on saturdays and plays for 5 hours or so. He cant get into the account on website because I have control over that, but when
 playing in a game is where its frustrating and he overrides me on what games to play or choose with the controller which overrides my controller for choosing. Thats what i want to change or not allow him to do when playing games online.

<p>Does it matter who signs in first when you're playing on the same console? &nbsp;I've had to sign in and out to relinquish control from my account to my wife's before but we're both adult users and not on a family plan so I'm not sure if I'm comparing apples
 to oranges here or not. &nbsp;I'm somewhat ignorant of how the parental controls influence ones gaming because I've never had to use them so my apologies if I'm not hitting the nail on the head here.</p>

            Hi Helen.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Please post a screenshot of Disk Management, which we read like a doctor reads X-rays.  Follow the steps here so we can see everything we need to advise you:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/post-a-screenshot-of-disk-mgmt/04a8ef8c-c882-404e-a26b-89867c4ddf55?tm=1441932228382">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/foru...</a>
<br />
<br />The problem is normally that something has written to the partition to use up the space needed for the System Volume Information file to expand to support the new version, or that the partition is abnormally small.  I'll give you steps to remedy this.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is something unusual about how your SSD\HDD is set up...</p>
<p>The DATA partition is only 100MB... That is pretty much useless for any amount of DATA...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally a 100MB partition in that location would be a boot partition on a UEFI Bios machine... It would be FAT32 and not NTFS...</p>
<p>It would not be marked as "Active" either...</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I could see on other images of the partitions on a setup similar to your's, your 100MB DATA partition is located where the System Reserved Partition should be, and it's properties are the same... The problem is that the System Reserved Partition
 needs to be in the area of 350-500MB...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 100MB size indicates that your 100MB DATA was at sometime a "System Reserved" partition for Windows 7... That is the size Windows 7 used..</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that is listed as DATA may be a problem also...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not actually need the System Reserved partition... Your machine is probably not even using one , since the partition has the wrong file name...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens on my machine with a similar setup is that the partition you are having issues with is created at the end of the SSD\HDD, not the beginning... I normally delete it after the upgrade is complete...</p>
<p>After it is deleted you will need to make the remaining partition "Active"..</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need a bootable 3rd party tool to do this... You do not want to "Install" anything to deal with this...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After deleting the 100MB partition you could either leave the space unallocated, or expand your remaining partition into the unallocated space..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Partition Wizard 9 is a good tool for this, but it is getting hard to find a bootable ISO... Partition Wizard 10 is not bootable without installing it first to create the bootable media, but you may be able to find a bootable ISO that someone else has created...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the links for PW9 actually try to download the version 10 that will not work...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is other free stuff available, but a lot of it requires installation, which you do not want...</p>

<h2>            How to change Administrator Account</h2>
                    <p>Greetings!&nbsp;</p>
<p>A former boyfriend made himself administrator on my laptop. We been separated almost 3years and I want to remove him as administrator. The problem is my laptop is not allowing me too. He has a folder on the laptop I cannot access and cannot trash. It's annoying.
 I don't want it on here. I want to be rid of it. I don't care what's in it! I just want to delete it. He also made himself administrator and I can't get rid of that as well. I need help! Can one of the Genius's help me please?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 april 2018 update hangs</h2>
                    <p>The update from 1607 to 1803 hangs after the first reboot.&nbsp; Progress never gets above 0%.&nbsp; I do a forced reboot, and my current Win 10 is restored. I then check to see the error code and I get 0xc1900101.</p>
<p>I see that this error shows up with many different updates.&nbsp; One installed program said to cause this, I do not have.&nbsp; Is it true that Windows Update can no longer write to my C: (flash) disk?&nbsp; I had to store part of the update on a USB flash stick.&nbsp; The
 computer is an ACER Aspire 1, A114-31-C4HH.&nbsp; This is repeatable and also has happened on an HP Stream 13 with the same, too small for the Win 10 update, (32 GB) C: flash disk.</p>

            Hi RobertPegram, I helped a friend earlier this week with the same issue. Unfortunately for PCs with only 32 GB of storage space, you will need to completely reinstall Windows in order to get Windows 10 feature updates, including version 1803 also known as the April 2018 Update. Do you have a backup of your personal files, applications, and settings? A complete reinstall of Windows will delete everything on the PC.
<br />
<br />You will need a blank USB flash drive, SD card, or external hard disk drive with at least 8 GB of storage storage. The Media Creation Tool will allow you to boot a Windows installer from the USB flash drive, or other external drive, you selected. As always, make sure to backup the PCs before continuing. Go to this page: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />Click "Download tool now" then run the application. On the "What do you want to do?" page, select the option to create a Windows installer for another PC.
<br />
<br />After the Media Creation Tool finishes, launch the Setup application on the USB flash drive media you just created. The same USB flash drive should work to completely reinstall Windows on both the Acer and HP PCs. Let me know if you have any questions or if that does not help, there are more steps you can try.

            That's a reasonable solution. I'm going to try a couple other ways 1st. 1) Backup my old windows files and let the computer delete it when making space.&nbsp; This should give me enough space to put the install files all on C:/&nbsp; 2) Do the upgrade some other
 way that doesn't require wiping my C:/ drive, so I can do that again on the next major upgrade

            I left the Acer 1 alone updating itself, while I did some errands for 2-3 hours.&nbsp; When I returned, the machine wasn't hung up as I expected, rather it booted right into 1803!&nbsp; There were some security updates to do after that.&nbsp; Finally, there were NO updates
 left, Yay!

<h2>            Getting Mechwarrior 4 to run on a 64 bit OS</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, so i have downloaded mechwarrior 4, the black knight expansion, and both mek packs. i cannot even get mechwarrior 4 to run. When i click the icon&nbsp;a screen pops up with a mech on it and it says mechwarrior 4 and a few seconds later the screen disapears
 and&nbsp;thats it.&nbsp;I have tried running the game in compatability mode as well as not in compatability mode. i've ran it as administrator. All my hardware is up to date includiing all video cards, because i saw that was the reason for other peoples problems.</p>
<p>I believe i need a patch, but i cannot find one to download, the only downloads i have found just fix minor bugs in the game. And microsoft support doesn't have the game listed under there supported games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My computer is currently running:</p>
<p>Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit</p>
<p>Dual core processor (2.80GHz)</p>
<p>3 GB RAM</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 1: </strong>Try changing screen resolution or refresh rate on your computer and check.</div>
<div><br />
Refer:</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-your-screen-resolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-your-screen-resolution</a>&nbsp;</div>

<div><br />
<div><strong>Step 2: C</strong>heck if the issue persists in clean boot state.<br />
<div>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try the steps provided under Step 1 in the below article to put your computer in clean boot mode.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Step 3: </strong>You may also temporarily disable security software’s and check if the issue persists. Make sure to enable those security software's on the computer after checking.</div>
<div><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off</a>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</a></div>
<div><br />
If disabling the security software resolves the issue then, please contact the specific security software manufacturer to resolve the issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Important</strong> These steps may increase your security risk. These steps may also make the computer or the network more vulnerable to attack by malicious users or by malicious software such as viruses. We recommend the process that this article
 describes to enable programs to operate as they are designed to or to implement specific program capabilities. Before you make these changes, we recommend that you evaluate the risks that are associated with implementing this process in your particular environment.
 If you decide to implement this process, take any appropriate additional steps to help protect the system. We recommend that you use this process only if you really require this process.</div>
<div><strong>Step 4: </strong>Also check for error messages in event viewer. If you find any error messages then post back the exact error message so that we can assist you better.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Steps to check Application Event log:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a. Click on <strong>start</strong>.<br />
b. In the search box type <strong>eventvwr.msc</strong> and press enter.<br />
c. Now click on Application under Event Viewer (local).<br />
d. Now look for event log on right hand side of the Event Viewer windows.</div>
<div><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Event-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Event-Viewer</a>&nbsp;<br />

                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;I have a problem with my tablet asus vivotab smart running windows 8.1.</p>
<p>It often crashes showing the blue screen and the error message sdbus_internal_error, I couldn't find any information about it on the web, even if it seems to be a kind of popular problem. Does anyone have a solution?</p>

            <p>Alex, Did you diagnose the issue using the dump files created on the computer? Come up with the dump files to find the real cause of this error. Try these steps:</p>

I got around the issue completely. I found, after many, many attempts to do a reset, that what I needed to do was update EVERY driver in my system, do several shutdowns and restarts with each time doing another driver update for everything on my system. Then
 I installed W8.1, as soon as it was done I went through the driver update process again a few times until I had no driver updates left. Now Windows 8.1 is working and I no longer have any issues.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Basically, update every driver until no more are present, install 8.1 and update every driver until no more updates are available. Took many hours, but now, I love my tablet/pc.</p>

Yes, I was able to solve this issue by updating all the drivers also. But for my Acer W510 it was very easy, because all the drivers for Windows 8.1 come together in a single package.<br />
<br />
The SDBUS_INTERNAL_ERROR has not occurred since, and previously it was happening at least once a day. So I think it is fixed...<br />

            I also have an ASUS VivoTab Smart, and have the same crashing problem with the same SDBUS_internal error message.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>How did you update all the drivers? I've gone into Device Manager and tried updating the drivers for each of the devices but all the drivers are up to date. And there are no updates in Windows Update.&nbsp;</div>

<p>Hi Sheila, <br />
<br />
Since you're running Windows 10 64-bit, you need to install both Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86) and Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x64). For your reference, please check

            <p>&nbsp;You haven't said what you used to create that IMG.DAT file, and that's very relevant.&nbsp; But why not just get yourself a flash drive, copy the stuff from XP to it, then copy it from the flash drive to Windows 7?&nbsp; That sure seems like an easy answer when you
 can buy 8 GB flash drives these days for under $10.&nbsp; No need to make the solution more complicated than the problem!&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck.</p>

<h2>            Windows 2008R2 was activated by success, but Product ID stays &#34;Not Activated&#34;. What&#39;s wrong&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all!</p>
<p>Windows Server 2008R2 SP1&nbsp;is activated by MAK successfully. The&nbsp;WAMT 2.0 and MS Licensing Site confirms it. But&nbsp;Product ID remains as "Not activated" in Initial Configuration Tasks and Server Manager. Though in System properties&nbsp;in Windows Activation appears
 "Windows is activated" Product ID number is OK.</p>
<p>That it meant?</p>

            I think your question would be best answered on the technet forums or somewhere that deals with volume licenses.

    <title>Escalation Map Pack - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doostavo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Escalation Map Pack</h2>
                    
<p>I previously purchased the escalation map pack for black ops but it's no longer in my download history so it says i have to pay 1200 ms points in order to have it again. meanwhile i still have a score on the leaderboards for the call of the dead zombie map
 that came with the map pack. so i did buy it before, and its annoying that I would have to buy it again to play it when i already wasted money for the stupid game</p>

<p>If you purchased it on this account it should be available to re-download. You can also check the Microsoft Billing website located
<a href="http://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>here</strong></a>, this will show you if the map pack was purchased on your account as it shows debits of Microsoft Points as well as the content purchased.
<br />
<br />
All because your rank is showing up on the leaderboards just means that you've played the zombie map pack from either another XBOX console, or had the content previously on another account. Remember, that if an account is banned all content associated with
 that account becomes null and void.<br />

            <p>Hello to you too,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no option for installing flash player for windows 10 in the above mentioned page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will winodos 8/windows 1012 do for windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As i read in other articles (and it's what made me want to get flash player back on my system) is that it comes intergrated with windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i did was to get ownership of the files like ".exe" and ".ocx" and the those contained in folders with keywords for folders "flash" "macromedia" "adobe" containing any files and permanently delete them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were not many. Around 30 such files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously it was impossible to delete them because the owner of the files was either "trusted installer" or "SYSTEM".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did that cause i have noticed that whenever adobe flash player or macromedia flash player is installed the videos on "steam" (online games seller) &nbsp;break and do not play smootlly.</p>

            <p>I’m having a problem with Windows 10 Microsoft X-Box Solitaire and some web pages that have multimedia content. For Solitaire, when an advertisement starts to load the entire program shuts down with no errors. And for some web pages, a multimedia file starts
 up – or tries to – and a message comes up with an error and the page failed to load (no other information is given). The latter occurs in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer. But when I use Google Chrome, I have no problems at all. I suspect the Flash Player
 Microsoft uses but have found no way to find any fixes. &nbsp;This is on my HP laptop which has the Intel Mobile 4 display chip and their website claims they will not support Windows 10. My regular PC, which has an nVidia card, has no problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Everything else. on the laptop, seems to be working fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PPS: I'm not going to pay the fee you (Microsoft) have thrown at me for fixing this problem. I expect that you will find a fix for a problem that is most evident and affects many other users ..</p>

=========================================<br />
You could try downloading and installing a codec pack <br />
or you could try using a different Media Player.<br />
<br />
No guarantees...but maybe it would be worth a try to <br />
download and install the following free codec pack:<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
K-Lite Codec Pack (Full)<br />
<a href="http://www.filehippo.com/download_klite_codec_pack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.filehippo.com/download_klite_codec_pack/</a><br />
(Windows XP - Vista - 7)<br />
<br />
<br />
One of the following freeware media players may<br />
be worth a try...they will play just about anything.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 on Dell Netbook - Installed memory 2GB &#40;1GB usable&#41; - Why can I only use 1GB of RAM&#63; How can I make all 2GB useable&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Dell Inspiron Mini 10v Netbook. It came with 1GB RAM and Windows 7 starter. I upgraded to Windows 7 Ultimate and like it much better. Since memory was only 1GB I installed a 2GB chip instead. The computer/BIOS is happy with it but Windows 7 will
 only use 1GB of it.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Resource monitor has marked the additional 1GB has "hardware reserved." It didn't have any reserved before the addition of the extra RAM.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I want to use all my memory!!!! HELP!!!!</div>

            Hi pcstan
<div><br />
<div>I would like to know that which version of OS are you using?? Is it 32 bit or 64 bit??</div>
<div><br />
<div>you can try the following methods:-</div>
<div><br />
<div>1.Change Memory remap setting in BIOS. This parameter may have different names, look into motherboard or computer&nbsp;manual.</div>
<div>2.Run msconfig.exe. Under boot go to advanced options and change your maximum available memory.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This may help you</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards</div>

<p>Win7 when configured on peer-to-peer Network Win 7 has three types of sharing configurations.<br />
<br />
HomeGroup Network = Works only between Win 7 computers. This type of configuration makes it very easy to Entry Level Users to start Network sharing.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Work Network = Basically similar to the previous methods of sharing that let you control what, how, and to whom folders would be shared with.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Public Sharing = Public Network (like Internet cafe) to reduce security risks.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;For best results log to each computer's System Screen and set all the computers to be on a Network with the same name while each computer has its own unique name.<br />

<p><br />
Make sure that the Software Firewall on each computer allows free local traffic. If you use 3rd party Firewall On, Vista/XP Native Firewall should be Off, and the active Firewall has to adjusted to your Network IP numbers on what is some time called the Trusted
 Zone (consult your 3rd Party Firewall instructions<br />
<br />
General example,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted<br />
</a><br />
Please Note that some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled). If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Since your computers are running Win 7 and Win XP you have to use the Work network option.<br />

    <title>Audio Stuttering in WMM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> willlane  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio Stuttering in WMM</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I have encountered an issue many times with WMM. One example of the Audio Stuttering can be heard here: ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g38BiUHPmTA ) most prominently beginning at 1:16. I use Audacity as my DAW.<br />
<br />
The original project file in Audacity does not have the stuttering, nor does the output MP3 from Audacity of the file. Within WMM, playing the video as a project file with the audio as well does not induce the stuttering. The first file in the chain that the
 stuttering happens in is the output WMM MP4 file.<br />
<br />
The output settings I used for that video in WMM are: Width 1280, Length 720, Bit Rate 8k, Frame Rate 29.97, Audio 192kbps, 44.1khz, stereo. I presume that the only setting that would apply to the audio is the kbps, sample rate, and channel distribution.<br />
<br />
On Audacity, I have matched the kbps and sample rate exactly- 192kbps constant, 44.1khz. The audio is dual mono. I have tried other bitrates as well, no luck. I normalize the final track in Audacity to -1db. I have tried -3db to see if possibly WMM was clipping
 the track upon output- and no, at -3db it still stutters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on what might be causing the stuttering? Should I have the kbps and sample rate set differently?</p>

<p>Thank you Marvin for the quick reply!</p>
<p>While your suggestions did not work, they made me think of another option that this is somehow related to display settings which it turns out I had changed the 'Change the size of text, apps, and other items' under 'Scale and Layout' to %250.</p>
<p>Changing it back to 100% fixed the issue and I am back to having the time stamp in one line.</p>
<p>Note, the timestamp is still in the exact same size - i.e. that change did not actually make it bigger, just more annoying ;)</p>
<p>In any case - THANK YOU!</p>

            <p>Yes it is. When you upgrade and Windows 10 activated that was via Digital Entitlement. Which means the hardware in the system is registered with MS servers. Changing the hard drive is ok and you will need to create boot media using the Media Creation tool.

</p><p>Create a boot DVD or USB device and boot from it to start the install process. When asked for a key select Skip, Do this later or I do not have a key. Activation will be automatic when the install is complete. (you need to be connected to the internet)</p>

<p>It seems to highly unlikely you will be able to extend partitions with the "default" Windows 7 tools.&nbsp; Look at:</p>

<h2>            problemi mortal kombat 9</h2>
                    
<p>ciao a tutti! ho 2 problemi con mortal kombat 9: ho acquistato le 30 easy fatality, pagando 4,99 euro ma non mi sono state date... eppure guardando nella fatturazione,il pagamento è stato fatto,ma non compaiono nel gioco... ho inoltre acquistato oggi la
 collector's edition con la statua di skorpion, ed allintermno c'era un codice(nella confezione sigillata) per sbloccare skorpion oro (gold skorpio), ma inserendolo mi dice che il codice è già stato usato.&nbsp; è capitata anche a qualcun altro la stessa cosa? inoltre
 dicono che è disponibile la patch 1.03 anche per xbox one,ma io non la trovo... vi ringrazio anticipatamente,un saluto! Cesare</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p><br />
In Device Manager - Double click the device - Driver tab - update driver (which<br />
may not do anything) - regardless Right Click on it and UNINSTALL - when <br />
complete reboot (that refreshes the stack). <br />
<br />
Check with Lenovo Support and forums for known issues. Update or re-install</p>
<p>the drivers (after you have done the above first).<br />
