            <p>Product keys are no longer required for Office 2016 after the initial activation.&nbsp; So, did you activate and install the license when you originally bought it?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you did, then you can log in to the MyAccount site:</p>
<p><span><a href="http://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://office.com/myaccount</span></strong></a></span></p>
<p>and manage your license from there, ie from the site you can re-install on the same computer or transfer to a new one, as required.</p>

<h2>            How can I find the reason &#40;the virus&#41; why MS Spynet disconnects me&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I want to go to www.office.com/myaccount I get a redirection to https://officeaka.cloudapp.net/office/url/myaccount
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This connection is at once stopped by MS Spynet block 1. To find the reason I tried several antivirus software (bitdefender, Malwarebytes, antivir etc.). But i can not find the reason for the redirection. As MS Spynet block 1 stops my connection to this
 site, it might know the reason.</p>
<p>I want to remove the redirection, because i can not download the office software. Does somebody know, how I can find the malware behind that - or how I can find out, why MS Spyware block 1 disconnets me from the site?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result is independent from the browser. I always get the redirection to https://officeaka.cloudapp.net/office/url/myaccount.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas would be great. Thank you for your help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Klaus</p>

            <p>Hi Klaus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure how it's on W10, but you need to go WAY back in time for this one.&nbsp; MS Spynet is the very old name for MAPS (don't remember change date - actually forgot name until my search cleared out the cobwebs).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At one point, there was no option to opt out and so folks came up with a way to block it.&nbsp; The unofficial and unsupported regedit to block the Basic Option was known as MS Spynet Block 1 (Block 2 for Advanced).&nbsp; I found this old article on it:
<a href="http://www.malwarehelp.org/how-to-block-microsoft-spynet-2009.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.malwarehelp.org/how-to-block-microsoft-spynet-2009.html</a>&nbsp;(I didn't fully check, but if they charge for anything or suggest any other product, please ignore that).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if you&nbsp;converted to W10 and still have the Spynet regedit (which may have hosed something since it wasn't anticipated to be there).&nbsp; Frankly, I've no clue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thought is I see the following in MSE on Vista ATM and, in all honesty, I don't remember it ever being there before (and have no idea what it does) - but it shouldn't be on W10 AFAIK - or I don't remember it (AKA, my W10 Laptop is WIA without being
 able to use or charge with an AC Adapter &amp; is in pieces all over the place - with superglue &lt;sigh&gt;):</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ac4c0b8e-0901-4a1d-9830-c114b28b970c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ac4c0b8e-0901-4a1d-9830-c114b28b970c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, FWIW.&nbsp; If there is such an option, try both checking it (and rebooting) and unchecking it (and rebooting) to see if that helps.&nbsp; Possibly the "remove MSE" option will work on W10 here (&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/wiki/mse-protect_start/uninstalling-microsoft-security-essentials-from/3acd2e01-cd4e-40af-930a-b8794429915f" title="There have been several reports of the Windows 10 upgrade from Windows 7 with Microsoft Security Essentials installed has left MSE on the machine and disabled Defender. The uninstall procedures for MSE do not appear to work. See this Wiki article: Uninstalling Microsoft Security Essentials This article contains information that may help if MSE was not removed during the upgrade to Windows 10.">Uninstalling
 Microsoft Security Essentials From Windows 10 After An Upgrade</a> ) - or maybe checking the registry to check for and undo the earlier mentioned block will work (be sure to backup the registry and your system and create a restore point before you even begin
 doing that - if you don't know, please ask and we'll provide better, more detailed guidance).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To REALLY be honest, beyond the above , I don't really have a clue.&nbsp; I did see some O365 links (not many) when searching but didn't follow them because I'm thinking this actually may be our ballpark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this is of help.&nbsp; If not (or if so), please post back and let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kosh</p>

<p>
</p><p>That did not Change the redirection. But I got some other Information: Kosh Vorlon mailed me that Spynet is an old Name vor MAPS.</p>

            <p>When I first saw this thread I found a tin foil hat thread discussing some apparent&nbsp;extensions to the SypNet blocking which Kosh mentioned above.&nbsp; The program was supposedly designed to destroy spying in Windows 10, though based upon a more detailed description
 there of the following "features" it appears to me that it disables much more than this and could clearly end up doing damage to the operation of many core functions of the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Remove all spyware modules</li><li>Remove spying apps</li><li>Add to hosts spying domains!</li><li>Remove Spying services</li><li>Remove Windows 10 Metro Apps</li><li>Support Windows 7/8/8.1/10 or Server 2008-2012 R2</li><li>Remove Office 2016 telemetry</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If either someone had purposefully or mistakenly&nbsp;run this program on their PC or even possibly portions of this program have now been included in some other&nbsp;malware scripting, any of the above features could create problems with the portions of Windows 10
 mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if along with the SpyNet issues&nbsp;someone were having troubles with Office 2016 (e.g. Office installation), Windows 10 Metro apps or other seemingly strange operational issues, it's possible that at least portions of this program may have been executed
 on that particular system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any of this sounds familiar, then the only way to easily fix it appears to be returning to the restore point the program supposedly creates before making the changes.&nbsp; However, if that restore point no longer exists, resetting Windows 10 may be the only
 way to repair all of the damage done by this rogue software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will not reference the thread itself since there is a directly clickable link to the program which would be dangerous to any machine that accessed it.&nbsp; I've provided more than enough detail here to understand the potential danger this program presents
 to a Windows operating system, so there's really no value to accessing the program or thread for anyone wishing to keep their system operating properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case I haven't made myself clear, anyone purposefully executing this program is either&nbsp;a tin foil hatter, a fool or&nbsp;both&nbsp;and deserves what they get for making such a dangerous decision.</p>

<h2>            Problem&#58; Excel Preferences settings keeps reverting to default</h2>
                    Every time I shut shut down the program Preferences goes to default and I lose my setting. I tried swapping out the .plist and then did a new download and install - but still have the problem. I see where people often have this problem with printers, but
 I am talking about the basic program settings. &nbsp;I am using Sierra OS, but had the problem before that install.

            <p>If you are talking about when you first Open a new Document, You only see window cover 1/3 the Screen starting at top left corner. &nbsp;Forget about it. This Defect, Bug, whatever you want to call it has plagued Excel Mac since at least the days of Excel 5.0.1.A
 &nbsp;(circa 1995).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is something&nbsp;Microsoft has gazillions of request to fix, and yet, Microsoft has decided it is just an annoyance that people can put up with, and not worth the effort. Excel 2016 has been "improved" &nbsp;In that now you can option click&nbsp;the green stoplight
 button, and it will fill the screen. 2011 and previous you had click on the grab corner and pull to right and down every time.&nbsp;Whether on a new document or a Saved document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In 2011 Someone came up with the idea of creating a Template file set like you wanted, remove the extension &nbsp;and place file in the startup folder within the Office2011 /Startup Folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this is broken in 2016 so you can't even do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason that Word can keep its setting is that it has a&nbsp;Normal.dotm Template file, which Word reads first, before opening a new or saved document. &nbsp;In the beginning,&nbsp;this could have easily been added. Template could have been named Normal.xltm, and worked
 the same as in Word. However; back in the beginning&nbsp;if everyone has read the history between Apple and&nbsp;Microsoft.&nbsp;Microsoft in those days was making every effort to kill off Apple. Today, it is just blind neglect although not as open as then. It is still around.
 (You'd think after Apple just celebrated 40 years as a company&nbsp;Microsoft would get the hint.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway write back and let use know if it is something else.&nbsp;And we will see if we can figure it out.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I thought I was pretty clear on this, but I'll try to be more specific if it will help:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) When ever I close Excel or reboot my Mac Pro 15'' with retina display, my changes in the preferences settings revert back to default.</p>
<p>2) This problem began in Yosemite and continues in Sierra OS. I am running 15.28</p>
<p>2) I have tried changing out the .plist and done a complete reinstall with no change</p>
<p>3) I called Microsoft and they repeated the above, which I had already done, again with no change. This was with a "level 1" technician. &nbsp;To go to a "level 2" technician I was asked to pay $99 - what a joke, that's practically what the software cost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) I won't list all my preferences changes because there are over twenty. &nbsp;The ones that drives me crazy are - the (default) indicator going "down" after each entry, and also I have all the "Auto Completes" turned off, and these just keep coming back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for looking into this</p>

                    &nbsp;I recently bought a replacement audio jack from rapidrepair.com along with a chintzy tool set.&nbsp; The part was used and damaged but, in my haste to install, I forgot rule #1 - always inspect what you buy before use.&nbsp; The part was used and had a hole purned
 through the ribbon and one of the ground leads.&nbsp; It worked for a short while but now is intermittent (not much fun to listen to on even slightly bumpy roads.&nbsp; Anyway, I'm looking for a reliable supplier with good ratings.&nbsp; Thanks for any suggestions.

            <p>I have 3 PCs and a laptop in my household all running Windows 7.&nbsp; The PCs all have full licenses purchased when W7 was first shipped, and the laptop has a normal OEM licence. Over the last 6 years 2 of the PCs have had new motherboards - one for a major
 upgrade and the other due to a major failure. Because the W7 license is a full one, there was no problem activating on the upgraded hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But does this change when I upgrade to W10? In other words, does the upgrade convert the full W7 licenses into (effectively) OEM W10 ones? So, if my 3rd PC needs an upgrade or motherboard replacement, will I then have to buy a new W10 license? If so it would
 seem best to stay on W7 for this PC. Or spend the money upgrading the motherboard first and then upgrading to W10, so long as it's in the next 12 months.</p>

            <p>From what I have read on the 29th July 2015 if you update to the full version of windows 10</p>
<p>your full windows 7sp1 or 8.1 valid license is updated&nbsp;/ transferred /consumed into a valid windows 10 license.</p>
<p>Your current motherboard + license in now only a windows 10 license.</p>
<p>If you try and format your system and go back to your old windows 7sp1 or 8.1 it will not activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, so the only way around getting a new motherboard is not to update to windows 10 now.</p>
<p>With windows 7 &amp; 8 if you change motherboard you can call Microsoft&nbsp;and phone activate (if it deactivates).</p>

</p><p>Do they convert your retail code to an OEM windows 10 code or keep is as a retail windows 10 code?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you enter your old product code later to activate windows 10 or will they give you a new product code?

</p><p>People have tried entering there old codes on a new install of windows 10 and it does not accept the code.</p>

</p><p>Windows 10 is a new product is will soon be just called "windows" and no more windows 11, 12 or so on,</p>
<p>it will morph into "windows as a service" model. </p>
<p>Also, will the change from windows 10 to just windows later change anything?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you buy a new windows 10 retail then yes you can transfer it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We will only know for sure on 29th July 2015 or until it happens to us and we are calling Microsoft phone support.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's pretty much the way it's always been... Windows 8 changed that slightly...</p>
<p>If you changed your motherboard, the Win 7 you upgraded probably wouldn't activate either, for instance..</p>
<p>
</p><p>A phone in activation MIGHT be possible if Microsoft could be convinced that you were not trying to install it on TWO machines...</p>

<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install/does-our-windows-license-save-to-our-account/5a70a697-b8fb-4ac2-9238-1d1114aece00">
</a>which I think answers the question satisfactorily towards the end, thus:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>

<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>

    <title>OneNote notes disappearing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            OneNote notes disappearing</h2>
                    <p>I've recently purchased a surface pro to use at college for note keeping. So far, I've only imported 25 pdf files into different notes, nothing else and the problems already begin. One note content disappeared, the note was still there, however, the pdf
 that was inside was gone. In another note, the first page of the imported pdf disappeared after a few hours. The remaining 8 pages are displayed fine, just the first page is gone. Checked in OneNote online and the first page is also missing in the synced note.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is with a Surface Pro (5th gen)&nbsp; and the OneNote app, (not the 2016 version, the 2016 is uninstalled).</p>
<p>All updates installed.</p>
<p>Many restarts of OneNote and of Windows to no avail. The note contents don't seem to be coming back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the notes still exist, just without content, they also can't be restored from "deleted notes".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other way to get the full notes back?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moved from: Office / OneNote / Windows 10 / Office 365 Home</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue with OneNote content could have happened due to corrupted files or application. We would like to know more about the issue by asking the following questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried opening the OneNote files with another application like OneNote online or OneNote from Office suite?</li><li>Are you running antivirus?</li><li>Have you tried opening the OneNote file on another computer?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response. <br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>* No, the OneNote files have not been opened directly. I have used OneNote online to try and find the notes there. However, that was only after the note content had already disappeared from OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* No antivirus software running or even installed, apart from the preinstalled Windows Defender</p>
<p>
</p><p>* No, I have been unable to even find the OneNote files, therefore I have not tried opening the OneNote file on a different computer. I was only able to find one folder containing .one files and that was in User/Documents/OneNote-notes which seems to contain
 only the standard notes (presumably the folder didn't get removed during the OneNote 2016 uninstall).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response.</p>

<p>There are some factors that we need to consider regarding this OneNote issue like default program to launch the application. To properly diagnose this issue, we would like to ask for a screenshot of the exact message that you are getting. This will help
 us to verify the issue with your OneNote file and to see if this message is from us.</p>

<h2>            How can I pass multiple values back an Excel worksheet from a user-defined function</h2>
                    
<p>working on Excel from MS Office 2003</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Can I set the function name up as an array and get mutliple values back to the spreadsheet that way?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Is it possible to directly write data values from the VBA function to specific empty cells in the Excel worksheet when those cells do NOT&nbsp;have an equation that calls the function....something like the farcical VBA code below?</p>

<p>Chip Pearson wrote:</p>
<p>A function can return a value to more than one cell; this is called an array function. The functions is entered simultaneously into the cells to which it is to be returned. Suppose you have a function like</p>
<p>Function Swap(X As Long, Y As Long) As Long()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim Arr(1 To 2) As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arr(1) = Y<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arr(2) = X<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Swap = Arr<br />
End Function</p>
<p>This returns an array of two elements, just swapping their position. Select, say, C1:D1, type =SWAP(A1,B1) and press CTRL SHIFT ENTER. This array enters the formula into C1:D1 and the result array of the Swap function puts its values into those cells. You
 cannot, however, have a formula that modifies any cell that does not contain the formula. For example,</p>
<p>Function Swap(X As Long, Y As Long) As Long()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim Arr(1 To 2) As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Range("F1").Value = 123<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arr(1) = Y<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arr(2) = X<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Swap = Arr<br />
End Function</p>
<p>will not work because it attempts to change cell F1, and VBA prohibits such action. By default, an array results into an array that is one row spanning several columns, C1:D1 in the example above. To get the results in a column spanning several rows, you
 have to transpose the array. So, select A4:A5, type =TRANSPOSE(Swap(A1,B1)) and press CTRL SHIFT ENTER.</p>
<p>A VBA procedure called from a worksheet cell cannot change anyting in the Excel environment, including other cellls. It can only return values to the cells from which it came. However, in a broader sense, VBA can modify cells directly:</p>
<p>Range("A1").Value = 1234</p>
<p>Cells(2,"C").Value = MB</p>
<p>puts the value MB in cell C2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
Cordially, Chip Pearson Microsoft MVP, Excel Pearson Software Consulting, LLC www.cpearson.com</blockquote>
<p>If you want to avoid the TRANSPOSE() in the worksheet formula, something like this seems to work:</p>
<p>Function Swap2(X As Long, Y As Long) As Long()<br />
&nbsp; Dim Arr(1 To 2, 1) As Long<br />
&nbsp; Arr(1, 0) = Y<br />
&nbsp; Arr(2, 0) = X<br />
&nbsp; Swap2 = Arr<br />
End Function</p>
<p>The formula will now return a 2 rows by 1 column array and =SWAP2(A1,B1) can be array entered directly in A4:A5</p>

<p>OOPS!!&nbsp; Thank you....my row and column terminology is switched.</p>
<p>I'm attempting to read&nbsp;the&nbsp;values in a&nbsp;multiple separate ranges of cells of an Excel spreadsheet, set these values into separate arrays, and solve via&nbsp;linear algebra matrix math.&nbsp; My User-Defined Function will also involve an iterative Loop.&nbsp; The answer
 will be an array that I&nbsp;am trying to then project back into Excel in order to perform&nbsp; further operations on and take advantage of the Excel Chart functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for any help you can give,</p>
<p>Mark</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that there are matrix functions already built into Excel. Have a look at MMULT(), MINVERSE() and MDETERM().<br />
Maybe they can help in your calculation so that you will not have to do any UDF at all.</p>
<p>If you have the system of linear equations&nbsp; like</p>
<p>a11 * x1 + a12 * x2 + a13 * x3 + ... + a1n * xn = y1<br />
a21 * x1 + a22 * x2 + a23 * x3 + ... + a2n * xn = y2<br />
...<br />
an1 * x1 + an2 * x2 + an3 * x3 + ... + ann * xn = yn</p>
<p>or more compact A*X = Y where A is a nxn matrix and X and Y are nx1 vectors where A and Y are known and X is unknown, the solution can be written as X = A^-1 * Y.</p>
<p>Example: n = 3. If you have your matrix A of aij-coefficients in cells A1:C3 and your y-vector in cells D1:D3 then you can directly get your unknown x-values in cells E1:E3 by selecting the cells E1:E3 and "array enter" the following formula there:<br />
Note: "Array enter" means that you confirm by CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER rather than just ENTER.</p>
<p><strong>=MMULT(MINVERSE(A1:C3),D1:D3)</strong></p>
<p>Hope this helps / Lars-Åke</p>

    <title>VBA to combine unique items to a single list&#47;sheet and cross tab - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zakynthos  say:</h3>
<h2>            VBA to combine unique items to a single list&#47;sheet and cross tab with variables</h2>
                    This question was recently posted here but am re-posting as I have since thought through the 7 step sequence more clearly.<br />
<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_xp-excel/combining-data-from-columns-into-a-and-cross/78d36cc6-4d5b-4565-ab23-c9c30c6d3bba<br />
<br />
<br />
First, thanks very much for all helpful previous comments on this post - it made me aware that I was looping a loop and that explains to me now my first and last cross tabs were identical!<br />
<br />
My apologies for posting unprofessional looking code - yes, parts were recorded as I was advised to do this and I refer to the original problem as stated in:<br />
<br />
<br />
I am clear on what I want to do and your comments forced me to think harder about the sequence.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The task is to cross tab a large and expanding no. of both algorithms and reports, so I'm looking to compile a routine that's scaleable.&nbsp; For the moment, say 100 reports across and 10,000 algorithms down.&nbsp; The other part of this is to integrate all the algorithms
 into column A and remove duplicates to end with a list of unique aglorithms cross tabbed to each report.<br />
<br />
Steps<br />
<br />
1 Copy col A and E from Sheet 1 to A and B on Sheet 2<br />
2. Input formula down col B to link A and B values<br />
3. Input =if(isnumber(Match .....) etc to col C to return an 'x' against each A/B value<br />
4. Fix values in column C<br />
4.Copy col A from Sheet 2 and column F from sheet 1 to Cols. A and B on sheet 3<br />
5.Combine 2nd list algorithms in F into first list in A on sheet 3<br />
6.Remove duplicate values in col A on sheet 3<br />
7.Close up any gaps created in Column A on sheet 3<br />
7.Repeat step 2 above<br />
9.Repeat step 3 above<br />
10.Repeat step 4 above<br />
11.Repeat steps 1 to 7 above until first empty column on Sheet 1<br />
<br />
That's it! - I know it's simple and I would really love to have the opportunity today to work this out for myself because I really get a lot of satisfaction from doing it and prefer it to crossword or Sudoku/Chess puzzles any day - but work comes first!.<br />
<br />
Many thanks again for your help.

<p>I'm feeling a bit stuck here.&nbsp; I've given you sample code to generate loops, but each time, you split the code up into separate subs (the number of which is growing) and then ask for it to be put into a loop!</p>
<p>I guess you are understanding the code that "does stuff", but perhaps I need to explain the logic of the loop, so in the spirit of "teach a man to fish" vs "give a man a fish", let me explain how the loop works.</p>
<p>If you have a range of cells that you want to loop through you can use a <strong>
For Each... In... Next</strong> loop.&nbsp; VBA is made up of many <strong>collections</strong> of objects.&nbsp; There are, for example, all the Sheet objects in the Workbook.Sheets collection, and all the Shape objects drawn in a worksheet appear in the Worksheet.Shapes
 collection.</p>
<p>Now a Range is merly a <strong>collection of cells</strong>.&nbsp; A cell is itself a range, so a range is really a collection of (single-cell) ranges.&nbsp; This is how we can use this:</p>
<p>Dim rng As Range<br />
Dim c As Range</p>
<p>Set rng = Range("A1:D1")<br />
For Each c In rng<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do stuff with the c object<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.Value = c.Column<br />
Next c</p>
<p>This will loop through each cell in the range "rng".</p>
<p>You can make use of the "c" object like this:</p>
<p>c.Value = "aString"</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>c.Formula = "=A1+1"</p>
<p>And you can access the current coordinates of the c object by using c.Row and c.Column.</p>
<p>Note, I call it "c" as it represents a cell, but it could be called anything.</p>
<p>In my previous code, we superimposed a second loop by including the sht = sht + 1 line.&nbsp; This incremented a variable that we used to name and reference the new Sheets.</p>
<p>So as an example, try looping through this code to see how it works:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim rng As Range, c As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set rng = Sheets(1).Range("1:1") <em>'Define the range as the entire&nbsp;first row</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each c In rng<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If c.Value = "" Then Exit For&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>'This will end the loop when the first empty cell in rng (i.e. row 1) is reached.</em><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If c.Column &gt; 5 Then <em>'If current cell's column number is &lt; 6 (i.e. left of col F), do nothing, otherwise enter the&nbsp;If statement...</em><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debug.Print c.Column<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debug.Print c.Row<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debug.Print c.Address<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debug.Print c.Value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next c&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>'Loops to the next c (cell) in the range "rng"</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Now given the coplexities of your set up (as evident by the increasing length of your posts! ;o)&nbsp;I suggest you have a go at implementing a loop yourself and see if you can get the logic right.</p>
<p>One other point; if you really want to separate out your code into separate procedures, you can do this, but if using in a loop, you'd want to pass arguments to them.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<p>Sub WriteFormulaInCell(rowNum As Long, colNum As Long)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cells(rowNum, colNum).Formula = "=A1+1"<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>Sub CallWriteFormulaInCellInLoop()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim i As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For i = 1 To 10<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call WriteFormulaInCell(rowNum:=i, colNum:=3)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next i<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>'<em>But that would just as easily be accomplished by using:</em></p>
<p>Sub WriteFormulaInCellInLoopInOneSub()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim i As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For i = 1 To 10<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cells(rowNum, colNum).Formula = "=A1+1"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next i<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i.e. it's&nbsp;often simpler to not bother creating multiple procedures to do things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally (ignoring my previous observation about the lengths of posts!), you asked "<em>is there a method where, once `i've inserted a row at the top of my Measures Report file which references all this data, to copy the headings from B1 onwards in that workbook
 to replace 'Sheet2' tab name,&nbsp; C1 heading to replace 'Sheet3' tab name etc, for all 250 tabs?</em>"</p>
<p>You could use code like this:</p>
<p>Sub RenameSheets()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim rng As Range, c As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set rng = Worksheets("<strong>Measures Report</strong>").Rows(1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each c In rng<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If c.Value = "" Then Exit For&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>'Stop when first empty cell is reached.<br />
</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If c.Column &gt; 1 Then<br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Name for Sheet<strong>2</strong> in B1 (i.e. col <strong>2</strong>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Name for Sheet<strong>3</strong> in C1 (i.e. col <strong>3</strong>), etc.<br />
</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheets("Sheet" &amp; c.Column).Name = c.Value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next c<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
That will name as many sheets as there are non-empty cells (without gaps) in row 1 of a sheet called "Measures Report", using the contents (values) of those cells.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, please try and have a go making your own code, my recommendation is to avoid using multiple sub-procedures, and post back if you get any problems.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>Cheers<br />
Rich</p>

    <title>Copy text from powerpoint into a RTF text editor, losing numbers and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flip535  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copy text from powerpoint into a RTF text editor, losing numbers and spaces</h2>
                    <p>We are using PowerPoint 2016 (16.0.6769.2017). We are attempting to copy text from a powerpoint presentation and into WordPad (not Word ). We are noticing that the RTF that is in the clipboard is malformed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here is a simple example.</p>
<p>Create a new blank presentation, and on the first page add text with a single number character "1"</p>
<p>now copy over the single character "1" over to an RTF text editor, like WordPad.
</p>
<p>when you paste into WordPad the "1" disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>here is what the RTF looks like in the windows clipboard:</p>
<p>{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\lnbrkrule<br />
{\fonttbl<br />
{\f1\fnil\fcharset0\fprq0 Calibri Light;}<br />
}<br />
{\colortbl;<br />
\red0\green0\blue0;<br />
\red0\green0\blue255;<br />
}<br />
\pard\plain\ltrpar\qc\kerning24\fs120\lang1033 {\f1\cf11}<br />
}</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what is wrong here is the second to last line....<br />
\pard\plain\ltrpar\qc\kerning24\fs120\lang1033 {\f1\cf1<strong>1</strong>} </p>
<p>should actually be....<br />
\pard\plain\ltrpar\qc\kerning24\fs120\lang1033 {\f1\cf1<strong> 1</strong>} </p>
<p>
</p><p>I took the liberty of bolding the text that has changed,. It seems as though the rtf is missing some nescessary space delimeters resulting in missing numbers and spaces when WordPad processes the rtf.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>16.0.4266.1003 doesn't seem to have this issue.</p>
<p>16.0.6769.2017 does have the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>edit: another way to reproduce this is to save the powerpoint as a *.rtf file. This makes it easier to see the malformed rtf because you can now open it in a standard text editor to see the rtf markup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there is definitely something wierd going on with the rtf generation.</p>

<li>
<span>If retaining your text formatting is important, paste to Word, which doesn’t use RTF by default.&nbsp;To preserve your formatting, click the
<strong>Home</strong> tab, click the drop-down under <strong>Paste,</strong> and click
<strong>Keep Source Formatting</strong>.&nbsp;Word can then copy/paste to WordPad as desired.&nbsp;
</span></li><li>
<span>If retaining your text formatting is not important,
</span><span>use Notepad. Note that doing so will result in lost formatting.</span></li></ul>

            Hey Erik, Thanks for the response and the work arounds. Unfortunately this issue is affecting a tool we use with PowerPoint that happens to use PowerPoints copy\paste automatically (it uses PowerPoint Automation via COM). Basically it will open large presentations
 and scan through with copy and paste. furthermore, the bug not only happens with numbers, but it happens to remove spaces in text. The example i showed above just doesn't show it directly.<br />

<h2>            Cerber Ransomware</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>one of our computer in the network affected by a cerber ransomware recently. The most of Microsoft office related files&nbsp;had renamed to unrecognized names and the file extensions had changed to .abb0. Each folder which has infected has a _readme.txt file
 that&nbsp;describe how to decrypt this files by paying money. But some files still can be used. The verse case is we don't have backups on this files since it was stored in the local hard disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible to remove virus and&nbsp;recover&nbsp;the infected files?</p>
<p>Is it possible to&nbsp;use the disinfected files?</p>
<p>if we copy the disinfected files to another pc is it possible to spread the virus to the new one?</p>
<p>Is it possible to spread via network?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you kindly help us to resolve this matter.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

            <p>Most crypto malware ransomware is typically <strong>programmed to automatically remove itself</strong>...the malicious files responsible for the infection...after the encrypting is done since they are no longer needed. The encrypted files do not contain
 malicious code so they are safe. Unfortunately, most victims do not realize they have been infected until the ransomware displays the ransom note and the files have already been encrypted. In some cases there may be no ransom note and discovery only occurs
 at a later time when attempting to open an encrypted file. As such, they don't know how long the malware was on the system before being alerted or if other malware was installed along with the ransomware. If other malware was involved it could still be present
 so be sure to perform full scans with your anti-virus. Disinfection will not help with decryption of any files affected by the ransomware.
<br />
<br />
If your antivirus did not detect and remove anything, additional scans should be performed with other security programs like
<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/malwarebytes-anti-malware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<a href="http://www.techmixer.com/online-virus-scanner-list-online-scan-files-for-viruses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<br />
In cases where there is no workable free decryption fix tool and victims are not willing to pay the ransom, the only other alternative is to
<strong>backup/save your data as is and wait for a possible breakthrough</strong>...meaning, what seems like an impossibility at the moment (decryption of your data), there is always hope someday there may be a potential solution so save the encrypted data
 and wait until that time. <strong>Imaging the drive backs up everything related to the infection including encrypted files, ransom notes and registry entries containing possible information which may be needed if a solution is ever discovered</strong>. The
 encrypted files do not contain malicious code so they are safe. Even if a decryption tool is available, they do not always work correctly so keeping a backup of the original encrypted files and related information is a good practice.<br />

<p>You really need to provide some data as to just what your issue is.&nbsp; We cannot guess at these things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, this is a Insider site for volunteers that are testing future beta releases of W10.&nbsp; Yes, we test for bugs in future releases of W10.&nbsp; We have no support from Microsoft.&nbsp; Our reward is simply to assist MS in testing and we can offer suggestions,
 improvements, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are a new member since an hour or so ago so likely a new member&nbsp; just to post on this site.&nbsp; Not likely that you are testing beta W10 builds.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All W10 public build users are entitled to Microsoft support.&nbsp; That is likely your best source of support.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has just released a new public build 17134.1 to selected users and finally to all users.&nbsp; This Insider group in now testing builds 17166 or beyond.&nbsp; Most public build users are still using a build released last fall that could be 16299.xxx.&nbsp; I
 sort of forget. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to determine first what build you are using.&nbsp; You can find out by searching for "winver" or go to Settings/Update and then click on "O/S build info".&nbsp; Just hard to go anywhere without knowing what build you are using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck</p>

            you phone was not initially meant for your region. the langugage pack was apparently added to your phone prior to your purchase. when you update firmware or have to reset the phone, the language pack always defaults to the original one that came with the
 phone. the only way you can get your language pack back is to go to nokia care point and ask them to put it on for you for a small fee. now if you update again you will lose your langugae pack and it will default to the orginal one it came with for the region
 it was sold for.

<p>If you don't have one already - open a Hotmail account.<br />
Go to "contacts" on the Hotmail page on your browser.<br />
Click "import from file" where it says "add people". Import the data you have with the .csv file.<br />
Enter your Hotmail details into your Lumia under "Setting/ email + accounts/add an account/windows live"<br />
Your contacts should now sync providing you have a data connection.</p>

<p>Actually the easiest way which will also give you control over what goes where would be through
<a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Mail.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHen you set it up and you enter your Microsoft account it will allow you to import a .csv and determine which fields should be used. Much more flexible as through the Microsoft account where you also need a specific format and you have a limited number
 of contacts you can import (may also apply to Mail, you'll need Outlook with the hotmail connector in that case).</p>

            Apple Mail makes a non standard .mbox file. If you look inside the .mbox file you'll see it's a folder with another folder named like this "3D5E4B46-F026-4CFA-96FF-28DBD1F7A18A" drilling down you'll find individual .eml files.<br />
<br />
Your best option to move from Apple Mail to Outlook for Mac is to use an IMAP account. If you don't have an IMAP account you can setup a free Gmail account.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Licensing Question</h2>
                    <p>Hey everybody. So i installed and use Windows 10 Insider Prev. on my Tab and Notebook. My Question is: After the Win 10 release will I be able to put in my former Windows 8.1 pro key and make the current prev. version my own activated Win 10 installation
 or do i have to reinstall win 8.1 and do the upgrade from the upgrade tool? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a idea on how the old Windows 8.1 Keys will be upgraded to Win 10 Keys? Do I get a new Key, or is the existing key updated to a Win 10 key to do a clean install form DVD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your answers :)</p>

            <p>It depends.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you did an upgrade from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 Beta, you should be able to upgrade to RTM without having to do anything since the key is stored.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you did a clean install, you have two options:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A. Reinstall Windows 8.1 and then do the upgrade using the upgrade tool to obtain a valid Windows 10 install, and then you can create a backup medium from there to do a clean install of the OS.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: There is a possibility that if you have a newer computer with UEFI instead of BIOS, Windows 10 may read the key from your system without having to reinstall Windows 8, but I don't know if this is true or not. In my case, I'm on an older motherboard
 that does not store my product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>B. Keep yourself as a Windows Insider where you will always be on the testing branch. Basically, you'll be continuously testing Windows 10 patches before they hit the retail people. Each build will have an expiration date, and if you ever forfeit to upgrade
 your computer on time, you may lose access to using your computer until you upgrade to the newest build.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Link:</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/06/19/upcoming-changes-to-windows-10-insider-preview-builds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/06/19/upcoming-changes-to-windows-10-insider-preview-builds/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I'm going to stay as an Insider for a week or two to avoid the slow servers at launch, but I will eventually just bite the bullet and reinstall Windows 7, upgrade to Windows 10, and create a backup medium to do a clean install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it would have been cool if Microsoft would just allow me to enter my Windows 7 product key during the transition to retail, but I do not see any indication of this.</p>

            <p>Hey, thanks for the Answer. Yeah, it would have been nice if u just could enter your key and it will change vom Technical Prev to your own activated version. But hey... nevermind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will Windows 10 bring a function to create Installation Media by myself from my current installation? And if so, is my former win 8.1 key a win 10 key in the future, which i have to enter at a clean install?

            <p>You can Create a (Windows) System Image which is a Snapshot of everything on your hard-drive, including hidden partitions and boot information, Windows files, Apps and Programs and all personal folders and files</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is a clean install, or you don't have much on your hard drive, it should fit on 3 x blank DVDs</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, an external USB hard drive or 2nd internal drive is used to store the Image Folder (eg F:\WindowsImageBackup)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Control Panel &gt; System and Security &gt; Back up and Restore (Windows 7)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check W10 is Activated in Control Panel &gt; System and Security &gt; System&nbsp; before creating the image</p>
<p>
</p><p>[MS decided to get rid of (deprecate) this feature, but I saw somewhere it may be reprieved in W10]</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Restoring an image can be done from the Repair Options on a W10 Install DVD or USB Flash</p>
<p>or</p>

<p>Hey everybody. So i installed and use Windows 10 Insider Prev. on my Tab and Notebook. My Question is: After the Win 10 release will I be able to put in my former Windows 8.1 pro key and make the current prev. version my own activated Win 10 installation
 or do i have to reinstall win 8.1 and do the upgrade from the upgrade tool? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a idea on how the old Windows 8.1 Keys will be upgraded to Win 10 Keys? Do I get a new Key, or is the existing key updated to a Win 10 key to do a clean install form DVD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your answers :)</p>

</p><p>Microsoft recently noted the following options available:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>With Windows 10, you can create your own recovery media and back up the pristine state of the operating system and preinstalled software. If things go wrong and you are unable to refresh or reset your device successfully, you can boot the device using
 recovery media and reset to the prior pristine state.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_upgrade/making-a-backup-copy-of-windows-10-to-a-dvd/3b3b8f1d-2455-4c32-b38a-d919f190c050">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_upgrade/making-a-backup-copy-of-windows-10-to-a-dvd/3b3b8f1d-2455-4c32-b38a-d919f190c050</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm also under the understanding that you can also perform a true clean install of the OS after the upgrade as well from the backup medium and not just a restore of the current snapshot of your system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that the backup medium will store the key that is tied to your specific PC/Motherboard, so you won't be able to use it on another computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I would make a backup DVD or USB Thumb drive, and put it in a secure spot in the event that I would need to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another note:</p>
<p>I think making a recovery partition might be another idea:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I would still keep a DVD or Thumb drive in a safe place in the event that your drive completely fails.<br />

            <span>For me it was an issue with the crappy SonicWall Global VPN Client v4.7.3 both 32bit and 64bit wreaking havoc with our general networking. This was regardless of whether we were actively using the VPN connection, it's mere presence caused
 intermittent issues. Either removing the software or going back to v4.6.4 seemed to work for me.</span>
<div><br />
I downloaded the Visio install file approximately 30 times and every time it would come back with a different hash, checking the has was far more efficient than attempting to install the program and wait for it to randomly fail. The program I used to check
 the has was called HashTab (<a href="http://www.implbits.com/hashtab.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.implbits.com/hashtab.aspx</a>). If you download the file a number of times and the hash is different every time, then it is something with your networking.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Other strange behavior I experienced with this issue was with corrupted images when browsing the web, corrupted file attachments and data encryption errors when using RDP. It was the data encryption error that led me down the path to the solution.
 I found this site:&nbsp;<a href="http://netache.blogspot.com/2012/10/because-of-error-in-data-encryption.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://netache.blogspot.com/2012/10/because-of-error-in-data-encryption.html</a></div>

<h3> cgriner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reboot and Select Proper Boot Device - black screen message Windows 10 Developer Preview - PLEASE HELP&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have a <strong>Toshiba Satellite ESST-AST2N01</strong> laptop. It came delivered with Windows 8 or 8.1 about 10 months ago. For several months I have been running Windows 10 Preview / Developer.&nbsp; When the problem occurred a few days ago, not sure which
 was the last update I was on but it was probably around 10 May 2015. There were no problems with the OS before that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went off to work in the AM and when I came home in evening, I was surprised to see my computer on but was displaying the following message on a black screen:
<em><strong>"R</strong></em><strong><em>eboot and Select Proper Boot Device or Insert Boot Media in Selected Boot Device and Press a Key"</em></strong>.&nbsp; And I believe that I had shut down that morning.&nbsp; If not I would have put it to sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please help?!? I have much of my stuff backed up.&nbsp; But .... I really need the machine for work and travel real soon.&nbsp;&nbsp; I should also mention that this Toshiba does
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NOT have and Function Keys</span> as traditionally known.&nbsp; It does have an
<strong>FN</strong> key.&nbsp; I have not idea what to press beyond that and cannot seem to find help online for that. &nbsp; And not so sure anything like BIOS will even come up on display.&nbsp; All I get is the black screen which only displays the
<em><strong>Reboot and Select</strong> </em>message over and over no matter what I tap on the keyboard. In other words, I cannot seem to get into the BIOS to even try and troubleshoot and save what I have.&nbsp; And no, it did not come with a recovery disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I cannot access the battery without removing the entire underside.&nbsp; I am reluctant to do that in case Toshiba would take it for repair.&nbsp; They did take it back in early February 2015 to replace a bad cooling fan.&nbsp; But they may not want to do
 anything since it is / was now running Windows 10 ....&nbsp; Looks like I may be reverting to 8.1 if this does not pan out with an easy solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help out there for this situation? I am really not happy with this.&nbsp; Simple fix or solution?!</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>What were you planning on doing with it if you did have "traditional" function keys?&nbsp; Whatever that would be presumably could still be done by just adding the Fn when pressing the appropriate&nbsp;top row key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW you have had an answer in your other threads on the Toshiba forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think it was pointed out there and it was difficult to see if your model has it but apparently there is a supplied utility which could be used to toggle the meaning of the Fn key.&nbsp;

You can configure the Function Keys Mode by selecting the "Special function mode" or "Standard F1-F12 mode" by the help of the
<strong>HWSetup Utility</strong>.<br />

    <title>Vimeo videos no longer playing in-line in Yammer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vimeo videos no longer playing in-line in Yammer</h2>
                    <p>Hello! Historically we have been able to have videos from Vimeo or Youtube play in-line in Yammer vs just directing people to visit the pages for the videos, however, since last week, we have not been able to do this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did something change? We really need to have a solution that allows videos to play in-line as just uploading videos directly to Yammer (which plays in-line) doesn't accurately capture views.
</p>
<p><br />
Thanks! </p>

    <title>950xl Bluetooth not Staying Connected - Just started happening last - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> russ05  say:</h3>
<h2>            950xl Bluetooth not Staying Connected - Just started happening last few days ago</h2>
                    My&nbsp;950xl&nbsp; worked great paired with my BMW for many months.&nbsp; Now in the last few days it stays connected for a few minutes to 10 seconds and drops.&nbsp; I use Groove to play music.&nbsp; It also drops on my blue tooth headphones now.<br />
What is going on?&nbsp; Was there a new update pushed to my phone that broke it?&nbsp; Is there some way the antenna is dirty or broken?&nbsp; My daughter's iPhone pairs with same BMW with no issue so I know it is not the car.<br />
Attacked is phone info<br />
This is beyond frustrating!!!&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/44a378c2-7db5-40ec-b0af-0e06d8fbc661" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/44a378c2-7db5-40ec-b0af-0e06d8fbc661" /></a>

            I fixes this by disabling all the auto-wifi connect options. &nbsp;
