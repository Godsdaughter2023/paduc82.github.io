    <title>Xbox One App not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One App not working</h2>
                    It's not connecting so I can't use the app as a remote. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but it's done nothing, I tried deleting then re-adding the console but when I get to the "connect by IP address bit" I just get "we are unable to connect
 at the moment. 80000001e". Both the phone and the xbox are connected to the internet and working fine, I've restarted the router and the Xbox itself just in case but no luck.

</p><p>Sorry to hear you are having this problem. Typically a hard reset can solve this issue, but before you do that:</p>

<p>
</p><p>It the problem still exists, I recommend you to perform a hard reset on your console (<span>Hold the power button on the console for 8 seconds or until the power shuts down completely.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Unplug the power cord from the back of the

            It could be due to xbox system over heating possibly bad components with the wifi router or something else entirely best bet is to possibly contact xbox support and maybe also wifi provider support and they can probably help solve the issue

    <title>Xbox one cannot control TV volume - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kamata50  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one cannot control TV volume</h2>
                    
<p>So When I purchased the xbox one day one, I was able to control my tv volume (xbox volume up, down, mute) I also purchase the media remote for it.</p>
<p>During the 2nd phase of the early update program, it removed my tv functions. I didn't think much about it as I was under the assumption it would be fixed in the next update. That was false, when I select TV and OneGuide, it would bring me an error code.
 So I did what I really did not want to do a factory reset to defaults.</p>
<p><br />
Now it seems to launch the app to allow me up pick my devices but it still will not control my tv volume. I used the auto detect before and nothing. I typed in Dynex model number DX32L100A13. The xbox still cannot give me my tv functions back. Is there any
 ideas around this otherwise I feel like I just wasted money on the media remote. It's even more disappointing because I know it worked before</p>

<p>Hi Kamata50,</p>
<p>Sorry about the issues, we should still be able to control your Dynex. I have a few questions for you.</p>
<p>1) Does your Kinect still have line of sight to your TV? Is anything blocking the IR receiver?</p>
<p>2) Have you tried going through "automatic" setup where we guide you through a few commands? Did none of those work?</p>
<p>We haven't done anything that would have made your Dynex stop working. Here are some remote codes you can try entering on the troubleshooting screen from TV &amp; OneGuide settings.</p>

<p>I've tried those codes and none of them worked :( I've also went through the auto set up and it says it found my tv but it never fully gave me back my volume or mute capabilities. I know it worked with my tv before the first update so it's frustrating that
 I no longer have this feature. </p>

<p>Hey Kamata,</p>
<p>Can you hold the Kinect about 5 feet from the TV, with it facing the TV? I just want to make sure nothing is blocking the IR from getting to the TV.</p>
<p>Also, there's Automatic detection and there's "Automatic" detection. If your TV gets auto-detected without any interaction from you, and we say "We Found your TV" at the bottom, you can hit a button that says "Let me enter it manually." Then you can choose
 "Automatic" from the next screen (real intuitive, right?).</p>
<p>Going through that "Automatic" setup, we send some commands to your TV, like Mute, as we try to detect it.

<p>Well this is disappointing... I just tried what you suggested. I currently have my kinect mounted on top of my tv. Now when it auto detects "we found your tv" i select the next button and it just carries on. When I select devices after it says tv not set.
 I tried doing what you said putting the kinect facing my tv and same thing "we found your tv but then still not set. I tried to select find it manually and I guess dynex just does not exists anymore under tv brands according to my xbox one.
</p>
<p>Some facts that may or may not help with this problem. I never had a cable box in the hdmi in. I never had the cable box in my room I use the verizon fios app. I just really want the volume, mute, and turning on and off function back with my console.
</p>
<p>I really would prefer not to reset to default settings again seeing as I used up 97% of my hdd already. Reinstalling all those games and dlc is a pain but if someway it can make it work, I'll suck it up and reset to factory defaults again.

<p>No need to do a full reset. From your description, I still don't think you went through our guided setup. (I could be wrong)</p>
<p>When it autodetects to "we found your TV", don't hit next. Choose the "manual" option. However, then we give you the choice to go through "automatic" setup.</p>
<p>In this setup, we send test commands to your TV. Like we'll send "Mute" or "Volume Up" and ask you if it worked. Did you go through this?</p>
<p>The existence of a cable box shouldn't matter.</p>
<p>You can reset TV settings without resetting the console settings (From TV &amp; OneGuide troubleshooting).</p>

<p>I don't see the automatic option you are speaking of. </p>
<p>I go to devices and select tv model (not set)</p>
<p>It brings me to the next page which is we found your tv now I see 3 options. </p>
<p>1. Next</p>
<p>2. Enter it manually</p>
<p>3. Back</p>
<p>I hit option 2 enter it manually. Which brings me to the what brand is your tv page. There I can select the model or I don't see my brand. When I select I don't see my brand I type in dynex, dy, or d. It now does the loading circle then brings me to the
 we couldn't find any tv brands that match. I get two options on that page try again or skip.
</p>
<p>I appreciate you for taking your time and trying to help me through this the best you can. I don't see the automatic option you said I should see</p>

<p>Since just b4 the last update I had to retune my xbox to pick up my tv just after trying my xbox to pick up my cable box, after finding where it was I selected my tv (toshiba) I hit next nothing happened done it a few times and nothing, I selected can't
 find my brand and typed it in manually, sorry we can't find your brand of tv. &nbsp;The same thing happens when im trying my virgin media box, it also won't let me into the display settings at all, when you click on it it kicks you back out again, bit annoying
 when the tv worked b4 when saying xbox on it would turn on the tv.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 update - downloaded but want to postpone installation</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on reserve my free copy of Windows which downloaded Windows 10 (approximately 3GB) for me automatically in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have a copy of it on my PC ready to install but I do not want to install it now - I want to wait till a later stage to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everytime I shut down my PC and restart it, Windows 10 ask me to accept / decline the EULA agreement and if I click on decline, it says "Cleaning files...". Also when I click on the Windows 10 icon on my taskbar by the time, it says "Downloading Windows
 10". My network traffic also spike when I look at my "Local Area Connection Status" and I see that I'm receiving more bytes which means it must be downloading Windows 10 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot download Windows 10 again each time I click on decline in the EULA agreement when I restart my PC especially since I live in an area where internet is scarce already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also don't understand why it would download Windows 10 again as when I look at my "Windows Update", it is sitting there ready for installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I prevent the PC asking me to accept / decline the EULA agreement each time my PC starts up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This won't be the best answer, but....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I signed up for the upgrade as well. I saw that it wanted to download and install and had heard I could postpone the installation once downloaded, so I let it download. I have a good connection so the download part was fast. The Win 10 upgrade window says
 something along the lines of click X to have your PC scanned/checked (for incompatibilities, I think) and then schedule an installation date/time. The scan took a long time. When it was over I was given options to install now or postpone by three days (including
 time).&nbsp; I had expected to have a lot more than a three day window but moved it ahead the three day max. When I next got the notification that Win 10 wanted to install I moved it ahead another three days (which is where I am now).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to move it ahead because I learned shortly after I pushed it ahead the first time (was too busy to deal with then) that one of my apps won't work w/Win 10 (lockup). I'm here because I was hoping to find a way to move the installation date ahead by
 more than 3 days, a month preferably.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing it every three days will be really annoying but is better than getting whacked with the upgrade and having an app or more wrecked. I'm hoping MS wakes up and allows us to reschedule the upgrade by more than 3 days soon.</p>

<h2>            WINDOWS System Restore &#40;Restoring Files&#41; Loop or Stuck</h2>
                    <p>My Toshiba laptop was acting up weird so I end up needed to do reset recovery and I went to Geek Squad to help me out. Recovery was success and Geek Squad gave an approval!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a fair amount of time say 3 to 4 weeks later after installation (last week) I began experiencing system repairs and blue screen errors (includes UNEXPECTED STORE EXCEPTION and one other error which I can’t think of). It would occur once or twice on certain
 days. When these errors first occurred, my laptop was missing a few components within the screen like Start Menu, Notification Panel and random panels that are essential to Windows thats easier to navigate had stopped working/showing. I was still able to navigate
 network and settings by using right click on the taskbar. I made sure everything was up to date (windows updates). I tried to resolved this issue by looking for resolutions and videos online. I also tried to do a reset my PC and troubleshooting diagnostics
 but both was unable to complete. When I did a research online, I saw that there was an option for recovery: Refresh Your PC. However, while trying to do recovery in the setting, that specific option was not listed so I knew my laptop was no use now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I turned on my laptop and it booted up just fine but once it arrive to the spinning wheel before login it went in a loop. Login never showed. Same thing happens everytime I do restart/hard reset too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I am trying a different option which is System Restore Point. Im dont know the exact amount of time process take, but its been over an 1 hour 1/2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in desperate need of help!</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 6 - 3 monitors</h2>
                    I would like to attach 3 external monitors to my Surface Pro 6 using the dock. I would plug in 2 monitors to the mini display ports on the dock, and the 3rd monitor to port on the computer itself. I would then use "second screen only" and turn off the
 display on the Surface itself. Before I go out and buy 3 monitors ... Will this work?&nbsp;

<p>You might want to try adding more than the exact amount to the Paypal account, maybe $5 or so? If that doesn't work, try removing all your payment methods from your account and then re-adding them. Just for my information, have you tried purchasing this
 promo with any other payment method?</p>

<p>to get refunded through xbox as my bank say its up to them to refund me.</p>
<p>I have tried everything phoning live chat etc. I am still been charged despite cancelling the&nbsp;</p>
<p>account too many times for me to remember . Deleting my credit card stopping</p>
<p>direct debits etc. Is there anyone that can advice ?? My only choice now is to take legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>be sure to double check every account you have on <a href="http://account.microsoft.com/services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://account.microsoft.com/services</a> to see if any subscriptions show up.</p>
<p>If no subscriptions are showing there, then there is a different cause for the charges. Either a different account you haven't checked or someone may have gotten access to your credit card details.</p>
<p>In such case I would advise to contact the credit card (bank) company to stop those charges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does originate from one of your Microsoft Accounts then you should be able to cancel the subscriptions immediately via that link, if that for some reason fails you will have to contact Xbox Support via Phone or Microsoft Support Chat and they should
 be able to cancel the subscription(s) immediately.</p>

                    I was permanently banned from an MSN MOVIES &amp; GENERAL DISCUSSION Forum. I feel I was unfairly banned &amp; am ready to apologize or do whatever I must to get my account reactivated. The behavior on the board is worse now then it ever was while I was posting
 there. Is there anything I can do to get back unto the board? I see posters with different monikers &amp; accounts all the time. I don't know how they do it but I do know I want to do it the right way. Please consider helping me with this issue. Thank you.

            <b>Hello, <i>CageLover!</i></b>
<div><b><i><br />
</i></b></div>
<div><b>Welcome to The Microsoft Answers Forum!</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>I am sorry to say that Microsoft Answers <u><b>cannot</b></u>&nbsp;help with problems concerning MSN. MS Answers is a forum for questions concerning Windows, Microsoft Office, Internet Explorer, Windows Phone, Microsoft Security Essentials, Zune, and Office
 for Apple Computers (Macs).</div>
<div><br />
<div>The branch of Microsoft Support you need to contact can be located <a href="http://www.windowslivehelp.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. Windows Live Support will assist you with a range of services including MSN.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If your access to the forum was revoked due to your posting of inappropriate, inflammatory or insulting content, you have probably been banned for a reason. Microsoft
<u><b>will not</b></u>&nbsp;remove your ban without a good reason.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you were banned for an unfair reason, you have a chance to recover access. I recommend writing a polite and well written message to whoever you are going to contact, indicating your apologies.&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>I <u>would not </u></b><i><u><b>at all</b></u>&nbsp;</i>try to make another account. This is the morally wrong path to take and can lead to further problems. If you make more accounts, you will not be trusted. Microsoft can find out your IP address and eventually
 ban your IP from the forum if you abuse under multiple accounts. Apologise, be polite, etc.</div>
<div>The common mistake people make is that they become rude and angry when the answer to their apology is 'No'. This shows that you're not polite (or apologetic) and will lead to their distrust of you in a future appeal against your ban.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Good Luck!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards,</div>
<div>Jetpackboy</div>
<div><br />
<div>P.S. If the answer to remove your ban is still 'No' then don't give up hope. Build up a
<i>good </i>reputation by helping people and being nice in other MSN forums and places like here. Microsoft may recognize your contributions and remove your ban.</div>

<h3> edcarcal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Version 1511 will not update to 1607</h2>
                    Windows 1511 is currently installed on this PC desktop (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4009939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">January 10, 2017—KB3210721 (OS Build 10586.753)</span></a>. I have tried everything posted over the
 last few months to get version 1607 to install&nbsp;(including using the current&nbsp;ISO) but nothing works - if gets partway through the upgrade and reverts to 1511 every time. Microsoft online support has tried everything they can think of including restarting a
 number of update services with no luck. Best guess is that the anniversary edition is encountering a situation or driver that works in 1511 but not in 1607, but no one seems to know what this is or how to correct it (if possible). Is there anyone in the Microsoft
 universe that can explain this?

            <p>The current version is 1511 (10586.73), and seems to have got to this level installing updates for the last few months with no problem. I am concerned that Microsoft will not be supporting 1511 after&nbsp;March, even through it is not experiencing any issues
 other than the 1607 update. &nbsp;While I appreciate your need to see what's going on, the files you request will not be helpful (been there, done that). In fact, I have tried
 computer - it is currently trying to install the 1607 feature update every time it boots with the same issue - after restart, it makes the update to 10% and reverts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded this computer from 8.1 Pro to 10 last year, and that was a disaster. After a couple of months I threw in the towel, wiped the drive,&nbsp;installed 10, and then added my apps and that is where I am now and have been since last Fall. After looking at
 the logs, there seems to be an issue with the MOUPG, Footprint.ICB and&nbsp;&nbsp;WINDLP items, but there is very little about the errors reported. Have a look and see what you think. I am beginning to think the update is getting confused as to what exactly is the status
 of Windows on this machine&nbsp;(even though SFC, diskcheck and DISM all report no errors and the protected partition is mostly empty), as after each attempt to install 1607, the system reports the update was installed.</p>

            <p>I too have been trying to update from version 1511 to 1607 with no good results. In my case I believe thwe Problems runs deep. All updates before 1607 installed fine. As a final try I formatted my HD and tried to do a clean install of version 1607 with no
 joy. Tried to clean install on same computer and HD with&nbsp; version 1511 and went perfectly . T<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">his suggests that the problem runs deep and not due to rogue progrms like anti virus&nbsp; or other installed programs.&nbsp;

            Well, I certainly agree with you. After a lot of attempts, it appears Windows Update finally gave up and is now installing 1511 updates again on this PC. It is most annoying that Microsoft staff will not comment on the problem and offer a definitive reason
 this BS continues. The 1607 update stops with no discernable reason, and even the TechNet folks keep saying try a clean boot. Fascinating - clean boot disables update, so go figure.

            I have this same problem and it all began when I tried to update from the anniversary edition to the Creators edition. My machine just crashed. Absolutely unusable. Tried everything possible and nothing. I took it to a tech who was able to install an incomplete
 version of windows but just enough to allow me to save my files. No updates no nothing. After months of trying and using every new trick that Microsoft engineers are trying absolutely nothing works. Now they are saying that you have to check the manufacturers
 website for drivers that are compatible with the Creators build.... Really? To me we are all being jerked off to have to buy a new computer. What a sales technique! Better than ransomware. No one saw this coming and Microsoft is ominously quiet about resolving
 the issue so what is that telling you? If you want to use Windows 10 you have to pay. Another 10 billion to Bill.....

            Well, the PC is still stuck on 1511, and although it quit trying to install 1607, it is now in a continuous fail loop trying to install 1709. I am beginning to think this has something to do with the way Win 10 is treating the 'AMD Phenom II X6 1055T 2.8
 GHz' processor in this machine - an older 64 bit cpu. It looks like it may not have installed the emergency update today, and not 1709. This just goes on and on - thanks a lot Microsoft!

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since we're now trying to install the <em><strong>Windows Update</strong></em> version
<strong>1709</strong>, have you tried using the latest <strong>.ISO</strong> copy of
<strong>Windows</strong> <strong>10</strong> in performing the update? If not, you can click the
<em><strong>Download tool now</strong></em> button found on this <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. Once the download is complete, temporarily disable any antivirus
 program and disconnect the internet from the device before running the update. This will prevent any possible update conflicts and may prevent any unnecessary download while the update progress is going on. If prompted, skip the portion where it ask you to
 download additional online content. This can be done once the <em><strong>Windows Update</strong></em> is complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll appreciate if you can send us an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p>

<p>That did not work this time, like it didn't work the last three times I tried it. After trying to install 1709, I now get the message "...couldn't finish installing updates", and a message saying "restart to check disc". The update screen now also says this
 copy is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be aware I have checked and rechecked all disks several times <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>in depth</strong></span>, never without an error being found, and if you read the posts above, you will see I have checked everything else as well several times. Version 1511 continues to work well with no problems, but refuses to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue with you folks going through your cookie-cutter list of things to try over and over with the same results, and that goes all the way up to your second level support. It is obvious to me that after 1511 you changed something in Win 10 that
 is no longer compatible with this processor/bios, and the obvious question is "WHAT DID YOU DO?". Please quit bothering me and others over and over with the same inane ways to fix this - what is needed is for someone in your organization to look at the logs
 and determine what the problem is. Sounds simple, doesn't it, so why not???</p>
<p>
</p><p>The logs from the&nbsp; 1607 failures are still available at https://1drv.ms/u/s!ArfkeEc7XV-Tw3UGEzkCNjBhJfQy - if you want more, let me know.</p>

    <title>Gamer Tag changed because it was found to violate rules - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Gamer Tag changed because it was found to violate rules</h2>
                    
<p>My gamer tag "YourMom69lol" was changed, I thought it didn't violate rules 1 because it got through the filter and 2 because I didn't think anything was wrong with it. 69 was my number in high school, and why would "your mom lol" be in violation of any rules?</p>

<p>Anyway I understand the change but now i have a randomly generated name and I've already paid for 2 gamertag changes. Do I actually have to pay again to have my gamer tag changed from the randomly generated one that you've assigned me?
</p>

<p>Thanks in advance. </p>

            <p>Sorry to hear it. &nbsp;It does look as though your previous gamertag suggested a sexual act which does go against the ToU and CoC of the Live service.</p>
<p>However, to find out if that is the reason it was changed you should post to the suspensions forums.</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_360_support/f/41.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../41.aspx</a></p>
<p>It does not matter how many times you've paid to change your tag, you will need to do so again if you want to change it another time.</p>
<p>I should also mention here that if you get too many forced name changes the PET may see fit to ban your account from Live completely. &nbsp;If this happens then you will lose ownership of all content you have purchased and anything else associated with that account.</p>

<p>Just to add, just because it makes it through the filter, doesn't mean it's not a violation. Some words are fine to use, it just depends on the context in which they are used, which the filter cannot detect.</p>

<p>To the original question on this post your mom lol 69 . I found the gamertag to be sexual in reference d demeaning to mothers. &nbsp;You need to think in a general look of things while.choosing gamer tags they should not be rude, offensive, sexual ref, discriminatory
 toward others be it race religion origin background or sexual preference, Illecite controlled substance ref. Use good judgement anti won't have to change your tag. Your s though innocent as you think always put yourself in another's shoes an think how.they
 would perceive it that why I put your tag down for violation.</p>

<p>Sadly, PET doesnt respond to any request I have made- They have quoted the same generic email that my son supposedly used hardware or software to cheat yet I can tell you that an 8 year old has no hardware or software on that xbox that isnt either bought
 from a retail store or downloaded from xboxlive store. &nbsp;They wont give specifics, refuse to answer any private messages and act as if infallibility is the rule in Seattle. &nbsp;I have never seen evidence of anyone having their "ban" overturned and doubt that MS
 even cares. &nbsp;How can I ensure my children do not make the same mistakes again if they(or more importantly I) DO NOT KNOW THE SPECIFICS of what they did? &nbsp;I cant imagine acting like this in my profession as a physician. &nbsp;Very sad and disgusted. &nbsp;And... there
 has to be a name and or phone number to contact these people yet no one will publish. &nbsp;Happy to hear from an PETXBL employee NAVYANES</p>

            <p>NavyMD123 - sorry to hear that you've had this experience. &nbsp;However, the PET will only answer posts to their forums and will not answer outside of them. &nbsp;No one in the regular forums will be able to assist you.</p>
<p>If an account was banned due to cheating the issue of cheating does not need to have software installed on the console. &nbsp;If your son asked for or took part in a modded lobby in the game then that would be the reason. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The ToU and CoC that was agreed upon when the account was created are quite specific on that matter. &nbsp;The PET do make an investigation on an account prior to creating an enforcement action. &nbsp;They do not ban or suspend accounts without proper proof of wrongdoing.</p>

<p>I have been loyal to Xbox since the OG Xbox. I have my favorite CDs ripped into all my xboxes. For Microsoft to abandon this great feature is a slap in the face and proves that they are not listening
 to what customers want. Instead Microsoft focuses on gimmick features that look good in commercials. I don't want Kinect. I don't want live TV while playing video games. I want
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">MY</span> music. I will not buy an Xbox One until this feature is restored. And by the way, Xbox One is a stupid name for the 3rd console.</p>

<p>2 things:</p>
<p>1) Why would you resurrect a thread from January?</p>
<p>2) This console is very different in design than previous consoles (it has a whole different architecture, in fact), hence why it doesn't have many things that the previous consoles have had. Not to worry though, MS is aware of what many of us want and are
 working diligently to make features such as this a possibility (although there are no guarantees). Still, the console has plenty of great features on it, including alternate ways to listen to music, so enjoy it for what it has to offer right now... Or if you
 don't already have it, then feel free to wait patiently and pick up the console later; just know that if you do, you'll be missing out on a lot of great games and other features in the meantime.</p>

<p>This missing feature is the #1 annoyance of my list for XB1. One of the reasons I bought the OX was the ability to rip my own music to it, although not many games used it. However, that feature became GREAT on the 360 with the ability to play it over every
 game.</p>
<p>If this feature comes back, along with the ability to have all my controls default at inverted, I will finally say the XB1 has everything I want from previous systems.</p>

<p>The Xbox 360 is my number one all time favorite console ever because of its ability to play your own music anytime you want to. &nbsp;I hope that this feature returns to the Xbox One soon &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>What people have to realise that originally the Xbox One was supposed to online 24/7 and we didn't need discs etc (that was at last year's E3) but Microsoft were forced to remove those features.</p>
<p>Now I've done a little bit of coding, and I know that you make a liitle change in a few lines of code, it can (and usually does) effect hundreds of other lines.</p>
<p>More than likely all the features were getting now we're going to be in the console at launch, but because of the DRM changes they were put on the back burner.</p>

<h2>            Titanfall No servers found</h2>
                    
<p>I have been playing titanfall since its release and I started to get kicked from games this last weekend.&nbsp; Today, when I try to play the game (during the connection screen) It will search for servers and then come up with no servers found.&nbsp; I therefore cannot
 play this game at all.&nbsp; Anyone have&nbsp; a solution for this? I am connected to the internet and other games are working fine.</p>

            <p>There's a service alert up that says certain online capabilities are being affected, in particular Titanfall.</p>
<p>You can track progress here:</p>
<p><a href="http://xbox.com/status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.com/status</a></p>
<p>However, I can say that I personally have been able to get online in the past couple hours. It requires some luck to get onto the server, but after that it seems to work flawlessly to pull all your friends in after you and getting games going is not too difficult (although it is apparent there are fewer players online than normal). If you leave, though, you're back to square one with trying to get in again.</p>
<p>That said, when the issue is fixed properly, the above-linked page will be updated to reflect that and normal service will resume.</p>

            <p>Splat, you may want to try out a power cycle and then try again :)</p>
<p>Just to let everything reset and hopefully you'll be able to get on straight after that.</p>
<p>If that still is not working, press X at the title screen to choose another server. For whatever reason, the one you normally use may still be having issues.</p>

 system restore to get back to windows prior to the updating.&nbsp; Please advise.&nbsp; (I am using my husbands computer to do this. His didn't get messed up because there was a message on his desktop the the attempt to update had failed.)&nbsp; But my update seems to have
 crashed.&nbsp; Please advise.<br />

            Hi Ariel.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Your Info and click the link to Sign in with a Local Account instead.  This will convert your account to an Admin Local Account:  <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-switch-back-to-a-local-account-from-a-microsoft-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-swi...</a>
<br />
<br />Restart PC then go back to the same place to choose Sign in with a Microsoft Account and affiliate your actual Micrsoft Account:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5375-switch-microsoft-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5375-switch...</a>
<br />
<br />If the link is missing then create a new Microsoft Admin account as desired in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users for yourself.  After you move files over to it and test everything is working fine, delete the other account when ready in the same place.

            Sorry, Ariel.  It seems there is some level of corruption at the Account level.  We do hear of this regularly so it seems it's not that uncommon.  
<br />
<br />What that means is that you'll need to go the long way around by creating a new Admin Microsoft Account for yourself using your existing one if desired, sign into it to move your files over, test that programs all work from it and then when sure you're ready (no rush) delete the old account in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.

            The issue might be that you are using a Gmail account.
<br />
<br />Can you try creating an entirely new user account then sign in to it?

            Hi, no there is not a native way of doing it. But with some third party software and using a pc from which the chat would have to come from you should be able to achieve this. Alternatively if you stream your gameplay with Mixer and include all party chat.
 You can save your streams which will include the audio too. I hope that helps

Sadly not, if you use a capture card you can.

<p>You'd need a capture card and some PC software. Alternatively you can broadcast with Mixer or Twitch and have everyone include party audio (Twitch is included by default I think). Get the audio you need, go on Mixer and save the broadcast to your PC, then
 just rip the audio files from it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way its a lot of work.&nbsp;</p>
