<h2>            ois rattle sound</h2>
                    Hello I have the new Nokia Lumia icon and it is making a really loud rattle from the image stabilization camera. I noticed that when I opened my camera app the noise stops completely. So I'm wondering if there is a way to make the camera always prevent
 itself from rattling? Thank u so much for replys

            Its definitely hardware. Unfortunately resets don't fix it cause all Lumia icons seem to do this rattle with the camera.

                    <p>I've been using an Outlook IMAP with Google mail for years. Suddenly today I can't access my Outlook mail. It keeps asking me to enter my password and when I do this comes up:

<p>After you've changed your password, you'll need to generate a new App Password as well as this will automatically expire any previous ones. Note that the App Password displayed doesn't actually hold any spaces; These are added for readability of the complex
 password.</p>

It's really bad advice to tell people to allow less secure apps and it is also not needed when they have 2-Step Verification enabled for their Gmail account. Allowing it is only needed when you don't have 2-Step Verification enabled.</p>

<p>So, I followed your instructions and here's what happened:</p>
<ol>
<li>I uninstalled all my 2013 office applications (office pro, visio and project all together) with the suggested fix.</li><li>My windows partition went from 28% used space to 16% used space after uninstalling it.</li><li>I installed it again, (all my settings were there) installed all updates required from Microsoft update (~1600 MB) and now the windows partition on my hard drive is about 23% used space.</li></ol>
<p>It was 11% space out of my windows partition just for the office aps.</p>
<p>Any idea what happened? Will this keep on happening?</p>

<p>A lot of Office Pro Plus 2013/Visio 2013/Project 2013 updates are installed.</p>
<p>How can I provide you that information?</p>

<h2>            Problem with Lumia 520</h2>
                    Hello ! I have a problem with my Lumia 520. I can't get notifications from any of my apps (e-mail, games etc.) and I can't send or receive messages anymore. First I thought the messages problem is from my phone provider but I verified with them and the
 problem is from my phone. If I put de SIM into another phone it works properly. I need help please.

<h2>            office 2016 is gone</h2>
                    This first started when I opened powerpoint 2016 and the commands are all gone. It is all blank except for design menu and transition menu. I thought that I must've clicked or change a setting of it. I tried to change the ribbon and its not working. I
 tried to update and restart too but its not working. So I tried to repair it using quick repair and it's still the same. Then I tried to repair with online repair and then it happened. It says error I think, and a moment later it started to uninstalling. I
 checked it in programs and its gone. But I found out that the One Note program is still installed. What should I do now? I need to reinstall it for my work but I can't buy it again.

    <title>Store issue returns - Some apps never seem to get registered as - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Store issue returns - Some apps never seem to get registered as updated</h2>
                    <p>Had it before 17093. Went away for a while with 17093. But it's baaaaaack. When running App update within Store, six apps seem to never get registered as being updated. If I "Get Updates" the same 6 (was 7 the first time this happened) go through a download
 and apparent quick install. Repeat the "Get Updates" immediately, the same download/install occurs. etc. etc. The interesting part is that even if I de-install those apps, the store app re-installs them 'as if they was an update'. Don't think is in an issue
 with the Store App (but who knows), more likely the app registry on the machine is not synced with what is registered back in the Microsoft farm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried reboots, a WSReset.exe, a Store Reset through troubleshooter, ran the Windows Update Troubleshooter, and DISM and SFC........no change/no errors found, no fixes made....Hate to do an OS reset as problem is not 'terrible' just annoying. Anyone
 else have this issue?</p>

<p>Hi Lloyd,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Corrupted system files or compatibility issue may be one of the possible causes why you're experiencing issues with Store. To assist you better, we'd like to know what are the names of the application you're referring to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we suggest that you download and run Windows apps troubleshooter by clicking on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. This will automatically diagnose Windows apps/Store concern and will provide you a remedy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
        </p>

<p>The troubleshooter indicated there may be corruption, and when complete says it was fixed. But when returning to Store, the same repeat update happens.&nbsp;<span>Did this several times.&nbsp;
</span>The apps affected are Web Media Extensions, Print 3d, MSN Weather, App Installer, Xbox and Microsoft phone. Will play a bit more with additional reboots and SFC/DISM etc. An issue is that even if uninstalling helped (which it does not) some of the apps
 can't be un-installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let me know if you have more insight. </span></p>

            Store eventually became totally corrupted. The app would not even run. Decided to do a clean install of Windows 10 production and then do an immediate update to 17093. Aside from some serious disk space saving, the full and accurate functionality of Store
 was returned. This also indicates that the Store "reset" as well as App Troubleshooter was incapable of fixing the corruption that existed. If Store could be "re-installable" then a correction MAY have been possible. Or it is possible that "other factors"
 repeatedly "re-corrupted" the Store. Please pass these comments off to the Store App development crew. Thanks.

<h2>            Outlook Desktop app&#58; calendar invites not received as emails</h2>
                    Recently, I have stopped receiving calendar invites as emails in the Outlook Desktop app. Instead, it places them directly on&nbsp; my calendar and I don't know that they're there. If I login to my web Outlook, the I receive calendar invites as emails but I
 do not usually login to the web client. I have checked all logical settings (even though I hadn't changed any prior to having this issue) and cannot determine the cause. Please help as I have missed some important appointment/meeting invites.

<p><span>Hi Sjlwsu,</span></p>

<p>Hi Betty,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I search by keywords, the invites appear in my mailbox. A colleague sent my an invite as a test and it only appears when I searched her name. It did not appear at the top of my inbox as a new email. Why would it do this? Most of the time, I wouldn't know
 who/what to search for to locate an invite that I'm not likely expecting. Invites are also being placed directly on my calendar.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've toggled the Work Off/Online button and it hasn't repaired the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For your other suggestion, <strong>Office Programs</strong> isn't an option in the
<strong>Apps &amp; Features</strong> menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
        </p>

<p><span>Hi Sjlwsu,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks for your feedback, based on your scenario, I recommend you check the location of the invitation message via hovering the message like below:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b70a0a1-bc34-435d-8096-2e559750f923?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b70a0a1-bc34-435d-8096-2e559750f923?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p><span>In addition, since the invitation is accepted automatically, I recommend you go to
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">File &gt; Options &gt; Calendars &gt; Automatic accept or decline</span><span> to check whether you have set automatically accept or decline meeting requests.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Moreover, the potential cause of the invitation message issue is that you set up certain inbox rule in your mailbox, please try to disable your inbox rules and view
 whether the issue disappears.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Best Regards,</span></p>

<p>Hi Betty,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Hovering over the message does not provide location information as it does in your image. However, I believe it is in my inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Automatic accept/decline is disabled and has been since the start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I have not indicated any inbox rules. Unless one was established during an update, I've never touched them. What kind of rule could I look for?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Betty,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just noticed that these are grouped as "Message Class: Meeting Request" and there are many of them that I've never seen. Is this part of the issue? I've also discovered other message classes, such as cancellation and acceptance, that I have never
 seen in my inbox but are marked as unread. How do I make these appear as they hit my inbox instead of grouped together in this way?</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi Sjlwsu,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your feedback. To avoid there is any rule in your mailbox that interfers the incoming message, I recommend you try to clear rules via related command line.</p>
<p>1. Exit Outlook.</p>
<p>2. Right-click Start button to Run.</p>
<p>3. Type "Outlook /cleanrules" in Run box and press Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, the issue also can be caused by custom view in your Outlook client, please also run "Outlook /cleanviews" to clear the custom view setting in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still exists, please capture screenshots of App&amp;Features menu and the groups message for further analysis.&nbsp;</p>

            Hey Nokia N8 has no porblem of web browser.<br />
The issue that we all faced was connection , we page not found etc...WHEN we click on any link in social network and also in application like youtube.<br />
The solution is go to connectivety, destinations and there in delete all settings except your LAN ( do it once to check that I am right and your phone browser works perfect).. once done then browse links and application on net and there you go....<br />
Now the problem was b'cos of settings from your mobile operator so get that correct... and that will also work...<br />
<br />

<p>Hi updaterx,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm assuming you're talking about the YouTube "application" under Menu &gt; Applications &gt; YouTube, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the first things, at least in the Nokia unsubsidized N8 sold in the US, is that the default setting in the YouTube app doesn't behave like the N97, such as tapping the video while it's playing to make it full screen.&nbsp; The default view is what they
 call beta Flash video player.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look below the video, where it shows the length, user ratings, etc.&nbsp; There is a link in there called "Switch to standard video player".&nbsp; Click on that.&nbsp; That will get you out of the beta Flash video player.&nbsp; Then if you look below the video icon, there is
 a Video Quality.&nbsp; The default setting in the "standard video player" is Normal.&nbsp; Click on the HQ link to the left of "Normal".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See if that solves your problem.&nbsp; When I tried this with my N8 with several US videos on YouTube, the quality improved dramatically.&nbsp; Let me know if it works.&nbsp; =)</p>

            There is a slight lag when you open the image up to when it actually renders the image in full quality. I used to think of the same problem but it just clears up after a few seconds.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;i think i have created an account with outlook while i was installing windows10 in my laptop and i sign in with the same in skype.</p>
<p>and i have one more account with the same name, maybe it was conflicting again and again at that time it got blocked and since then i had not used this skype anymore. as of now i tried to sign in again it is showing the same. kindly remove my outlook account
 from this skype.</p>

<h2>            Cannot login to Outlook.com or any Live services&#58; &#34;There&#39;s a temporary problem with the service. Please try again. If you continue to get this message, try again later.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>As of this morning I am locked out of my main Outlook.com account. The problem has been going on for 7 hours. I can reset the password by going through the (mail/SMS text) authentication process but every time I try to log in I get: "There's a temporary
 problem with the service. Please try again. If you continue to get this message, try again later."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am desperate to access my emails but don't know how to get around this problem. http://Status.live.com reports that all is fine, which it isn't for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I wasn't even able to use Skype but I managed to figure out how to disassociate my Skype account from the Outlook.com account and at least I have my "phone" back. And I was able to post this message by using an older Live account...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Edit]</p>
<p>I am experiencing the same problem with IE11, Firefox&nbsp;34.0.5&nbsp;and Chrome <span>
Version 39.0.2171.99 m</span>. I am mentioning this since some 18 month old posts focus on clearing the cache, which I have done repeatedly. The problem prevents accessing the account from Outlook (the app), Windows Phone and iPhone. I am pretty sure this is
 a problem with my account on the central service.</p>

            <p>Hi Komal, thanks for responding!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are answers to your questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Did you recently try to switch primary alias? <br />
No</span></li><li><span>Did you recently connect their Outlook.com account to any devices?<br />
No</span></li><li><span>When did the issue start occurring? <br />
The problem started yesterday (January 20th, 2015) around 8am PT.</span></li><li><span>Were any changes done to account settings before issue started occurring?<br />
Well, possibly - some time earlier in the morning I went into the management section for the account. I saw the ability to verify connection attempts and discovered an IP address in Los Angeles which wasn't me (I haven't been there for several months) and I
 did click that it wasn't me. That could have set off an alarm, however I have since reset the password twice so you would think that should take care of it.</span><span>I also had an expiring OneDrive payment and had received messages that my credit card couldn't
 be charged (which my bank denies btw).</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Does that give any clue to what may be going on?</span></p>
<p><span>Even if an alarm was triggered, I reset the password first via text message and later via my alternative email but I still will not be let in.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And note that I am unable to access the account via Outlook (the app) as well as Windows Phone 8 and iPhone so it is not a cookie issue (though I have deleted cookies just to be sure).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, your comment "<span><em>Please sign in to </em><a href="http://account.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em>http://account.live.com/</em></a><em> and
</em><a href="http://profile.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em>http://profile.live.com/</em></a>
<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and fill up all information of your account. The error you are getting usually occurs when information in the account is not complete.</em></span>" is funny since I would love to be able to sign in... :-)</p>

            Microsoft support has fixed my problem. They did something in the backend to let me back into my account. While I am grateful I got my emails, calendar, OneDrive etc back, I was out of them for a week. After close to 20 years with Hotmail this was my first
 real incident. I guess I shouldn't complain over a free consumer service with such a track record. My biggest gripe is the uncertainty of not knowing what goes on, who to reach out to and spending time trying, trying and trying.

<h2>            Internet Explorer 11 slow loading pages it waits too long</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Ever since I instad windows 8.1 and installed the internet explorer 11, going to websites is very lame.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The its not that the pages are lowing slow. It has to do with connecting to the page, and getting a respond from the server or the page, and on the page tab it always says, "waiting of "web address" to connect", and the pages loads like 1 minute later.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>That's too long any thoughts, has this been happening to other people?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Help.</p>

            <p>I managed to get things working with IE by disabling Protected Mode. You can find the setting in IE under Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Security (Tab) -&gt; uncheck Enable Protected Mode. This fixed the slow page loading for me.</p>
<p>Strangely,&nbsp;this setting somehow affected&nbsp;Firefox also. I don't think there is a connection between them but Firefox displayed the web pages in a blink of an eye same as IE after unchecking that box.</p>
<p>Rechecking that&nbsp;option slowed IE down again. Firefox on the other hand, loads the pages quick.</p>
<p>I unfortunately can't find a fix for the other slowdowns. This kind of remembers me of Windows Vista....</p>

<h3> bobptz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook on 2 computers</h2>
                    <p>I have Office 2016 on my home desktop computer and just installed Office 2019 on my laptop computer. I am trying to get Outlook set up so that if I use my laptop to read email while I am away from home it will still be available to my desktop when I return.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried checking the leave mail on server box on all accounts on the laptop, but the mail was not there when I logged into the account on the desk top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried checking the leave mail on server box on all accounts on both computers, but the results are the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open an Outlook profile &amp; it loads the new emails received, it is no longer visible to the other computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to get the two computers to work together?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not use the cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have about 10 email accounts (Profiles) setup - some on gmail, some on Outlook.com and some that are on my own domains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contacted Microsoft support but they totally misunderstood my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance. Bob</p>

            Hi there,<br /><br />Seems like you need to setup these email accounts as an IMAP as it appears you have configured them for POP3 <br /><br />What domains do you use? For example if Gmail you can search for Gmail IMAP outlook and it can give you the settings for this<br /><br />Let me know what domains they are and I can get you the configuration needed

<br />I am trying to get Outlook set up so that if I use my laptop to read email while I am away from home it will still be available to my desktop when I return.
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Just to cover off the rest of your post, means that you have the email accounts configured as POP3 accounts where only the &lt;Inbox&gt; data gets downloaded in a one-way unidirectional mode. However, rather then delve into the rest of it, going to take a step back.
<br />
<br />Which of the following simplified scenarios best describes what you're trying to accomplish?
<br />
<br />Scenario #1
<br />
<br />- Primary computer is the desktop
<br />- only want to read new emails rec'd when travelling but no need to access previously rec'd email 
<br />- you have no requirement to retain copies of any &lt;Sent Mail&gt; while travelling
<br />- there's no requirement to ensure that contacts/calendar info is the same on both computers
<br />
<br />Scenario #2
<br />- same as #1 but you want access to all emails rec'd before leaving on any trip
<br />
<br />Scenario #3 
<br />- you want both computer to have complete access to current data including email / contacts / calendar data etc
<br />
<br />Other things to be aware of in case it applies
<br />
<br />#1 - Using POP3 allows you to use a single &lt;Inbox&gt; for all of your accounts whereas
<br />#2 - IMAP will result in a different folder set &lt;inbox&gt; for each IMAP email account
<br />#3 - Neither POP3/Imap provide for the sync'ing of contact/calendar info
<br />
<br />Rather then write an encyclopedia about all the various options available, will wait for your response for specific suggestions regarding the environment you want to achive

</p><p>I guess it is easy to switch the gmail addresses to imap, but the ones on my domains have been pop3 since they were created. They are hosted on go daddy and it looks like they want more money from me before I can make them imap.</p>

</p><p>I've been using Office 2010 on my old desktop/laptop setups and it worked fine if the laptop was checked to leave email on server, even though they are pop3 accounts. But I bought new computers and Office 2016 &amp; 2019 don't work the same.</p>

<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Re: #1 - Is there a reason you have 10 separate Outlook profiles only having one account each? Unless there is some kind of specific requirement for these multiple  profiles, that is one seriously overly complicated way to go about things.
<br />
<br />Aside from that, you would have to maintain contact folders in each profile unless you only used the accounts to reply to rec'd emails 
<br />
<br />Each POP account would have its own PST file which just complicates managing all of this unless, again, there is some serious requirement for this configuration
<br />
<br />Re: #2 - Since you have one Outlook.com account, the simplest solution to manage your contacts would be to maintain your contacts in the Outlook.com account and configure it on each machine. End result - maintain things from anywhere accessible by any device.
<br />
<br />Re: #3 &amp; 4 - Have never heard of a provider charging for an IMAP account especially not GoDaddy. In fact, going through the steps on the GoDaddy site, the default configuration for Outlook '2016 is to configure the accounts as IMAP if it follows the default. Whenever, you enter just the email address/password, Outlook will use &lt;auto-discover&gt; to configure the email account and under most circumstances this will default to IMAP. I don't have a GoDaddy account to check any of this so it is possible that the &lt;auto-discover&gt; will configure the account using POP3 but given that they provide the IMAP settings on their site - not likely.

<br />
<br />Which brings us back to your question/requirement for which there is no straight-forward answer especially with that many separately POP3 accounts making this a little short of a "nightmare" to manage if your objective is to have both computers access the same data when remembering the following
<br />
<br />a) A POP account only downloads data from the &lt;Inbox&gt;. Assumption is that you eventually move your read emails to other folders after dealing with them if you don't delete the message.  
<br />
<br />b) going to assume that you use our desktop more then your laptop. That could easily be an incorrect assumption if you travel a lot and simply use your desktop as a central repository. Either way, not just a question a downloading messages from the &lt;Inbox&gt; but can't be sure of that without having a better idea on how you actually work 
<br />
<br />c) At a very minimum, any sent messages on each machine would be in their own &lt;Sent Items&gt; folder which wouldn't be sync'd with anything in the event you want to have a history of &lt;Sent&gt; messages
<br />
<br />d) Remember that if you have "Leave Messages on server" set on each machine, you will eventually have to manually delete any messages from the server unless you have set one of the machines to add a "## of days" after which messages will be automatically deleted from the server. 
<br />
<br />Just going on the info that's currently available, my first suggestion would be to simplify your current desktop environment to use one Outlook profile and one PST file for all your POP3 accounts. You can easily configure your &lt;Inbox&gt; in Outlook to group rec'd emails by &lt;email account&gt; making it very easy to distinguish what something is from. Then, store your contacts in the Outlook.com account and configure it in the same profile.
<br />
<br />If you went the above route, you would need to deal with all the email data in the separate PST files you currently have - a topic to be addresses separately if it's something of interest
<br />
<br />Once the above is set - might be worth your while to review the Sync2 program from the 4Team folks to sync PST data between 2 computers. Providing this info purely as a FYI - have no vested interest in the product or vendor but do know it works since I own it

<p>Karl - thanks for all the helpful information. Some of the email accounts go back to the Outlook 97 days. Each profile is for a different thing - Vietnam War Squadron I was in, Personal, years in the Air Force Reserves in Oklahoma, etc. so each profile has
 different contacts. Back then there was no Imap, no Microsoft Exchange Server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of what I have now is carried over from then. It was simple in Office 2010 days and earlier. Now things are more complex. I just have to adjust.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will try the Imap thing. And/or the Sync2 thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gotta be a way to make it work, I just have to retrain myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks. Bob</p>

<br />#1 - Each profile is for a different thing................. so each profile has 
<br />different contacts. 
<br />
<br />#2 - Will try the Imap thing. 
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Just for the record, the only thing different between '2010 and '365 is the manner in which you initiate the "manual" email account configuration process.
<br />
<br />Some additional comments
<br />
<br />Re #1 - Should you ever consolidate your contacts into one folder, one way to deal with the different "contact lists" would be to assign a category to each contact to reflect where those contacts apply. Then within Outlook you would be able to change the view for the Contact folder to "group" contacts by category so you can easily see everything in one place without mixing everything up
<br />
<br />Re: #2 - Imap. Be forewarned that if you created a single profile for all the accounts using IMAP, you are going to have a different &lt;Inbox&gt; (folder list) for each account but given how you're working now - should'n't be a big deal.

<p>Hi Ronit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your posting in our forum. Based on my tests and research on your problem, I found that the events of the previous week and the last two weeks will be displayed on the team calendar. And the events shown in the Teams calendar are also the events
 shown in your Outlook calendar of your account. They are synced between each other. According to your description, do you mean that the daily events in your Outlook main calendar of your account are not shown in your Teams calendar? It is infeasible to connect
 the events of the calendar under Other calendar in Outlook to Teams. Only your own calendar events can be displayed in Teams.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, there is no month view for calendar in Teams. We can only view the meeting events in Day view. While I totally understand your concern to have this feature included. I suggest you vote for the feedback via the link below:</p>
<p><a href="https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/33586480-the-ability-to-change-the-meeting-calendar-view-to" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/33586480-the-ability-to-change-the-meeting-calendar-view-to</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Many features of current programs have been designed and upgraded based on customers’ feedback.</p>

            For a short time, you can still download and use Skype classic, but we are discouraging users from using it, since it will be permanently shutdown September 1st:
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week. 
<br />
<br />From Skype
<br />We are encouraging everyone to upgrade now to avoid any inconvenience as only Skype version 8.0 will work after September 1, 2018. As we roll out improvements, there comes a time when we must shut down older services and application versions.

    <title>Increased SPAM hitting Focused Inbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christopher bruscato  say:</h3>
<h2>            Increased SPAM hitting Focused Inbox</h2>
                    <p>I can see from the posts on this forum that the new Outlook.com upgrade has not gone well in regards to SPAM. It is abundantly clear that there are widespread problems with the new SPAM filter. I have been a Hotmail/MSN.com/Live.com/Outlook.com customer
 for life, and this is the first time in over 15 years I am overflowing with SPAM. I receive now on average 50+ Messages a day in my SPAM folder, and roughly 15 per day will hit my Focused Inbox, they never get sorted to Other. This is immensely aggravating
 because hitting my Focused Inbox means it is sending a Push Notification to my phone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have aggressively been marking messages as Junk and adding senders to my Blocked Senders List. This is unacceptable, because there is not some secret sauce spammers are using to attack Outlook.com, the platform is simply performing worse than every competitor
 in the market. This has been going on every since the upgrade in November (when my wave was activated). It seems as though this is an issue the Product Group is aware of, if that is the case - please mark the service as limited in Service Status and link the
 escalation ticket where engineers are addressing the issue. We need more transparency over what exactly is being done to repair this system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft does not either take action, or at least tell us what actions they are trying to take, people are just going to leave en masse to GMail, which currently has none of these issues, as I maintain an account there as well. Please just simply inform
 the community on what's up with this update and the issues we are facing. It is completely unacceptable to tell customers they need to enable safe-senders and maintain a whitelist to block SPAM. That isn't so much a cop out, as just failing to do your job,
 that we are paying for with Ads or Cash.</p>

            <p>Your response seems disingenuous, since I am posting to the Outlook.com forum, and am having issues with SPAM not with connecting my client since the upgrade. However, yes, I have reconnected my Outlook 2016 client after the upgrade, using the preferred
 method of recreating the profile. Keep in mind, though, it isn't like I have any one client. I use Outlook 2016, Outlook 2013, and Outlook for iOS. Regardless of what client I connect with, or just browsing Outlook.com through a web browser, obviously the
 SPAM is hitting my Inbox across every client; because they connect to the same mailbox.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Have you increased the level protection in the <strong>Junk Email Filter</strong> by clicking
<strong>Home</strong> &gt; <strong>Junk</strong> &gt; <strong>Junk E-mail Options</strong>? Then choose from the following level of protection you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>No Automatic Filtering</li><li>Low</li><li>High</li><li>Safe List Only</li></ul>
<p>Additionally, you can also tell Outlook to delete all suspected junk messages instead of moving them to the Junk E-mail folder:</p>

<li>In <strong>Mail</strong>, click the <strong>Home</strong> &gt; <strong>Junk</strong> &gt;

<p>Hi Marcus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The number junk mails being received can be lowered if the Junk Email setting are configured correctly. This means that the emails considered by Outlook.com as junk will be moved automatically to the Junk Mail folder which you can empty anytime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may click this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Filter-junk-email-and-spam-in-Outlook-com-afba1c94-77bb-4f50-8b85-057cf52f4d5e?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to follow the instructions on how to set it up in Outlook.com.</p>

<p>I get about 100 junk emails per day on my hotmail.com account. &nbsp;I have set up the junk folder with no good results. &nbsp;Also, when I try to clear my junk folder and click the "All" button at the top of the page, only about 5 emails get deleted. &nbsp;I then have
 to select about 15 each time to delete them. &nbsp;I am agressive about marking and blocking these emails but obviously the filter does not do a good job of keeping the junk out. &nbsp;I have been getting emails with the same subject and from indicators but the address
 is changed each time so I guess you are unable to catch these types of junk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything that I can do to relieve this stress?</p>

            Having same issue. Worst decison ever to switch to focused last week. I am spending at least 10 minutes a day with junk mail. The worst is getting the junk mail on my phone. Really upset!!! I’ve turned off focused and turn junk mail setting up to high.
 Plus blocking senders. &nbsp;However i am stilll getting tons of junk. If this does not get fixed shortly i am going to switch my whole companies email to something else. Not a huge account but still 15 users. Let me know if there is any solutions. &nbsp;

<p>I have an Apple computer and every single day I receive over 50 spam emails, mostly with "bitcoin" as the Header, although many others ... in the Junk mail box of my Microsoft Hotmail email address.&nbsp; Why are they even arriving that far?&nbsp; Also mail that usually
 goes straight to my IN BOX are also going to my Junk Mail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to click and Block each one separately, but nothing improved so I clicked on the tick on the left side of message (I NEVER open them) and now click on Phising Spam ... as there are no alternatives.&nbsp; No matter what I do, more come the next day!!!&nbsp;
 I'm fed up with having to deal with them every single day.&nbsp; This is a recent problem in the last couple of months.&nbsp; No major issues before.&nbsp; What's going on?&nbsp; Why is the computer security "Malware" not blocking them?&nbsp; How can this very irritating issue be
 fixed permanently.&nbsp; I'm not the only one experiencing this, obviously!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            &#34;This workbook contains content that isn&#39;t supported in this version of Excel.&#34;</h2>
                    Hello Everyone, 
When I open some workbooks my company uses for our finances I get the following error message since upgrading to the latest version of Office. &nbsp;


This workbook contains content that isn't supported in this version of Excel.

To view the unsupported content in the file, you can open the workbook as read-only.&nbsp;
However, if you change and then save the workbook, unsupported content will not be saved.


Then it offers for me to open as "Read-Only" I'm running Microsoft Excel for Mac version 15.12.3 (150724)


Obviously this could be a big issue for me. &nbsp;Anyone else had this happen and know of a fix? &nbsp;


Thanks! 
Jim

            Actve-X IS banned on the Mac, for all time. It never has, and never will work on the Mac. Also, Having Active-X controls in your workbook does not generate that error reliably. The active-x controls just show in outline and do not work.

<p>When I am in the People section of Oulook.com and I try to add</p>
<p>a user (who has more than one e-mail address (like a work and a personal e-mail</p>

<p>to use.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I pick which account to add to a group?&nbsp; How can I add both accounts to a group</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
<p>In Hotmail (and it appears to still be true in outlook.com) there was a hierarchy to email addresses: Personal, then Work, then Other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you send an email to a contact that has multiple email addresses without specifying which email address to use, then outlook.com will use the Personal email addresses first. If there are no Personal email addresses then Work email addresses will be used.
 And lastly Other email addresses will be used if no Personal or Work email addresses exist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you send email to a group of contacts, then the hierarchy discussed above will be applied to each contact in the group to determine the address to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to override this hierarchy, then you could create multiple contact entries for those contacts you want to be able to send to a specific address and include in the group the appropriate contact entry.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There may be other solutions, but that is what I have done in the past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps or answers your question.</p>

This seems like a bug, or something that should be added to outlook.com.

<h2>            Workflow works in test but not in normal flow</h2>
                    I have created a very basic work flow to send me an email when someone fills out a form on Sharepoint. I have used the Forms app and created a flow that worked perfectly in test. However when I saved and completed the flow I did another test and it is
 not working. The form gets filled out ok but I do not get an email notification.

<h2>            My inbox has been cleared by Outlook&#59; Trying to recover email. I was not alerted this would happen.</h2>
                    <p>I use a tab in my bookmarks bar to connect to my Outlook / Hotmail account. I believe I did sign in within the last year, which by Outlook's rule would prevent my emails from being cleared:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
To keep your Outlook.com account active, you must sign in to the account at least once every 365 days. After 365 days of inactivity, your email will be deleted and cannot be recovered.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Steps I've taken are below. Please share anything that will help me get my saved emails back, dating to the late 90s!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Login to Hotmail and go to your Hotmail Inbox.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click the<span>&nbsp;Deleted folder</span>&nbsp;in the left pane of your Hotmail window.</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp; Scroll to the bottom of the window, and then click&nbsp;<span>recover deleted messages</span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I also tried following the steps under this heading:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Recover email that’s been removed from your Deleted Items folder</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>When I clicked "Recover" there were no messages, except from Microsoft Outlook Calendar.</span></p>

<h3> mike 1430  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2016 View Print rePagination unnecessarily slow</h2>
                    <p>I work mainly in draft (normal) View in my 700+ page document. Deep into this long document, if I need to View Print, I have to wait a minute or so for re-pagination. However, since in my document:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each chapter starts with an Odd page section break (Even would be just as good)</li><li>The page numbers&nbsp;start over at 1 for each chapter.<br />
</li></ul>
<p>I can see no reason that Word 2016 can't just re-paginate THAT chapter, instead of the entire document up to there.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to know if it was working previously.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us try to install the Office updates and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also <span>&nbsp;</span>open Word in safe mode and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>To do that, close Word. Let us type in ‘Run’ in the search bar next to start button, click on the 'run' icon that appears – in the 'Run window' type in WinWord /safe and hit ok. (Note:
 There is a space between WinWord and /).<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>
<p><span>If the application works fine safe mode, try disabling the add ins for the application and check the result,</span></p>
<p><span>Click the File tab. </span>
</p>
<p><span>Go to Options.</span></p>
<p><span>Click Add-ins.</span></p>
<p><span>In the Manage section, select COM Add-ins and click on Go.</span></p>
<p><span>Now uncheck the Add-ins and click on OK.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
