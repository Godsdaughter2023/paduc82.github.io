<h2>            Newest on Top not using correct date time</h2>
                    <p>I received an email from a device whose date time was out of sync given the recent daylight savings change. &nbsp;What was strange was that Outlook for Mac's Newest on Top sorting lists the email by the sender's date time and not the actual receiver's date time.
 &nbsp;I checked with a colleague who uses Outlook for Windows and it correctly lists the same email by receiver's date time. &nbsp;Is this a bug or is there a setting I need to change on Outlook for Mac?</p>
<p>

            I guess this is due to settings issue.<br />
change the view settings in Outlook that should resolve it.

    <title>Proposed Treatment of Live Tiles in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> antonio java  say:</h3>
<h2>            Proposed Treatment of Live Tiles in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p><strong>TL;DR Version:</strong></p>
<p>Allow Live Tiles to be placed on desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Long Version/Rationale:</strong></p>
<p>Windows 8 adapted the “Metro” design language from Windows Phone in an attempt by Microsoft to unify the look and user experience of all Windows products. In doing so, however, the Windows 8 experience became a little convoluted. I'm not even going to touch
 on the “full-screen app” and “desktop app” issues (since this has thankfully been addressed in the Windows 10 preview anyway). This post will concentrate entirely on the Metro design's “Live Tiles” aspect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When they were first introduced in Windows Phone 7, Live Tiles presented a new way for applications to interact with the user by combining what is essentially a program icon or shortcut with the functionality of a widget. With Live Tiles, an otherwise static
 icon/shortcut becomes a useful source of at-a-glance information related to the application, and the same system was carried into Windows Phone 8/8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Live Tiles to work on Windows Phone, a user had to select the appropriate program from the main application list and pin it to the Start Screen, where all the Live Tiles can be rearranged and resized. Because the Start Screen on the Windows Phone OS
 was the “default screen” – meaning it's what's displayed when programs aren't running – the functionality of Live Live Tiles is maximized by allowing the user to see tile information immediately and constantly when no other programs were open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Microsoft adapted Live Tiles on its PC OS in the form of Windows 8, it used the same principle as in Windows Phone – take an app from the main app list, then pin it to the Start Screen where the tile can constantly show its at-a-glance information.
 To maximize Live Tiles, Microsoft then made the Windows 8 Start Screen the “default screen” of that OS, much like it is in Windows Phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That, however, did not sit well with most Windows PC OS users, who, in previous iterations of the OS, have always considered their desktop screens as their default screen. Improvements introduced in Windows 8.1 allowed users to regain the feel that the desktop
 was the default environment, but the use of Live Tiles was still limited to the full-window “Start Screen”, which most users did not really care for, effectively decreasing the usability of Live Tiles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I believe Microsoft was too fixated on terms and technicalities rather than functionality when it tried to incorporate Live Tiles into Windows 8. Because Live Tiles were on the “Start Screen” of Windows Phone, they thought it was only appropriate
 to also put Live Tiles on what was also called the “Start Screen” of Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now, the same is happening in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 preview has introduced many improvements that make it superior to all previous iterations of the OS, but I feel that Microsoft still missed the mark when it comes to how to implement Live Tiles. In the Windows 10 preview, by default, Start
 is no longer a screen like it was in Windows 8, but a menu much like how it was in Windows 7 (with a full-window “Start Screen” option should one go into tablet/touch mode). However, still of the mindset that Live Live Tiles should be plastered onto whatever
 was called “Start” on any given OS, Microsoft has made the Windows 10 Start Menu a hybrid of the folders/icons system found in Windows 7/Vista/XP and the Live Tiles-laden Start Screen of Windows 8/Windows Phone. This not only makes the Live Tiles redundant
 in the Start Menu, but also unoptimized, as the live information that makes a Live Tile awesome otherwise gets hidden when the Start Menu isn't in use, which is pretty much 99.9% of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe what Microsoft needs to do to maximize the use of Live Tiles on PC is not to force it into whatever it calls “Start” in the different versions of Windows 10, but to allow it to be used in whatever “default screen” the OS uses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For mobile and tablet users (including the PC version's “tablet mode”), that default screen is the Start Screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For PC users, that default screen is the DESKTOP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Windows 10 PC version, this proposed setup essentially makes the desktop into THE Start Screen, but onto which windowed programs can be overlaid, while keeping the Start Menu purely an applications list (similar to how, in Windows Phone, a side swipe
 summons an applications list). For PCs with a “tablet mode”, the Live Tiles on the desktop then becomes the Start Screen of that mode. This better emulates the Windows Phone experience, but still completely respecting the Windows 7/Vista/XP experience as well.
 The bonus for PC users would be that they can open their windowed programs like they always do, then slightly resize them so that the user can see certain tiles on the desktop, allowing them to work while keeping an eye on the “live” information on the tiles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Naturally, this setup replaces the Windows 7-style desktop shortcuts with the Live Tiles, since Live Tiles serve as shortcuts/icons anyway. For those who aren't big fans of Live Tiles, they can simply stick to the "Small", un-interactive tile sizes, creating
 an environment identical to Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This system not only serves to further unify Windows 10 on all platforms, but also maximizes the use of Live Tiles on the PC version by always having them visible and showing their respective at-a-glance information when no applications are open or when
 the applications are windowed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a technical name is necessary for this kind of setup, let's tentatively call it the “Start Environment”. But the point is, this Start Environment should be whatever default screen the user prefers (or is limited to) – The Start Screen of mobile/touch
 devices, or the desktop of a PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In essence, instead of the mindset that the Start Screen and desktop are two different things, their functionalities should instead be merged, with the only difference being that mobile/touch devices have their applications open full-screen over the Start
 Environment, while PCs can open those same applications in resizeable windows over the Start Environment (desktop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, the full list of applications can be accessed the same way: on mobile and tablets, a swipe from the side/bottom brings up the applications list in full screen, while on PC, a click on the Start Button brings up the same applications list in a
 Windows 7-style pop-up menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this idea gets the attention of Microsoft as well as the developer community for consideration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try to incorporate all these ideas into a mock “screenshot” in a future edit to this post. But as I am not particularly good with graphics editing, that might take a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Constructive criticisms welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p>

            <p>Totally agree. For me as an average PC user, the only useful thing Metro brought was the Live Tiles, but as long as they cannot be transferred to the desktop, make them almost totally redundant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, thank you very much for not abandoning&nbsp;the Start menu and the desktop environment as we know it from Windows 95, but let's make it really functional now by incorporating the Start Screen in the desktop (not replace it), as Antonio said, and you'll
 see most of Windows 8 criticism just disappearing.</p>

            I agree. I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but <strong>you can pin apps to the desktop.</strong> Just drag them from the Start Menu to the desktop. However,
<strong>they're not Live Tiles</strong>... as far as I can tell

            My live tiles never showed me anything, they were just solid color squares that had a name on them. They were huge with very little information.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you launched them they took up the whole screen and told you the time, or the temp but not both as that
 would overload a&nbsp;phone's display but looked like something from fisher price or the tv set of Barney on a 32 inch monitor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want information density not a full screen with 4 digits telling me the time when the clock on the desktop doesn't have to be launched.

            <p>I totally agree.&nbsp; Instead of being delighted when I try a new metro app, I'm more often than not, feeling punished for having attempted to use metro.&nbsp; A full screen with almost no information on it is not a rewarding desktop experience.&nbsp; The calculator app,
 for instance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is still very early with this preview, and I'm sure that as they are trying to make a tailored experience for every device, they will somehow make apps aware of the type of device they are on, and how they are configured (keyboard/no keyboard,
 display size).&nbsp; Just hope that they use this tailored experience to provide appropriate information density or sizing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a metro app is full screen with little information, then when using a large display device it should display information that would be on later pages of the app all on the main screen if in full screen mode, and if there is no additional useful information
 it should be sized appropriately.&nbsp; A cell-phone sized calculator should not be sized full screen on a desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Microsoft seeks to tailor the experience, and have a consistent look and feel, it should be red flagging any situation where the app is almost always resized by the end user before being used.</p>

            <p>I jumped into Windows 8 with a tablet, so the Start Screen has never been an issue because it is a natural set-up for a touch only interface.&nbsp; Of course I do go keyboard with the tablet too because that is the beauty of a Windows tablet.&nbsp;&nbsp;And when I am in
 keyboard mode, I am using the desktop 90% of the time while&nbsp;the two are attached. &nbsp;So I hope the desktop users don't evolve Microsoft away from the Start Screen option on tablets.&nbsp; Currently 10 forces you to choose, Start Screen or Start Menu and it would
 be great if future versions can be configured to bounce between the two easily.&nbsp; The Start Screen on my tablet was so good there, it convinced me to get a Windows Phone and the two are very complimentary.&nbsp; The Start Screen has its place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The current configuration for 10 is much better for a traditional PC though and I think it is important for W10 to keep the leaps forward/backward that allows the desktop to function on large screens with traditional computer inputs.&nbsp; Live tiles on the desktop
 would be even better.&nbsp; Windows 7 had the widgets that they no longer support, but I still use such as the clock, calendar and weather, but making live tiles for the apps come alive on the desktop the way the widgets started out to function as,&nbsp;is as natural
 an evolution for the next Windows platform as the Start Screen is a natural evolution for PC use of a tablet.&nbsp; I'm thinking the developers are going to realize this if they haven't already.&nbsp; Drag and dropping live tiles to the desktop is going to happen.&nbsp;
 If Microsoft doesn't get it by the time they roll out Windows 10, they'll be foreced to do it by W10.1 because the general users are going to be insisting on the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not a fan forcing the PC live tiles on the Start Menu as it is currently configured for 10, that takes the best of both worlds and ruins them equally.&nbsp; Both the Start Screen and the Start Menu should exist together.&nbsp; It should be a simple check-box
 option in the setting if you ant the Windows button to operate the Start Menu or the Start Screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Better yet, as has been mentioned, when a keyboard is attached (wired or bluetooth) windows should ask "Switch to Start Menu?" with an option to check a box
 that says, "Do this every time I attach a keyboard". </p>

            By the way, has anyone used the Start Menu button with a touchscreen?&nbsp; In Windows 8, the on-screen keyboard does not pop up when I use a mouse to activate a text input box, but the keyboard pops up when I touch the same box with my finger.&nbsp; Word works
 the same way, acting normal while using a mouse and keyboard, and automatically popping up a keyboard when I use my finger to set the cursor (a great feature when I detach the keyboard but still want to do edits to my word document) It seems like it would
 be very easy then for Microsoft to program the Start Menu button to work like W7 when clicked on by a mouse&nbsp;or&nbsp;touched with an S-Pen;&nbsp;and jump to a Start Screen when touched by by a finger.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm only using the preview on a non-touch computer so I haven't
 been able to see if maybe they have already made this happen.

The Live Tiles on my Windows 8/8.1 were always active and flipping around, and definitely showed more than a few giant numbers when opened.</p>

<p>Considering that many of today's Windows Phone units support high-resolution screens (and those that don't aren't pushovers for pixel density either), it could even be justified that whatever an app shows on a Windows 10 PC should be almost identical to
 what it would show on a Windows 10 phone.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and frustration you have been through. I will be glad to assist you.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned that display stopped working when Windows started to install display drivers. I suggest you to roll back driver and check if issue persists.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:&nbsp; Roll Back to a Previous Driver</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Type Device Manager in the search box on taskbar, and press Enter.<br />
2.&nbsp;Find and double-click the category of device causing the issue.<br />
3.&nbsp;Double-click the problematic device to bring up the Properties window.<br />
4.&nbsp;Click the Driver tab.<br />
5.&nbsp;Click the Roll Back Driver button.<br />
6.&nbsp;A dialog box will ask you to confirm your decision to roll back to a previous driver.
<br />
7.&nbsp;Click on Yes to begin the roll-back process.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: &nbsp;Uninstall display drivers</strong> and install the latest drivers from manufacturer's website.
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Type Device Manager in the search box on taskbar, and press Enter.<br />
2.&nbsp;Find and double-click the category of device whose driver you wish to uninstall.<br />
3.&nbsp;Right-click the device, and click on Uninstall.<br />
4.&nbsp;Windows will prompt you to confirm the device’s removal. Click OK to remove the driver.<br />
5.&nbsp;After the uninstallation is complete, reboot your computer as soon as possible.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. Do let us know if your issue is resolved. For any further query, feel free to contact us.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. </p>

<br />
Probably because you now have a different printer.&nbsp; The way in which Word lays out a document depends upon the active printer.

<h2>            Office 365 with Word 2016 for me has convoluted, cumbersome, multi-step procedure for new document &#34;save as&#34; to particular folder</h2>
                    <p>With Word 2010 I'd work with a number of files from the same folder. When I created a new file and did "save as" and gave it a name it was saved to that folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now each time I create a new document and click save ask it wants me to choose between &nbsp;OneDrive, Browse and This PC. I select browse and have to go to may main directory, &nbsp;major folder with many subfolders, then to the particular subfolder and then click
 save. Each time. Even if I haven't opened any other folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I doing something wrong, or is this it. I feel like I've been moved back to a rotary dial telephone after many years of using touch-tone.</p>

<p>If that does not help, then as you have already tried to repair Office Home and Student 2013 and was unsuccessful. You may remove all traces of it present on the machine by running the fixit from the
 following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now login to <a href="http://www.office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font>www.office.com/myaccount</font></a> with the same Live ID which was used to register for Office Home and Student 2013 and then click
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps to launch the Office applications.</p>

    <title>Courier New size 7, Excel 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jon combe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Courier New size 7, Excel 2013</h2>
                    <p>If I copy in some data from an external system that I want to be in a proportional font to Excel I can paste it in and set the font to Courier New. However, if I reduce the font size in Excel to be less than 8, Excel changes from using Courier New to some
 other horrible font. This does not happen in Word, it is specific to Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I print it out, it does come out in Courier New, size 7. However in normal or Page Layout view mode, it is not showing what is actually output (I.E. it's not WYSWIG). Why is this? How can I fix it, so it shows the data in the font I select and not change
 it to some other one?</p>

            This is obviously a limitation of Excel. I can get it to display the font properly again by increasing zoom percentage, but it is not likely that that is what you need :-) I know no way around this I'm afraid.

            <p>Jan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No I set it to that size so I could fit all the data on the screen, whilst still being readable. Increasing the zoom therefore doesn't help because whilst it does change back to Courier in this case it is then too large to see all the data on my screen.
 If I use Courier New in Word it does display at size 7 so the issue seems specific to Excel. Clearly Excel is not really WYSIWYG.

<h2>            AutoUpdate Does Not Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>The AutoUpdate is not updating. There are pending updates for 15.23.0 (Outlook, Powerpoint &amp; OneNote) and 15.23.1 (Excel &amp; Word) and when I select Install the download dialogue box appears but there is no activity. It just sits there. My version of AutoUpdate
 is 3.5 (160506) and I'm running Mac OSX El Capitan V10.11.5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried downloading the .pkg versions from the link provided in the AutoUpdate dialogue box but when I try this the status of the download bar in the browser progresses then stops and then no further activity occurs. My version of Safari is 9.1.1
 (11601.6.17).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a problem with the Microsoft server?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Barry</p>
<p>
</p><p>ps I had to lie in order to post this as the System and device option did not include any OSX platforms only Windows (very frustrating and poor form). I chose the first option</p>

            <p>The Auto Updater might need Updating. In this case Google is your Friend &nbsp;In Google lookup type&nbsp;Microsoft Office Updater. &nbsp;Also you might have a bad&nbsp;Internet connection at the time you tried</p>
<p>
</p><p>Down load that updater and Update it first Then run auto Update.&nbsp;Open it and choose about&nbsp;Microsoft Auto Update.&nbsp;The version should show 3.6. If the auto Updater is so much as &nbsp;one version off it will not locate any updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft gets a wild hair about once every two or three months and updates the updater. Sometimes they forget to tell people and they don't &nbsp;write the code in to tell it to update itself.&nbsp;Without version version 3.6 anything pst 15.22.1 don't exist. I have
 gotten so as soon as I hear of a Update &nbsp;I look for update to the updater. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>I am having the same problem. Opening Word (version 15.23.2) going to Help&gt;Check for Updates launches Microsoft Updater 3.5. It shows updates pending e.g. Word 15.24. Clicking Install and the 15.24 versions start to download and seem to complete. But then
 after asking for my password to allow installation, the "Overall progress" progress bar is at 50% and doesn't move (stalls). I've left it open for upwards of two hours hoping it would install. It doesnt. In other words, AutoUpdate seems to identify and download
 relevant updating files, but then refuses to install them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took your suggestion to try Google Microsoft Office Updater to get a version 3.6. Couldn't find it anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other advice?</p>

<p>VBA doesn't allow this kind of thing.</p>
<p>About the best you could do is to use a variable to represent the Field Number<br />
you want.</p>
<p>dim myFieldNumber as long<br />
if me.optionbutton1.value = true then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; myfieldnumber = 1<br />
....</p>
<p>activesheet.range("A1").currentregion.autofilter field:=myFieldNumber</p>
<p>You could use the same technique for the criteria, too.</p>

<p>My phone recognizes my admin account as "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***," as it is supposed to. However, I cannot use this account with Outlook Calendar or Mail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My school account and Gmail account show up fine, but when I try to sign in to my primary account, it begins to load, the option to click "next" briefly pops up but goes away before I can click on it, and it then says I've successfully sign in. But then
 I got to see My Accounts listed in Outlook and it's not there. And I have tried multiple times.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Despite all this, the email shows up under Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Your Email and Accounts. -_-</p>

<h2>            Outlook app, People, has duplicate Contact names, some with old information</h2>
                    When I open the Outlook app on my iPhone or iPad and tap People, the list of Contacts includes duplicate names. When I look at the information under each, it is different and I recognize old information that is long gone from Outlook People (outlook.live.com)
 and from Outlook 2016. There is no option in the app to delete a contact. Why is the app importing old contact information and how can I get it to sync with Outlook People? Thanks in advance.

            <p>Thank you for that, Ced. I'm not sure what steps you took when you say, "then linked it to the already linked contact." Steps would be very helpful since all of this is so confusing. However, I prefer to use iPhone Contacts app and delete any duplicates
 there rather than messing around with more confusing linking and unlinking. I prefer to open
<strong>iPhone Contacts</strong>, select duplicate contact; click <strong>Edit</strong>, scroll to bottom, tap&nbsp;<strong>Delete Contact</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do see I still have one Contact with duplicates and I just noticed something--when I select that contact, I see
<strong>Links (3)</strong> on the menu with Outlook (Deleted Items), Outlook (Contacts), and Outlook (Contacts)--how confusing is that! I clicked the X by the Outlook (Deleted Items) entry and see a screen tip that says "Unlink." However, when I click the X,
 nothing happens. Again, utterly confusing. Here's a link to more information for the
<strong>Clean up Contacts </strong>feature and linked contacts:&nbsp;https://www.msoutlook.info/question/845. Here's another link for deleting duplicates via
<strong>Phone</strong> view in Outlook 2016: https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Delete-duplicate-contacts-41c97f0a-2055-4287-aa00-767844269eb8&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e6a881d-ebe9-4e9d-a808-5d3ce3c93830" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e6a881d-ebe9-4e9d-a808-5d3ce3c93830" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I did--it was scary but it worked. I deleted all contacts from Outlook 2016 and Outlook People; all contacts disappeared. I opened&nbsp;<strong>Outlook</strong>&nbsp;<strong>People&nbsp;</strong>(Outlook.live.com);
<strong>Manage</strong>, <strong>Restore deleted contacts</strong> and waited an hour or so. Contacts finally synced up . I then went to
<strong>iPhone,&nbsp;</strong><strong>Contacts</strong> app--if I had a duplicate there, I deleted it there. If anyone wants to try this, I would suggest deleting only one contact that has a duplicate, follow the steps above, wait a couple of hours, and see what
 happens. I also think Outlook, People, should have an option to restore deleted contacts individually, not all deleted contacts. I'm not sure exactly what happens and how far back Outlook, People, goes when you click
<strong>Restore deleted contacts</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft and Apple really need to work on this to make things more transparent, but I think issues arise due to the iPhone (their Contacts app and the Outlook, People, app) and Outlook People, and Outlook 2016 not working well together to sync contacts
 to avoid duplicates. I edit all my Outlook contacts' information (email, phone, notes, contact pictures, etc.) directly via Outlook 2016 or Outlook People (Outlook.live.com), not via iCloud or iPhone Contacts app. I never add any contacts via iCloud unless
 I want a picture for these contacts to show up on my iPhone. For those few contacts, I add only a name and a picture via iCloud or iPhone Contacts app--I absolutely don't add any other contact information or it becomes extremely confusing when looking at contacts
 on the iPhone via the Outlook app and the Contacts app to figure out where information has originated and where best to edit it. Any picture you add for a contact in iCloud Contacts shows up on iPhone Contact, (scroll down to
<strong>LINKED</strong> <strong>CONTACTS</strong>, <strong>iCloud</strong>). If you add a picture via
<strong>iPhone</strong> <strong>Contacts </strong>( select desired contact, scroll down to&nbsp;<strong>LINKED CONTACTS</strong>,
<strong>Outlook</strong>, <strong>Edit</strong>, tap <strong>edit</strong> under picture and
<strong>Choose</strong> <strong>photo</strong>, <strong>Done</strong>), the iPhone contact picture there's no consistent pattern as to which picture shows up under iPhone Contacts--the one added to Outlook or the one added to iCloud. Confusing, right!</p>

<h2>            IEFrame.dll web OCX emulating MSIE 7.0</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have taken over a legacy application written in C++/MFC. The application used an Internet Explorer OCX to host a web window inside a dialog box displaying Google Maps. (Bing maps didn't exist at that time.) The OCX was invoked with CLSID =&nbsp;{8856F961-340A-11D0-A96B-00C04FD705A2}
 which is mapped in the Registry to IEFrame.dll. The navigator.userAgent for the OCX returns MSIE 7.0 and Google recently stopped support for MSIE 7.0 JavaScript causing the map window to fail with a scripting error. According to Google, the OCX in IEFrame.dll
 emulates MSIE 7.0 regardless of which version of IEFrame.dll is installed on the system. In my case the IEFrame.dll version is 11.0.9600.18231.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way, perhaps using a different CLSID, to use the OCX with a more recent version JavaScript and that identifies itself as a more recent version of IE?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you suggest any other alternatives? (Dumping all the Google maps development and starting over with Bing maps is outside the scope of what I can do for corrective action.)</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>POP3 server deletes the email on the server&nbsp;as soon as the emails&nbsp;are downloaded unless explicitly set to save a copy on the server. I would recommend you connect your email account&nbsp;using IMAP instead of POP which will store a copy of emails on the server
 as well. </p>

            <p>If messages are deleted from the server when you delete them from the app, then I suspect you're not using a POP account like you believe because, in general, what you do in a POP client doesn't affect what's on the server. Messages travel in one direction
 only: from the server to the client, where they become completely local. The server no longer cares and cannot find out what you do with the local copies, except in one particular case.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two possibilities: one is you're using a synching protocol like IMAP or Exchange ActiveSync, in which case, whatever you do to a message in Windows 10 Mail will also happen on the server or two, you're using POP, as you say, but the client is deleting
 the messages from the server immediately when they get downloaded, not when you delete them on the client. You can easily test this by downloading messages, then visiting the mailbox on the server to see if the messages are there or not. If they're gone at
 that point, before you delete them from the server, then you know it's not when you delete them in W10M that they disappear from the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "one particular case" I mentioned above is that some POP clients also have an option to send a delete command to the server when you empty the client's Deleted folder. So, while messages aren't deleted from the server when you click or tap Delete or
 swipe to delete on the client, when you empty the trash, the client will send a command to the server to delete the corresponding server-side copies of those messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't believe the option to choose whether or not to leave messages on the server when you configure a POP account exists for Windows 10 Mail. I think W10M always leaves messages on the server. Moreover, The Outlook.com server's default behavior is to
 ignore the DELE command it receives from the client when the Deleted folder is emptied and to move the messages to a folder named POP that is a subfolder of the Deleted folder on the server. Log into your mailbox on the server to see if that folder exists.</p>

            <p>I've just moved from Windows Live Mail to the simple Mail app in Windows 10 and can confirm that when you download mail from a pop3 account the mail remains on the server BUT deleting the mail in the Mail app deletes it from the pop3 account. This is a pain
 in the backside as I sync with 2 devices and if I carelessly delete a mail message in the Windows 10 app before I sync with the other device then I never see it in that device mail client.</p>
<p>In Windows Live Mail you can configure when messages get removed from the pop3 account, but I see no equivalent option in Windows 10 mail.</p>
<p>Looks like I will have to ditch yet another Windows 10 app as being a very poor relation to the previous Windows tools (I've already given up on Groove music for the same reason)</p>

<h2>            Recover all deleted Outlook folders&#63;</h2>
                    How can I recover all deleted Outlook 2011 email and folders, when trash has also been emptied?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I purchased Wondershare's Data Recovery for Mac, ran it in regular and raw. &nbsp;I have folders that might be what I need, but they are not large enough to contain all my Outlook folders (I saved and organized hundreds of folders). &nbsp;Also, what do I "recover"
 ... the Office 2011 Identity, Main Identity, or Data Records (includes 14 folders).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Like everyone else I am sick about what I may have lost, and would appreciate the help of someone more knowledgeable than myself! &nbsp;: )</div>

            I'm afraid you'll more than likely need to resort to a backup to recover your deleted data. A Time Machine backup would be ideal.
<div><br />
<div>Your message sources would have been stored in your home folder (where " ~ " denotes your home folder) here:</div>
<div><br />
<div>~/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Office 2011 Identities/Main Identity/Data Records/Message Sources.</div>
<div><br />
<div>These are the raw messages. You should be able to double-click the .olk14MsgSource files to open them in Outlook. You won't be able to get these back into Outlook easily, though.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps!</div>

<p>Hi Margarida</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back to me but I'm afraid I need a few more instructions as your link didn't take me to the right place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on the link and I was already logged in. If I click on My account there was no option to go to 'Chat'. So could you please explain again in more detail.</p>
<p>
