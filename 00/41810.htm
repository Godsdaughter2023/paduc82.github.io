<h2>            Liability Insurance when using Azure</h2>
                    We are getting an insurance policy for liability and the application has many questions about our hosted environment, privacy, data security, backup, etc. Is there a published document that would answer these types of issues when hosting on Azure?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I continuously have problems with wireless network adapter for Acer Aspire V3-571G. It losses connection with wireless router. Other computers in the office&nbsp;have no such problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried several drivers but result is same or worse (it does not work at all). Please tell me which drivers I should use. My computer uses Windows 8 (single language=Russian)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for your quick response.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I cannot say I am facing the problem while I am connecting to the network. I can connect to the network without any problems, but in variable period of time the adapter loses connection with Internet (it seems like it is still connected to the router).
 The connection either comes back itself or I have to right-click on the Internet Access on the control panel and choose Troubleshoot Problems only after that the connection is restored.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. I do not receive any error message or error code except that the icon of Internet Access is changed. This happen some seconds later after the Internet connection is lost, most visible it is seen on Skype.</span></p>
<p><span>2. No we have wireless router.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please recommend me the most suitable driver I need to choose to solve the issue. I suppose the problem is related to this issue.</span></p>

                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having issues accessing a ton of titles that were previously added to my account as games with gold (including For honor, Superhot, and Watch Dogs, among others). I have a current Xbox Live Gold subscription, and have already contacted online
 support, who ran me through resetting the console, which did not restore access to the games. It would seem that the licenses for these games have been removed from my account. I have tried calling the microsoft support line, however that just gave me a link
 back to the xbox support site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know more about this issue, or know who I can contact to resolve it?</p>

<p>Hi Nckbyc,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us. I'm sorry to hear about the current issue with some games tittles you've previously obtained. I do want to clarify, you've always had an ongoing subscription through your account? Has anyone previously game shared with you
 ? Reason I ask about game sharing or best known as the 'Home Xbox' is due to the fact that those games could have been accessed through game sharing which lets you access the games but that would mean they weren't necessarily obtained officially through your
 account. If that is the case the account that was home sharing would have to be set up again to be able to grant you access to those games again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On </span><strong>Xbox One</strong><span>, you’ll no longer be able to access your Games with Gold titles if you cancel your subscription. However, if you decide to renew your subscription at any time, you’ll be able to access and
 play your previously redeemed Games with Gold titles again. Fore more information check out our article

<p>Hello Leslie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had acquired those games on my own account as home xbox, and they were not originally accessed through game sharing. However, I did begin game sharing later on, which is when the games seemed to be removed from my account. Xbox support notified me that
 the game licenses do not appear on either account. My home xbox is now set to the one I am using currently, and the games still do not appear on my account. I have a current xbox live Gold subscription, which was renewed recently.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick response! Thank you for the information you have provided helps narrow down what we can do to resolve this. Now since you do mention recently starting to game share and that's when you started to have issues with the games. By saying
 you started the game share, do you mean someone else was set up as your home Xbox for a bit? or did you set up your home Xbox elsewhere? Usually when you obtain these games with gold the will show under your order history as purchased for $o.oo as it's a free
 game obtained with Gold. Have you previously had any other account you have used on your Xbox that could be the main one that got the games?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest to try the following to see if it helps get access to these games again:&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span><span>Press the
</span></span><span><span>Xbox</span></span><span><span>button&nbsp;
 to open the guide.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Select
</span></span><span><span>System
</span></span><span><span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>Settings
</span></span><span><span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>Account
</span></span><span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>Remove
 accounts</span></span><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Select the account that you want to remove, and then select
</span></span><span><span>Remove</span></span><span><span>to
 confirm.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ol>
<div>
<p><span><span>After</span></span><span><span>removing
 the account perform the option '<span><span>'Clear
 local saved games'</span></span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><span>Go to settings</span></span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Choose system</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Go to 'Storage'</p>
</li><li>
<p>Choose <span>
<span>'Clear local saved games'</span></span><span><span>it won't delete your data.
</span></span><span><span>Clear local saved games:</span></span><span><span>This
 will clear out saved games from the console. This can be helpful if a game fails to launch because of a corrupted save.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<div>
<p><span><span>Now, you can add your Microsoft account to any Xbox One console. Here's how:</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><span>Press the
</span></span><span><span>Xbox</span></span><span><span>button&nbsp;
 to open the guide.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Select your
</span><span>gamerpic</span><span> in the upper-left corner of the screen, move all the way down and select
</span></span><span><span>Add new</span></span><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Enter the email address for the Microsoft account that you want to add, and then
 select </span></span><span><span>Enter</span></span><span><span>.
</span></span></p>
</li><li>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>Let us know how it goes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only way that game sharing would affect your licenses for a game is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were game sharing with someone else that had the gold subscription at the time the games were available with GWG and you did not have a gold subscription to go in and choose to get the games with gold.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order for the licenses to be on an account you have to actually go in and say that you want to get those games as part of the GWG they are not automatically put onto your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to tell if your account has a license for a particular game is to sign into your account at account.xbox.com and go to games and it will show you all licenses for the Xbox One games they took off the 360 games from there a couple months ago.</p>

            Are they showing up in the ready to install section?&nbsp; Make sure you have that filtered correctly to show all games and not just certain ones.&nbsp; &nbsp;I know there have been times in the past where I thought I lost access to some games, but it turned out that
 my Kids changed my filters so I wasn't viewing them.&nbsp;

<h2>            When playing the game after a short while the screen goes black.</h2>
                    <p>Hi. My daughter has a dell latitude 630 and has upgraded to windows 10, all be it by mistake, and since she has done this when she goes on her favourite game, Animal Jam, after a short while the screen goes black and she cannot do anything. She has to turn
 it all off and restart. This is obviously very annoying as she is in the middle of games etc and points!! Please help find a solution to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, is there any way she can go back to windows 7 home premium after installing windows 10 as it seems a bit complicated for her as she is used to the old version the same as her sisters have.</p>

    <title>Mysterious font issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brendankennedy_1956  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mysterious font issues</h2>
                    <p>Something is up with at least one of my fonts.&nbsp; The first symptom was that the text tool in all three versions of Photoshop I have stopped working. Adobe says it is probably a corrupted font, which makes sense, I guess, as why would all the programs have
 the same issue all of a sudden? I have since noticed that in Word, as well as other programs, fonts that have been long deleted still show up in the list. They don't work, of course... Word just says there isn't enough memory to display them. None of the fonts
 exhibit problems like missing or garbled characters, etc. Resetting the fonts to default values did nothing. I tried using Scan now, which after 25 minutes reported no issues. Is there anything I can try short of reimaging the whole machine? I wonder, if I
 renamed the font folder to "fntsold"&nbsp;or something and then rebooted, would Windows be forced to rebuild the font folder with the default set of fonts that come with it? (No, I have not installed any new fonts in quite some time) —Thanks for any ideas!</p>

<p>I did try to do that, but I discovered that it is really difficult to do. I get a&nbsp; lot of "Cannot delete this file because it is open in another [unspecified] program. Or it says it is open in Norton. Well, the latest version of Norton has no pause button
 like it used to, and it cannot be stopped in the services window—access denied. SO, it is a problem. I even tried "File Assasin" from Malware Bytes...no luck.</p>

            It probably is Norotn that is prohibiting this action . . .
<br />
<br />Does this option not exist in the latest version of Norton?
<br />
<br />In the notification area on the taskbar, right-click the Norton icon, and then click Disable Auto-Protect
<br />
<br />In the Security Request window, in the Select the duration drop-down list, select the duration for which you want to turn off Norton.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>OK, I disabled Norton, Malwarebytes, Carbonite, plus&nbsp;anything I could see in the task manager that might be running.&nbsp;Still says the files are open. Then I thought I'd start it in safe mode, thinking it just wouldn't load up much, maybe I could get somewhere.
 Got to the blue screen with all the choices on it and it wouldn't respond to any keyboard&nbsp;input. Ah-ha, I thought, it is a wireless keyboard and none of the drivers are loaded. So I went and got a cheap wired keyboard (typing on it now) plugged it in...and
 nothing. Restarted and made sure it worked, which it did. Restarted again in safe mode, blue screen, still nothing...<strong>UPDATE</strong>: I found another way into safe mode using msconfig, and successfully deleted all the files you mentioned. Unfortunately,
 that made no difference. Ghosts&nbsp;of fonts are still showing up in Word, etc. If I end up resetting Windows, and I choose the "save my files" option, will it still overwrite the fonts folder, etc.? Or, to be sure, should I Just start with a clean slate.? [Still
 curious as to why I couldn't get into safe mode the normal way.]<br />

            <p>NAT stands for Network Address Translation.&nbsp;</p><p>Simply put, the Xbox is trying to communicate out through your router on several ports. Since the router manages your network traffic, that's where the issue usually exists.</p><p>There is more info to explain about the process but we'll skip that for now<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>The NAT Types you'll run across on the Xbox are -&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;- OPEN - meaning the Xbox is able to communicate on the ports that it needs<br /></p><p>&nbsp;- MODERATE - meaning some of the ports are closed and some games/features may not work</p><p>&nbsp;- STRICT - meaning that most ports are closed and most features like chat or connecting to a game server may not work</p><p>&nbsp;- UNAVAILABLE - meaning the router is not allowing the xbox to communicate on any ports</p><p><br /></p><p>Troubleshooting -&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;- Since it sounds like your using the wifi "at my new apartment complex (don't have access to the modem". The router there may limit your 
<p>&nbsp;- Set your Primary DNS as 8.8.8.8 and Secondary DNS as 8.8.4.4</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Go back to Alternate MAC Address &gt; Clear - and let the Xbox restart and try your games again</p><p><br /></p><p>The other issue is that the NAT on the Xbox can be OPEN and when you try and launch a COD game, the game is unable to connect out on the port that it needs through the router and the game will show a NAT Type of STRICT</p><p><br /></p><p>The other thing that you posted is that you don't have access to the router and then later you post that you "opened eight different ports through port forward&nbsp;triggering,"&nbsp;</p><p>I'm not sure if you're saying you do have access to the router? Or if you have a second router in your network setup?&nbsp;</p><p><br />If the steps above don't work, give Xbox Support a call and reach out to the Networking group for Xbox.

<h2>            Movie Maker cuts off last 3-4 seconds of my MP3 audio</h2>
                    I have been working on my 5th video with Movie Maker. No major issues with adding MP3 audio before.&nbsp; This time I have put together a long series of photos totaling about 10 minutes. I add a MP3 audio clip (entire song lasting 9 min, 43 sec.). No matter
 how I try to do this it cuts off the climatic final 3-4 seconds. When I listen to the song otherwise, it plays to its entirety. What gives?

    <title>Surface Book 2 - High internal GPU load - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> atyachin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book 2 - High internal GPU load</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Book 2 (i7 Model 1832) with Intel Graphics 620 build-in GPU, and NVidia GeForce GTX 1050 additional GPU.</p>
<p>System is Windows 10 x64, build&nbsp;10.0.18362.207</p>
<p>
</p><p>A typical setup I have is:</p>
<p>* laptop lid is closed</p>
<p>* surface dock is connected</p>
<p>* external monitor connected to the dock</p>
<p>* resolution set to 1920x1080 (the recommended per the connected external monitor)</p>
<p>* display scale set to 100% (the recommended in this case)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Under the above setup, every couple minutes the entire system becomes very sluggish. The task manager shows that the Intel 620 GPU is on high load (mainly the "3D" section), and the apps that seems to consume the GPU load are typical Windows apps like Outlook,
 Skype, Chrome, Windows Explorer and sometimes even background processes.</p>
<p>Under this state the system becomes almost un-usable / hanged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to solve this issue is to "reset" the display by opening the lid and closing it again. Opening the lead (turns on the internal laptop monitor) immediately lowers the GPU usage to 0%. Closing the lid again gets me couple more minutes of low/regular
 GPU usage until I open some apps and the internal GPU runs again to &gt;80% usage (no graphic apps are in use - only regular windows apps).</p>
<p>Another way to "reset" the high GPU load is to use the Surface Detach button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Additional points:</p>
<p>* I'm not using the "tablet mode" of windows</p>
<p>* All drivers and system updates are latest/greatest.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Would be happy to learn if other people also suffer from high internal GPU load, and what are possible solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Ok, after additional tests, it looks like the main processes to consume the high GPU are:</p>
<p>1. Client Server Runtime Process (csrss.exe)</p>
<p>2. Desktop Window Manager (dwm.exe)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an issue many people are facing and can be searched in Google as:</p>
<p>"<strong>client server runtime process high gpu</strong>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This seems to be related to power management policies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First thing to try is to disable the NVidia Power Saving Mode as described here:</p>

<p>After several more weeks, changing the power settings of the nVidia GPU does not solve the issue.</p>
<p>Still, csrss.exe and dwm.exe (and sometimes other random processes) are consuming high load from the Intel GPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't happen all the time. The computer enters this state of high GPU load (&gt;80%) once I start using some apps that require GPU operation (like video encoding/decoding). Then, even if the specific operation is stopped, the mentioned processes still
 loads the Intel GPU and only opening/closing the laptop lid resets the state.</p>

<p>A few things you might try.</p>
<p>You should really keep the lid of your Surface open. The cooling ports for the base are in front of the hinge and will work better also the tablet will get better cooling if it is fully exposed to the air. If you're not using the Surface display just disable
 it in Display Settings.</p>
<p>Try uninstalling or at least disabling Chrome and see if that helps. I've seen a couple reports indicating it can do crazy things to system resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;When you can manually select the Nvidia GPU for graphics heavy applications. The auto select function is useless.</p>

<p>Ok, the GPU load seems to be a side effect of the real issue, which is <strong>
CPU throttling</strong> down to 400 MHz...</p>
<p>More about this issue in Surface Book 2 devices here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/microsoft-surface-pro-6-and-surface-book-2-devices-are-throttle-locking-to-400-mhz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/microsoft-surface-pro-6-and-surface-book-2-devices-are-throttle-locking-to-400-mhz/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here's how it looks like:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b3f59d9-4b6a-47e2-bc45-771a13589ce8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b3f59d9-4b6a-47e2-bc45-771a13589ce8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Note that even after the GPU usage decreased, the CPU stays throttled at 0.40 GHz.</p>
<p>Opening and closing the lid resets the throttling and CPU goes back to ~2 Ghz ranges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens regularly when the Surface is connected to its dock and is not overheated in any way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now need to wait for Microsoft to release a firmware upgrade to solve this...</p>

<p>atyachin isn't trolling. I've used an ice pack on the back of my SurfaceBook 2 to speed it back up to 25 watts (around 3.2Ghz or better under 100% load) while installing updates to Visual Studio 2019 and Unity 2019.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've installed the Release Preview firmware update (which was release a few weeks ago, just didn't know about it) 2 nights ago and it seems to have made a significant improvement. I wouldn't say the throttling is gone, but what I have noticed is the processor
 (using Intel Power Gadget) stays around 22 to 25 watts constantly, and under long loads (Say 10 MHz+ bandwidth SDR waterfall or CPU machine learning inferences) the CPU drops to 15 Watts (2.4GHz ish) but then recovers within a minute back to 22 to 26 Watts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before the firmware update would only see 13 Watts (2.2 GHz ish under full load) that would drop to 4 watts ( 400 MHz to 0. 8 GHz) under load for several minutes only to clime back to 11 watts (1.5 to 1.6 GHz)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could trick it back to 18 to 25 watts if I adjusted the battery slider power mode, but that only solved the problem for a 20 to 40 seconds depending on how warm my room was. throttling was much worse in environments like a laundromat where the ambient
 temperature was 85 degrees F.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still testing out the "fix" to see how it reacts, unfortunately we've had a cold front move in that's dropped our outside temps to below freezing this week so it's hard to create an environment that reliably reproduces the bug.</p>

<p>I have the exact same issue. Once i power up anything that requires some GPU it throttles WAY WAY down and just won't run. My whole computer will drops FPS down to about... 8. Then i have to CTRL ALT DEL to close everything.

<h2>            Deleting EVERYTHING</h2>
                    <p>I need to delete everything off of my computer. Just completely wipe it out as if I just bought it. I have no clue how to do that. I have gone into the main frame and tried to figure out what to do from there but nothing works. Re-installing windows would
 be great-but I learned that I need to have a disc for that (If your are wondering, I don't have the disc I need). Help would be greatly appreciated. Oh and some advice about my computer fan would be great too. It keeps heating up way too quick.&nbsp;</p>

 because it should never be used on a lap) has vents on the bottom.&nbsp; It needs those vents to be unblocked to suck air in to cool the system.&nbsp; When you block them by placing your computer on a soft surface, you stop the airflow.</p>

<br />You probably need the drivers from the AMD site. 
<br />Go to the link below and search for you driver and install that.
<br />Also make sure your BIOS is up to date.
<br />You can do that from your vendors site.

            Hi kfong, that crash is caused by EaseUS Todo Backup Monitor . . .
<br />
<br />tart your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />
<br />Once in Safe Mode, uninstall that EaseUS software
<br />
<br />Restart your PC

<p>I have the exact same issue and have tried your recommendation.&nbsp; However, I can't get the machine into Safe Mode to remove EaseUS Todo.&nbsp; I have tried wmic in the cmd but this hasn't shown any product names (not sure I am using it correctly).&nbsp; It just keeps
 rebooting with the error, attempts to fix and then gets the error again.&nbsp; Hoping I can fix this without resorting to a new install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a workaround for my situation?</p>

    <title>Why is CPU usage so high&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> curryguy123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is CPU usage so high&#63;</h2>
                    I have run multiple virus scans with both MSE and Malwarebytes and neither have found any problems. However, my fan was blowing really loudly, so I checked Task Manager with nothing else open and CPU usage was between 25% and 30%. When I opened Word and
 Chrome, it went up to 50%-55%. I don't believe this is normal, I was hoping someone may know why. Just a few weeks ago, the computer was running on 1-2% when on standby and around 10-12% when programs were open.

            <p>I am guessing you are asking this, "Why would it be high if I'm using the computer?" about the "System Idle" process?&nbsp; It would be high because it is UNLIKELY you will use 100% of your processor unless you do certain tasks (or there is something wrong.)&nbsp;
 It is telling you that your CPU is xx% idle, doing nothing and waiting to be utilized.&nbsp; If it gets low, then you have too many things open and/or (more likely) have a problem.&nbsp; If you do start noticing you use lots of processor and have very little left idling...
 Then yuou might consider (if there is no problem) getting a new system.</p>
<p>In reference to the application in question (using up to 25% of your processor):</p>

<p>Get rid of it if you don't use it.</p>
<p>Proprietary crud you likely do not use should likely not be left installed.</p>
<p>Basically - what it is:<br />
a software library, which assists VAIO Content <span>
Importer / Exporter</span> in analysing and working with media content...</p>
<p>Do you need it?<br />
It is recommended if you use VAIO Content Importer / Exporter for managing and editing video and audio.&nbsp; Do you?<br />
(Yes, keep it and update it.&nbsp; No, remove it.)</p>

i just bought a new desktop with windows 10. on log in the screen says defaultuser0, account disabled. contact administrator. When you click OK, the administrator screen comes up. It also says account has been disabled. I've tried to go to safe mode, but nothing
 seems to work. The only keys that work are the windows key and P. That brings up the screen for attaching a projector to the computer.</p>

 I am part of a fairly large FL community, and have been on steam for over 9 years now. And if MS is willing to allow flight sim X on steam. Then why wouldnt they also list other successful titles, namely Freelancer, as well?
