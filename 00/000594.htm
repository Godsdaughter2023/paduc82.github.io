    <title>Windows 10 and MSN Explorer Premium - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 and MSN Explorer Premium</h2>
                    <p>My computer currently runs Windows 7 Home Premium with Service Pack 1, and I am subscribed to MSN Premium (Version 11.000.0028.1500)&nbsp;as my Internet service provider.&nbsp; Lately, MSN has had numerous operating failures requing the program to be closed and relogging,
 sometimes repeating the problem several times after a single log in episode, which leads me to think that there may be some instability or other issue(s) that are causing this to happen.&nbsp; I understand the MSN Explorer runs with Internet Explorer in the back
 ground, but when I run Internet Explorer by itself, I do not have access to my favorites and other features I have configured in MSN Explorer (e.g. home page, mail, address book, calendar, etc).&nbsp; I have already reserved a copy of Windows 10 and have several
 questions about the upgrade:</p>
<ul>
<li>How will MSN Explorer work with Windows 10?</li><li>Will there be an upgrade of MSN Explorer concurrent with the Windows 10 upgrade?</li><li>Will Microsoft Edge replace Internet Explorer?</li><li>Will I be able to use Microsoft Edge in lieu of MSN Explorer and access the same features I currentlent have in MSN Explorer?</li></ul>
<p>I sincerely thank in advance any assistance and insight that anyonecan provide on these questions.</p>

            <p>Hello Everyone! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to upgrading to Windows 10, I had Windows 7 and had been having issues with MSN Explorer that it would stop working, sometimes repeatedly, especially when we would switch from the browser to email or from my account to my wife's account. &nbsp;Immediately
 after the upgrade to Windows 10, I was able to access my email, but could not either reply to or write new emails. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called Tech Support and after about 1 hour on the phone, the technician was unable to resolve the problem and created a case no. for referral to a Level 2 Technician. After three calls and my insisting that I needed this resolved at that time, a Supervisor
 came on the line to assist me. He found that I had multiple currupt files in my temporary files, which was causing the recurring crashes of MSN Explorer. He proceeded to delete all the currupt files and re-installed MSN Explorer after which I was able to access
 and respond, as well as write new emails. The technician did warn me that there was a problem in the interface between MSN Explorer mail and Windows 10 that would cause MSN Explorer to crash when attempting to open emails with attachments, and that Microsoft
 was working to resolve this issue. The issue must have been resolved because I now can open emails with attachments without problems. The same Supervisor called me the next day to check if everything was working fine, except for the issue with emails with
 attachments that he had warned me the previous day. As a matter of fact, since his assistance about a week ago, I have not had any instances of MSN Explorer crashing. &nbsp;The only problem I was having until yesterday was that after the computer went into the
 sleep mode, my Logitech wireless mouse would not work. I had to remove the USB input device and reinsert it for the mouse to respond. However, yesterday I went to Control Panel and selected connected devices and performed a diagnostic for the mouse and Windows
 fixed the problem. So, knock on wood, the mouse has been working fine since then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Norton 360 Premium for my virus and other protection and Norton advised me that not all the features of Norton 360 are compatible with Windows 10 and Edge, so it recommended that I make Internet Explorer as my default browser, which as you may know,
 runs in the background with MSN Explorer. &nbsp;Norton advised me that they are working to resolve this issue and will notify me as soon as it is resolved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On on a previous occasion prior to Windows 10, I asked the folks at MSN if I could use Internet Explorer and Outlook as my browser and email and was told I could, but that first I needed to log into my MSN Premium account and then switch to either IE or
 Outlook. However, I was warned that my favorites would not be available in IE nor my address book and my regular mail boxes would be available in Outlook. As you all may know, Outlook.com replaced hotmail and is available through MSN Explorer, and allows you
 to access your mail boxes and address book.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope one this is helpful to all.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Pedro,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about your queries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also appreciate your concerns about MSN explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MSN explorer will work as it works in previous version of Windows. An upgrade of MSN explorer is not required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Edge will replace Internet explorer. However, you will still have "Open with Internet explorer" option within Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will be able to use Microsoft Edge in lieu of MSN Explorer and access the same features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For issue with MSN favorites, you may refer the following link and check if it helps.<br />

    <title>Numbering not showing on document when applying new template - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wp4fun  say:</h3>
<h2>            Numbering not showing on document when applying new template</h2>
                    <p>When I apply a new template to an existing document, quite often the format numbering will not show.&nbsp; I close the document and reopen it and sometimes the numbering will show and other times it won't.&nbsp; I keep reopening the document until it finally shows.&nbsp;
 Why does this happen?&nbsp; What can I do to make the numbering show instantly without reopening the document multiple times?&nbsp; I've discovered that when I open the document and the numbering is not showing, if I reapply the first couple of styles at the beginning
 of the document numbering doesn't show when I do this), close the document and reopen it, the numbering will show.</p>

<p>How did you apply your template to an existing document? There are different ways, some more convenient than others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Often, the best approach is to create a new document based on your template and then bring in existing content via the Insert File dialog box. (To display the dialog box: Click the Insert tab, click the arrow on the Object button and then choose Text from
 File.) Assuming that numbering was properly created with styles (see <a href="http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering20072010.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering20072010.html</a>), the formatting should change to match the settings in the target.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;add/change a template to a document by choosing the Developer Tab,&nbsp;&nbsp;clicking on the "Document Template" tab,&nbsp; and when the "Templates and Add-ins" box opens, I select the "Templates" tab, delete the existing Template (if any) showing in the Document Template
 box, select "Attach", and attach the template I want.&nbsp; I also make sure the box is selected for "Automatically update document styles". &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I follow this procedure, I have to&nbsp;close the document and then reopen it, sometimes two or three different times, before the numbering shows.&nbsp; The template works.&nbsp;&nbsp;The document just doesn't show the numbering after I've applied it and closed out of
 the Developer Tab.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I have no idea what your steps are.&nbsp; I couldn't follow them as my ribbon does not show&nbsp;and "Object" button under&nbsp;the "Insert" tab.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>The Object command is in the Text group on the Insert tab. <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb71f24d-acc0-40a8-9939-48f49f46fbdb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>That worked but is way too time consuming.&nbsp; I'm applying or changing the template to over 40+ documents at one time.&nbsp; It's much easier to it my way.&nbsp; I'm trying to find out why when I apply the template does the numbering disappear until I open it open again
 (sometimes I have to reopen it two or three times).&nbsp; I've been applying templates this way for several ways and never had this issue in previous versions of Word.&nbsp; If its a "glitch" in the new Version of word, is there a "patch" to fix it?</p>

<p>I suggested using the Insert File dialog box simply because it is safer. However, depending on "Automatically update document styles" may work if you carefully set up numbering for your headings (see
<a href="http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering20072010.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering20072010.html</a>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally, automatic updating of styles work best when there are no numbered styles present, though. This also applies when you manually copy numbered styles between documents (using the Organizer dialog box).</p>

<p>Hi Suzy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to set up rules for incoming emails when you’re out of office, you can refer to the following steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open Outlook &gt; File &gt; Automatic Relies &gt; Rules &gt; Add Rule &gt; Advanced &gt; set the time under Received section</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33de911b-1b6a-4d00-817c-229113915719?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33de911b-1b6a-4d00-817c-229113915719?upload=true" /></a></p>

<h2>            This is ridiculous&#33; &#40;Can&#39;t access my main account&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I had to make an entirely new account just to post this complaint/plea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently moved computers (new hard drive) and unfortunately I didn't remember to save all my passwords from the other one on my flashdrive. So I've been struggling to get into my e-mails and Tumblr and other places.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this is completely unfair. I tried (several times) to get help recovering my password for my main account (*** Removed for Security ***) and filled out that stupid form it asks to verify. In the past it worked, but for some reason, it's rejected me THREE
 TIMES now (and now I'm 'blocked' from further attempts even GUESSING the password). Not to mention I don't have a cellphone so I can't just have the thing texted to me. It's ridiculous. I can't even use my secondary e-mail account (ymail) because I'm having
 trouble remembering/recovering THAT password too. The only way to get that one renewed is accessing HOTMAIL and obviously they're not realizing that I'M the person trying to get into MY account!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm NOT about to give up on this. My main account is used for EVERYTHING.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I'm trying to do is get the stupid password changed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please, for the love of god, HELP ME, don't deny me access to my own account. PLEASE.</p>
<p>I'm tired of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You guys need a much better way of dealing with this problem than being so "overprotective" and refusing access when I can't answer some questions precisely enough. And it's extremely stupid to have a limit to how many times you can use the form or guess/try
 to sign in. I don't care if it could be a hacker or imposter trying to get into an account, it's still complete ****.</p>

            <p>I tried to access my account this evening to download and install Office on a replacement computer.&nbsp; I tried numerous times but all of the login attempts and forgot password attempts failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like no matter how I type in the characters it does not work.&nbsp; So I tried the audio and could not understand it at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's pretty frustrating.&nbsp; If we can't access our account we need to consider moving to some other system.&nbsp; In the past I maintained my own server with everything I needed there.&nbsp; I moved my email to the cloud and it works but what do I do if it ever stops
 working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We put a lot of faith in these systems.&nbsp; So my suggestion would be that if nothing we do is working, there should be a way to contact support and get assistance.&nbsp; It could be a chat or an email if a telephone contact is not an option.&nbsp; But there should be
 a way to get unstuck.&nbsp; Our lives are too full for delays of any kind now.</p>

            <p>Thanks for offering suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already visited the article last night and everything about the online support system is built on the assumption that you can log in using your original identity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too had to create another identity just to access the site and articles.&nbsp; What&nbsp;I need is direct, two-way human to human communication.&nbsp; I will need to find a telephone number to follow up with Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My situation is probably different because I am a reseller who pays a subscription fee annually for access to resources I need to understand and support Microsoft products.&nbsp; I should be able to get a human on the phone at some point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may not be so easy for someone who migrates from a Hotmail account or some other consumer service/product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These observations are shared here in the hope that people (system designers and consumers) realize we can do better.&nbsp; And we should be prepared to pay for the level of service we need.&nbsp; I am.</p>
<p>

            <p>I am experiencing the same problem.</p>
<p>I have an 'hotmail' account that i have used to register many gaming and shopping websites.</p>
<p>As part of your 'overprotective' policy i had to verify my account; however, the website that i have used to create the email that was linked to my account has closed it's email service, therefore i couldn't verify my account.</p>
<p><span>Furthermore</span>, i couldn't fill all the small details that was required in order to recover my account, because i don't remember every email, folder or contacts that i have had.</p>
<p>Couldn't we contact you (Microsoft) through the phone (not through emails) in order to try and verify our account?</p>

            <p>Thank you for the multiple offers of support.&nbsp; I will update you all here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did visit the article again and did select having trouble signing in.&nbsp; I did use my new login to gain access to the form.&nbsp; I did complete the form with all the details from my Action Pack subscription including location ID, Order number, email confirmation
 header info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried to save the form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The captcha was much more clear on this form area then it was on the areas I worked last night.&nbsp; However, four very meticulous attempts all failed and now I am absolutely convinced this form page is not working.&nbsp; I do have a hardware firewall but I did not
 see any alerts.&nbsp; I would think that if I can type characters here I should be able to submit a captcha entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am still wasting time.&nbsp; I do not think it is appropriate for this to be a problem to rely on generous offers of assistance from the community.&nbsp; I really think I need to go to Microsoft for assistance.&nbsp; In the past when I did, I was always well served.&nbsp;
 I just have to find the appropriate phone number and start the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;will take this opportunity to say here that product and service providers will only support what they sell if we hold them accountable.&nbsp; The consumers just have to decide what is an acceptable level of support and what is an acceptable price.&nbsp; I believe
 that time has a value.&nbsp; I have wasted a lot and I apologize for wasting yours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will post an update when I have some resolution.&nbsp; It may be a day or two so please relax.&nbsp; I know you are trying to help me.&nbsp; Please help Cocoa if you can.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your contribution on the forum Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should try to&nbsp;remove and reconnecting your Facebook account in <strong>Settings &gt; Emails+Accounts</strong>. MS recently fixed a few syncing issues with Facebook, perhaps this will fix your issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find several manipulation also to try on this thread : <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp8-wpapps/facebookfacebook-messenger-images-dont-load/dbd28f8f-02e1-40cd-931f-48d0b57e010e">

<p>
</p><p>Microsoft and Facebook are currently investigating all issues regarding FB in Windows Phones.
</p>
<p>Hopefully it is resolved with a new update that is coming soon. </p>

    <title>Bookmarks in Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tomskim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bookmarks in Excel</h2>
                    After creating a content page&nbsp;(list of reports), I linked the items to&nbsp;the Named Ranges.&nbsp;After Clicking on the Bookmark it takes me to the Top-Left corner of the respective&nbsp;Range. The problem is that the top-left cell more often than not appears at the
 botom of the screen. Is there a way to create a Bookmark, so&nbsp;the Range&nbsp;always appears at the top of the screen (viewing area)? Regards - Tom

<p>If you want a slick way to do this, try:</p>
<p>Sub AllBtnClick()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim rng As Range<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case "Text on btn3": Set rng = myNamedRange<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case Else ' do nothing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.Goto rng, scroll:=True<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>All buttons call the same macro.&nbsp; The range selected will depend on the text on the button.</p>

                    <p>My friend made me a custom build a while ago and bought 2x4gb of RAM. Could only get the computer to boot up with 1 slot of ram in. I recently enabled XMP mode in the bios menu and it now boots up and runs.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However...<br />
<br />
Maybe after 20 minutes to an hour of usage my computer will restart with a blue screen and give various error messages. These two have popped up before.<br />

            <p>Are you sure you are using the proper control to display the Hyperlink?&nbsp; You have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the Insert tab --&gt; Hyperlink and then bind the values to the proper fields</li><li>Go to the Home tab --&gt; Controls gallery --&gt; Hyperlink and then bind the values to the proper fields.<br />
</li></ul>
<p>Sounds like you may have an anyURI field, but this doesn't ensure that it will display as a hyperlink.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully that works for you!</p>

    <title>Outlook displays incorrect name for Sender on incoming email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ortnpalms  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook displays incorrect name for Sender on incoming email</h2>
                    <p>I have a&nbsp;error in&nbsp;the name that displayed by Outlook as the Sender of certain emails in my Inbox.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that this problem can be caused by a&nbsp;situation at the Sender's end due to either an error or variation in the name entered in the Sender's email Account settings.&nbsp; However, the error that I see is due to something at my end because the error is so
 ridiculous that the Sender would never make it, and I know for a fact that I initially made the error.&nbsp; And&nbsp;I can't correct it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the situation.&nbsp; I originally received an email from an email address that I will say (to disguise the actual info) was from
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp; I didn't know the person's name but somehow I got in my head that the sender was (to make it up for this example) Xavier Yahoo.&nbsp; So I entered that information in my Outlook contact list.&nbsp; Later
 I found out that the person's name is actually Joe Johnson (to make it up, but with the correct fact pattern).&nbsp; So I changed the information in my Outlook Contact to associate&nbsp;the
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;email address with Joe Johnson.&nbsp; However, to this day when I receive email from
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, Outlook displays&nbsp;it&nbsp;as being from "Xavier Yahoo."&nbsp; There is no way that Joe Johnson would have set up an account using the name Xavier Yahoo.&nbsp; It was clearly a mistake at my end, and even though
 I have changed my Outlook Contact for *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;to refer to Joe Johnson, email from that email address in my Outlook Inbox still displays the Sender as Xavier Yahoo.&nbsp; How can I fix that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a second case where I mistakenly entered a person's first name in my Contact List as "Judy" and it is actually "Judi."&nbsp; No matter that I corrected the name to Judi&nbsp;in the Outlook Contact list - whenever I receive email from her email address, Outlook
 insists on telling me that it is from "Judy."&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow, somewhere Outlook has cached the display name for these two email addresses based on what I originally entered in my Contact list, and I can't figure out to correct what Outlook displays as the Sender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Outlook 2007 on Windows 8.1&nbsp; </p>

            I see that no one has picked up on this.&nbsp; It would seem to me to be a fairly common problem where a person changes their name (such as a married name) but not their email address.&nbsp; It would be nice to&nbsp;be able to change things so that&nbsp;the person's new name
 shows up as the sender when receiving an email from that person.&nbsp;

<p>Jack_the_Wonderdog,</p>
<p>I suspect you're paddling upstream on this one. Active support for Project 2010 ended a few years back (circa Dec 2016) and compatibility with with Office 365 was never addressed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still need to save Project plans to Excel, I suggest you continue with the .CSV to .XLSX workaround or upgrade Project to Project Online. I'd suggest using VBA for the export but unfortunately VBA is not supported by the online versions of Excel (e.g.
 Office 365)</p>

Is there a way to&nbsp;sort Inbox by Sender while keeping the Conversation View?<br />

            Hi Steve,
<br />No, sorry, you can't sort by send and keep conversation. If you are looking for mail to or from a specific sender, use instant search. If you do this a lot, create a custom view or search folder. (You can also use VBA to create the search using the sender name of the selected message. )

 to use OnTime since I don't have access to the PC where it will be running full time right now. I need some assistance with cancelling all the OnTime events upon closing the workbook. Do I need to name each occurrence individually? Also, will the current OnTime
 events only run for 1 24 hour period or do I need to loop them? Any help is greatly appreciated! This is one of the 2 that are set to refresh at the given times.</p>
<br />
<p>Code: </p>
<p>Sub Refresh_Data()<br />
<br />
Application.OnTime TimeValue("00:00:00"), "Refresh_Data"<br />

            <p>The only way to cancel an OnTime queue entry is to specify the exact time requested in the first OnTime call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The technique described below is a safe way to start a process at a specific time or to run a repeating process at a specific interval of time. The OnTime timer has to be restarted each time it triggers if a repeating timer is required. The sample code below
 illustrates how to do this. In the example, the timer is started by calling StartTimer. It fires every five seconds until StopTimer is called.<br />
<br />
Note that if using frequent Application.OnTime events, the Name Box is rendered ineffective.<br />
<br />
[Begin Code Segment]<br />
<br />
Private mTimerTime As Date<br />
<br />
Public Sub StartTimer()<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; StopTimer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; DoTimer<br />
<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Public Sub DoTimer()<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Do timer work here<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Reset the timer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; mTimerTime = Now() + TimeSerial(0, 0, 5)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.OnTime mTimerTime, "DoTimer"<br />
<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Public Sub StopTimer()<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On Error Resume Next<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.OnTime mTimerTime , "DoTimer", Schedule:=False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On Error GoTo 0<br />
<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
[End Code Segment]<br />
<br />
When setting the next timer, specific intervals at specific times can be specified. Below are some common intervals and times.<br />
<br />
Once a minute on the whole minute.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; mTimerTime = Now() + TimeSerial(0, 0, 60 - Second(Now()) Mod 60 + 1)<br />
<br />
Once every 5 minutes on the whole 5 minutes:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; mTimerTime = Now() + TimeSerial(0, 5 - Minute(Now()) Mod 5 - 1, 60 - Second(Now()) Mod 60 + 1)<br />
<br />
Once every 10 minutes on the whole 10 minutes:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; mTimerTime = Now() + TimeSerial(0, 10 - Minute(Now()) Mod 10 - 1, 60 - Second(Now()) Mod 60 + 1)<br />
<br />
Once every 15 minutes on the quarter hour:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; mTimerTime = Now() + TimeSerial(0, 15 - Minute(Now()) Mod 15 - 1, 60 - Second(Now()) Mod 60 + 1)<br />
<br />
Once an hour on the whole hour:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; mTimerTime = Now() + TimeSerial(0, 60 - Minute(Now()) Mod 60 - 1, 60 - Second(Now()) Mod 60 + 1)<br />
<br />
Once every three hours on the whole three hours:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; mTimerTime = Now() + TimeSerial(3 - Hour(Now()) Mod 3 - 1, 60 - Minute(Now()) Mod 60 - 1, 60 - Second(Now()) Mod 60 + 1)<br />
<br />
Once every six hours at midnight, 6 AM, noon, and 6 PM:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; mTimerTime = Now() + TimeSerial(6 - Hour(Now()) Mod 6 - 1, 60 - Minute(Now()) Mod 60 - 1, 60 - Second(Now()) Mod 60 + 1)<br />
<br />
Once every 12 hours at noon and midnight:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; mTimerTime = Now() + TimeSerial(12 - Hour(Now()) Mod 12 - 1, 60 - Minute(Now()) Mod 60 - 1, 60 - Second(Now()) Mod 60 + 1)<br />
<br />
Once every 24 hours at midnight:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; mTimerTime = Now() + 1<br />
<br />
The next day at a specific time (9:45 AM for example):<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; mTimerTime = Now() + 1 + TimeSerial(9, 45, 0)</p>

<h2>            How do I restore my old msn.com email to my profile after removing it since this msn.com email is no longer being processed&#63;</h2>
                    I am a long time msn customer with a msn.com email account. &nbsp;I converted my hotmail online interface to the outlook online interface as it is definitely the way to go. &nbsp;In the conversion I created a live.com email account and so no issues as I read my
 msn.com email account would still be active. &nbsp;No issues since these two email accounts would be linked to one profile. &nbsp;And then I removed the msn.com email account and now realize that this killed any msn.com email account processing. &nbsp;I want to add my old
 msn.com email back to my profile but it is not an option within the profile interface since it does not recognize the msn.com email domain address. &nbsp;I am hoping and asking, is there any way to restore my msn.com email address? &nbsp;Any ideas or approaches to contact
 the right Microsoft support is greatly appreciated. &nbsp;Thank you.

            <p>Hi, Rookman!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From my understanding, your newly created&nbsp;live.com email was your primary e-mail. This is what you use to log-in. You associated your msn.com email&nbsp; to this primary e-mail as an alias and you deleted it from being associated to your live.com e-mail. Now,
 you would want to add it back. If this is what happened, it doesn't mean that when you deleted it you have killed/deactivated the e-mail itself.
<span>Only after being removed and not reused by the original account for 30 days will the removed alias address be available for any Microsoft account owner to add as an alias</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is an alias?</p>
<p><span>An alias is a secondary email address added to an already existing Microsoft account address. To put it another way, you have a mailbox with an existing email address created
 when you signed up for your Microsoft account and sometime later you added another email address going to the same mailbox.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for replying.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to download the&nbsp;Window Phone Recovery Tool&nbsp;from the link given below and check if it helps.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Software Recovery Tool can help you to reset and recover your phone software at home, if your phone is experiencing software related or software update problems.&nbsp;With Windows Phone 8&nbsp;models, you can also&nbsp;recover your phone in case your phone is not
 responding, it appears to be stuck, or it is not starting.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987</span></span></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important!</strong><span>&nbsp;Using the Software Recovery Tool will erase all content stored on your phone, including apps and games (along with app data and game progress), text messages, call history, music, photos and more. If possible, you should
 back up your phone first (Settings &gt; backup). You will be able to restore a backup once the recovery is complete.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After performing the recovery, I suggest you to update to the latest build and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Before you install refer the article given below: </strong></p>

<h2>            My Product Key for Microsoft Office Suddenly not Valid</h2>
                    I purchased my Microsoft Office 2010 from Amazon and got the product key from there. It worked fine for a few weeks and now it is suddenly telling me that the key is no longer valid so my version is now "unlicensed." I copied the product key exactly from
 Amazon and entered it, but it continues to tell me the key is not valid.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't know how to retrieve my product key off the Office website as it asks for a product pin number which I cannot find as my copy is a digital and not a hard copy.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What do I do? I can provide proof of purchase if necessary. I spent $119 on this product and I would be rather upset to learn that the money ended up being wasted.</div>

            So good news, I tried one more thing before I called MS. I went digging through my computer and found out the previous version of Office my father had installed was a pirated version which may have clashed with Office 2010. I uninstalled everything that
 was related to Office included the starter pack.
<div><br />
<div>I then reinstalled Office 2010 and now everything appears to be working fine. I checked in the help section and it tells me my version of Office 2010 is activated. So I think whatever pirated key my dad used to install Office 2007 clashed with 2010.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks a lot for your help.</div>

    <title>How to remove Bing-infection from Win 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the dag  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to remove Bing-infection from Win 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I want to use IE11 (both desktop and "Store" versions) but I do need to use a search engine that sometimes returns relevant results, and that means I cannot use Bing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found lots of questions similar to mine on this forum and articles online. Apparently none of your support staff is aware whether or not this is supported on Windows 8, or if so, how.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google also have a page intended to make it as easy as a click to switch (to them, of course). Since this stuff has been custom made to help users switch back to Google after Microsoft stole their users, it is pretty easy to guess the reason it doesn't work
 is you made changes in IE precisely in order to prevent it from working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the registry changes that your own support staff have been suggesting on this site. They don't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've watched youtube videos demonstrating how to do this. They don't work. Parts of the UI that is displayed in the videos have simply disappeared (the search providers, shown in the youtube video at the bottom of the dropped-down address bar).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my searches confirm only one thing: A ton of people are trying to make this change, and every time someone found a way Microsoft changed something so it no longer works.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't take a genius to look through what you are doing, and I for one can tell you this: I may have to continue using your products at work, but I will never ever voluntarily buy any product or conduct any business with you crooks ever again! What you
 are engaged in is not only immoral, it is ILLEGAL and you are very well aware of it, given a history of getting smacked down by the justice system for unfair competition practices.</p>

            <p>You must be talking about the search results tab. It used to be in my programs section and I followed the instructions to remove it. It worked once. Then I has some troubles with 8.1 and when I got them cleared up the annoying little boomer was back. This
 time without a source for removal. I no not mind having my choice of search engines handily appearing on one tab. HOWEVER; I do have a website and expect to have my options settings in place very time I open IE. I hope that MS gets back to you soon on this
 topic. I am really interested in the solution. I can't stand the popups and the Bing/search results add on erasing my settings every time I open or close the program.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I am not talking about any special tab for search results. When I search the results appear in the same, regular tab that was already active when I typed my search query into the address bar. But I am always taken to Bing, and while it has gotten better
 than before, it is still providing me with much less relevant search results than Google (more precisely, it may have found the same pages, but it does not rank results so that what I am looking for appears near the top of the list most of the time - something
 Google does a much better job at IMO).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I discovered something that leads me to believe Microsoft may not have quite as malignantly intended as I first thought. I still think the number of people having trouble getting rid of Bing is testament enough to show Microsoft is engaging in unfair
 business practices. Anyway, whether a fluke or something MS did on purpose, it turns out that switching search provider becomes possible once I had changed my language settings!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can modify your language preferences under&nbsp;Control Panel &gt; Clock, Language, and Region &gt; Language. (To get to control panel, press start, type "control panel", then select it from the results.) Make sure English (United States) is your most preferred
 language (top of the list). Once done, start IE in desktop mode (or use an already open instance),&nbsp;go to settings (a cogwheel in the upper right-hand corner), choose "Manage add-ons" from the dropdown menu. You get a dialog by the same title, in which you
 select "Search Providers" in the list over on the left. Then click the link in the lower left corner of the dialog "Find more search providers...". This opens up another browser window, and unlike when I did not prefer US English it offers normal search engines
 - the three first are Bing, Google, and Yahoo. (When I preferred Norwegian only speciality searches showed up here, e.g. real estate search from Finn.no, the largest marketplace for housing in Norway!) Select Google, then "Add to Internet Explorer".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all this, you should find yourself with two search providers, Bing and Google. The final step before you can remove Bing is to set Google as the default, after which the "remove" button will become enabled for Bing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still don't believe that this incredibly convoluted and difficult process is Microsoft's idea of creating a good user experience. They are not THAT bad at UX! But it shows they are willing to bully their own customers/users even at a time where it is becoming
 increasingly easier to switch platforms. </p>

<p>Hi Lynne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We can agree with Solar-Eclipse that the best option for you is Office 365 Home. One license covers 5 PCs or Macs. We still recommend to purchase it directly from the Microsoft Store. This is to make sure the authenticity of the license that you will purchase.
 You have the option to purchase it from our online store. Please check this <strong>
<a href="https://products.office.com/en/compare-all-microsoft-office-products?tab=1#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link.</a></strong> Another option is to contact our Answer Desk Team to have it processed for you and guide you with the activation. Here's
 the <strong><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/software/office/setup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to proceed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need clarifications, feel free to message us again.</p>

<br />All options for tracking changes on a shared workbook can be found on this page:
<br />
<br />However, if you need to do this retrospectively, that cannot be done, it needs to be setup prior to any changes being tracked . ..

            Hi Crystalfox,
<br />
<br />It looks like Slimware is potentially unwanted software, do you remember installing it?. Are you receiving pop-ups from online or on your computer specifically? If the latter, I recommend you uninstall it through Apps &amp; features or through a third-party uninstaller like Revo: <a href="https://www.revouninstaller.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.revouninstaller.com/</a>
<br />
<br />Let me know.
<br />

Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products).

            Hi Crystal.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Uninstall all Slimware in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features.
<br />
<br />Then Run a full scan with the most powerful on-demand free scanner Malwarebytes: 
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br /> 
<br />Clean up anything found, restart PC and then run again until it comes up clean.
<br />
<br />Check at C:\Program Files to see if any Slimware files still exist and delete them if so.

<h2>            Microsoft&#47;Bing Rewards are not increasing with searches</h2>
                    <p>I went to the Rewards Dashboard and it shows no increases to my points when I search.&nbsp; Both PC and Mobile.&nbsp; Even the daily extras, I click on them, but they act as if I did not perform the click.&nbsp; They remain in an unredeemed status.&nbsp; When I perform a PC
 search, I see an increase to the number next to the medallion, but when I click the medallion, it shows 0 for searches and resets the points back down to what it was before I started searching.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on News and perform searches, it seems to work correctly for a while and then resets as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using Edge and Google Chrome, but both show the same symptoms.</p>

<h2>            Why am I being sent to http&#58;&#47;&#47;us.yhs4.search.yahoo.com&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I've been trying to get on Tumblr today and it just keeps sending me there. If I click on the links, it just loads the same page. I'm very weary about this. Is it something like mypartner.24.domain (or something like that) I know that's like a virus or
 something like that. I've ran into a few times in the past. I have not downloaded anything recently nor changed any settings.&nbsp;
<div>I can get on other pages just fine except Bing, facebook, urban outfitters and tumblr, obviously. (and so far)</div>

<div>This is the link that I am sent to:</div>

<div>and now, no other links are showing up on the page above. By links I mean, it looks like what google would provide.</div>

<p><span>Go to
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>www.malwarebytes.org</span></span></a><span>
 and download, install, update and run the free version – just follow the prompts.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span>The prompt<span>&nbsp; </span>asks if you want to <em><span>Start&nbsp;trial</span></em> or
<em><span>Decline</span></em>.&nbsp; To get the free version (without real-time scanning or web site blocking features) you need to choose
<em><span>Decline.<span>&nbsp; </span>
</span></em><span>You may need to rename the installation file to 123.exe or something similar to prevent the malware from disabling/blocking the installation.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Or you might want to download the installation file to a flash drive or CD and then install Malwarebytes on the infected computer.</span></span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>SuperAntiSpyware
<span>&nbsp;</span>Portable is "designed" to be downloaded onto a flash drive (or CD) and you could then insert the drive into your computer and run it from there.&nbsp; If you do that you may need to scan the flash drive for malware after using it on the infected
 computer.&nbsp; Superantispyware is a very good scanner but will also identify and remove cookies which are not considered to be malware.</span></p>
