<p><span>Although the <strong>search results</strong> will be as you describe, the

<p>
</p><p><span>Depending on where you obtained your music files, they likely will include metadata such as album and artist name.&nbsp; If that's the case, you can do searches based on that metadata and move them back into appropriate folders.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the files are now all in a single folder, navigate to that folder in Windows Explorer, click the View menu and select Details.&nbsp; Then click "Select details" in the View menu and check the desired boxes.&nbsp; See below, where</span></p>

<p><span>Contributing artist = performer(s)</span></p>
<p><span>Album = album name</span></p>
<p><span># = track number</span></p>
<p><span>Title = name of piece (song name)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can, of course, then sort on any column by clicking in the column header, select a group of files, and copy them into whatever folder you desire.&nbsp; Use copy rather than move ... after you confirm that the files a</span>re where you want them, you

    <title>Surface Pro 4 Battery fraud - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bori&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Battery fraud</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought the I7 Surface Pro 4. However, the battery is terrible. The Surface will not last even 2 hours on a full charge with only light use, and not even playing music or videos. I actually also have the Surface on "Battery Saver" mode the whole
 time, and I can't still get 2 hours. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to a Microsoft store and was told that this was a "software issue" and that the battery would get better over time. That would be&nbsp;a first for a computer/tablet ever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My advice: stay away from the SP4 until the battery problems are seemingly resolved. Otherwise, you just bought a really slim desktop.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has advice on what to do, please let me know. I already use Battery Saver, and have turned on the hibernate mode, as listed in other websites from people with battery problems. Still no improvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            I am typing this on a SP4 i7 that I've been using on battery for the last 3 hours and still have 55% battery left.&nbsp; While this is less than the 8+ hours they talked about I'll take it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also I found that the i7 can EAT the battery very quickly if the
 GPU or CPU is at all highly utilized.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its dramatic how fast the i7 can burn down the battery when its being beat on.. that Iris 540 and the i7 Core are serious business.

            <p>Hi.&nbsp; Sorry that you're having issues with your battery.&nbsp; We all have to some degree, however, if you're only getting 2 hours of battery life, my questions would be how bright do you have your display, what Web browser are you using and what exactly are you
 doing on your SP4?&nbsp; If you're using Chrome, use Edge, as Chrome on all platforms tends to suck battery life, something that Google has acknowledged for some time, but has really done nothing about.&nbsp; If you aren't currently, I'd suggest setting your brightness
 to 50% or less on battery.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind, this device has a 38w power supply and in this particular form factor, you're really not going to get more than 5-6 hours of battery life in real world use.&nbsp; Yes, MS has advertised 8 hours, however, that's theoretical and not real world battery
 life.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do have your brightness lower that 50% and using Edge AND have installed the latest Windows updates, you may want to go back the MS Store and request an exchange.&nbsp; I hope that you get a resolution.&nbsp; I'm very happy with my SP4, even with some quirkiness
 and battery issues.&nbsp; Best device I own, hands down.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Thanks for writing. I &nbsp;rarely use Chrome. I mostly use Edge or Firefox. I have the tablet always set for "battery saver" mode and have lowered the brightness in it. I've only used it mainly for web browsing and email/document writing. Nothing like playing
 video games or video watching, which I guess would kill it in half hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is actually my 2nd SP4.The first one got about an hour and a half of battery. I troubleshooted with MS support, and they said that they couldn't find anything wrong with it, and adviced to try to get an exchange. I went to a Microsoft store and exchanged
 it. At first they hesitated, saying that the machine tested fine, to which I asked that if that was the case, why wasn't I getting anywhere near the battery use they advertise. They told me that the software of the battery "would improve over time", but then,
 offered to exchange it. I am using brightness at least than 50%, mostly using edge and installed all the updates. However, that hasn't fixed the problem, which leads me to conclude that (1) it's a poorly built device when it comes to this and that (2) they've
 engaged in deceptive practices with their advertised battery use. It's my first non-Apple purchase in years, and frankly, I regret the purchase. Never had any problem like this with Apple. I would be happy with the 5 hours of battery, but I can't get even
 half of that. If you have any other tips, they'd be welcome.</p>

            <p>I bought the Pro 4 Last week ( Monday 7th of December); I called them and I return it back today. (They were extremely Helpful). The battery was Not lasting more than 1.30 minutes... after I have fully charged it and re-charged it a couple of times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I had a new one.. ( I really like it so I hope.).. I&nbsp; do Not know hoe long the battery will last.. but WHAT I know is that when the battery is very low.... and I put the charger in.....and I keep working ... is not charging at all..... remains
 low.... Like if all the power is consumed by the current use...</p>
<p>

            <p>Rather than sue ( which would provide lawyers with the money ) Microsoft should provide every NFL team with Surface Pro 4's</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) the batteries would run out before the end of the game</p>
<p>2) the coaches and players would be slamming the tablets to the ground in rage during the 3rd and 4th quarter</p>
<p>3) the whole world would see that the battery life is half of what Microsoft claimed</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I wish Microsoft would provide an external battery pack/case as Apple has done with the iPhone 6</p>

            <p>I have an SP4 I7 512gb and I use it most every day on battery for mostly browsing and email.&nbsp; I keep it at 40% brightness with Battery Saver enabled and typically get about 6 hours on the battery.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting 2 or less hours of battery life is very atypical.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is only an educated guess but since you have experienced this problem on 2 different SP4s, perhaps u have installed an application which is loading into the background and is eating up the
 battery.&nbsp; I recommend periodically checking Task Manager for apps that are using excessive cpu.&nbsp; Under normal circumstances total cpu usage should be under 10% with only occasional bursts of higher cpu usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you can get this sorted out.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

    <title>Computer shuts off at random instances during startup - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Computer shuts off at random instances during startup</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've bought a laptop about 3 years ago, and 1 year ago it started having problems until it completely failed. It started to shut off randomly and eventually didn't even boot anymore. I recently gave it another attempt and tried to replace the hard drive
 with a new SSD. I also installed 4GB new ram (8GB now). To my surprise, it suddenly worked again. However, now I'm having new problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer now sometimes suddenly restarts, giving me the Following Event:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Event 41 Kernel-Power</p>

<p>
</p><p>What most often happens is that when I start up the computer it SOMETIMES automatically restarts right after booting windows. It's always at the point where the windows logo has appeared and where windows has seemingly loaded, right before the user name
 and password box normally appears. Then the next boot often works but usually (but not always) takes much longer than normal (my new SSD usually takes 3 seconds between showing the windows logo and showing the user name and password box, but when it automatically
 restarts after such a boot failure it takes about 30 seconds).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've downloaded Speccy and seen that the CPU usually is between 55 and 65 degrees celcius with normal use. I ran Intel processor diagnostic tool which shows no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However the weird thing is this:</p>
<p>I've had the laptop with SSD installed now for 4 days, and every single day, it did this the first time I booted the laptop in the morning when it seems to me to be at its coolest which is the opposite of what I'd expect. But I've restarted and shut down
 and booted the laptop numerous times during these days without a problem. </p>
<p>I've also played crysis 2 on it just to test. it then moves to 93-98 degrees celcius, and it shut off once while doing this. It has also done so at least once while it was on, but this definately happens less frequently than during booting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two questions:</p>
<p>1. The obvious: I've looked online at what this problem could be and how to solve it, and although the possibility of overheating being the cause is suggested by the crysis-shutdown, it is not supported by the fact that it also hapens first boot in the morning.
<strong>So what could the cause be, and how do I solve it?&nbsp;</strong>I've considered the possibility of power supply not being sufficient, but it would seem to me that if this were the case, it would shutdown more frequently and more immediately after starting
 crysis (rather than 10 minutes into the game), but I don't know much about this.</p>
<p>2. If it cannot be solved completely: How can I makethe problem manageable? I don't want to play games on it (crysis was just to test), I just want to have a reliable laptop for word, excel, photoshop and internet and such, that doesn't fail on me right
 before a college deadline. <strong>Is it safe for my laptop to keep this problem unsolved and simply live with the fact that bootup effectively takes longer? or will this progressively destroy my computer/SSD/CPU making it fail after a while, if kept unsolved?</strong></p>
<p>A lot of thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Some additional info:</strong></p>
<p>I have my power supply maximum cpu setting set to max 75%.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry for taking a while to respond, I waited with responding until having taken your advice.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No I don't get any error messages at all, except of course the events "event 41" in the event viewer. I have change the restart setting like you said. at first I got an error message that I should increase the size of the page file (which was between 100
 and 1024 MB at first I think), so I changed it to between 500 and 1024. after this it no longer gave an error message. However, after doing this it restarted twice again (I confirmed this by checking the event viewer again), without showing the BSOD; it simply
 restarted again. <strong>Is there a place where I can find the error log where the error that is supposed to show up on the BSOD is stored? Is the event shown in the BSOD different from the one in the Eventviewer?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here an image to show that I have indeed unchecked the box for automatically restart:</p>

<p>
</p><p>It often happens at startup, and always after the windows logo appeared and before the user login box appears, but no, it ALSO happens just when its turned on. It happened once while I was playing crysis (to test the laptop), but it has also happened during
 normal use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think that I am correct in assessing that the primary problem can not be overheating, because if this were the case, it wouldn't shut down during startup first thing in the morning? it seems to me that at this point it is relatively cooled down.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have done as you have said. But disabling automatic restart did not bring me to the BSOD (It's not that the BSOD goes away; through this entire process I haven't seen the BSOD even once). Could you give advice on how I can grab more information about the
 cause of the error? Is it possible that I somehow disabled the BSOD?</p>
<p>About the second article: my scenaria indeed corresponds to scenario 3. I went through the 5 bullet points that are listed in the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Overclocking</strong>: <em>This cannot be the problem, because I have never overclocked.</em></li><li><strong>Check the memory</strong>: <em>I have verified the memory using Speccy. the memories are both Samsung PC310600 memories and if both run JEDEC 3 (which they seem to do according to Speccy), then their timings and voltages are identical.</em></li><li><strong>Power supply</strong>: <em>I don't know how to check the power supply. is there software for this? Besides, I have only added a Ram and switched from HDD to SSD. apart from that the laptop is the same as it was designed. the switch to SSD should
 about cancel out the increased watt usaged due to the added RAM, shouldn't it? And it shouldn't have a big effect anyway, right?
</em><strong><em>Is there a piece of software to troubleshoot this? Or can I otherwise find out if this is the cause?</em></strong></li><li><strong>Overheating</strong>: <em>I have checked using Speccy that during Crysis the CPU moves to 98 degrees celcius approx. this could explain the shutoff during crysis gameplay, but it shouldn't be able to explain it during startup, should it?</em></li><li><strong>Defaults</strong>:<em> I have tried the following thing: I have reset the computer to the point where I just installed windows and done windows updates. I get the impression that indeed after doing this, I get less problems than when I have all
 sorts of programs installed, but it nevertheless still shut off during startup.</em></li></ol>
<p>I hope that I have provided usefull information, and if you need additional information, I'd be very willing to give it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for helping me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I just recalled that I forgot to mention something that may be important: after installing windows 7 on my new SSD, it didn't have the drivers yet, so I used DRP (Driverpack solutions) to install the drivers on my computer. I didn't accept to install
 any programs.</p>

</p><p><span>Thank you for your reply, appreciate the time taken by you in keeping us updated on the status of the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You are absolutely right on the point that problem cannot be overheating considering the fact that issue occurs even at the first startup in the morning and just
 after the computer logo. However, this problem also appears due to faulty (broken) CPU fan causing overheating.
</span></p>
<p><span>However, before we come to that conclusion, let’s check on every possible aspect on the problem related to Windows.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let’s start the computer in safe mode and check if the issue persists there as well.</p>

<h2>            FortiGate&#47;FortiClient Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro 3 purchased in March of this year.&nbsp; I have a client that just switched to FortiGate vpn.&nbsp; On my laptop (Windows 7), I had to install FortiClient (version 5.2.3.0633) to access the VPN.&nbsp; It works fine.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I assume that any program I load on my laptop is safe to load on my Surface Pro 3?&nbsp; I read some posts from some time back that loading Junos Pulse on a Surface caused major issues with the touch interface (it was an old post, but it makes me nervous).&nbsp;
 When my client was using Junos I didn't have to load any client, the vpn just worked.&nbsp; I guess because Junos Pulse settings were pre-loaded on the Surface.

<div>&gt;&gt;I have a Surface Pro 3 purchased in March of this year.&nbsp; I have a client that just switched to FortiGate vpn.&nbsp; On my laptop (Windows 7), I had to install FortiClient (version 5.2.3.0633) to access the VPN.&nbsp; It works fine.&nbsp; </div>

<div>&gt;&gt;Can I assume that any program I load on my laptop is safe to load on my Surface Pro 3?&nbsp; I read some posts from some time back that loading Junos Pulse on a Surface caused major issues with the touch interface (it was an old post, but it makes me nervous).&nbsp; When my client was using Junos I didn't have to load any client, the vpn just worked.&nbsp; I guess because Junos Pulse settings were pre-loaded on the Surface. </div>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the link.&nbsp; I had actually already read that post, but it was with respect to SSL.&nbsp; The VPN my client uses is IPSec, so I wasn't sure if that post really applied to me.&nbsp; Sorry, I forgot to mention the distinction before.&nbsp; Honestly I don't even
 know if the distinction matters (as I am not a VPN expert), but I'm rather protective of my Surface, so I didn't want to take any chances.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went ahead and called Fortinet directly via the link provided by Barb (I had not seen the phone number before, thank you).&nbsp; They said that Forticlient is safe to install on Surface Pro 3.&nbsp; I installed it with no issues and am now up and running on vpn.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this clarification helps others with the same question.</p>

            <p>You can right click a thumbnail or filename or a selected<br />
(highlighted) group and choose...Copy...from the menu.<br />
<br />
Then right click the folder you wish to copy the photos to<br />
and choose...Paste.<br />
<br />
Another method would be to create a shortcut to the folder<br />
you want the photos saved in and drag the shortcut to the<br />
'Send To' folder. Then you could right click files and from<br />
the menu choose Send To and choose your shortcut. The<br />

<p>1. Call of Duty 4, Waw, Modern Warfare 2 may be out of date, But Counter Strike Source was released back in 04. &nbsp;I get a steam update for it every other week. &nbsp;T and IW can still update their games, there is no excuse not to. &nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Covert, You need to get out and get some sun shine or some Jap food. &nbsp;Your crappy attitude on the forums are really annoying.</p>
<p>3. The guy that said OMA/Quick Scoping is a exploit, I wish everybody realized that they are.</p>

<h2>            IN NEED OF HELP&#33;&#33;&#33;  Windows Vista backup failed with unkown error and odd Microsoft Security Defender pop ups&#33;</h2>

                    <span>I attempted to make a backup on my Acer. It failed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It also failed when I tried to make one on a 250 gb external memory drive.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Upon failure, I received the message ‘Access is Denied 0x8007005’.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Besides this, Microsoft Security Defender pops up saying Trojan: JS/Hiloti.C<span>&nbsp;
</span>has been detected.<span>&nbsp; </span>I then go on to remove the Trojan, reboot, and then run a variety of security programs afterwards to ensure it’s gone.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I then try to make another backup but it fails with the same error message and Microsoft claims that Trojan has been detected again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Does anyone know what any of this means? Any ideas on how to fix this?<span>&nbsp;
</span>All I wanted to do was to create a computer backup.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Thanks to all that help!!</span>

<p>Yep, it's a known problem and has been affecting quite a few consoles. You can get in touch with Microsoft and ask for a replacement, although the replacement I got had the same problem... :(</p>

    <title>Minecraft Window 10 Edition Keeps Crashing on World Generation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zcintron  say:</h3>
<h2>            Minecraft Window 10 Edition Keeps Crashing on World Generation</h2>
                    I have recently downloaded Minecraft Windows 10 Edition on my PC and it keeps crashing after trying to generate a world. I have tried the majority of the trouble shooting options, restarting, and re-installing the game multiple times. All my drivers and
 apps are up to date and I cannot seem to figure out why this version of Minecraft will not run. I have even tried using a different account and the same issue occurs every time. The Java version works fine but not the Windows 10 Edition that allows me to play
 across multiple platforms. I hope someone can help resolve this issue.

<p>Hi ZCintron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming to the forums. I'd be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I recommend looking over this troubleshooting article for when games are not responding or crashing on Window 10 that goes over some things you may have tried already but also there may be something you haven't tried yet:
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/troubleshooting/game-freezes-stops-responding-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/troubleshooting/game-freezes-stops-responding-windows-10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If that article does not help with the issue then I recommend restarting your computer with a clean boot to make sure there isn't any other programs interfering with the launching of a world:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hey thety Xia!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the difficulty you've experienced as of yet. </p>
<p>This cross-play feature for Minecraft across all devices is relatively new anc can be complicated sometimes.
</p>
<p>I found this great article that outlines a lot of information on how to make sure that everything syncs up correctly here at
<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/minecraft-cross-play-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to use Minecraft cross-play on Xbox One and Nintendo Switch</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if I'm reading correctly, you're saying that you're trying to load up a World that you had started on the Switch. When you login to the same account you used on that console through the Xbox, it's missing your changes?</p>

<p>Hey thety Xia!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the difficulty you've experienced as of yet. </p>
<p>This cross-play feature for Minecraft across all devices is relatively new anc can be complicated sometimes.
</p>
<p>I found this great article that outlines a lot of information on how to make sure that everything syncs up correctly here at
<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/minecraft-cross-play-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to use Minecraft cross-play on Xbox One and Nintendo Switch</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if I'm reading correctly, you're saying that you're trying to load up a World that you had started on the Switch. When you login to the same account you used on that console through the Xbox, it's missing your changes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the case, then I would suggest to try removing and redownloading your profile following the steps here on

<h2>            Pen and Touch Settings</h2>
                    I'm trying to turn off the press and hold right click setting because I can't draw with it on and that annoying circle popping up every time I hold down my pen, but I can't find my Pen and Touch settings. It isn't in my control panel, and nothing comes
 up when I search for it. I turned everything off in the Pen &amp; Windows Ink settings but the circle is still showing up. Where can I find this setting so I can turn it off?

            The Control Panel is being gradually merged into Settings where you can find most of the controls now.   Open Start, choose Settings (gear icon), then Devices, then Pen and Windows Ink.   Do you find the disable toggle switch there which should appear on touch devices?  

I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

            I found the Press and Hold setting there and have it disabled, but the circle is still showing up and canceling my brush strokes- disabling that setting didn't seem to do anything. I have everything in Pen and Windows Ink disabled right now.

            1) Set a System Restore Point:   http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943

2) Turn the feature off in Group Policy on Pro Version, or Registry on Home version:  http://www.thewindowsclub.com/disable-windows-ink-workspace

Remember that editing the Registry must be done precisely.   System Restore is your safety net, both from within WIndows and the Advanced Startup Options including if necessary booting installation or repair media.  

I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

            OK, go to Control Panel 
Set view by option to Large icons
Click Pen and Touch

The Pen and Touch dialog box will open. 
Select either Pen Options tab or Touch tab. 
Once the Press and hold option is highlighted in the list, click Settings.

Pen Options – Select this tab if you want to enable or disable “press and hold for right-clicking” on your touch pen.

Touch – You can also use your finger to press and hold on a touch screen. Choose this tab if you want to turn on or off right-click for a finger press and hold.

In the Press and Hold Settings window, check or uncheck the “Enable press and hold for right-clicking” option, and click OK.
