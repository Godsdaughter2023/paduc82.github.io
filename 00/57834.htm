    <title>Restore from WindowsImageBackup - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Restore from WindowsImageBackup</h2>
                    <p>I've read the Windows Help article on restoring files from a backup, but it does not seem to apply to my situation. I recently rebuilt my computer in order to increase the size of my SSD and change where user profiles were stored. That process seemed to
 go well, and I was able to move ProgramData and Users to my D: drive, while keeping the system and Program Files directories on the SSD (C:). I'm running Windows 7 Professional 64-bit, both on the original computer and the newly rebuilt one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before tearing down the old computer, I backed up all my documents, and created a WindowsImageBackup of the previous SSD (C:) and hard drives (D:). I'm fine concerning documents, but I'd like to recover such files as Personal.xlsb that contains my Excel
 macros. It was under the Appdata folder in my profile and was not considered to be a document. The image backup is on an external hard drive N:\WindowsImageBackup\Haydn (Haydn is my computer name) and there are three folders: Backup 2014-05-13 005636, Catalog,
 SPPMetadataCache, and one file named MediaId.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read in other posts that the backup has to be in the root of the drive it's being restored from, so I tried moving the Haydn folder to the root, I've tried having the WindowsImageBackup folder in the root, and even the three folders and MediaId file
 in the root. Regardless of what I try, the Restore app tells me it was not able to find any backup sets. It looks like restore only works if restoring to the original computer with the original installation of Windows, which is of really limited use. Is there
 some magic word I'm supposed to utter to get restore to deal with the backup from my original computer?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Microphone too quiet even on max volume - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Microphone too quiet even on max volume</h2>
                    Recently I upgraded to windows 10 and my mic just became extremely quiet. The mic did for a little bit while I had windows 10, but after a week or so while I was talking over Skype everyone told me they could barely hear me anymore and I tried Skype sound
 service and my mic was super quiet. (I'm using the built in mic on my laptop), and I have no idea what's the cause of this problem, I've tried reinstalling my sound cards and updating them as well as using a different mic. No matter what I try the mic is way
 too quiet, the only way anyone can hear me is if I talk with the mic practically in my mouth! It's been a terrible issue please help!

    <title>Windows 10 Upgrade Dell XPS L702X - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pandora8  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade Dell XPS L702X</h2>
                    <p>On my Dell XPS 17 (L702X) I have a Synaptics PS/2 Port TouchPad. Since the Windows 10 Upgrade (From Windows 7 Home Premium) I cannot&nbsp; two finger scroll. I have checked the driver, thru the windows 10 settings menu, and it says I have the best driver for
 my machine. I see from this post that others are able to scroll, albeit with problems. Can someone give me some clues as to what to do next? This is a deal breaker for me.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>No Dell has not tested this model. Why can some folks scroll and others can't on this same machine? If there is a fix why not make it easy to find?</p>
<p>I'm more than beyond frustrated with this Windows 10 conversion and may well go back to Windows 7. I work with an Intuous &nbsp;Tablet, ACDsee, and PSCC2015 and I have done nothing but problem solve for 1 full week. I need to get back to working.</p>

<h2>            Saving photos from Photos to Pictures in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>When I take a photo on my iPhone, the photo is automatically added to the Photos app on my PC - Windows 10.</p>
<p>But, when I save the same photo to the Pictures file/program, a duplicate copy is made in the Photos app.</p>
<p>Is there a way to stop a duplicate copy from being made ?&nbsp; I have tried right clicking the photo, clicking Copy,</p>

            Hi William
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience caused.
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Autoplay
<br />
<br />There you should see a list box for the Apple iPhone
<br />Click in that list box and choose the option 'Take not action'
<br />
<br />In future, when you connect your iPhone, you can manually choose to import your photos or copy directly from the iPhone to the Pictures folder.
<br />

    <title>WMP Does NOT recognize m4a As Music - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dakoch  say:</h3>
<h2>            WMP Does NOT recognize m4a As Music</h2>
                    I just performed a Windows 7 Clean install. Trying to play Apple Lossless in m4a. WMP did NOT play out of the box, though aac did.<br />
<br />
Finally got&nbsp;ALAC playing&nbsp;by adding in a secondhand&nbsp;Quicktime/WMP filter. But now&nbsp;all my w4a files show up in "Other Media" in WMP.... not under "Music". So some of my music (mp3's) are in the music folder, with all the correct info tags and album art... and
 the majority of my music (m4a's) are in "Other Media", not able to be added to playlists. While WMP recognizes the tags, it does not show them like in "Music".<br />
<br />
I found what I hoped would be a work around. When an m4a is re-named to be an Mp4, it shows up correctly (that is, under "Music"). However, WMP will NOT play a file with the extension mp4. SO I know that the m4a will show up in "Music" with an extension change,
 the tags will show up (including album art), all the way it should, it just won't play. Change back to m4a, it plays fine, but&nbsp;it gets moved back to&nbsp;the wrong place ("Other Media"), and all the Music formatting dissapears.<br />
<br />
<br />
How can I get WMP to add m4a to the Music area instead of Other Media? Or how can I add a media type to WMP so it treats an m4a like a mp3 or mp4?<br />
<br />
Thanks!

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The .m4a extension is not a supported file type of Windows Media Player. You may however user your favorite search engine to search for a solution that may convert the file to a Windows Media Player supported file type.</p>

            <div>Hi Harshavardhan,</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry but your reply was not at all helpful as in the support community link you have provide, &nbsp;point Q12: clearly shows that the issue I am raising exist in Windows 10. i.e.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>1. Windows DVD Player App does not support Blu-ray discs</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>2. The existing app that plays Blu-ray movies has stopped working after the Windows 10 upgrade.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Q: Does the app play Blu-ray discs?<br />
A: No, it plays DVD movies. If you already have an app that plays Blu-ray movies, it will continue to work on Windows 10.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please urgently help with a fix.</p>
<div><br />
Regards,<br />
Pratik Bose</div>

            This has happened to me as well on my Surface.&nbsp; I fixed it by simply plugging the surface into the charger for a few seconds.&nbsp; Another time I physically disconnected and then reconnected the keyboard to the Surface.&nbsp; Kind of like re-booting, I guess.&nbsp;
 Hope this helps.

            <p>Yes, that's what I do now.&nbsp; My new keyboard is better but the problem still happens from time to time.&nbsp; I simply detach it and reattach it.&nbsp; And make sure the screen is fairly upright.&nbsp; If I have it on my lap and it shifts then I run into this problem more.&nbsp;
 Definitely exchange the keyboard if it keeps happening.</p>

            If you want a blank canvas, open the Surface top bar and click Clear.&nbsp; If you want to clear just part of the page after it is dried, you can use the Undo button on the little selection of tools on the bottom, if it is the last thing you painted.&nbsp; Otherwise,
 you will have to just paint over it.

    <title>Windows 10 Update 1511 Fails After Nearly Completing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> happymommy77  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update 1511 Fails After Nearly Completing</h2>
                    <p>I noticed the 1511 update in my Windows Update settings yesterday. After spending over 12 hours downloading it, it finally began it's install this morning.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything looked like it was going perfectly until it reached about 95% complete overall (reflected on the black screen with the percentage in the large blue circle in the center). At the bottom, it stated it was at 82% on the last step, configuring settings.&nbsp;It&nbsp;sat
 there for around 30-45 minutes with no change however. Finally, without doing anything myself, it stopped itself, rebooted and the screen changed to say "Restoring your previous version of Windows..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read something that said this was likely due to an SD card being inserted during the installation however, this was not the case for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a side note, yesterday morning I began having multiple issues with my laptop as well, primarily with the hard drive showing it was at 100% usage whenever I'd attempt to launch something or, when I attempted to search for something. Occasionally, when
 this happens, it pops up a window that said Microsoft Windows wasn't responding and I could end the task. This began after an application I was in the middle of using had a script crash and it hasn't recovered since. I had hoped maybe this update would resolve
 whatever was going on but obviously, as it failed, that's not going to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP Envy m6 n010dx&nbsp;laptop on which I did a clean (delete and recreate partition) install of Windows 10 a few months ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help on, ultimately, either of these issues, I'd greatly appreciate it! I really don't want to have to do a repair install but if it's necessary I'll go there. Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I gave in and decided to try to install Windows 10 over itself. Told it to keep my files and apps but (ugh) just start me over again. I probably should've guessed but... the install has been stuck at the EXACT SAME spot (95% overall, 82% configuring
 settings) for about 30-45 minutes again. This can't be coincidence right? There's gotta be something it's getting hung up on that I can fix without wiping this machine right? Or... is the answer to go back to 8.1?</p>

            Akheel Ahmed P - - why do you and your colleagues keep pointing people to that response?&nbsp; it is about a 44% stuck level, and SPECIFICALLY asks people who are stuck at other levels to post a NEW thread.
<p>My PC is stuck at 83% also, and I have had no useful responses to my question, the best being to do a fresh install losing my settings and files.&nbsp;

Update stuck at 83% and settings 32%</a></p>
Surely there must be a way of finding out what it is <br />

    <title>Windows 10 shuts down after going into sleep mode - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 shuts down after going into sleep mode</h2>
                    Following the most recent Windows 10 update, my computer shuts down after going into sleep mode. I have tried turning off fast startup in power options. This appeared at first blush to fix the problem, but in reality, when I tried to wake the computer
 from what I thought was sleep mode, it shut down. I then had to turn on the computer and go thru a total reboot. Any current thoughts on this problem would be appreciated. Something closer to December 2017 rather than 2016 solutions. Thanks.

<p>Thank you Katrina, my system responded correctly in Safe Mode. Since I have no knowledge of what drivers were turned off in Safe Mode, can you suggest a systematic way I can isolate the offending drivers? Thank you for responding.</p>

<p>Thank you once again for responding. I currently am working around the problem by not letting the computer go to sleep. I changed the settings to "never" and that seems to do the trick. I don't know what the downside is of doing it like that, but it seems
 to work. The display turns off and when I want to use the computer, I just move the mouse and that wakes up the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, you mentioned laptop, but this is my desktop computer, a Dell Studio XPS 9100.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you and Merry Christmas!</p>

<p><span>Katrina,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have had the exact same problem with the exact same computer: a Dell XPS 9100 desktop. It started after a Windows 10 update on 12/20/17. The computer turns off instead of sleeping when it reaches
 the time for sleep based on the Power and Sleep settings. If I manually put it to sleep using the button in the Start menu, it will go into sleep mode, but when I try to wake it up by clicking the mouse it then turns itself off.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I tried starting in Safe Mode as you suggested to the other person, but couldn’t find a sleep option to test.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My solution has been to set Sleep to “Never”, which prevents it from shutting down, but I don’t like having to keep it constantly powered up.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it helps, the updates on 12/20/17 are KB4058043, KB4054517, and KB4053577.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your help.</span></p>

<h2>            Camera won&#39;t stop rotating</h2>
                    In some games the camera keeps rotating the view to the left. If I move the mouse to the right I can get the scene to stabilize temporarily and then it begins to spin again. I don't see any setting or adjustments. The games in question are Batman Arkham
 Assylam and FUEL.

    <title>Trade in Xbox 360 games for Xbox One versions - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Trade in Xbox 360 games for Xbox One versions</h2>
                    
<p>Does Xbox currently have a deal where users can trade in 360 games for the One version of the same games?
<br />
<br />
For example: Battlefield 4 - 360 version trade in for Battlefield 4 - Xbox One version. If they do not have one in place already,<br />
I believe XBox should give users a fair deal so that they may upgrade games for a reasonable and fair price. I for example have<br />
had GTA 5, Battlefield 4 and Assassins Creed Black Flag since the release dates and would very much appreciate a fair deal so<br />
that I may upgrade to the XBox One system. I however do not want to purchase a game I technically already own, and do not<br />
wish to sell the games I intend to trade, because I would get next to nothing. As a Xbox user since the first generation Xbox I feelit would be a fair and reasonable deal; as the games are not really new, they are just re-done for the next generation.
<br />
(GTA will offer more traffic, wildlife, and eventually a first person mode etc. - Battlefield 4 increases player capacity and new guns etc.)</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p>
<p>- ZakkWyld333</p>

<p>lol you know as much as I do, anyone else have actual input ? </p>
<p>I have heard it depends on the store you go to, and that xbox has some sort of deal that if you bought the 360 version in october - december and have a receipt you can upgrade. But that would be unfair to people who have owned the game since its release.</p>

<p>The deals are usually from the Publishers themselves and not Microsoft. So you'd have to check the games' websites for specific details. The deals are usually limited time and would only be available either if the game was purchased digitally or if they
 did make a deal with some retailers. Some deals will allow you to get the upgraded version for free and others will just give you a discount.</p>

<p>From what I've seen, not every developer is allowing gamers to download the Xbox One version if you purchase it digitally on the 360. I know COD: AW is doing it, but I doubt it'll be for too long, so get on it as soon as ya can.

            <p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be due to incompatibility issue with devices in Windows 7. I would suggest you to try the methods as below and check the status.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter by clicking the <span><strong>Start</strong></span> button
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%25207%2fmain%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33_818.jpg" />, and then clicking
<strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong>. In the search box, type <span><strong>troubleshooter</strong></span>, and then click
<span><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></span>. Under <strong><span>Hardware and Sound</span></strong>, click
<strong><span>Configure a device</span>.</strong></span>‌ <span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%25207%2fmain%2f18abb370-ac1e-4b6b-b663-e028a75bf05b_48.jpg" />&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation,
 type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2: </strong>Update the driver in Device Manager</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Open Device Manager by clicking the <span><strong>Start</strong></span> button
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%25207%2fmain%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33_818.jpg" />, clicking
<strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong>, clicking <strong><span>System and Security</span></strong>, and then, under
<span>System</span>, clicking <strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong>.</span>‌
<span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%25207%2fmain%2f18abb370-ac1e-4b6b-b663-e028a75bf05b_48.jpg" />&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span>
</p>
<p><span>Expand Keyboard and&nbsp;Mouse and other pointing devices tabs</span></p>
<p><span>Select the current driver and right click on it</span></p>
<p><span>Click Update driver software</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 3:</strong> If the issue still remains, Visit the computer manufacturer's support website and install the latest drivers software for Windows 7 for the same computer model.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may also refer to: </span><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly#update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update a driver for hardware
 that isn't working properly</a></strong></p>

            <p>Minty White has a zip file to load HoldEM to Windows 7.&nbsp; I know it works for Vista.</p>
<p>I DO NOT KNOW IF IT IS SAFE.</p>
<p>I would not do it if you use PC for banking or anything sensative/important.</p>
<p>Make sure you create a restore point first, though not sure that woud solve any issues as it installs using DOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be nice if microsoft just offered the game to everyone.&nbsp; </p>

 in the General tab and check the checkbox next to&nbsp;</span><em>"Unblock" -</em><span>&nbsp;this
 should mark the file as safe and let you install it. Click&nbsp;</span><em>"Apply"</em><span>&nbsp;to
 save the changes and try to launch the installation file again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If this is not working then please try to install the application from CMD :-</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>1. Click on start menu, search for cmd, right click on it and run it as an Administrator.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2.&nbsp;</span><span>Locate the file
 you want to install and go to its Properties (right-click the file and select&nbsp;</span><em>"Properties"</em><span>&nbsp;from
 the contextual menu). Then, enter its location in Command Prompt and type the exact file name.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For example, it would be&nbsp;</span><em>"<strong>C:\Users\test\Downloads\wlsetup-all.exe</strong>"</em><span>.

<p>From looking at the WARNING.</p>
<p>Is this a Company Computer / your parents computer or your Personal Computer ???</p>
<p>It seems to me that you are not the Administrator of this computer and therefore are locked out from installing said program which requires Administrators rights and User Account Control settings to be set up correctly.</p>
<p>Also, is this a McAfee Virtual Technician program that you are trying to install ?<br />

<div>&nbsp;You will be notified before programs make changes to your computer or to Windows settings that require the permissions of an administrator.</div>

<div>When you're notified, your desktop will be dimmed, and you must either approve or deny the request in the UAC dialog box before you can do anything else on your computer. The dimming of your desktop is referred to as the secure desktop because other programs
 can't run while it's dimmed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;This is the most secure setting.</div>

<div>&nbsp;It's usually safe to allow changes to be made to Windows settings without you being notified. However, certain programs that come with Windows can have commands or data passed to them, and malicious software can take advantage of this by using these programs
 to install files or change settings on your computer. You should always be careful about which programs you allow to run on your computer.</div>

<div>You will be notified if a program outside of Windows tries to make changes to a Windows setting.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;This setting is the same as "Notify only when programs try to make changes to my computer," but you are not notified on the secure desktop.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Because the UAC dialog box isn't on the secure desktop with this setting, other programs might be able to interfere with the dialog's visual appearance. This is a small security risk if you already have a malicious program running on your computer.</div>

<div><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Never notify</strong></span></div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;You will not be notified before any changes are made to your computer. If you are logged on as an administrator, programs can make changes to your computer without you knowing about it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you are logged on as a standard user, any changes that require the permissions of an administrator will automatically be denied.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you select this setting, you will need to restart the computer to complete the process of turning off UAC. Once UAC is off, people that log on as administrator will always have the permissions of an administrator.</div>

<h2>            Is it possible for Windows Media Player&#40;WMP&#41; to play a particular mp3 file from a folder in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a music folder which contains 50 mp3 songs. I would like WMPlayer (ver 12.xxx) to play one mp3 song each day at a scheduled time without repeating the previous song. Is it possible to schedule or program in Windows 7 to do the required job in any
 particular way?<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can schedule a Task using <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/schedule-task#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Task Scheduler </a>and prompt it to play music a desired time. You can follow the steps given below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Open your Task Scheduler and choose&nbsp;<strong>Create Basic Task.</strong></p>
<p>b) Give the task a name and description and push <strong>Next</strong></p>
<p>c) For Trigger choose the option that suits your needs&nbsp;For example&nbsp;Daily at 8:00 AM.
</p>
<p>d) For action choose <strong>"Start</strong> <strong>a Program</strong><strong>"</strong> and choose your MP3 file you want to play.</p>
<p>e) <strong>Finish</strong> the task.</p>
<p>Test it by running it manually.</p>
<p>I recommend you to set Windows Media Player as your default media player to enable it to open.

            <p>1&nbsp; Something close to what you want is possible but, without some serious programming effort, you cannot get precisely what you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>2&nbsp; With a single Task&nbsp;scheduler task, the same song would be used every time.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>3&nbsp; If you started a playlist of all 50 of your tracks instead of setting up a task to play a single song, it would play all the songs in the playlist from the first one onwards every time so that would not solve things.&nbsp;
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>4&nbsp; But if you were prepared to make sure that WMP's random setting was set up beforehand, then a playlist of all 50 of your tracks would achieve something close to the result you desire in that it would start with a different track each time.&nbsp; But WMP would
 keep playing tracks until you told it to stop - it would not just play a single track.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5&nbsp; To achieve everything you want, you'd have to write a batch file, vbs, vba or Powershell solution then use TS to run&nbsp;a playlist containing a single track&nbsp;at the desired time.&nbsp; Given the awkward data structure within playlists, I do not think a batch file
 solution could be used for this.&nbsp; The [possibly batch file,] vbs, vba or Powershell solution would need to substitute the name of the track in the playlist each day with a different tracks name.&nbsp; This would need a lot of work to design, write &amp; test.</p>

<h2>            Do I need to Activate my Windows 7 after re-installing</h2>
                    hi Andre... I have a laptop (with windows 7 home basic 64-bit pre installed), its hard drive crashed and thus I don't have any recovery partition anymore, also the laptop is out of warranty. I've read your post about downloading those ISO and use that
 eicfg removal utility. Can you please tell me using those iso and after installing windows 7 home basic in my laptop in new hard drive using the key I have (in sticker below my laptop) it will work and is it already activated or I need to do something for
 activation.&nbsp;
<div>Also can I use X17-58997.iso with SP1 (of-course after treating it with eicfg utility) with my same license key, instead?</div>
                </div>

            <p>You will likely have to activate it after creating the all in one disc. </p>
<p>Download one of the existing .isos (of your language) from
<a href="http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/software-os/w/microsoft_os/3316.2-1-microsoft-windows-7-official-iso-download-links-digital-river.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. Download either the 32 bit or 64 .iso depending on what bit of Windows you want.</p>
<p>Install&nbsp;<a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">7zip</a>&nbsp;(using the 32 bit or 64 bit .msi depending on your OS).</p>
<p>Extract the contents of the .iso with 7zip. This is your extracted Windows installation files.</p>
<p>The extracted contents should look like this. Go to the sources folder.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.community.dell.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-wikis-components-files/00-00-00-00-18/5282.1.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fen.community.dell.com%2fresized-image.ashx%2f__size%2f550x0%2f__key%2fcommunityserver-wikis-components-files%2f00-00-00-00-18%2f5282.1.PNG" /></a></p>
<p>Scroll through the folder until you find ei.cfg right click this file and delete it</p>
<p><a href="http://en.community.dell.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-wikis-components-files/00-00-00-00-18/0285.4.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fen.community.dell.com%2fresized-image.ashx%2f__size%2f550x0%2f__key%2fcommunityserver-wikis-components-files%2f00-00-00-00-18%2f0285.4.png" /></a></p>
<p>When you install you will get this for 32 bit</p>
<p><a href="http://en.community.dell.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-wikis-components-files/00-00-00-00-18/7026.32-bit.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fen.community.dell.com%2fresized-image.ashx%2f__size%2f550x0%2f__key%2fcommunityserver-wikis-components-files%2f00-00-00-00-18%2f7026.32-bit.PNG" /></a></p>
<p>or this for 64 bit.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.community.dell.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-wikis-components-files/00-00-00-00-18/3247.64-bit.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fen.community.dell.com%2fresized-image.ashx%2f__size%2f550x0%2f__key%2fcommunityserver-wikis-components-files%2f00-00-00-00-18%2f3247.64-bit.PNG" /></a></p>
<p>Note the Starter only comes with the 32 bit, thats normal.</p>
<p>NovaCorp WinToFlash can be used to make these installation files into a bootable USB. Alternatively the files can be remade into an .iso and used in conjunction with the Microsoft .iso to USB/DVD tool. Both methods are explained
 below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Activation:</p>
<p>Once you have installed it, all you need to do is change the product key located on the Certificate of Authenticity (COA). Lets take a look at how to do that.
</p>
<p>Click Start, right click Computer</p>
<p>Click Properties</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset1_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d461%26amp%3bh%3d145" /></a></p>
<p>Scroll down to Windows activation.</p>
<p>You will notice it displays a time until Activation but be completed. Also the Product ID indicates it is using a default key, this is only for the 30 day grace period allowed until you must activate Windows 7.
</p>
<p>Click the link, <strong>Change product key</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset2_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d455%26amp%3bh%3d398" /></a></p>
<p>Enter the product key located on the COA sticker located at the bottom or (sometimes in the battery compartment of your laptop), you can also find it at the top or side if its a Desktop computer.&nbsp; It looks something like the following:</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/image2.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fimage_thumb2.png%3fw%3d438%26amp%3bh%3d156" /></a></p>
<p>Proceed to enter the product key and click Next</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset3_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d460%26amp%3bh%3d403" /></a></p>
<p>Wait while Windows attempts to activate.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset4_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d459%26amp%3bh%3d402" /></a></p>
<p>If all goes well, within a minute, you should see this screen. </p>
<p>You can further confirm Windows 7 is activated by checking the Windows Activation status:</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set5.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset5_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d468%26amp%3bh%3d98" /></a></p>
<p>Notice Windows 7 now displays OEM within the Product ID to indicate the product channel it is licensed from. Please note, this also works with Windows Vista if you are still running that version.</p>
<p>If you are unable to activate Windows 7 using the Change product key method, you can try phone activation and speak with a call agent who will assist with reactivating Windows 7:</p>
<p>How to activate Windows 7 manually (activate by phone)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1) Click Start, and in the Search box type:&nbsp;&nbsp; slui.exe&nbsp; 4<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2) Next press the ‘ENTER’ key<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3) Select your ‘Country’ from the list.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4) Choose the ‘Phone Activation’ option.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
5) Stay on the phone (do not select/press any options) and wait for a person to help you with activation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
6) Explain your problem clearly to the support person.<br />

<h2>            0x0000007B &#40;0xF78A2524, 0xC0000034, 0x00000000, 0x00000000&#41;</h2>
                    few days ago I cleaned the inside of my desktop with a compressed can of air. After plugging everything back in I got the blue screen, with the error code 0x0000007B (0xF78A2524, 0xC0000034, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)<br />
<br />
I tried to reboot, and I still get the error. I tried rebooting in safe mode, and I still get the error. I removed a slot of RAM, removed the graphics card and used the original card that shipped with my computer. I removed all PCI cards from the motherboard
 and I still get a blue screen. I checked to see if the LED light turns an amber red color when booting, and it does not.
<br />
<br />
then I went into BIOS and changed the booting order, and booted from CD-ROM using the disc to run HARDWARE DIAGNOSTICS TEST.<br />
I ran the extended test which took a while, everything pass the test, except my Diskette Drive B (floppy)<br />
<br />
Could this be a bad diskette drive preventing Windows OS from booting? Could this be the culprit? maybe the IDE ribbon is bad as well...who knows?<br />
<br />
from my understanding, there is a fix or patch for this, as too what DELL has told me, BUT its useless to me, because I can't access windows from here.<br />
<br />
if anyone can help, or share some insights about this that would be great.<br />
<br />
thanks <br />

<p>As previously stated, this is probably the problem. Try switching to IDE/ATA mode in BIOS.</p>

What I don't understand is why this happens and once you get "going" do you change it back?&nbsp; This has come up several times before and I don't get it.&nbsp; Why does it happen in the first place?<br />
<br />
I would be great if some conscientious person that has a Dell and this problem and "fixes" it this way might ask in the Dell forums, get a reply that makes sense and would tell us all about it.<br />

<h2>            Space bar, changing keyboard layout</h2>
                    Is there any way to change the space bar to another&nbsp; key?&nbsp; My bar broke..I've tried several places to replace the key.&nbsp; Now its worn to a nub and I worry it'll die anyday.&nbsp; I could use the accessible keyboard with the mouse but that's a hassle.&nbsp; Any way
 to change say the [ key to space?

<p><span>Hi VilleJeff,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no way of changing the keyboard button functions.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using a laptop as the spacebar is not functioning properly you can connect an external keyboard and use the spacebar button.</span></p>
<p><span>You can also contact the laptop manufacturer to check if they can provide a replacement of the laptop keypad.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps!</span></p>
