<p>Not really a fan of it to be honest. When I played it, it seemed like hits didn't register enough. I guess you can say it's a challenging game and all, but I couldn't get into it. Plus LJN released it, so that's not good.

<h3> mgerity  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t add a Microsoft account to Windows Store</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so I purchased an app in the Windows store under my Microsoft account.&nbsp; When my child logs in, the app I purchased isn't available to him.&nbsp; The solution to that is SUPPOSED to be that I log onto the computer as him, but then log into the Windows Store
 app under the account that I used to purchase the app, download it, and then switch back to him.&nbsp; Easy, right?&nbsp; Wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Store app will NOT let me log on using my Microsoft account.&nbsp; It will ONLY let me add a "Work or School" type account, and if I try to enter my Microsoft Account credentials after making that selection, it gives me an error.&nbsp; Why on earth can't
 I simply add my Microsoft Account and log into the Store with it?&nbsp; How else am I supposed to give my family access to the apps I purchase?</p>

            <p>Well, after burning more than an hour on this, I finally solved my own problem.&nbsp; The only way to sign in with another Microsoft Account is to first log out of the first one.&nbsp; So, you are limited to adding only a "Work or School" account while signed in to
 an account, but in order to get to another Microsoft Account, you first have to log&nbsp;out of the first one.&nbsp; Once you've done that, then clicking to add an account gives you the choice of adding either a "Work or School Account" or a "Microsoft Account" that
 I was expecting to get all along.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It baffles me why you have to go through this basically useless preliminary step, but that's what you have to do.&nbsp; It baffles me far, far more why they don't simply TELL YOU this there on the account screen in Windows Store.&nbsp; How hard would it be to put
 a message saying "In order to log into another Microsoft Account, you must first log out of this one."?&nbsp; That would have saved me over an hour and a ton of frustration.</p>

            <p>Yeah, the ENTIRE problem is that this simple information isn't presented to the user when they need it.&nbsp; All Microsoft needs to do is to put a message on that login block that says "you cannot login to another Microsoft Account until you log out of this
 one."&nbsp; There, that's it.&nbsp; Problem solved 100%, easily, simply and quickly, which is unlike the hour I wasted trying to figure out this little rule on my own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, PLEASE, disclose this rule to users by posting a message on the login block that informs us that we can't login to a Microsoft Account without logging out first.&nbsp; Why I have to ask you to do this, instead of it being INCREDIBLY OBVIOUS to Microsoft,
 I cannot fathom.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update, BSOD after reboot when installing the update KB4043961</h2>
                    <p>Hello Gentleman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just recently updated two of my x64 systems to the Fall Creators Update.</p>
<p>Shortly after, another cumulative update KB4043961 appeared to be available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, every time I want to install that update, both the systems always end up with a BSOD after the required reboot.</p>
<p>Now I have halted Windows Update on both machines for 35 days but I am afraid that perhaps afterwards the BSOD series will continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For already over a decade of the last years I have never had such any similar issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also filmed the reboot behavior, but video is &gt; 400 MB.</p>
<p>I do also have the evaluated WindowsUpdate.log - File generated from the&nbsp;C:\Windows\Logs\WindowsUpdate\ - Folder.</p>
<p>(With the Powershell ISE command "Get-WindowsUpdateLog")</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anybody experienced similar behavior with the KB4043961 update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(By the way:</p>
<p>On both machines, the Fall Creators Update failed with a BSOD too a few times...but this has simply resolved on its own after a certain numbers of attempts)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your support and time gentleman.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Nothing&#39;s responding--restarting, one-key recovery, hard drive replacement doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>I boot up my laptop, and not only does it take forever to load, but the moment I try to click on or do anything at all, nothing responds. I upgraded it to Windows 10, and I can't even do simple tasks like open up the Start menu, use Cortana, or look at my
 notifications. I can't open any web browsers or other software because they don't respond.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes, the entire computer screen will go blue and a message will show, saying that my PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. The error said "DRIVER_IQRL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL" but restarting doesn't help. I've found several solutions to that specific
 error, but nobody else with this error has the other symptoms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took it to the Best Buy where I got it, and handed it over to the Geek Squad. They sent it away to get fixed, saying that it was a hardware problem and that the entire hard drive needed to be replaced. When I got it back, it worked alright for a while,
 but soon went back to the same symptoms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried restarting the entire thing back to factory mode about 3 times by now, but it never works. Or, if it does, it doesn't work for very long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop model is a Lenovo G50-45 and I upgraded it to Windows 10, but I don't believe the Windows 10 upgrade was the problem. My friend recommends seeing if I can get a refund for it, considering how useless the laptop is when it's like this. Please help!
 I want to get this fixed, and since I only bought it 3 or 4 months ago, it's too expensive for me to just buy a whole new laptop.</p>

            <p>I've tried backing my computer up like you mentioned, mostly because I was sick of having to re-download all of my software if I reset the entire laptop to factory mode. But when I try to, it says that in order to backup the system, I need to insert either
 a hard disk or removable hard drive with at least 39.8GB worth of space. I don't understand why the USB needs so much space, considering I don't download THAT much onto my computer, but I am going to try and get a large 64GB USB soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will let you know how the rest goes once I have the appropriate USB. Regardless, thank you for the suggestion!</p>

            <p>In the end of your problem, are you sure that your computer is bought 3 or 4 ago? or are you sure that your computer is not fixed computer from old computer? As is described in the beginning, your computer has something wrong before upgrading. Therefore,
 Windows 10 is not reason to cause problem on your computer, but computer hard ware. &nbsp;I recommend you to find the sales shop that sold this computer to you, you must require they refund to you. Or if you insist to use this computer, you can old version of Windows,
 such as 8. 8.1, 7 or XP. It is not compatible to run windows 10 on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, we recommend you to install <a href="http://www.backup-utility.com/onekey-recovery.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
AOMEI OneKey Recovery</a>. You can use it to create a rescue partition. Once your computer crashes, you can use it to restore your system immediately. the speed of backing up and restoring system is so fast.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            What happened to the original Windows 10 download, it disappeared.  I lost that Windows desktop &#40;only had 8 small animated windows&#41;&#33; Can I get that original desktop back and keep my old stuff&#63;</h2>
                    <p><em><strong>Original title: </strong></em>What happened to the original Windows 10 download, it disappeared.&nbsp; I lost that Windows desktop (only had 8 small animated windows)!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 was downloaded on my computer almost a month ago (I had Windows 7).&nbsp; Things were fine, a full desktop with the windows and groups of windows, planned to review it. Including email, I&nbsp;was unable to open some other programs I regularly used and
 would have to frustratingly&nbsp;reconfigure or find them to download. I was concerned though, that I lost my original (albeit crowded) desktop and sticky notes, and I made note about that in a feedback that came up on my desktop. After searching online "everything"
 and PC, I did get my&nbsp;Sticky Notes back and&nbsp;find my desktop and my other folders, and original programs in another file on the PC, and there was no need to download my programs; and, thus, I was&nbsp;fine with the original 10 desktop, since I could go back and forth
 to my other folders and reclaim important Sticky Notes. BUT the next day or two,</p>
<p>Will I be able to download the Windows 10 again without losing anything.</p>

            <p><span>Hi EricHalliwell,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to the Windows 8 Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From your issue description I understand that after installing Windows 8 App store can’t connect to internet. I do understand the inconvenience caused to you. Do not worry; I am here to help you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check the Windows Firewall Settings and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type in Control Panel on the Start Page.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>On the left side, click Control Panel.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on Windows Firewall.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>On the left pane, click on "Allow an app or feature through Windows Firewall".</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Under the Allowed apps and features, look for Store.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Make sure you have a click in Private and or Public.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Then see if you can open the Windows Store. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you have a 3rd party Firewall, you may need to change the settings to allow the app thru the Firewall.</span></p>
<p><span>NOTE: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you are done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Photos App November 2016 update</h2>
                    <p>Hello, gang! Nice to be here; good to know that I have someone to turn to in case of trouble...<br />
Or, by some chance, I am able to help ...<br />
There is this thing causing me a lot of grief right now:<br />
</p>
<p>A couple of days back, there was an update done on Windows - this one, to be specific, upgraded the PHOTOS App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wouldn't really call it an upgrade - of course, it automated most of the editing functions, but has totally taken away the individual manual tweaking options! I SO miss the 6 options on the left - Basic, Light, Colour, Effects, etc - the COLOUR option
 had this fantastic option to change the temperature, plus - COLOR BOOST.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there ANY way I can go back to the pre- Nov 14th version of PHOTOS? PLEEEEEASE?<br />
(it is not being shown under the "Uninstall an Update" - maybe too minor to figure in there ... :-( &nbsp;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks much in advance! With warm regards, George</p>
<p>

            I could not agree more. This Ap is totally ruined for anyone who actually wants to edit a photo.

            I was very unhappy with the automatic/unwanted update as well. I found a note on another site and the advise given was to go to your control panel, then system and security, then security and maintenance, then recovery, then open system restore. I restored
 to a date before the update took place, which was 11/13/16 on my computer. I now have the previous version and was able to edit photos as I had done on 11/12/16. Yeah!!!!! I then went to my Microsoft store settings and made sure the automatic update button
 was toggled off.

            <p>The problem with your suggested solution is that it also undoes all the security updates and prevents future automatic security updates. Various vulnerabilities are regularly found and patched. It would be helpful if Microsoft stopped rolling their useless
 program changes in with the important security patches. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping they might undo the Photo one, next update! In the meantime, I'm doing a workaround by using the bery good crop feature on Photo and using another program for the adjustments.</p>

            100% agreed. I loved the older version of this app and as of now it's completely useless to me. They've taken away all functionality and dumbed it down to the point where it's just garbage. I hate this app now, and I hate them for changing it. Before I
 could edit 100+ photos in a decent amount of time, now it's a huge pain in the ****. Thanks for making my workload twice as hard and tedious, Microsoft.

            <p>Isn't it a travesty? I'm so mad a Microsoft for ruining their fabulous photo editor app. Was completely shocked when I tried to use it this afternoon and realized they had dumbed it down to where it's unusable. Would have only taken me 20 or so minutes to
 edit everything and be on my way with the previous version. Instead I've burned up all afternoon/evening researching and trying to figure out an alternative. Purchased Adobe Lightroom CC and now watching tutorials on one computer while trying to figure out
 how to edit with the Lightroom program on the other computer. Argh, so complicated... a nightmare time suck that totally diminishes the great experience I had taking the photos in the first place!! &nbsp;Damn it Microsoft, your random update sucks, who on earth
 approves these kind of stupid decisions that has such an immediate, negative impact on people? Don't they have real photographers on staff?</p>

            Hi  TRIVIATUS
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Before printing, did you click File &gt; Print &gt; Page setup 
<br />You should be able to adjust for the size of the paper you are printing on.
<br />
<br />You could also try saving the file first then use the Photo printing wizard to print it.
<br />
<br />This should show you an actual preview of what it is going to look like before printing or first print it as a PDF, view it then try printing it again.
        </p>

<p>In the print dialog, be sure that you are printing at 100% of original size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Printers commonly resize items for printing so that they fit evenly on the margins of the printed page. Usually, this is a benefit, but not in your case.</p>

            Thanks for the prompt reply. Although I ensured it was set to 100% (it had been greyed out) I had the same result. However it gave me the idea of setting to 115% which worked. So Your reply was sort of successful.

            Thanks for the reply. Paper size is set to A4 as default. I have tried printing it through the photo app but it comes out too large. I did get the inspiration for a solution from another reply which involved altering the size to 115%.

            <p>Not at the partition level, best you can do is to convert the whole disk, but have a look at these 2 utilities, maybe they have a new feature to their recent releases:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Partition Wizard Home Edition:<br />
<a href="http://www.partitionwizard.com/free-partition-manager.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.partitionwizard.com/free-partition-manager.html</a><br />
Note: There is also a bootable CD or bootable Flash drive versions:<br />
CD: <a href="http://www.partitionwizard.com/partition-wizard-bootable-cd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.partitionwizard.com/partition-wizard-bootable-cd.html</a><br />
Flash Drive: <a href="http://www.partitionwizard.com/bootable-flash-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.partitionwizard.com/bootable-flash-drive.html</a><br />
Some of the features and Functions include: Create partition, Delete partition, Format partition,
<br />
Resizing a partition, Move partitions, Restore Partition after accidental deletion,
<br />
Convert partition, Explore partition, Hide partition, <br />
Change drive letter, Set active partition, partition explorer (View contents). <br />
Note: To complete any task use the 'Pending Operations' box located in the lower or top left.</p>
<p><br />
Alternative to Partition Wizard (Somewhat easier to use but both Partition Wizard and EASEUS have nearly identical user interfaces)<br />
EASEUS Partition Master Home Edition (Free):<br />
<a href="http://www.partition-tool.com/personal.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.partition-tool.com/personal.htm</a><br />
ALL-IN-ONE partition software and the most convenient hard disk partition manager toolkit
<br />
Includes Partition Manager, Disk &amp; Partition Copy Wizard and Partition Recovery Wizard on MBR and GUID partition table (GPT) disk under Windows 2000/XP/Vista/Windows 7 and Windows Server 2000/2003/2008 (32 bit and 64 bit).
<br />
It allows users to Resize/Move Partition, Extend System Drive, Copy Disk &amp; Partition, Merge Partition, Split Partition, Redistribute Free Space, Convert Dynamic Disk, Convert GPT Disk to MBR, Partition Recovery and much more.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) Did you make any changes to your computer prior to the issue occurring?</div>
<div><br />
2) When does the wallpaper and theme change? During hibernation?</div>
<div><br />
3) Does it happen when you working on some application? A third party application could be causing the issue.</div>
<div><br />
4) Are you using a laptop? It sometime happens that your laptop battery is low and the screen switches to basic theme.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This usually happens on laptops depending on power adapter connected or if your laptop is running on a battery. To save some power, it usually changes the desktop background in your computer automatically.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you do not want to change the wallpaper or themes, make sure you have not set the time to change the Wallpaper and the theme or set it to never if you have the option.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In the meantime, follow these steps.</div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong> <br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You might want to follow the steps given earlier which talks about a similar issue. However, that one is for Windows 7 which should also work for Windows Vista.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7desktop/thread/6ead49cc-6c56-42c6-ad6d-b17175cb643c</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, disable Webshots and change the desktop wallpaper and check if desktop background changes. It seems like the issue is caused by Webshots.<br />

    <title>DVD drive not working after Windows 10 16299.64 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petersmith_853  say:</h3>
<h2>            DVD drive not working after Windows 10 16299.64 update</h2>
                    <p>I have an Lite-On IHAS 124W optical DVD/RW internal drive which does not read DVDs following this Windows update. I have checked hardware properties in file explorer and it confirms the device is working normally. Same in Device Manager. When I insert a
 DVD the device spins up but does not recognise the disc. I have tried numerous discs - purchased and my own - and none work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking the FAQs on the Lite-On web site it says no Windows 10 driver is needed, just make sure the IDE&nbsp; ATA/ATAPI controileers are enabled, which they are. Does anyone know of a fix for this problem without having to replace my DVD drive?&nbsp; I need to burn
 some DVDs very soon so a prompt reply would be ideal. Thanks</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Center freezes after entering setup key for Xbox 360 Extender - Quick Fix&#63;</h2>
                    Here's the deal. I already went into services and STARTED all the required actions needed to run an extender. My firewall IS NOT blocking anything pertaining to WMC Extenders as far as I know. I've already went into the Languages tab and done that as well.
 I'm running Windows 7 Home Edition and an Xbox 360 Elite.&nbsp;
<div><br />
I've tried hard wiring it to the PC and the router AND using the wireless connection as well. NOTHING WORKS! When I enter the 8 digit setup key, it simply freezes and asks to end the process. I REALLY want to set up my extender service!</div>

            <p>Hello Angela,</p>
<p>The spooler service is needed for a printer to work; it starts automatically when Windows starts. So the&nbsp;first thing I'd suggest is rebooting your computer without the disc inserted. Then, once the computer has rebooted, insert the disc and try again.</p>

<p>If that doesn't work, you might want to try the hp.com site. There you can download the latest version of your driver as well as diagnostic tools that might help diagnose any printer problems. Go here and enter your specific model number:&nbsp;

<p><span><b><span><br />
Method 1</span></b></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may boot the computer into ‘safe mode’ and check if the issue persists. It will start Windows XP with a limited set of files
 and drivers. Startup programs do not run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed, follow the steps to boot the computer in safe mode:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Restart the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Start tapping F8 key.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. You will get advanced boot option window.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. Select the option “Safe mode”.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Error&#58; Setup was unable to determine if BitLocker Drive Encryption is in use. </h2>
                    It get the error trying to go from Vista Ultimate:<br />
Setup was unable to determine if BitLocker Drive Encryption is in use. <br />
The compat. wizard said the system was good to upgrade, but during the install, I got this.&nbsp; Tried running CHKDSK /f /r<br />
<br />
All patches in place and system is installed with 1 HD, divided as c: for system files and d: for recovery files. BitLocker is not in use on this system.&nbsp; Any way around this issue?

            Is there any way you can temporarly move the recovery files from D: to external media?<br />
If you are able to do so then after creating the backup of your recovery files delete the D: partition.<br />
Then try the upgrade.<br />
<br />
As an alternately you may what to enable and then disable Bitlocker:<br />
See: What is the difference between disabling BitLocker Drive Encryption and decrypting the volume?<br />

            Thanks for the answer, but it does not work.<br />
<br />
Deleted the Recovery volume (D:) and BitLocker was never enabled, but verified it is not on.<br />
<br />
Same error about being unable to determine if BitLocker is in use.<br />
<br />
Any more ideas?

            Short of a clean install (without activating Windows 7) which I can do as I have Image Backups no fresh out of ideas. Turning BitLocker On and then Off I take it didn't solve the problem?
