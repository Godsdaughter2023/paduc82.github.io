<h2>            TIP&#58; reading deleted text messages</h2>
                    heres a trick....(mods can you make this a sticky?)<br />
<br />
Procedure<br />
<br />
Step 1) Open Fexplorer(<a href="http://www.gosymbian.com/FE_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gosymbian.com/FE_download.html</a>) for those who dont have it.....<br />
<br />
Step 2) Select drive C: or D: depending on the memory in which the Sms messages have been saved. C-phone memory D-memory card<br />
<br />
Step 3) For example u selected c: , Then open "system" folder.<br />
<br />
step 4) Then in "system" folder open "mail" folder.<br />
<br />
step 5) Then in this folder u will see different folders (eg 0010001_s) and certain files (eg 00100000). These files are the actual messages. Browse through every folder and open all files till u get the sms u are looking for.<br />
<br />
Step 6) For opening the files don't choose options&gt;file&gt;open as it will show format not supported rather choose options&gt;file&gt;hex/text viewer. By selecting the "Hex/ text viewer" u ll be able to open and read the deleted SMS message.<br />

They don't actually last forever on the phone. Eventually they get overwritten and/or removed by the system. It's a fairly typical and common I/O process of a operating system.<br />
<br />
The same thing happens with files on your computer. All removing them to the recycle bin and then deleting them from there does is set a flag on the space where the data is stored physically on the hard drive that says "This data can now be overwritten with
 new data". Even though Windows shows they are gone and corrects the storage allocations accordingly they are still there until the data gets overwritten. This is the reason files can be recovered even after you have deleted them from your computer.

<h2>            i keep getting redirected to korean msn com</h2>
                    Hi all,&nbsp; I live in korea and few weeks ago for no reason&nbsp;when I start IE8 instead of going to MSN.COM for my homepage it redirects to Korean KR.MSN.COM, when I first got here about 1 year ago it did this but after the first time it gave you the option
 to go back to MSN.COM then it&nbsp;ask if you want to use this all the time. Now it offers to go back but never ask if I want MSN.COM for good. So everytime I go to home page I have to repeat the above. This is driving me nuts. I'm running Vista 64bit but using
 IE8 32bit. Thanks for any help. Oh I've alreally gone to internet options to try to change but does no good. Also I can make just about any other web page my home page and no problems. Just MSM.COM

            Hi guys,<br />
<br />
When you are locate in another country trying to access an American webbase site, sometime the government of that specific country might have some type of censorship or blockage which might cause the you to get redirect from MSN.com.&nbsp; There isn't much you can
 do if this is the case.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,

<p>hi osama,</p>
<p>for the issue, i suggest you check three points as the error message shown. besides, can you try the following steps?<br />
1. try open in excel online and click edit in excel online.<br />
2. directly open the url displayed in the error message</p>
<p>for checking persons working on same excel file, we can find other person when all people are editing in excel online (check below image). co-authoring in excel application is not supported. so it is not feasible if anyone is editing in excel application.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=6af3b1d0-ce92-4e42-9a55-1713274a9b89" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d6af3b1d0-ce92-4e42-9a55-1713274a9b89" /></a></p>

<p>hi osama,<br />
<br />
is this file in your personal onedrive for business or shared with you by another user? if it’s shared from another user, you can contact that user to check if he made any changes to it (e.g. change the permission of this file, move it to another folder).<br />
<br />
for further investigation, i’d like to confirm the following things:<br />
1.how is this file shared, with a guest link or an invitation email?<br />
2.the steps about how you open this file. do you open it from the<strong> shared with me</strong> section or directly use the url to open it from excel 2013?<br />
3.open excel and check if you are signed in to it with your work/school account. you may click switch account and then enter your work/school account again to check the outcome.<br />
4.do any other users who can edit this file have the same issue? <br />
5.does this issue occur when you open the file or save changes?<br />
6.do opening and saving options work well for other excel files in sharepoint online (both the files shared with you and those in your personal onedrive for business)?<br />
7.if this user shares a test excel file with you, can you open and save it?<br />
<br />
moreover, when a user is editing a shared excel file, you will receive a pop-up like the picture below if you are also trying to edit it at the same time.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=9f63b791-3610-4191-ab7e-160135573d8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d9f63b791-3610-4191-ab7e-160135573d8d" /></a><br />
let us know the results when you have time.<br />

            The My Phone service was discontinued and shut down almost a year ago.&nbsp; If you were actively using your My Phone account by syncing regularly to it with a WM6.x phone, then your contact data would have been migrated over to your SkyDrive account as Resourceful
 stated in his reply.&nbsp; But if your My Phone account was inactive for 6 months or more (you had not synced or logged into the account for 6 months prior to the termination of the service), your account was shut down with all your data deleted prior to the termination
 of the service, and none of your data would have been migrated to SkyDrive.<br />

            Hello. Look in your Skydrive account first as they were supposed to be migrated there. In this KB (additional resources section), you will find a link to order a CD if they don't show up in Skydrive. I think it depended on how often you used the service.&nbsp;

<h2>            How to Preview a Forum post prior to posting</h2>
                    <p>Good Morning all,</p>
<p>I suspect this question has an easy answer yet it alludes me because I'm just no good conjuring up the right search terms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Word to compose posts that I intend for a forum such as this and use a lot of BBcode to enhance such.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to open the Word files of the posts I write in Internet Explorer to see what my code actually produces and what other folks will see once I do post it.&nbsp; But my IE, (IE_11 on Win_7), refuses to open with a preview of what the post will
 look like, either just opening it in Word, or giving me some error saying to check the address I'm pointing to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't help but feel I'm missing a simple easy step that would allow me to&nbsp;have a new "tab" open up in IE to show me the post.&nbsp; It would be even better if it was easily updated with changes I made in the original composition with a quick refresh but any
 preview would really make my life easier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried searching&nbsp;for this feature in the FAQs but I'm so bad with search terms</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with this would really&nbsp;be appreciated, thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>David&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are using BBcode for writing post on the forums to enhance it. As
<strong>BBCode</strong> (<strong>Bulletin Board Code) </strong>is a lightweight markup language used to format posts in many message boards.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue you posted is more complex than what is answered in the Community forums and would be better suited in the
<strong>MSDN. </strong>This forum is looked at by other developers who would more than likely be able to assist.</span></p>

            <p>Hello!&nbsp; I'm a developer on the OneNote team and would like to help you with this.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; First off, sorry to hear that you are running into this issue.&nbsp; From the error messages you are receiving, it sounds like there may actually be two separate problems here
 that have mixed together to make things more difficult to address than it originally appeared:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Your credentials either expired, or changed state internally in some way.&nbsp; I believe Harsha's suggestion would have addressed this issue had it appeared by itself, as&nbsp;deleting the cached credentials&nbsp;would have prompted a new sign in session and forced a
 complete refresh of the creds.<br />
</li><li>The license file for the app itself&nbsp;is corrupt or damaged in some way.&nbsp; This is evidenced by the "OneNote has run into an error that is preventing it from working correctly" message you received.&nbsp; I suspect that addressing this issue will clear up your
 problem.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>So the good news is that we have a pretty clear diagnosis for the problem&nbsp;- by the way, thanks for posting such detailed descriptions as well as screenshots for the error messages.&nbsp; That helps a ton.&nbsp; The bad news is that repairing license files in place
 is an extremely tricky problem to solve, since they are designed to prevent tampering (this is one of the tools we use to avoid piracy).&nbsp; Just for some additional background, we actually have a completely separate team that handles this aspect of the&nbsp;product&nbsp;for
 the entire Office suite, which is separate from the individual client teams.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All that said, the simplest solution would be for you to reinstall the app, provided you don't have any unsaved/unsynced data.&nbsp; That will&nbsp;generate a new license file&nbsp;and should resolve the problem.&nbsp; Luckily it sounds like you have been using OneDrive to
 store your notebooks, so you should be able to check&nbsp;that your data has all synced out from your PC by using either the web client or your Android device.&nbsp; Once you've confirmed that your data is present, go ahead and use Add or Remove Programs to remove the
 C2R installation of OneNote (this should appear in your list of programs as "Microsoft OneNote Home and Student 2016").&nbsp; After that, reinstall from
<a href="http://www.onenote.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.onenote.com/download</a>, enter your original credentials,&nbsp;and things should work again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if this fixes your issue, or feel free to reply back if you have further questions or problems!</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply Russell!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, still a no-go after credential clean-up, uninstall, and re-install. </p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple other ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wonder if there's something lingering after the uninstall. For example maybe a Send to OneNote hook/add-in somewhere like the Outlook trust center that needs to be killed.</li><li>I went to&nbsp;https://account.microsoft.com to see if there was anything to be tweaked or edited and noticed that I have a "cancelled" Subscription to Office 365. We're in the middle of evaluating SharePoint in the cloud as a company but that shouldn't affect
 my OneNote 2016 install (I'd think).</li></ul>

            <p>Interesting thoughts!&nbsp; Even though reinstalling didn't work, that gives us some additional data to work with. &nbsp;I'm still confident that this is an issue with the app license, but rather than it being damaged or corrupt, it is possible that the licensing
 code is having trouble figuring out the combined set of licenses on your device.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,&nbsp;such an issue&nbsp;could potentially be impacted by the second bullet point you've listed regarding a cancelled O365 subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Licensing needs to evaluate the full set of&nbsp;existing permissions on a device to make sure the broadest possible&nbsp;range of features is unlocked for any product, and it is possible that a cancelled subscription (mixed with&nbsp;an older&nbsp;perpetual suite license&nbsp;+
 later C2R install)&nbsp;is tripping that up.&nbsp; This is getting a little beyond my area of expertise, but I am going to contact the licensing team on your behalf and see if they have any suggestions.&nbsp; There's usually a way out of these situations, we just need to
 figure out the one that will work for you.&nbsp; :)</p>

    <title>Installing Virtual Box broke my internet connection &#40;Windows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Installing Virtual Box broke my internet connection &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed VirtualBox onto my Windows 10 machine 2 days ago and I do remember during the installation that it said VirtualBox would amend some adapter settings but didn't think anything of it at the time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My internet was fine after the install but last night I tried creating a VM, once I had completed that I closed down VirtualBox and noticed that my internet was going slow and it had diverted to the Wifi. As it was late at night I didn't do anything with
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I have turned on my machine to find that the ethernet settings were no longer working (Which was why my PC has defaulted back to Wifi). So I tried the following troubleshooting steps and I still have not been able to resolve the issue, is anyone able
 to assist?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Ran TroubleShooter - It came back with the error '"Ethernet" does not have a valid IP Configuration' and it looks like trouble shooter can do nothing further to resolve this.</p>
<p>2) Disabled Wifi - to see if it would default back but did not</p>
<p>3) Uninstalled network drivers and reinstalled them - No change</p>
<p>4) Uninstalled VirtualBox from the machine and restarted PC - No change, still unable to connect to Internet</p>
<p>5) Ran CMD with <strong>ipconfig /release</strong> and <strong>ipconfig /renew</strong> - This caused CMD to run three lots of errors:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 - No operation can be performed while wifi media is disconnected</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 - No operation can be performed while the ethernet media is disconnected</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 - Error occured while renewing ethernet operation : cancelled by user</p>
<p>6) Checked Proxy settings - These are just set as the default, nothing manual has been changed or edited on these</p>
<p>7) CMD as admin - <strong>net winsock reset </strong>and <strong>net int ip reset</strong></p>
<p>8) Checked the adapter settings - Both are set obtain IP and DNS Server automatically</p>
<p>9) Changed adapter settings to Googles - No effect</p>
<p>10) (Shouldn've mentioned this earlier but I have already tried restarting the router but as I'm the only one in the house having this issue, I know it is not this).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now I've ran out of ideas as it looks like Googling this was not able to come up with suggestions that were directly related to this issue, more so to do with the internet within VirtualBox itself.</p>

<h2>            why has the live tile for bing translator stopped working&#63;</h2>
                    the live tile which once showed pictures with word of the day now is the solid block colour of the selected theme. it's not even the logo that comes before you fully being using the app but just a blank square with the name of the app. i know it's not
 a real problem. but it's really annoying. i can't seem to find a solution to this unnecessary niggle.&nbsp;

<h3> frederik long  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to change the font color in Outlook 2003 &#40;Repeat post&#41;</h2>
                    (This is a repeat of a question I posted last week, with no answers to date)<br />
<br />
I have the following scenario with a client:<br />
<ol>
<li>Some text in a Word document, parts of it in red color.</li><li>Mark &amp; copy the red text.</li><li>Create a new message in Outlook.</li><li>Paste the text into the message field (the menu item "Paste Special" is grayed out)<br />
</li><li>Try to change the red color to black.</li></ol>
Outlook lets the client edit the text but any attempts at changing the font color are ignored. I might, of course, tell the client to change the text color to black while in Word but there are good reasons why he prefers to leave it in red. Is there a way to
 change it while in Outlook?<br />
<br />
Background info:<br />
- Windows XP Professional<br />
- Word and Outlook 2003<br />
- Using HTML message format in Outlook<br />
- Not using Word to edit EMail messages in Outlook<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!<br />

<h2>            password restricted forms</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a DB to create and keep track of purchase orders, in this DB I created a form that is password protected and is just accessed by the CIO.&nbsp; The purpose of the form will allow the CIO to approve the purchase orders and that is why I made it password
 protected, However so far this password was created by me and it resides in a table.&nbsp; I would like to create an option so that&nbsp;CIO can&nbsp;create his own password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone give me an idea of how to do this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks very much in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>You might want to develop this further so that the user has to confirm the current password before changing

 form and &nbsp;I get the password prompt if I dont' type anything the form opens with no information on it which is ok but if I type anything whether is the right password or not the form opens with all the information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            In which event procedure are you prompting for the password, and what is the code?&nbsp; For a simple solution you could use code in the form's Open event procedure like this:<br />
<br />
Private Sub Form_Open(Cancel As Integer)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Const MESSAGETEXT = "Invalid password"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strPassword<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strPassword = DLookup("Password", "tblPassword")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If StrComp(InputBox("Enter password:", "Password"), strPassword, vbBinaryCompare) &lt;&gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox MESSAGETEXT, vbExclamation, "Password"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cancel = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
but a better alternative would be to open an unbound form in dialogue mode rather than calling the InputBox function as this would allow you to format the prompt as a password so that it shows asterisks rather than the actual characters entered.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I entered the code in the on open event of the passaword protected form and it looks like it works until some extend, is perfect but it works for just one user, in other words if I enter the password of another user it tells me invalid password.&nbsp; I also
 understand what you mean as I had set the passwords in the table to show as asterisks but how can I make the password shows the same way as the user is entering it?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Regardless of the password issue, each user should have their own front end, either on their local machine or in a 'personal' folder in the system.&nbsp; The tblPassword table should reside in the front end not the back end, so the password will be specific
 to each user.<br />
<br />
I don't think there is any way of getting the text entered into an input box to show as asterisks.&nbsp; It's done by the InputMask property of a column (field) or control, so you'd have to use a dialogue form rather than calling the InputBox function.&nbsp; I have done
 this before, so I'll put together a little demo file and post the link here when it's available.&nbsp; The approach I've used is not to store the password in a table but as a property of the form.&nbsp; Bear in mind that however you do it, it will only provide a very
 low level of security.&nbsp; In reality it hardly merits the term 'security' at all; it's really just a means of controlling who has Access to what in the day-to-day operation of the database.&nbsp; Any moderately competent meddler could crack it very easily.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am still having some issues with the password.&nbsp; I was able to create the changing password form and it works perfect even showing asterisks in the password field as I created&nbsp;it&nbsp;as modal dialog. Hevever if I follow the previous code you&nbsp;gave me although
 is works good the password still shows as I am&nbsp;entering&nbsp;it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I open your file and tried to analyze the codes but I am kind of lost.&nbsp; Can you please help a little on this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I created another password form that will prompt me to enter a password when I am opening the form called POPendingforApproval. This time I created it as a modal dialog to be able to see the password in asterisks instead of the acual word, but can you please
 help me with the code?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The password form is called Passtoopenform</p>
<p>The form to open is called POPendingforApproval</p>
<p>the password field is called New_Password</p>
<p>and the bottton&nbsp;that should&nbsp;trigger the form to open is called Ok</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you please give me some&nbsp;ideas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!&nbsp;</p>

            Sorry for late reply; I've been out of the country.<br />
<br />
Firstly, the visibility of a password is controlled solely by setting the control's InputMask property to 'Pasword', not by any code.<br />
<br />
If you use exactly the same form and control names for the password form and for the form for setting/changing a password as in my demo then you won't need to change the&nbsp; code for these forms at all other than changing 'frmOpen' to whatever is the name of the
 form containing the button to open the POPendingforApproval form.&nbsp; If not you need to change the refernces to the form and control names in their modules to your own.<br />
<br />
In the code for the OK button on the calling form you simply need to change 'frmEmployees' to your form's name. i.e.&nbsp; 'POPendingforApproval'.<br />
<br />
In the Open and Close event procedures of the POPendingforApproval form you again simply need to change 'frmOpen' to whatever is the name of the form containing the button to open the POPendingforApproval form.<br />

<h2>            Windows Phone 8.1 -T-Mobile - Phone.com VoIp -Softphone, Zoiper app.</h2>
                    <p><strong><span><span>Q. Is this possible to get this up and running within the current parameters of
</span></span></strong>Windows Phone 8.1 -T-Mobile - Phone.com VoIp -Softphone, Zoiper app.?</p>
<p><span><strong><span><span><span>A) The operating system requirement for the Windows Phone 8.1, brings customer
 to Zoiper, which compatible with Windows Phone 8.1.</span></span></span></strong></span><strong><span><span>However, Windows phone 8 does not allow voip applications to keep running in the background, for full functionality
 is debated. </span></span></strong><span><span>About the background tasks in Windows Phone 8.1, Located the Battery Saver from the app list and background app control to adjust settings.</span></span><span>
 However, the process is understood to be far more reaching on a level passed WP8.1 users access. Otherwise the failure would not continue to occur.
</span><strong><span>The matter of setting up on the phone this Zoiper application is necessitated out of numerous call forwarding failures to WP8.1 number, which would send a caller to WP8.1 voice mail revealing private phone number
 and moving calls from the VOIP personal business &nbsp;network of calls causing delays in turn around response for the calls.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>B) Says Zoiper:</span></span></span></strong><span><span>The
 only way to reliably achieve incoming calls or messages is to use PUSH notifications. When the option "use PUSH" is enabled in the zoiper for WP8 preferences, an extra header X-PUSH-URI will be sent in the SIP packets that includes a PUSH URL. "Unfortunately
 this will require changes to the dial plan on your PBX or SIP PROXY, and if you are not managing your server yourself, please forward these instructions to your voip provider or PBX administrator to enjoy incoming calls." says Zoiper.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>C)
</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Says Phone.com VoIp</span></span><span>:
</span></span></strong><span><span>Please note that the following are known factors that determine whether or not a VoIP app can work reliably and consistently on a mobile phone:<br />
<br />
1) Your cellular carrier (network). VoLTE is still under deployment in a lot of markets. Even networks that do support VoLTE may support it only in certain areas, and/or have restrictions regarding which accounts get VoLTE calls. Certain carriers restrict VoLTE
 calls only between their own subscribers. It's best to check with your cellular provider regarding VoLTE availability.<br />
<br />
2) The cell phone device manufacturer (OEM). Even if the mobile device's internal modem supports VoLTE, and the cellular network also has support, the OEMs (Samsung, LG, HTC etc.) can choose to disable VoLTE when an app that would make use of it is running
 in the background. In some cases, they offer a setting to toggle whether or not VoLTE can run in the background and it might be disabled by default to save battery life.<br />
<br />
3) The mobile operating system. Starting from Android Lollipop, Google has officially supported VoLTE. Apple has been supporting VoLTE since iOS 8. We already know you can run the app when it is in the foreground, so I do not suspect this to be the cause of
 the issues you're having.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">June 25, 2014</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) uses Direct Push technology to keep data on a Windows Phone device synchronized with data on a Microsoft Exchange server.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Direct Push optimization</span></strong></p>
<div style="text-align: center">
</div>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Direct Push Technology has two parts; one resides on the phone (client), and the other resides on an Exchange Server:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Windows Phone (client): The EAS feature on the phone manages Direct Push communication with the Exchange server. It establishes an HTTP or HTTPS connection with the server for a specified
 time, and then it goes to sleep while waiting for the server to respond. The server responds with either a status indicating that new items were received or that no new items arrived. The phone then sends either a synchronization request or another Direct
 Push request. The rate at which this occurs is dynamically adjusted based on parameters set by the OEM or mobile operator and the time limits for an idle HTTP or HTTPS connection on the operator's network and the customer's enterprise network.
</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Exchange Server: An Exchange Server with the Client Access Server role installed has a Direct Push component that augments the Exchange ActiveSync infrastructure by supporting manual and
 scheduled synchronization. Exchange Server uses IP-based notifications to deliver email, contact, calendar, and task updates to a phone as soon as the information arrives at the server.
</span></span></li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">When data changes on the server, the changes are transmitted to the phone over a persistent HTTP or HTTPS connection that is used for Direct Push. The time-out
 value in the mobile operator's network specifies how long the persistent connection is maintained with no activity. To keep this connection from timing out between updates, the phone reissues a request when the server responds. This periodic transmission is
 referred to as the heartbeat. The heartbeat is what maintains the connection to the server for Direct Push; each heartbeat alerts the server that the phone is ready to receive data.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Direct Push process</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Direct Push traffic behaves like small HTTP requests to an Internet web site that takes a long time to issue a response. Microsoft recommends that the content
 of the packets be encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to make it difficult to identify Direct Push traffic by packet sniffing. The following steps describe the Direct Push process:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The client issues an HTTP message known as a ping request to an Exchange server, asking the server to report whether any changes occurred in the user’s mailbox within a specified time
 limit. In the ping request, the client specifies the folders that Exchange should monitor for changes. Typically, these are the inbox, calendar, contacts, and tasks.
</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>When Exchange receives this request, it monitors the specified folders until one of the following occurs:
</span></span>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The time limit expires. The time limit is determined by the shortest time-out value in the network path. If this occurs, Exchange issues an HTTP 200 OK response to the client.
</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>A change occurs in one of the folders, such as the arrival of mail. If this occurs, Exchange issues a response to the request and identifies the folder in which the change occurred.
</span></span></li></ol>
</li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The client reacts to the response from the Exchange server in one of the following ways:
</span></span>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If it receives an HTTP 200 OK response indicating that no change occurred, it reissues the ping request.
</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If it receives a response other than HTTP 200 OK, it issues a synchronization request for each folder that has changed. When the synchronization is complete, it reissues the ping request.
</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If it does not receive a response from the Exchange server within the time specified, it lowers the time interval in the ping request and reissues the request.
</span></span></li></ol>
</li></ol>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Direct Push Adjustment</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">During the Direct Push process, the phone waits for successive round trips before attempting to adjust the amount of time it needs to keep a connection
 open with the server. The amount of time that the server should wait for Personal Information Manager (PIM) changes or new mail to arrive before sending OK to the client is called the heartbeat interval.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The heartbeat interval is specified by the client and is sent as part of the ping request. The heartbeat begins at the default rate. The Direct Push algorithm
 on the client then dynamically adjusts the heartbeat interval to maintain the maximum time between heartbeats without exceeding the time-out value. The adjustment is based on network conditions, time limits on idle HTTP or HTTPS connections on the network,
 and some settings that the mobile operator can specify.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To determine the optimal heartbeat interval, the client keeps a log of ping requests. If a ping request receives a response, the client increases the interval.
 If no response is received at the end of the interval, the client determines that the network timed out and decreases the interval. Using this algorithm, the client eventually determines the longest idle connection possible across the wireless network and
 corporate firewall. The following steps describe the communication of how the heartbeat interval is adjusted during typical Direct Push communication between the client and the Exchange server:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The client wakes up and issues an HTTP request over the Internet to the Exchange server, and then goes to sleep. To keep the session active, the request specifies the heartbeat interval,
 which is the amount of time that the server should wait for PIM changes or new mail to arrive before sending OK to the client. In this illustration, the heartbeat interval is 15 minutes.
</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Because no mail arrived during the heartbeat interval, the server returns an HTTP 200 OK.
</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The client wakes up at the end of the heartbeat interval plus 1 minute (15 + 1 = 16 minutes total).
</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Because no mail arrived during the heartbeat interval, the server returns an HTTP 200 OK.
</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The server response wakes up the client. Because the connection did not time out during the interval, the client determines that the network can support idle connections for at least this
 length of time. </span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If this was a successive round trip, the client determines that it can increase the interval for the next request.
</span></span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Direct Push and firewall settings</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">For Direct Push to work through the network firewall, TCP port 443 must be open. This port is required for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and must be opened
 between the Internet and the Client Access server.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The network idle connection time-out indicates how long a connection is permitted to live without traffic after a TCP connection is fully established.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The firewall session interval must be set to allow the heartbeat interval and enterprise session interval to communicate effectively. If the firewall closes
 the session, mail would be undelivered until the client reconnects, and the user could be unsynchronized for long periods of time. By setting the firewall session timeout equal to or greater than the idle timeout on the mobile operator's network, the firewall
 will not close the session. </span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th><span>Tip</span> </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Microsoft recommends setting the firewall's idle connection timeouts as follows:</span>
<ol>
<li>
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Mobile operators should set the idle connection timeouts on outgoing firewalls to 30 minutes.
</span></li><li>
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Organizations should set timeouts on their incoming firewalls to 30 minutes.
</span></li></ol>

</tbody>
</table>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Web servers, network security appliances, and system network stacks have several time-based thresholds that are intended to insulate them from insufficiently
 tested or malicious clients. You can safely increase the idle connection time-out setting without compromising the security of the network. The following table shows examples of attacks and describes how other settings are used to mitigate exposure to them:</span></p>
<table>


<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span>A DoS attack is launched by failing to complete the handshake that is implicit in the creation of a TCP connection. The attacker attempts to create a large number of partially open TCP connections.
</span></td>
<td><span>Increasing the idle connection time-outs is unrelated to this type of attack. The time within which a TCP handshake must be completed is a separate threshold that is governed by the Windows TCP/IP stack.</span>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>A DoS attack is launched against IIS by opening a large number of TCP connections but never issuing an HTTP request over any of them.
</span></td>
<td><span>Increasing the idle connection time-outs is unrelated to this type of attack. IIS mitigates this threat by requiring that a client submit a fully formed HTTP request within a certain time before dropping the connection.
 The name of the connection time-out setting in the IIS management console is misleading; TCP connections are closed when the connection time-out value is exceeded (120 seconds by default).</span>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>An attacker establishes a large number of TCP connections, issues HTTP requests over all of them, but never consumes the responses.</span>
</td>
<td><span>Increasing idle connection time-outs is unrelated to this type of attack. This threat is mitigated by the same time-out as the previous scenario. The connection time-out setting in IIS defines the time within which
 a client must issue either its first request after a TCP connection is established or a subsequent request in an HTTP keep-alive scenario.</span>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A short time-out value causes the mobile phone to initiate a new HTTPS request more frequently. This can shorten the battery life of the mobile phone. Higher
 heartbeat intervals result in longer battery life for the phone.</span></p>

    <title>Tables in Word 10 and customised page numbering - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> suechilderstone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tables in Word 10 and customised page numbering</h2>
                    <p>Hi, i have two issues with a word document. I need to create a table the whole size of a page which i have done but when i enter text it moves the table on to the next page automatically. Am i able to fix a table to one page without it moving down when inputing
 text? So i can make a tamplate document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another problem is i have the same document inherited from someone that has page numbers in the footnote which are roman numbers with normal numbers i.e. I/1, I/2; IV/1, IV/2 etc, these relate to specific sections of the document autonumbered which is what
 i need, i just cant work out how they customised the numbering with the roman numerals and numbers as the formating is not giving me an option for both and its autonumbering so its not just been typed in??&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be very grateful for help on this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Page numbers are fields. Their format is primarily controlled by the format page number dialog. However, they can have formatting "switches" which will override the settings in the format page numbers dialog. The switches can be: \*roman and \*arabic Those
 switches override the settings in the dialog. Note that if you have a Table of Contents, that will reflect the formatting set in the dialog.See:</p>

I'm not sure what your notations mean. Is the second number the Section number? That is not a page number field.

            Charles, many thanks for the guidance. I do have a contents page. The Roman number in the page numbers refers to the Section and the numbers refer to the page number in that section if that makes sense.&nbsp;

In recent versions of Word, wrapped tables are allowed to break across pages. This is a Compatibility Option in Word 2003 ("Don't break wrapped tables across pages") that is enabled if you set Compatibility back to Word 2000 (so it's evidently been possible
 since Word 2002). The&nbsp;option ("Layout Option") still exists in Word 2010, but in Word 2013 and above, this and many other layout options are available only in .doc files.

<p>Wrt the page numbering: What do you see if you press <strong>Alt+F9</strong>? I'm guessing that the heading number is a StyleRef field. The
<strong>Page Number Format</strong> dialog allows you to add a "chapter number" that is the paragraph number of an autonumbered paragraph in one of Word's built-in heading styles, but the slash is not one of the offered separator characters, and the { PAGE
 } field that is created doesn't reflect the formatting, so there's no way to change the separator. So I would expect that you might be seeing this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>{ STYLEREF "Heading 1" \n &nbsp;}/{ PAGE }</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>While this will give the result you're looking for, the chapter number won't be picked up by the TOC. If you use one of the default separators (hyphen, period, colon, em dash, en dash), then the number will appear the same in the TOC.</p>

<h2>            6288 &#38;amp&#59; 6230i</h2>
                    Hello<br />
<br />
I've got some problems with this two phones. First of all I'd like to know how many contacts (circa) can them hold on. I'm trying to copy contacts from 6230i to 6288 by using PC Suite version 6.84 and after about 85% program shows me info that 6288 has no memory
 left (what a suprise - 6288 has only 5 MB internal memory).<br />
<br />
Second question: can I copy selected contacts to SIM card in PC Suite or must I do this from contacts menu in phone?<br />
<br />
Third question: is it possible to copy contacts to additional card?<br />
<br />
Fourth question: will additional card from 6230i work in 6288?<br />
<br />
Final question (to Nokia): why newer phone has less memory than the old one? Can you explain this phenomenon? But thanks to You I teach my lesson - when I'll buy another Nokia phone I won't be checking nonsense tech information about display, connections etc.
 but first of all I will check internal memory.<br />
<br />
best regards

            replying to your fourth question<br />
both the mmc are not compatible u can use a memory card reader and try copying.<br />
third qestion:u can try syncronising to outlook express.<br />
second question:it is not posible to copy selected contacts to sim card using pc suite as pc suite backs up only phone memory and not the sim/mmc memory.<br />
this phone should be able to hold Phonebook memory for 500 names, up to 5 phone numbers

<p>Can anybody help, as the admin of our school site, I am unable to access OneDrive and OneNote app on IOS&nbsp; OneNote and OneDrive.&nbsp; When I try I enter my school email account and then school email account and password - it just takes me back to a black username
 and password screen (our school logon).&nbsp; I can logon on iPAD to office365.&nbsp; I had thought this was an issue with me being an admin, but have now tried this on a user account.</p>
<p>This is something I am testing out - our staff already use 365 but normally on iPads and I keen to get this up and running correctly before they&nbsp;do!</p>
<p>Any pointers would be very helpful at this stage.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the question. I am sorry to hear that you are&nbsp;not able&nbsp;to send and receive e-mails from Outlook 2007. I will need a little information before we proceed.</p>
<p>1. What is the Anti-Virus program installed on the computer?<br />
2. Were there any updates installed recently for windows and anti-virus program?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the following article which discusses about the common causes and resolution for send receive errors in Outlook 2007:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/813514" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/813514</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the steps provided in the above article helps you. If you still have questions, please let me know.</p>

            <p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for replying along with providing additional information. Let us restart the computer in Clean Boot and check if we are able to send/receive e-mails.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the following article on How to restart the computer in Clean Boot:<br />
<b>Windows Vista/ 7</b> : <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
<b>Windows XP :</b><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are able to send receive e-mails, then the issue might be with the 3 party software conflicting in the normal mode. Follow the below article to perform advanced Clean Boot to check which application is interfering with Outlook 2007:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are unable to send/receive, then remove and re-add the e-mail account. If that does not help then let us create a new profile in Outlook and setup the e-mail account:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try the above steps and reply if you still have problems with the Outlook 2007 send/receive issue. I will be more than happy to help you further.</p>

</p><p>I know how important this is to you. However, there is no option to recover deleted conversation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be advised that last 30 days of your conversation history are also stored in the cloud, this is the reason why you still have access when you're signed in to Skype on your mobile device.

            This is often caused by having a virus scanner installed which integrates itself with Outlook.<br />
Uninstall this integration part of your virus scanner and try again; you'd still be sufficiently protected by your on-access scanner part of the virus scanner. For more details see;<br />

            I don't think this is the problem.&nbsp; I recently switched to MS Security Essentials and I don't believe it does that type of integration with Outlook.

            <p>There seems to be an ongoing problem with pop3/imapi reception in outlook 2010.
</p>
<p>One the same exchange 2000 server i have at least 4 computers running email clients from outlook 2002 - outlook 2003 - thunderbird, my windows&nbsp;ce phone, my android G2, my blackberry all work pop3/imap on my account with zero problems.</p>
<p>My windows 7 64 bit ultimate with outlook 2010, my xp computer with outlook 2010 and my server 2003 with outlook 2010 (remote desktop server) all will only download a few emails through pop3 and imap from the same account on the same server. However the
 same 2003 remote desktop server using outlook 2003 works perfectly. I want/need to upgrade everyone to the outlook 2010 for other features other then email (sharepoint programs) but do not wish to upgrade my exchange server. It's been running since 2001 and
 does its job flawlessly.</p>
<p>also the 2010 outlooks do the exact samething pop3 and imap on comcast.net, gmail and two other pop3 service providers so it is narrowed down to the outlook version as the problem.

<h2>            Why is Outlook.com constantly asking for Ad Cookies and how do I stop it permanently&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In recent months every time I open up my email account, which I've had for many years and was initially Hotmail, it asks me to accept Ad Cookies. Every time I click "Manage ad cookies," then the "Discard all changes" button, which does nothing, then the
 X in the top right corner of the window, followed by the "Discard" again, which seems to work. I use Firefox browser on a Windows 10 OS.</p>
<p>I want nothing to do with personalised ads and never have. I'm getting sick of it always asking and never saving my preference to NOT have them enabled. All I want is to not have to go through this (admittedly short and simple, though increasingly annoying)
 process each and every time I try and access my mail.</p>
<p>I am no stranger to computers and finding my way around a system, but am unwilling to just go changing things unless there's at least a little guidance on the topic, but nothing I find in the forums mentions anything like this, and is all about "how to enable
 cookies" or "Outlook won't function without cookies enabled". I can access Outlook.com just fine and have no prohibitive issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help on this issue would be appreciated, thanks to all who assist.</p>
