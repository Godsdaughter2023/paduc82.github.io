<h2>            WIndows 10 Driver Problem- Driver won&#39;t load, but works in other PC&#39;s with WIndows 10 - Error messages don&#39;t help- Error Code 28</h2>
                    <p>Original Title [WIndows 10 Driver Problem - Driver won't load, but works in other PC's with WIndows 10 - Error messages don't help ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new PC that uses Windows 10. &nbsp; My scanner, a Canon 4400f, is not configured correctly as indicated in the Device Manager. &nbsp;I have tried every option that I know of and can find on the internet. &nbsp;Hopefully someone can help me here.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>Steps / Problems</p>
<p>1. &nbsp; The device manager shows that the scanner is not configured and has an exclamation point on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp; If I go into Properties, it says:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28)<br />
<br />
There is no driver selected for the device information set or element.<br />
<br />
<br />
To find a driver for this device, click Update Driver.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp; If I try to update the driver (both automatically and manually), it says:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Windows encountered a problem installing the driver software for your device</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Windows found driver software for your device but encountered an error while attempting to install it. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">CanoScan 4400f</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">There is no driver selected for the device information set or element.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp; I have tried this on another PC with Windows 10 and everything worked, so there is something different on my new PC. &nbsp;But the error doesn't give much info to diagnose further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. &nbsp; &nbsp;I have tried restarting where Windows doesn't check for being digitally signed. &nbsp;The same error occurs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>6. &nbsp; I get the following in the event log:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Driver Management concluded the process to install driver NULL Driver for Device Instance ID USB\VID_04A9&amp;PID_2228\5&amp;29057CD7&amp;0&amp;7 with the following status: 0x0.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what else to do. &nbsp;I have downloaded drivers from Canon, I have installed and uninstalled 100 times, I have tried automatic and manual install. &nbsp; I appreciate any help that anyone can give. &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

            <p>Ok, I broke and contacted Microsoft support. &nbsp; They tried the basic things and then blamed Dell, Canon, me, etc. &nbsp; This is not a Windows issue even though the same device and driver works with other Windows 10 machines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that that I decided, to reset Windows 10 back to original. &nbsp; I am not sure if it reinstalls or what. &nbsp; After that, Windows stopped giving the cryptic error message and installed the driver right away. &nbsp; Everything worked. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, for all of the people that have had the issue where Windows fails to load a driver that it found and gives the error message that tells nothing, try reverting Windows back to original. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Jim, version 1809 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

            <p>Hello Navra_purple,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for asking the Question!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Sorry to know that you face issues with Startup message . As I get it right you get an error message " the procedure entry point InitializeKeyHook could not be located in the dynamic link library hccutils.DLL" during startup.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Free Upgrade for BIOS-embedded Windows 8 Key &#43; Dual - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr. alan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Free Upgrade for BIOS-embedded Windows 8 Key &#43; Dual Boot</h2>
                    <p>I have seen the previous question <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/dual-boot-windows-10-with-same-copy-of-windows-10/5264e1de-0079-4dde-b7c3-dcfae5b8582c">
https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/dual-boot-windows-10-with-same-copy-of-windows-10/5264e1de-0079-4dde-b7c3-dcfae5b8582c</a>, but neither the question nor the answer is quite specific enough to what I'm asking or having
 issue with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two partitions that I dual boot between.&nbsp; Both are Windows 10 Pro free upgrades, based on a Windows 8.1 Pro key embedded in the Dell Precision T3610 machine's BIOS / SMBIOS.&nbsp; I've been using this configuration successfully since Windows 10 1511 or
 1607 (guessing) without any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This week I noticed that one of the two Windows 10 Pro installations no longer shows as activated.&nbsp; (We're on 1703 now of course; specifically 15063.540.)&nbsp; Truthfully I don't know when it happened.&nbsp; I only noticed because I went to configure taskbar properties,
 and Windows show the "to personalize you must activate" message.&nbsp; I had also replaced my NVIDIA with an AMD video card a couple weeks ago; but again, I don't know if it happened then, nor have I ever had a video-card-only change trigger re-activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The activation error its giving on the second partition is 0xc004e016, even if I manually input the OEM Windows 8.1 Pro key retrieved from BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run the activation Troubleshooter, it reports "A digital license for Windows 10 Pro was found for this device running Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; To use this license, you must install Windows 10 Pro."&nbsp; So it confirms that I have a valid Windows 10 Pro license
 for this device (as expected), but then behaves as though Windows 10 Pro is not the version of Windows I'm already running (not as expected).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess the real question or maybe bug report I'm trying to get to here is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft definitely provided me with "a license to run Windows 10 Pro on this device."&nbsp; But it appears as though maybe something is unintentionally (or maybe intentionally) not expecting "the Windows 10 Pro instance on this device is not just a static /
 single instance."&nbsp; i.e. One way to look at this "dual boot between two different Windows 10 installations" is that it's "no different" than if I&nbsp;was doing&nbsp;a full disc backup &amp; full disc restore to switch between the separately configured&nbsp;copies of Windows
 I intend to run on this machine.&nbsp; I just happen to be dual-booting instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this scenario being accidently blocked, simply because the "a different but valid installation of Windows 10 could appear on this same device at any time" wasn't taken into account?&nbsp; Or is this a known an intentionally blocked scenario, in which case
 a separate Windows 10 license is now needed (ever since 1703?&nbsp;15063.540?) to keep the dual-boot configuration valid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I don't mind getting a second license too much, if that's really the specific requirement.&nbsp; But my next question will of course be "Will /that/ screw things up for a different reason?"&nbsp; i.e. One of my dual-boot Windows 10 Pro installations depending
 on the BIOS-embedded Windows 8.1 Pro key with a free upgrade entitlement on this device, and the other dual-boot Windows 10 Pro installation being "a real license."&nbsp; Is that going to intentionally or unintentionally invalidate the Windows 10 Pro free upgrade
 entitlement license that Microsoft's activation servers currently have "on file" for this device?</p>

<p>Earlier in the release of Windows 10 1607, a loop hole was discovered through Digital Licensing that could let you install an additional instance of Windows 10 on the same machine because of the digital entitlement. Its not known, but Microsoft might have
 discovered and closed the loophole and going back to the original tenets of the licensing agreement, which says, 1 license, 1 computer. Having a second install using the same license on a second partition would seen as a separate machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should try chat support and attempt reactivation using the BIOS key:</p>

<p>Thank you Andre. &nbsp;I wasn't ignoring you; for whatever reason the "Notify me when someone responds to this post" never fired in response to your reply, or it got dropped somewhere before my mailbox. &nbsp;Tonight I just received the "we noticed you haven't had
 an answer yet" email, and I finally saw your reply.<br />
<br />
I actually came here and posted this message after going through the Microsoft chat support. &nbsp;I thought they would just make me go through the phone activation steps and that would be that, since this is what has always resolved me in the past upon the rare
 activation issue. &nbsp;But the wording of a specific error message seemed to get my chat support session off-track.<br />
<br />
The message for activation error 0xc004e016 says "Error 0xc004e016 On a computer running microsoft windows non-core edition, run 'slui.exe 0x2a 0xc004e016' to display the error text." &nbsp;Well the support agent on the other end of the chat could not be convinced
 that this message means "you can display additional text about this error if you are running a non-core version of Windows." &nbsp;i.e. If you're not on a non-UI installation of Windows Server, you'll be able to display the additional text.<br />
<br />
But they insisted, and to the best that I can tell, "made up" some facts, to support "this message means you're currently on a corrupted non-core installation of Windows, and that is the problem. &nbsp;You must re-install in order to get a core installation of Windows
 to resolve this."<br />
<br />
So that was the end of my chat support session. &nbsp;I'm on Windows 10, and there isn't a core edition of the desktop platform, even if in some parallel universe that was somehow the issue.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>&gt; Having a second install using the same license on a</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>&gt; second partition would seen as a separate machine.</em></strong><br />
<br />
I can understand how that would make a reasonable answer. &nbsp;But what are we basing that assertion on? &nbsp;If I could have cited Microsoft ever declaring "an independent installation of Windows on the same computer is considered to not be the same machine", then
 I wouldn't have ever raised the question to begin with.<br />
<br />
Meaning, even though this answer is plausible, is it <em>actually</em> the answer? &nbsp;Or is it just a reasonable explanation that we can neither prove nor disprove. &nbsp;Are we saying the Windows computer SID or something like that is also involved in the activation
 calculation? &nbsp;Does simply changing the computer SID on an existing install -- let alone trying to have to separate installations with separate SIDs on otherwise the same machine -- would also trigger reactivation / loss of activation?<br />
<br />
Sorry for my questioning, but it just doesn't "make sense" to me, even if Microsoft was enforcing 100% of their EULA. &nbsp;If I'm licensed for just one machine -- or even if it was one user, for that matter -- I haven't exceeded either of those things. &nbsp;I don't
 have two installations of Windows running concurrently; it's dual-boot. &nbsp;When sending the "hardware fingerprint" to Microsoft activation servers, it's still matching the same single device I'm licensed for.<br />
<br />
To be complete, I also have to take issue with "in Windows 10 1607 there was a loop hole", because I've been doing this with every edition of Windows 10, and even the previous versions of Windows. &nbsp;(Not withstanding that their licensing is different from Windows
 10's.) &nbsp;So if this ability has been intentionally closed on me, it's not something that was first possible in 1607. &nbsp;Or at least, the ability I'm talking about was not something only possible in 1607.<br />
<br />
But if you read this far, I'll tell you: I simply left the machine alone, and let it continue coming up as non-activated. &nbsp;At some point (two days ago is when I first noticed), the issue is now resolved, and the dual-boot partition re-activated again successfully
 on its own. &nbsp;So Microsoft again "allows" something now, if the failure was ever intentional to begin with.<br />
<br />
Meaning things are back to "the way it has always worked for me", and both of the dual-boot paritions now consider themselves activated. &nbsp;We'll see how long that lasts. &nbsp;But again, this is not "unusual" from my perspective. &nbsp;I've been doing this ever since
 Windows 10 1507. &nbsp;It's always worked, and at least to me, always made sense that it worked based on what I know (and maybe don't know) about how the licensing actually works.<br />

                    I am bringing up a new&nbsp; windows 7 pro computer.<br />
<br />
The operating system does not allow me to copy files with the .CMP or .REP extensions.<br />
I did not create these files they are associated with a very important program that I use.<br />
<br />
I am using a drag and drop copy from my old computer to my new computer.<br />
The old computer is an xp pro machine.<br />
they are connected using 100mbps ethernet<br />
The program is Altium.<br />

<h2>            Help&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I am trying to fix my aunt's old laptop. Recently, she had to reinstall Windows XP because she downloaded a virus of some sort. Of course, the re-install only gave her SP1. After much looking around, I was able to find her SP2.. but the problem is I cannot
 download anything on to her laptop. I have to find it on my pc and burn it to disc, then install it on her laptop. Presently, she is running the SP2 and IE7. I found a standalone version of SP3 and burnt it to disc, but the certificate is no longer valid (expired
 in 2009), so I cannot install it. Again, a large part of the problem is that I cannot download ANYTHING directly to this laptop.. I also can't do an automatic update because the scanning doesn't work. Is this all happening because she is on such an old Service
 Pack? or is there another underlying issue? I do not believe she has any virus because there is nothing on this pc at all.. I even had to reinstall her ethernet driver just to connect to the internet. Can anyone help me

 2/22/2009. I've downloaded (and burnt) both .exe files and ISO files. they both end with the same message.</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
<div>(I feel this warranted a separate post, especially for the many others who are experiencing the same&nbsp;frustration&nbsp;and hopefully stumble upon this thread.)<br />
<br />
I have seen this behavior when a problematic PC attempts to download the installation file. However, if one uses a working PC (patched and without any malware) to download the file to a USB flash drive, it always works. (Well, I have yet to hear any reports
 of it not working...)</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can always use a program like <a href="http://www.slavasoft.com/hashcalc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HashCalc</a> to determine the integrity of the file:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>MD5: &nbsp;bb25707c919dd835a9d9706b5725af58</div>
<div><br />
<div>SHA1: &nbsp;c81472f7eeea2eca421e116cd4c03e2300ebfde4</div>
<div><br />
<div>In the event that there is something wrong with the Microsoft server (lately, there HAVE been all sorts of problems!), a Google search for</div>
<div><br />
<div>WindowsXP-KB936929-SP3-x86-ENU.exe</div>
<div><br />
<div>... yields tons of hits. Here is a safe one:</div>

<div><br />
<div>Again, check the MD5 and SHA1 hash values to be 100% safe and sure. :-)</div>

<div><br />
<div>Select Windows XP. You need to ideally install drivers for chipset, network (it sounds like you already did), graphics, and audio.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, you said your aunt had to "resintall Windows." But that term is vague since it can mean three different things: Clean Install, Repair Install, or Parallel Install. Without knowing what really happened and since IE was upgraded too early, I really
 think that flattening and rebuilding is the way to go. (I sure hope her important data were backed up!)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, for best results, use a working PC to download t<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">he SP3 installation file</a> to a USB flash drive. (You cannot use Windows Update unless SP3 is installed! And if
 you do not use a working PC, the download might go belly up.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>In case you didn't see my directions from the other thread, here they are:</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><span>Preliminary work:</span>
<div><br />
<div>Download the installation files for SP3, IE8, and Microsoft Security Essentials, which is an effective antivirus/antimalware program. I prefer to keep these (and other useful files) on a USB flash drive, but that part is optional. Here are the links for
 all three installation files:</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=24</a>&nbsp;(for SP3)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>(You may TOTALLY disregard the "intended for IT Professionals" message!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=43" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=43</a>&nbsp;(for IE8)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials</a>&nbsp;(for MSE)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Physically disconnect from the Internet. Also disconnect all unnecessary peripherals!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. Temporarily disable Automatic Updates. To do this:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Start | Control Panel (switch to Classic View if not already selected) | Automatic Updates</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Select "Turn off Automatic Updates" and click OK.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3. Install SP3. Reboot TWICE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Upgrade to IE8. Reboot TWICE. (Note: It is important to leave IE at the IE6 level before upgrading to SP3. After you are at SP3, then you may upgrade IE6 to IE8.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Install MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Very often what happens is someone has&nbsp;their antivirus program&nbsp;running while they are trying to install SP3, which often results in chaos! That is why it should be done AFTER SP3 and IE are installed.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Make sure Windows firewall is enabled (it should already be):</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Start | Control Panel | Security Center</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Now you can physically reconnect to the Internet. Update Antivirus program.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.update.microsoft.com/windowsupdate/v6/default.aspx?ln=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update</a>&nbsp;to download and install only critical security updates. Reboot whenever prompted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Re-enable Automatic Updates.</p>

<h2>            How could DirectX 11 possibly be outdated&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So. I bought a new laptop a few days back, and got around to installing games. I checked my DirectX to make sure it was version 11, got Steam on the computer, and attempted to start gaming. However, I got the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Your DirectX Runtime is out of date. Download and install this file from Microsoft."</p>
<p>
</p><p>and it opened up the DirectX download page on the Microsoft website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try downloading it as told twice, but both downloads failed to install the correct versions on multiple occasions. That's probably due to the fact that I'm running Windows 8.1 and cannot revert to a lesser stage of DirectX, but the latest version refuses
 to work on most of the games I have tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any tips on how to fix this, or do you think Steam is responsible? Also, has anyone else had the same problem?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file you most likely need is the DirectX Runtime June 2010, which is a optional update that a lot of games need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even my Lexmark printer requires it... I will include a link to the full installer...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a self extracting package. It will extract after double clicking on it so be sure to note the location where you\it extracted.</p>
<p>Then open the folder and double click DXSETUP.</p>

            <p>The game's version check might not recognize your version of DirectX.&nbsp; I know some websites I use think IE 11 is actually IE 1.&nbsp; I guess they never planned to see two digits?&nbsp; Who knows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you might try this:&nbsp; right-click the icon for the game, choose "troubleshoot compatibility" and use that function to see if it fixes the issue. Among the many things it can do, one is that it can trick the program by reporting a different version number.</p>

    <title>Why did my file names change for my ripped music. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sean gnant  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why did my file names change for my ripped music.</h2>
                    <p>I have about 1500 CD's I have ripped&nbsp;as full 16bit 44k .wav files, basically uncompressed.&nbsp; I don't know how or why, but&nbsp;recently EVERY album directory has had ONLY the first song renamed to "01 Track 1.wav".&nbsp; All the rest of the songs in each album directory
 are fine and have maintained the ripped music information, but every&nbsp;first song&nbsp;has been renamed on the drive as I described.&nbsp; The author,&nbsp;album&nbsp;fields have also been changed to "Unknown".</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get the original file information back on the file name?&nbsp; And more important, how do I prevent this from happening again.&nbsp; I'll be darned if I am going to re-rip every CD for just the first track.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In an attempt to fix this, I have wiped my media library database in Media Player and started from scratch.&nbsp; And when I reloaded the media library I have the options selected to "<em>Retrieve additional information</em>" and to "<em>Overwrite all media information</em>"&nbsp;
 I also have checked "<em>rename music files using rip music settings</em>" and "<em>rearrange music in rip music folder using rip music settings</em>".&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, while this will change the file name to the correct song, it does not change any of the rest of the fields.&nbsp; The author and album field are still "unknown".&nbsp; How do I get the original metadata back?&nbsp; Besides re-ripping all my collection.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any suggestions, I am open to hearing them.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sean</p>

            <p>Hi Sean,</p>
<p>I sympathize!&nbsp; So have you wiped all the metadata you had by doing the library reload or is it still just the Tr 01 data that is wrong? You may find the only practical option is re-ripping and I'd advise
<em>against</em> having those wmp options set because they might overwrite correct information.</p>
<p>The 'connect to internet' setting is required and so is the 'display media information from the internet' option in the 'Privacy' tab. In the 'Library' tab the only box I check is the 'volume levelling' one...</p>
<p>I believe there is&nbsp;3rd party software that will enable metadata writing for wav. and flac. files but I prefer avoiding those personally...there is however a useful music editing program called 'Audacity' which may help you&nbsp;resolve the Tr 01 issue...it does
 permit the addition of a certain amount of data when you re-save a file. I have been using it for four + years now and it does not seem to cause any conflicts. Here's an image of the save screen for a wav. file...&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me know what you want to do.... Cheers
 - Ric.</p>

    <title>Why does my mapped drive only show offline folders when I&#39;m - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greg edwards mvp alumnus &#40;2010-2014&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does my mapped drive only show offline folders when I&#39;m connected via VPN&#63;</h2>
                    I have configured offline access to a folder on a mapped network share (let's call it U:\projects) so that I can work with the files when I'm disconnected from the office. I also use my company's VPN solution (Juniper Connect), which allows me to map my
 usual network drives once connected (via a locally executed script called MapDrives.hta). I have a bunch of other mapped corporate network drives, and once I'm connected to the VPN and mapped, I can see those folders' contents. However, when I try to access
 the U: drive (or its network path, let's call it \\companyserver\shared) over the VPN, I can only see the aforementioned folder (projects) I've configured for offline access, even though there are many other folders in that location. Any idea why?

<div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
<div>It appears that Corel Painter X is not compatible with Windows 7. Corel Painter X is not listed in the Windows 7 compatibility website. Click&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;type=Software&amp;s=Corel%20Painter%20X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>
 .<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let’s try the below methods and check if it helps</div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div><br />
<div>It seems to be compatible with Windows XP and Vista. I'd suggest you run Corel Painter X in&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows compatibility mode</a> .<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue persists, check if&nbsp;Windows Installer Service is started and set to Automatic.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To open services console, please see the step below,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Click on Start Orb, and type services.msc and hit enter to open it.</div>
<div>b. In Services Console window, find and locate Windows Installer service.</div>
<div>c. If the service is stopped, start the service and set it to “Automatic” or restart the service if it is already started.</div>
<div>d. Reboot your computer and check if you are able to install the software programs you would like to.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>unregister Windows Installer, and then reregister Windows Installer and check if it helps. To do this, follow these steps:&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a. On the "Start" menu, click "Run.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
b. In the "Open" box, type "msiexec /unreg", and then press ENTER.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
c. On the "Start" menu, click "Run".&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
d. In the "Open" box, type "msiexec /regserver", and then press ENTER.</div>
<div><br />

    <title>delete photo library cache - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saloei  say:</h3>
<h2>            delete photo library cache</h2>
                    <p>My device: Surface RT with latest updates - March 19.2013</p>
<p>I will show the steps&nbsp;I added and deleted pictures.</p>
<p>1. I added my SD card with its picture/video files to Pictures Library app. All images/videos on card showed&nbsp;in the library app with no problem</p>
<p>2. I've deleted a few&nbsp;image/video files&nbsp;on the SD card using Windows Explorer -&nbsp;I didn't use the Pictures Library app to delete the files</p>
<p>The file formats are JPG and MPG.</p>
<p>There are no devices synced to this pc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem: The deleted files still show in the Pictures Library app when I OPEN it but are not viewable. When I select the file from within the Pictures Library app and choose Delete, this error message appears: This file couldn't be deleted. Make sure
 another app isn't using this file, or you have permission to delete it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These deleted files are not on the SD card. This message appears even after doing a fresh cold reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can&nbsp;I clear the Pictures Library app cache without going through the troubleshooting processes of using the "selective start up"&nbsp;setting in Msconfig?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

Is this issue specific to the current Story or does<br />
it happen with other video files as well?<br />
<br />
Windows XP SP3?<br />
<br />
Are you running Windows Media Player 11?<br />
<br />
How many photos? <br />
<br />
Lots of motion and transitions?<br />
<br />
Did you add music files? If yes, what formats?<br />
<br />
There is a possibility that reducing your Graphics <br />

                    <p>I am running Windows XP on a Lenovo T400 laptop. While doing a routine file backup using Lenovo's backup tool I got the following error message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unable to back up 'C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET.\Framework\v.2.0.50727\CONFIG\security.config.cch.7324.447173109'
 because the file is either corrupted or being used by another application. Please close any application that could be using the file.</p>
<p>I had closed all applications so the file must be corrupt. How do I go about removing and replaciing this file? Thanks.</p>

            Try this:<br />
1. Set your BIOS so that it uses the DVD drive as its primary boot device.<br />
2. Boot the machine with your Windows 7 Repair CD.<br />
3. Press a key if prompted to boot from the DVD.<br />
4. Select "Safe Mode Command Prompt" when prompted.<br />
5. Log on as Administrator if prompted.<br />
6. Select Repair when prompted.<br />
7. Select System Restore when prompted.<br />
8. Set Windows back to a point before this problem occurred.<br />
9. When finished, remove the CD before rebooting the system.<br />
In Step 2 you could also use your Windows 7 installation DVD. The subsequent steps are similar to the ones above.<br />
<br />
There is an overall issue which you should address immediately. Having just one single admin account is risky. One little incident and you're in deep trouble. You should have two fully tested admin accounts and write their details on a note which you file away
 in a safe place.

<br />Whoever installed it, might have installed a volume license (organization key) on your computer. 
<br />
<br />Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise volume license clients are used by large organizations that deploy Windows 10 in bulk to hundreds or thousands of computers. Sometimes, users will copy these organization keys off the Internet and use them to install Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise, but they are blocked from activating because it can't reach appropriate KMS host (Server computer) which handles the activation request.  
<br />
<br />You would need to purchase a genuine license for Windows 10 Pro from the Microsoft Store. If you can't afford Pro, you can purchase Home, make a bootable copy then perform a custom install.

            Hi Ionita, 
<br />
<br />Generally activation issues after a re-install are because a different Edition of Windows has been installed to the Edition than was previously installed and activated on that system . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - System 
<br />
<br />What Edition (Home, Pro . . etc.) is reported there? 
<br />
<br />If it is the correct Edition:

            If you have you license for Windows 10 Pro, then try updating the product key.
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation &gt; Change the product key then enter the new product key then click Next to Activate
<br />
<br />If you are unable to activate Windows 10 after all the above and you are certain you have the correct edition installed, then please attempt chat support:
<br />
<br />Activate Your Windows 10 License via Microsoft Chat Support

<br />
<br />If that key does not work, its likely not valid. 
<br />
<br />If the laptop was bought a year ago, in most cases, it likely came with Windows 10 Home, unless you specifically opted to have Windows 10 Pro installed at purchase. This is usually done through the manufacturers website.

I was unable to get my desktop or my laptop to recognize an external samsung dvd player. It showed up in the device manager in the section for usb devices but had the yellow triangle/exclamation point. A pop up window also said the device was unrecognizable.

            <p>Mate can I just say absolute genius - did the same thing with a bog standard replacement cable for my Samsung SE-208 DB external DVD-writer and computer recognised it immediately in Windows 10 (as you say, my drive had been recognised in Win 7 and 8 with
 the original cable but not Win 10). </p>
<p>
</p><p>My situation was slightly different in that I didn't even have&nbsp;a yellow question mark in the device manager over optical drives...my new computer flat out did not recognise anything was physically connected to the USB port.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else with the same problem - seriously recommend you test this first before getting into clean boots, tweaking the registry and all the other time consuming solutions :)</p>

<p>If you actually have a DVD burner and I believe you have do then down load free VLC media player anf you will be back on track. Because of Netflix and other media companies DVD players and hard drives will soon become a thing of the past. Hard drives will
 be replaced with icloud which you can get on a mac or PC. What you should have done and me too is kept your 8.1 and waited till you bought a new PC with Windows 10.
</p>
<p>I just bought a new Dell because my processor was wearing out. I make movies and interview people in the eighties&nbsp; edit a lot of Video on my PC and was told my new pc would be ideal for that with i7 processor hope this helps</p>

            <p>Hi Rhyan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your instruction ~&nbsp;however (<em>and maybe I'm a bit dense</em>) I am confused as to how can I follow the instructions to&nbsp;create &nbsp;a Windows Live Mail log file&nbsp;when I no longer HAVE any of&nbsp;that program installed ~ therefore I can not even complete
 the first step.&nbsp; &nbsp; I managed to&nbsp;get it Uninstalled (no program,&nbsp;directories or files remain).&nbsp; My fervent issue now is how to REinstall Windows Live Mail. (or Windows Essentials.......and MSE as well!!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I "think" I am&nbsp;(<strong>fortunately</strong>) able&nbsp;to access&nbsp;my Outlook mail&nbsp;thru an internet web connection as I do not have that program installed as a part of my 2010 &nbsp;MS OFFICE HOME and STUDENT.???&nbsp; I can find no reference to that program (Outlook )
 in any of&nbsp;my program or explorer&nbsp;files???&nbsp;&nbsp;I await&nbsp;further suggestions, which will be greatly appreciated!&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if the previous post was meant for me or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that I have updated windows, restarted it, disabled firewall and anti-virus and tried to install windows live offline. I've tried offline install with wlsetup-all.exe as well as wlsetup-web.exe offline executable files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried this multiple times and have mentioned that I have got stuck at 34% every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, your experts whom you escalated the issue need to look deeper into the log files to see what may be stalling the install process and what may be a work around!</p>
<p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t make changes to my D Drive.</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">So basically, I uninstalled my antivirus (Norton) to replace it with Avast. After uninstalling, I couldn't install Avast
 properly. I thought that it was just a bug. I woke up the next day and opened up my PC, and Steam opened up with an error something like this, "Steam folder not writable". I went to the properties of the steam folder and unchecked read-only. It still didn't
 work. And after that, another error popped up. It said that my D Drive recycle bin is corrupted. After hours of trying to fix that, I decided to factory reset my PC. It failed to reset. So I decided to format the drive. I did and still, I couldn't make ANY
 changes to the drive. I couldn't make a new folder, copy paste, install or anything. I have tried to change the ownership, permissions in the properties, opening it up in safe mode, making myself admin, etc. Still it wouldn't let me make changes. It just kept
 saying Administrator permission required or Destination folder access denied. Then I deleted the partition from the disk management and made a new one. It worked but after I rebooted my PC, It went back to the same situation as before. I can't make any changes.
 And now I am stuck<br />
<br />
Here is a screenshot of disk manager:&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fi.gyazo.com%2fa7f80c83a8a2d2292815f9d07fb9cfa1.png" />

<p>Did you reinstall Avast.?&nbsp; If so remove it and download and run their uninstall cleanup tool. Restart and make sure Defender is up an running, it should be if Avast is fully uninstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume you are using the same sign-in as before, is this an MS account or local and is it set as administrator. I don't think you could open Disk Management if it wasn't.</p>
<p>What happens if you make a new local account the administrator right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although you have clean install run the following.</p>
<div>Method 1: <br />
System file checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</div>
<div>Run system file checker (SFC) and see if it helps. Please follow these steps:</div>
<div>a. Press Windows + X keys and click command prompt (admin). Or PowerShell (Admin).</div>
<div>b. Type the following command in command prompt and press Enter.</div>
<div>sfc /scannow</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it does not help, use method 2.</div>
<div>Method 2: </div>
<div><br />
Run DISM tool and check the issue. Please follow these steps:</div>
<div>a. Press Windows + X keys and click command prompt (admin). Or PowerShell (Admin).</div>
<div>b. Type the following command in command prompt and press Enter.</div>
<div>
<p>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth<br />
after the scan is complete type the following and press Enter<br />
DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</p>

Yes, I am using a local account enabled as an administrator.<br />
I did method 1 and it said that there were some corrupted files and it repaired them.<br />
I did method 2 earlier and I only did Scanhealth in which it said that everything was perfectly fine.<br />

            Ok, I'll do that.<br />
I've noticed that if I start downloading, either my disk usage goes way too high (SeaGate Barracuda 1 TB ST1000MD1010) or my internet bandwith usage is being used very highly even though the downloader says its going at a speed of 500 KB/s which is very unusual
 as it should be at around 4 MB/s

            Alright, I uninstalled Norton, did the RestoreHealth thing and restarted from the menu.<br />
I just checked, and I still can't make changes to the :D\ Drive.

            What surprises me the most is the fact that I can make changes to the drive in Safe Mode and not in a normal boot.

<p>Yes very weird. Did you try a new admin local account.?</p>
<p>You could also try a clean boot&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows</a></p>
<p>I also find it strange it let you delete and recreate the partition and then won't allow you to add files or folders.</p>

<p>In Device Manage does the drive display correctly without any error messages.</p>
<p>Can you run any disk checking software from the manufacturer or are there any driver updates available. (you don't say if this is a custom build or a specific manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit: You could try uninstalling the driver for the D:\ drive and reboot and see what happens after windows installed the device driver again.</p>

            I tried a new admin local account, and it still didn't budge. Plus it can't clean boot properly.<br />
Yes, this is a custom build by me.

            The D:\ Drive is a partition of a single HDD. I'm not sure what will happen if I uninstall the driver but I'll give it a shot.
