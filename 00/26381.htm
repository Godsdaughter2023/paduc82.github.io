http://204.0.64.78/o365nwtest</a>, the tool is actually not used any more. If you want to do network analysis in your own environment, you can search for 3rd party tools.

</p><p>As of a 10 days ago i stopped receiving emails. I can send emails to other people. I tried sending emails from my Gmail account to my Hotmail (outlook) account , but nothing is getting through. Also my wife tried sending me emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My mailbox suddenly changed to english , and my gmail account was added to the inbox aswell , which i did not do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix this? We are in the middle of a visa application , and cannot receive any emails on this email adress.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Mr Malik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I access my email with Google Chrome.</p>
<p>I tried accessing my email with my pc and with my phone on both Chrome and Explorer.</p>
<p>The sender does not get any errors .</p>
<p>My mailbox used to be in Dutch. As of March 14 it was changed to English , and options were added, like my gmail inbox and a drafts folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I added my wife to the safe senders list , and she tried sending me an email. I did not receive it and she did not get an error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed all the blocked senders to see if maybe by accident i blocked people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess i have an different version of outlook , as i don't see the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1); font-weight: bold">Customizing Outlook.com or&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1); font-weight: bold">Writing

    <title>An error occurred while accessing the Office Document Cache. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            An error occurred while accessing the Office Document Cache.</h2>
                    <p>This is both an Office 2013 and OneDrive problem for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My local OneDrive is not completing the sync from cloud to file storage. I can confirm certain files exist on OneDrive using a browser, but these files are not coming down onto my computer. In the system tray, I can see the Microsoft Office Upload Center
 is trying to sync...when that's opened, you get the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>An error occurred while accessing the Office Document Cache. Close and reopen the Upload Center to try again. If the problem persists, move or delete the cache in the Upload Center settings dialog box.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening up Upload Center's settings, attempting to delete the cache crashes the client (not responding, Windows is attempting to resolve...). If I close the Upload Center executables (msosync.exe,&nbsp;CSISYNCCLIENT.EXE), I am able to delete the cache manually
 at:&nbsp;C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\15.0\OfficeFileCache (delete whole directory). After a reboot or opening up Microsoft Word, the Upload Center error returns with the same message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling/reinstalling OneDrive, performing the above steps multiple times, and tried other solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_365hp-office_storage/office-2013-upload-center-document-cache-problem/794694e1-5fd5-4949-917a-9495782e5630</li><li>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/office-2010-fix-office-document-cache-error/</li></ul>
<p>So far, nothing has worked.</p>

<p>A change from V2.1 to V3.0 would seem to suggest that there has been a major upgrade and change to the software.&nbsp; Having installed this and run it for a few calls, I have to say I'm struggling to see the difference between this and V2.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know which software version would have shipped with a CK-200, bought about 6 months ago?&nbsp; that version was significantly more useful than either V2.1 or V3.0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lost functionality going from whatever I had before to what is available now seems like such a step backwards.</p>

<p>What is considered to be a "smartphone"?&nbsp; I assume neither an E90 or a 6500 qualify for that function?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that this is all software related issues, would it be so hard for a company the size of Nokia to release new firmware for it's older phones for them to work with their new kar kit?&nbsp; Given that Nokia seem to be discontinuing the Comminucator range,
 it would make sense for them to at least update the E90's firmware so that it can do the same bluetooth communication as the car kit is expecting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's all such a shame.&nbsp; The CK-200 is a good bit of kit from a mechanical point of view.&nbsp; The remote control is a great idea, the two-phone connectivity is fabulous, ISO integration means very easy installation, and the display even looks good.&nbsp; I really
 don't understand why the software/firmware isn't up to the same standard.&nbsp; Same can be said of the E90.&nbsp; Mechanically it's the best "smartphone" I've ever used, and I want to keep it, but the firmware on it is now woefully out of date, and seems to get slower
 every day. Seems silly that two pieces of Nokia flagship technology cannot function properly together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would serve Nokia well if they released the source code and other technical information for the CK-200 (and other devices) so that they could be reprogrammed to do what they really ought to do straight out of the box.</p>

    <title>Critical error on logon after linking microsoft account &#124; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erdefb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Critical error on logon after linking microsoft account &#124; reproducable</h2>
                    <p>I know several other threads with this problem already exist, but I think this warranted a new one since I have steps how to reproduce it and I'd like &nbsp;a new response from a Microsoft rep to this issue whilst taking all information mentioned bellow to consideration:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Insider Preview build: 10130</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I link a new local account with a Microsoft Account, log out and log in, I get a critical error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"A critical error has occurred in the Shell Infrastructure Host, Stat Menu, Cortana and some apps may not be available. Please save your work and sign-out to recover."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ran sfc /sannow and it has not found any integrity violations.</p>
<p>
</p><p><del>The problem started to occur after installing a new update, but I do not recall what that update was. Security update to something I think. Could be unrelated, but figured I should at least mention that. Any way to remove installed updates? Silly me
 had disabled restore points in Windows 7 I installed Windows 10 on and they didn't get re-enabled after upgrade.</del></p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Removed the newly installed update and no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps to reproduce:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Create a new local account</p>
<p>2. Sign in to the new account.</p>
<p>3. Link it to a Microsoft account</p>
<p>4. Log out.</p>
<p>5. Log back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Creating a new local account and using that works around the issue, but that is not really something one should have to do especially since the free upgrade to full release is tied to having a Microsoft Account linked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: If creating a account directly linked to Microsoft account, the first time I log in the account setup process never finishes and a text claiming that it is taking longer than usual never goes away. After rebooting the computer and trying to login to
 that account the same critical error appears.</p>

</p><p>That's all fine and all, but wouldn't reinstalling also void my eligibility to receive the free upgrade to the full version of Windows 10?</p>

            <p>Did you get this sorted? I &nbsp;have a friend i just updated from Windows 7 to Windows 10 Build 10158 and everything works fine as a local account. &nbsp;As soon as i link it to a microsoft account, i get the above error. &nbsp;I can link each individual app perfectly
 fine, but linking the main account causes it to bug out, and you can't use start menu or anything and have to click the sign out button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried deleting and recreating the account several times, and even thought it might be a problem with his MS account, so got him to make a new one, and still the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't use the feedback app because it doesn't load because you have no start menu. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems like a HUGE bug.</p>

            <p>The only way that worked for me (at least for now) was to re-install Win10 over the existing installation and deciding to not save any apps or personal files. Basically a clean install, except it still saves the old Win7 folder and such.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue has also been reported on the Feedback app by someone else and had enough upvotes for it to be sent to Microsoft to evaluate even before I went to check in the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there is no guarantee that this will keep working as it used to work just fine for me for a while after upgrading from 7 and one day just suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, it is not complete software so nothing unexpected there.</p>

    <title>Unable to retrieve Outlook account details. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to retrieve Outlook account details.</h2>
                    Posting this on behalf of a friend who is facing the issue. My friend had created a @outlook.com account couple of months back as he had to register his office installation. As he was not regularly using the outlook email id. he forgot the password for
 the same. Lat week while reinstalling office on the same machine, he was unable to login back to the outlook account and hence could not activate his office installation. On using the password reset option, the password never got reset and then subsequently,
 the mails received from the account team showed an unknown account name(email id). Kindly advise on what can be done to reset the password. It is very critical to reset the account as the office account activation is pending. Thanks in advance

            Hello Vinod! 
<br />
<br />Welcome to the Microsoft Community! My name is Alessandro, I'm an independent advisor, I'm an experienced customer and I'm here to help!
<br />
<br />I'm so sorry about this problem! I understand perfectly how important it is that you are recovering your email account. So you should try to recover your account by these steps and in the end if everything not right you have access to direct chat. I will make a detailed summary here that describes all possible ways to recover your account step by step:
<br />
<br />Step - 1 :Regarding your question there are several ways you can recover if you remember or have the email address being that to reset the Hotmail password, the current Outlook, start by accessing the <a href="https://login.live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://login.live</a> page.com 
<br />In the short form, your e-mail address should already appear, otherwise enter it and, under the "Enter" button, click on the "Can not access your account?" When you do this, you will be directed to a form where you must enter the email address of your Hotmail account and enter the verification characters, by "Captcha" (to prove it is not a robot) and click "Next" (Just make the form if you remember the information, email addresses, passwords that have been used, email headers and messages as they will ask you questions) so be sure to remember this information and require patience. If the first attempt on the forms does not succeed try again and preferably on devices you used before to open your email that you are trying to recover (this step is actually the last and most recommended step when all previous steps are exhausted which I quoted at the beginning of our support yesterday). See the article: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12429/microsoft-account-sign-in-cant" target="_blank" r
<br />
<br />Step -2 : E-mail Password Recovery Method
<br />
<br />This method can only be selected if you have informed, at the opening of your Hotmail account, an alternate email address, to which you have access. When you select this method, Microsoft will show you the details of your alternate email. If you recognize it as your click on "Next." In the same interface, you may request that a code be sent to your cell phone, provided, of course, that you have given your number earlier. Select the option that is under the "Next" button. The third possibility, still in this interface, if you no longer have access to the alternative email or your telephone number, open the link "I can not use any of these options and follow the instructions. "To finalize these settings, enter your" alternate email, "open the" link "sent by Microsoft support and follow the instructions to complete.
<br />
<br />Step -3: Method of recovery of the password by code sent to the mobile phone
<br />
<br />The condition is that you have previously entered your cell phone number. Select the recovery option "Send a code to my phone" by message or by call, and select the desired option. Then click on the "Send Code" button. You will receive the code that should be entered in the appropriate field in the same interface as the option. To finish, click "Submit."
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2675025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2675025</a> 
<br />
<br />Step - 4 : Using computers to retrieve the password (Device that were used to access the desired email)
<br />
<br />You can recover your password from a computer, as long as you have registered one that you trust in your Microsoft account options. This procedure allows you to reset the password when you log on to the registered computer. Click the "I can not use any of these options" link and then "Next" to continue. Simply enter the new password in the appropriate field and click "Next."
<br />
<br />So the link below has the step-by-step images of all the information mentioned above:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2675025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2675025</a> 
<br />
<br />See that I am describing in detail all the recovery methods, and the next method is to open a ticket for support staff to check other forms of recovery here: If you do not recover in these steps above, open a ticket for the specific support as per the attached steps : <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/supportrequestform/7a3f017a-c951-7e06-1bd7-64bf7fc202ff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/supportrequ...</a> 
<br />
<br />Or you can also contact the Microsoft Technical Support Team directly via Chat: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/office/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/o...</a> 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! I am at your disposal if you wish!
<br />
<br />Best Regards!
<br />

<h2>            Narration cut off in powerpoint for mac 2008&#63;</h2>
                    I teach online and provide a number of powerpoints for my students. Today I decided to try narration - and it was easy to figure out how to do it. BUT when I play it back my narration gets cut off. It seems to be somewhat random (and not really due to
 the length of my comments.) &nbsp;Some slides - all of my narration is there. Others - NOPE, just stops. HELP!!! (Folks at work say the solution is not to use my MAC but to come into the lab at work. Please say it ain't so!!!)

            Try inserting the Audio or music from File option in PowerPoint for Mac and check if this helps. You may also use the External Microsoft if you have one.<br />
<br />
Ensure <span>"Link Narration"option is not checked when recording, this may also cause this issue.<br />

    <title>Automate running an append query using a list of records for the query - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Automate running an append query using a list of records for the query criteria</h2>
                    <p>I want to present, in a table, the median values for time elapsed while performing specific tasks.&nbsp; There are &gt;20 tasks and they are performed by a team of people throughout the day. I am easily able to calculate the median using&nbsp;a module I found on this
 site - &nbsp;Public Function MedianOfRst(RstName As String, fldName As String) As Double<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This function will calculate the median of a recordset. The field must be a number value.</p>
<p>It works great. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get the table,&nbsp;I first have to run the median module&nbsp;for TaskID=1 and SecondaryTaskID=3. (Each recordset of &gt; 10 records corresponds to a TaskId and SecondaryTaskID.) Then I run an append query using the&nbsp;median data I just calculated to add a new record
 for that TaskID and SecondaryTaskID to a&nbsp;table. </p>
<p>I then need to run the median module&nbsp;for TaskID=1 and SecondaryTaskID=4.&nbsp; I run an append query using the&nbsp;next set of median data I just calculated to add another new record for that TaskID and SecondaryTaskID to&nbsp;the&nbsp;table.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>And then again and again until I get my full table, which looks like this:</p>
<p>
<table>

<p>Boo - too manual and too much time. The datasets I use to run the Median module change&nbsp;continuously as more records are added to the datasets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I automate this process.&nbsp; The values for the TaskID and SecondaryTaskID are all in a table.&nbsp; Ideally I would like to refer to the table and cycle thru the records&nbsp;to establish the criteria in the query I use to run the Median module.&nbsp; I am open to
 any suggestions to automate my process!</p>

            OK, so why do you need to filter by TaskID and Secondary TaskID? Why not just one query without the filters?

It is my understanding that they are aware of this issue and are working on a fix. Hopefully, it will be identified, corrected and a fix will be coming in an update.</p>

In the meantime, I have tried a couple of other PDF readers (Foxit MobilePDF and Perfect PDF Reader) and have been using both. I have not decided which I like better (However, I am using Perfect PDF Reader more often) but they work fine until a fix comes.</p>

            Excuse me but your "solution" doesn't always work. In cases where the PDF file was received from Whatsapp or Viber, there is no option to open it in a third-party app. In fact, there's even no option to save it.

<p>Hi Jack.</p>
<p>I have downloaded and tried all the PDF readers as has been suggested as a workaround.</p>
<p>and still PDF files will not open.</p>
<p>I tried the workaround saving them to One drive and opening them from there.</p>
<p>It looked really encouraging but ended up the same a page about downloading W10 on a PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now deleted/uninstalled them</p>
<p>Tried to download the new reader it says I own [but not in my apps list]</p>
<p>and it will not download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to update it same dead end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use this for work as they send me a few pdf's a day as contact forms for bookings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am now stuck and have to wait until I go home and download them on Outlook.com to the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried opening the PDF attachments in EDGE as a favourite 'Outlook.com'</p>
<p>NO same dead end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried MS support but they just refer me to B2X they do not know of any issue and keep saying Hard resets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Mind you last time I spent 10 minutes trying to explain to a lady what a TILE was as she had never seen a Windows phone and did not understand my problem.]</p>

<p>Hi Jack.</p>
<p>Thanks for the kind response.</p>
<p>The acknowledgement of the problem helps my well being!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes they all open on my PC's and Tablets fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[The mobile work around for me is when I am on the road get my HQ office to convert them to Word documents and send them manually as attachments so I can open, read them, and contact the persons named.</p>

            FWIW, I was able to save a pdf attached to an email on my 950 xl.&nbsp; Then opened that file using PDF Viewer Plus and it opened fine.&nbsp; (In fact, I think it probably did better than the PC opening the same file because there was a "watermark" on page that
 didn't show on the PC)

<p>Thanks Mark.</p>
<p>Just tried this and it worked for me.</p>
<p>Tried the other usual ways and the other readers still NO</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something about the PDF Viewer Plus then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had previously saved the PDF's to one drive and my device [950] and they would not open</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>An excellent work around</p>

<h2>            How do I change the screensaver to 24-hour clock&#63;</h2>
                    NOTE: I have set it to 24-hour clock in my locale and that works on my lock screen but the screensaver shows a 12-hour clock.<br />

Any suggestions?

<p>You will have to remove Each &amp; Every file associated with that application..and for that you MUST be 100% sure that a particular file is of that particular application and not linked either to other application or the phone system file..else you will lend
 in trouble.. The surest way is to Format the Card or Reset the phone and then Restoring / Re-installing everything..</p>
<p>..though for some applications UN-INSTALLING and then Re-installing will do that..</p>

            the problem is if some one has not knowlege to go in the system and look every single file of the application to delete manual may cost a damage<br />
i have same problem, if i unistall it it remembers previous settings so if the application has cost problem in the phone , the problem will not go<br />
<br />
if reset the phone then other problems will occur like problems with map or ovi

<p>I am not a Software Engineer.. so won't know for sure but I think its the fault with the Programme (Application) and not of the Phone..or the Application is purposely written that way perhaps..</p>

    <title>I Love Windows 10, but Three Questions Please.... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greg7579  say:</h3>
<h2>            I Love Windows 10, but Three Questions Please....</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;just upgraded from 7 to 10 and am impressed so far.&nbsp; Three questions though....</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; IE is still there along with Edge.&nbsp; I guess it is no big deal, but should I care?&nbsp; If MS had wanted it gone it would be.&nbsp; Just another program to ignore now?&nbsp; Maybe just delete the link, but do not attempt to remove IE right?&nbsp; I have always heard that
 was dangerous to try.&nbsp; I'm sure MS left IE along with Edge for a reason.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; I am a Norton Security w Backup subscriber and have 18 months left on my contract.&nbsp; It did not reinstall with the 10 install so I reloaded it.&nbsp; I think it might not be needed at all w Windows 10 because of the greatly increased virus and security capabilities
 in 10, and I abandoned Norton backup two months ago anyway.&nbsp; (Their backup program is not great, so I use another).&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I loaded it back in W10 because I have used Norton for decades along with Windows and I paid over 100 bucks for 2 years recently.&nbsp;&nbsp;It
 used to be a necessity w W7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any thoughts on that?&nbsp; Should I delete it and just rely on Windows 10 to do all the right security and virus protection?&nbsp; Or is there still some advantage with Norton?&nbsp; Also,&nbsp;Norton keeps telling me on popups to revert to IE so
 they can protect it.&nbsp; It says that Windows 10 does not allow&nbsp;add-ons to Edge "yet."&nbsp; Any thoughts on that? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; I am a photographer and rely heavily on Photoshop and Light Room.&nbsp; That is all I need and use for anything to do with images.&nbsp; I do not need or ever want to see a MS photo viewing or organization app.&nbsp; I have 225,000 images stored&nbsp;in hundreds of folders
 all located in the&nbsp;This Computer "Pictures" folder, and that is the way I want it.&nbsp; That makes it easier to back up and control -- all under one folder (although most photographers do it other ways).&nbsp; I leery of this new Windows 10 photo app.&nbsp;I haven't opened
 it.&nbsp; What will it do?&nbsp; The live tile called "Photos" is already flashing my JPEG files in the little tile in the start area.&nbsp;&nbsp;Did this program already link to my huge program of images?&nbsp; I'm not sure I want that.&nbsp; I'm afraid to open it.&nbsp; Will it try to take
 over as my image viewing main platform?&nbsp; Will it then form a link to all my almost quarter million images?&nbsp; Will it create 225,000 new thumbnail files for viewing all of my images &nbsp;in that app? Thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp; Greg</p>

            <p>Hello Greg, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft forum and apology for the delayed response.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your query. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Microsoft Edge is specially designed to work best with touch devices, and some of Internet Explorer features are still not available or fully functional in Edge. Edge will continue to develop further to be more dynamic. In the meantime I would not recommend
 you to remove Internet Explorer from your computer. Since Internet Explorer is the default browser it can only be disabled and can not be uninstalled as of now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Since you have your Norton subscription, you can use it for the remaining period. Once&nbsp;the subscription period is over you may choose to uninstall&nbsp;it from your computer. Windows 10 has preinstalled security software and it's sufficient. No other third
 party security software is required. </p>
<p>
</p><p>3) If you do not want your photos to be synced with the photo app you may&nbsp;either disable the photo app or simply change the location of images from pictures folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For more information on Windows 10, you may refer the Windows 10 FAQ below.<br />

<h2>            The Outlook Mobile update that just came out that changed the bold line in the Inbox of each email that I send to myself from NOTE TO SELF to say ME instead, has a broken feature about Signatures.</h2>
                    <div>
<p>It won't let me turn OFF having it automatically add the same Signature to each email that I write nor will it let me change what my Signature is.</p>
<p>It can't be Changed or Stopped from adding "Sent from my Windows 10 phone" at the end of every darn email that I write?</p>
<p>Heck, why should I advertise a dying breed no matter how much I love her despite her MANY shortcomings? This is my 2nd Nokia Lumia 950.</p>
<p>So, I'm forced to either advertise for Windows 10 Phone or I'm forced to manually Delete that line on every email.<br />
This isn't right.<br />
At least&nbsp;Microsoft's IT staff fixed the “stuck in Conversation mode” problem overnight that this new version also had.</p>
<p>I just posted this over at Feedback Hub but Microsoft has recently changed the Hub to simplify it (and so that it takes&nbsp;a smaller cloud to store it on ;-) ), so it no longer has the RECREATE THE ISSUE feature or ADD 1 IMAGE I.E. A PRINTSCREEN

    <title>N78 v30.011 Bug List Thread - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adrianhughesnsd  say:</h3>
<h2>            N78 v30.011 Bug List Thread</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hi everyone, thanks for all your advice and comments now that v30.011 has been released here (NSU, FOTA was still not available on the 23rd July) are the changes I have noticed, along with some newly discovered bugs. Please bear in mind that there
 is<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>NOT</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>a v30.014 as some users on the Internet have alluded to, the official Nokia firmware versions channel over at Forum Nokia states v30.011 as the
 firmware version for all variants of the N78, including EDGE-only and Americas variants.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<em><span>NOTE: all the documented features/improvements are performed with the Theme Effects turned on.</span></em></span><em><span>The update size from v21.002 to v30.011 is&nbsp;</span></em><strong><span>114MB</span></strong><em><span>.&nbsp;Update takes about ten
 minutes to complete (after downloading has been completed).</span></em><em><span><br />
<br />
<em><span>Software Version: 30.011</span></em><br />
<em><span>Software Version Date:&nbsp;</span></em></span></em><span><span>&nbsp;<em>08-05-09</em></span></span><span><br />
<span><em>Custom Version: 30.011.051.1</em>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><br />
<span><em>Custom Version: 30.011.051.1</em>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
<strong><span>Changes/Improvements/New features I have noticed from v21.002 to v30.011</span></strong></strong>:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Standby screen:<br />
<br />
*When Music Player is operating, and seeing the track name on the screen, and then when one song ends and goes to the next track, the speed at which this happens has improved yet again from 21.002, although the noticeable change is not as much as from 20.149
 to 21.002.</span><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
</span><span><br />
&nbsp;</span><span><br />
Call log, Contacts and calling function:<br />
<br />
*Calling speed (from standby screen to Contacts or Call Log) and transition to call/disconnected screens even faster than 21.002, is more than the instantaneous that I stated for the 21.002, it has improved yet again.<br />
</span><span>*New menu option in the in-call menu to Send MMS during phone call.&nbsp;<br />
</span><span>*Loudspeaker maximum volume has seemed to decreased&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
</span><span><br />
&nbsp;</span><span><br />
Maps:</span><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span><span>*Maps startup is now almost instantaneous, speed through all the Maps menus very fast, even faster than Maps 2.0<br />
</span><span>*Switching to different views is very smooth and fast now, i.e. to Map 3D etc.<br />
</span><span><span>*Maps version 2.0 week 39 remains the same, although the Maps is able to be upgraded to Ovi Maps 3.01 flawlessly</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</span><span>Music Player:</span><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span><span>*The biggest change is the equaliser improvements. There is a huge improvement in sound quality, even background sounds and other channels are more noticeable. The default equaliser settings are quite good. And bass is less crunchy than before.<br />
*Split-second delays now do not exist when pressing the volume keys to change between volume levels. In the past, there was some degree of delay, even running multiple applications now, that behaviour has been improved remarkably.<br />
</span><span>*Freezes in the music player have not been evident to me yet in my days of usage with the new firmware. Which is a marked improvement in the functioning and stability of the music player. Screen tearing and slow speed for album art to appear is
 still present though.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>Camera and Photos:<br />
<br />
</span><span>*Biggest change is the reappearance of use of the volume keys to zoom while taking photos/recording video<br />
</span><span>*Going into Details is faster than 21.002, almost instantaneous now<br />
</span><span>*Scrolling speed through thumbnails is only minimally jerky now, also scrolling through photos at 100% view has improved in speed so it is now very smooth and almost instantaneous&nbsp;<br />
*When going into menus in Camera, the speed is instantaneous</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><br />
<span>Video centre:</span><span>&nbsp;<br />
<span>Video centre:</span><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span><span>*Logo has changed for the video centre in the menu<br />
*Appearance of video menu is different and seems to have inherited the newer N-series/E-series style simplified logos<br />
*Speed in the video centre is much improved and is almost instantaneous<br />
*Changing between volume levels in RealPlayer is instantaneous, fast-forward/rewind speed and resume of playback after these functions is improved and almost instantaneous. Sound quality appears to have been improved also.</span><span><br />
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<span><br />
<span><br />
Search:</span><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span><span>*Application has been upgraded from v4.08 to v4.10.0904<br />
*Logo has changed and is now reminiscent of the newer N-series/E-series simplified styling<br />
*Performance is faster and Yandex search service has been removed in favour of Live Search and Google (Note: this is for the APAC variant, will vary between different regions and specific countries)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Web:</span><span>&nbsp;<br />
</span><span><br />
*Rendering of webpages has improved in speed since 21.002</span><span>*Rotate Screen option speed is now almost instantaneous&nbsp;<br />
</span><span>*Speed in Web options menu is now instantaneous<br />
</span><span>*Loading of Minimap on side when scrolling down pages does not have pixelation anymore&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
</span><span><br />
&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span><br />
Other:&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</span><span><br />
*Overall system speed has been improved so it is somewhat faster than 21.002<br />
</span><span>*Scrolling in the Multimedia menu from one tab to another whilst multiple applications are running, has improved marginally in speed<br />
</span><span>*Overall stability seems to also have been improved, have not had one crash or freeze where I have had to remove the phone battery. The slight freezes that have occurred, the phone has recovered from flawlessly.<span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</span><span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span><span><br />
<br />
<span>I have yet to check all the bugs that were documented for v21.002 in the thread&nbsp;but" target="_blank"&gt;/discussions/board/message?board.id=swupdate&amp;thread.id=49063&nbsp;but</span></span>
<span>I have yet to check all the bugs that were documented for v21.002 in the thread&nbsp;but" target="_blank"&gt;/discussions/board/message?board.id=swupdate&amp;thread.id=49063&nbsp;but</span></span>
 I will go about that very soon and document all the changes here in this thread. But so far, so good, the firmware appears to be a lot better and more stable than 21.002. New features are not really there, but it is vastly stable and exactly what I had hoped
 to be for v30. Again, thanks to all users for their current feedback on problems. Remember to be sure to add your experiences with the N78 here!<span><span>

            One more improvement I found out that after restart I had to wait for sometime for keypad light to come for entering sim code.Now the light comes first and then the phone asks for code.

<p>So just to compile the bugs/problems I mentioned on the other thread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1- FM transmitter bug - unless FM transmitter shut down manually, the keypress tones are not heard. This is an old bug since previous firmwares.</p>
<p>2- Internet Radio application is now very buggy, I cannot get it to open some stations and it keeps reverting to the main radio page when selecting others. Also had constant buffering and stuttering when finally managed to play something.</p>
<p>3- There is a bug with the music player icon on the standby screen. On occasion I could not start or switch to the music player by clicking on it, had to use the multimedia button for that. I have not yet figured out what causes this to happen, it has occurred
 twice already, but after a phone restart or changing the standby mode the problem was gone.</p>
<p>4- As mentioned, the volume of the loudspeaker is definitely lower then before, which is bad in my opinion.</p>
<p>5- The video feeds are now gone from the Video player menu. Replace by a direct link to Ovi Store. All the free internet stations I enjoyed are gone, replaced by useless videos that have to be paid for on the Ovi store. This is a step back for Nokia. I am
 very dissapointed as they are squeezing every cent out of the consumer. Why not still have the video feeds????</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another issue which is not a bug but would be a nice feature is to have some way of preventing certain tracks from playing in the music player when playing all tracks. I have some MP3 ringtones that pop up sometimes and it is quite annoying. I know making
 a playlist not including them would work but that is very cumbursome especially if you keep adding or removing tracks and have to make a new playlist each time.&nbsp; The other feature which would be nice is if it was possible to change the standby mode applications
 like you can on the E51 and other nokia phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Somebody mentioned Bluetooth A2DP not working, but for me it works great, no changes at all.</p>

<p>thanks for the feedback so far everyone. with respect to the bugs you have documented Luyul, i can attest to some of them. Internet Radio experience i can agree with. FM transmitter bug is not really a bug i think, as the keypad tones are designed to be
 played back through the radio of your car or home stereo. 3. and 4. are true, and 5. i don't have a link to the Ovi Store rather a link to the old Nseries videos. That would be a good idea with more customisations (say giving the user the option of selecting
 which folders to search for Music in) in the Music Player.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have finally finished the complete bug list across all firmware versions 12.046, 20.149 and 21.002 and 30.011 so far, so will post that under this post. it's pretty long!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi everyone, after extensive testing with the new v30.011 firmware, here is the complete list of bugs documented by myself and other users (many thanks to you all) for the v21.002, v20.149 and v12.046 firmware, and whether they have been rectified or not.
 I'm sure this is considered by many to be a very stable and fast firmware, so this may be the last firmware update we see for the N78. Otherwise we may see a v31 sometime in the future. The history for the firmware versions of the N78 are as follows (NOTE:
 some product codes depending on region and variant, did not receive certain firmware versions, for example, the 13.052 or 20.149 updates):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10.136<span> </span>Build Date: 07-05-2008</p>
<p>11.043<span> </span>Build Date: 21-05-2008</p>
<p>12.046<span> </span>Build Date: 25-06-2008</p>
<p>13.052<span> </span>Build Date: 04-09-2009</p>
<p>20.149<span> </span>Build Date: 08-12-2008</p>
<p>21.002<span> </span>Build Date: 18-02-2009</p>
<p>30.011<span> </span>Build Date: 08-05-2009</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were also a small number of behaviours that were initially thought to be bugs, however they were present across all firmware versions and after close scrutiny, were concluded to be normal system behaviours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.<span> </span>Left soft key, right soft key and call key selection is still inaccurate - COMPLETELY FIXED, much&nbsp;improved from firmware to firmware, 21.002 had some right soft key issues but these have been&nbsp;completely rectified.<br />
</p>
<p>2.<span> </span>Pressing the Menu key&nbsp;also fails to work at times, as well as bringing up the task manager -&nbsp;COMPLETELY FIXED, much improved from firmware to firmware, 21.002 had some issues but these are&nbsp;now completely rectified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.<span> </span>When going back into the Menu, the Message Reader or other applications on other instances are&nbsp;opened for no apparent reason - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.<span> </span>When playing games on N-gage and listening to music, music playback is occasionally interrupted due&nbsp;to multiple applications running at once - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.<span> </span>Sometimes the phone crashes and restarts while playing back music through the FM transmitter - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.<span> </span>Sometimes freezes when trying to fast forward through an mp3 track in the Music Player, then going back&nbsp;up and selecting the Music Player in the Active Standby screen - FIXED, not a single crash of the Music&nbsp;Player
 or phone under firmware 30.011</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7.<span> </span>CK-3000 Bluetooth headset won't pair with the phone - apparently FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8.<span> </span>Loudspeaker will not activate when receiving call while playing music through the FM transmitter - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.<span> </span>Loudspeaker is said to be activated on normal phone calls with no other phone processes running, but it&nbsp;is not activated....loudspeaker therefore periodically works then doesn't work - FIXED, tied in with number&nbsp;eight
 above</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10.<span> </span>RealPlayer on a lot of occasions fails to play video, only displaying a blank screen and playing the audio&nbsp;of the file - FIXED, have yet to see a single instance on 30.011</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11.<span> </span>N-gage application to be integrated into future firmware - FIXED, although it is not actually integrated into the firmware, downloading the latest version will work on the 20.149, 21.002 and 30.011 firmware</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12.<span> </span>Lags in the Gallery and Camera application and when going back to the Active Standby - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13.<span> </span>Error in Camera application, sometimes when pressing Camera key to take a photo of the screen goes to&nbsp;a blank viewfinder and fails to show everything on the screen, almost as if the lens of the camera weren't&nbsp;open
 - FIXED, haven't seen an instance of it yet</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>14.<span> </span>Camera zoom problems: the need to change the photo storage memory from microSD to phone memory,&nbsp;in order to fix camera initialisation and camera zoom non-functioning problems - FIXED, camera zoom&nbsp;now works in all
 instances for both camera and video modes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>15.<span> </span>Failure for Nokia Maps to create its own cities folder, I have the Anberlin album Cities and the Nokia Maps</p>
<p>application stored its data in that folder instead of the proper folder - UNFIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>16.<span> </span>Streaming problems with RealPlayer, sometimes displays 0% when loading videos then fails to go any&nbsp;further - FIXED, streaming playback is almost flawless, any issues are now due to network coverage&nbsp;issues solely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>17.<span> </span>Whenever in a call and a pre-set alarm goes off, the option to snooze or turn off the alarm should present.<br />
However, it does not, and the phone accepts no user input, with this alarm only being remedied after the&nbsp;phone call is ended by turning off the phone and taking out the battery - UNFIXED, alarm clock comes on&nbsp;only after you switch the phone back on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>18.<span> </span>Numerous freezes when phone does not take any input, for example, trying to press the End Call key&nbsp;after finishing a call - FIXED, have not seen a single hang anywhere in the phone, including Calls, Web or&nbsp;Music
 Player, except for the bug 17. documented above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>19.<span> </span>When changing network mode from UMTS to GSM simply to enable web access to the operator network&nbsp;web pages, sometimes when going back into the network selection screen, UMTS is no longer enabled&nbsp;and Dual Mode is -
 FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>20.<span> </span>Numerous problems with the email client - UNTESTED, I am not an email user so if anyone could shed&nbsp;any light on this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>21.<span> </span>When activating voice commands from the phone (push and hold the right soft key), the text label for both&nbsp;left and right soft-keys flashes up with the text "text_softkey" before jumping back to the home screen&nbsp;(with
 a mini-zoom if you have menu effects turned on), and then launching the voice command application&nbsp;- FIXED, completely fixed in 30.011</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>22.<span> </span>Sometimes when exiting Create New Message in the Messaging application, the phone hangs - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>23.<span> </span>When installing some applications such as older .sis files, the installer freezes and hangs the phone&nbsp;- FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>24.<span> </span>Sometimes when browsing the web and playing music at the same time, the phone hangs and the only&nbsp;way to fix this is by taking out the battery and powering back on - FIXED, have not had a single crash&nbsp;with any processes
 on the phone except for the bug in 17.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>25.<span> </span>FM transmitter performance inconsistent - HAS REMAINED THE SAME across all firmware versions, but&nbsp;I also believe that performance is due to environmental factors and not the phone itself, power of&nbsp;transmission has
 not increased or decreased as far as I can see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>26.<span> </span>While using the web browser and holding the down or up buttons to scroll down the page, the browser&nbsp;will keep scrolling down and up and the cursor will have 'a mind of it's own', instead of just stopping the&nbsp;scroll
 once pressure is released off the directional buttons - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>27.<span> </span>Classic thumbnail problem where thumbnails of photos that were deleted long ago still appear - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>28.<span> </span>Weekday alarm setting issues, where you set a Weekly alarm and no matter what day you set the alarm&nbsp;for, it says the alarm is for the day you set the alarm (e.g. today is Wednesday, you set the alarm for&nbsp;Sunday,
 but it doesn't work and instead sets the alarm for Wednesday) - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>29.<span> </span>When using GPS data on trip distance, besides all the time you should wait for it to get a satellite fix, if&nbsp;you remain in that mode, about one hour later the device boots up and all the trip information is lost&nbsp;-
 FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>30.<span> </span>When the Music Player is active, and the volume is on any level apart from Mute and the FM transmitter&nbsp;is activated, and then the FM transmitter is deactivated later, the playback volume of the speaker (or&nbsp;headphones)
 is very loud. Also when doing the same as stated, but the volume is on Mute level, the phone crackles when activating or deactivating the FM transmitter - UNFIXED, a jolt in volume (went up to&nbsp;100% or so) when my standard volume was on 70% before activating
 the FM transmitter, occurred upon&nbsp;re-inserting headphones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>31. When activating FM transmitter, later the loudspeaker cannot be used, you need to restart the phone - FIXED, no need to restart if making phone calls after using the FM transmitter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>32. Slow performance of ambient light sensor - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>33. Pairs with in-car Bluetooth on the Citreon C4, but you can only call on voice dialing and the phone address book is not available. The Nokia 3109 pairs with the C4 also, but the phone book is completely usable - UNTESTED, would someone be able to shed
 any light on this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>34. Screen backlight doesn't turn off completely when recording audio in the Voice Recorder application - UNFIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>35. Could not close Contacts and Phone Log by using the end call key - FIXED, only if you press the end call key while in the applications, if you make a phone call by bringing up the phone book then the Contacts application will remain open in the task
 manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>36. Geotagging inconsistency for taken photos, and when uploading to Ovi geotagging metadata is not always included - UNTESTED, would anyone be able to shed any light on this matter?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>37. Audio not synchronised with video when playing back FLV videos in the Adobe Flash Lite 3.0 Player (i.e. through the file manager) - FIXED, have not noticed a single instance yet</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>38. Message Reader application is activated for no reason while using other applications or randomly and suddenly says "No new messages" even when you haven't used that application at all for a long period of time, or if the phone is keypad-locked - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>39. When the albums list in the Music Player , and you press and hold the up or down button to scroll fast through the list, it displays the word "fast" in the blank space underneath the word Albums. Also that the fast scroll that was in the Music Player
 carried over and I was unable to go into the calendar or any other entries on the standby screen because the scroll was too fast - UNFIXED, as of current firmware 30.011</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>40. If you are in the Music Player and your phone is set to auto-lock the keypad after ten seconds or whatever integer you have set it to, sometimes it dims and locks the keypad and at other times it doesn't lock the keypad - UNFIXED, as of current firmware
 30.011</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>41. N-gage backlight errors where phone backlight dims to whatever the phone has set it to (e.g. ten seconds) - UNFIXED&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>42. Wrong character display in the Music Player, it cannot display apostrophes correctly in a song title or album title, i.e. ' is displayed as a square or other weird characters - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>43. Sometimes when selecting applications or performing processes, the phone backlight turns off completely and the keypad backlight is bright and stays on, almost as if the phone freezes, then maybe after a 20 second period the phone goes back to normal
 - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>44. When viewing Visualisations in the Music Player, these do not work while playing music through the FM transmitter, the Album Art visualisation works but the others freeze the Music Player when you press Close, causing the music to stop playing - UNFIXED,
 where the visualisations now occur and play, although the FM transmitter seems to deactivate and songs can be heard playing through the loudspeaker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>45. When in Tools &gt; Utilities &gt; Speed Dial, when moving from one number to the next takes more than a while to occur - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>46. When in the Messaging inbox, and the first message you open will display the message. Now when you press the right or left arrows to goto the next message, the Inbox view is displayed briefly before the message is actually displayed. Looking at subsequent
 messages by pressing right or left, this does not happen. However, when going back to the Inbox view then selecting another message, the same scenario happens again if repeated as I have stated - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>47. When going into Notes in Office applications, and say you immediately press Exit to go back, the menu transitions go all weird as if they have turned themselves off, until you go backwards into the main menu. This is noticeable in all themes, though
 most noticeable in the Haze effect - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>48. Will not let you enter the Date and Time settings, or Alarm Clock settings, instead going back to the main menu - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>49. Carousel menu by pressing the small silver key is still inconsistent, sometimes appears with scroll bar and performance is slow - FIXED, all entries have scroll bars even if there are not enough entries to dictate the presence of a scroll bar, speed
 much improved though not perfect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>50. Sometimes the Music Player track playing time and name of track does not appear in the place that it should be on the standby screen - UNFIXED, have seen it on one instance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>51. When receiving text messages (while earphones are plugged in and listening to music, whether the phone is on General or Silent profile, or if the FM transmitter is activated and playing music), the sound output goes to mono and a bit crackly, when the
 message alert is played. The music is also played through the loudspeaker - FIXED, though not for the FM transmitter. Although this may be a deliberate behaviour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>52. Wireless LAN Settings and display on standby screen not translated to relevant language that has been selected on the phone - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>53. When exiting N-gage games after long periods of usage, the phone turns off then back on again - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>54. When listening to new messages in the Message Reader, on one occasion the default voice I had (UK Male) was changed to another voice (Turkish) which read out the message instead - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>55. When listening to songs through the 'All songs' menu in the Music Player, and you restart the phone. When you press the silver key to enter the Carousel menu, the 'Last played' entry will be correct, but if you select it, the Music Player will open the
 first song from the 'All songs' list - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>56. When starting playback of a video in the Photos application, the phone Main Menu screen is displayed briefly - UNFIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>57. After unlocking the keypad the breathing light of the Navi-wheel sometimes stays on - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>58. When starting the Photos application, the keypad backlighting flickers before it is turned off - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>59. When unplugging headphones from the phone while playing music in the Music Player, the phone restarts itself - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>60. If you turn your phone off and keep it off for a number of hours, the phone time will go backwards by a certain amount - FIXED&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>61. When in the Web Browser, and you have the Settings &gt; Page for the Selection keys set to Hidden. You press 2 to search the current page or 9 to goto another website, the selection keys are displayed - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>62. When setting the light and power save time-out to for example, from 10 seconds to 60 seconds, it works for the first instance, and then reverts back to the old 10 seconds, even though 60 seconds has been explicitly selected - UNFIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>63. When loading Log list, you have to wait for it to load completely otherwise, if you go immediately into it and you go to the bottom of the list, it ends up refreshing to place you in the middle of the Log list - UNFIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>64. I am firstly in Silent mode and have UMTS activated, I then change this back to the GSM mode and then change the phone profile to Offline, without waiting for the network signal for GSM to appear. The phone then shows Settings as an open application,
 when you go in there, it goes straight to the network band selection screen, and you have to exit back out of the menu to make the open application icon disappear - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>65. Unable to zoom in the camera/Photos application when Music Player is active and FM transmission is active - FIXED, now with proper behaviour. When music playback is paused, the camera/Photos applications will zoom, however when music playback occurs,
 only volume of the Music Player is adjusted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>66. When skipping from one track to another in the Music Player (through most of the 200 tracks I have), I got to track 190 then immediately pressed to fast forward through that track and the phone froze - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>67. When Music Player is playing songs and you go to the Carousel menu, the Now Playing entry for the song is the wrong song - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>68. When recording video in low light, the camera flash keeps blinking on and off continuously while video is being recorded - UNFIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>69. When exiting an application such as Windows Live Messenger or when web browsing and the 3G cuts out, then exit back to the standby screen, instead of the network name being displayed, it is replaced with the numbers 999 999 - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>70. Not able to add tags to photos, you are able to add tags in the Details part of a photo, but when you enter the Tags option in the Photos menu, the application bombs out - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>71. Problem with the phone and its music library playback, my library was usually fine, but then I chose some songs to play and it sorted the album in the wrong order. Therefore had to refresh library - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>72. The phone used to auto-lock, and the lights would dim straight away, now the phone auto-locks but takes another few seconds before it dims the lights - FIXED, this bug came about after not leaving the battery out for long enough after a crash/freeze.Since
 the phone has only crashed once in all my experience, plus one minor lockup with the right softkey which was recovered from flawlessly 20 or so seconds later, this bug no longer occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>73. The screen backlight remained on for the entire duration of the phone call - FIXED, same variables required as in 72. for this bug to occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>74. In a phone call, when I pressed the left soft key to go into the Options, no menu appeared, it just put the call on hold - FIXED, same variables required as in 72. for this bug to occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>75. Phone freezes after transferring music to the device from a PC in Mass Storage mode, freezing after phone asks if "USB synchronisation complete, do you want to refresh?" and selecting Yes. Sometimes prompt appears, sometimes not - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>76. When you are in any theme, and have the Theme Effects turned off, then you go into each individual text message to view it, then go to the next message, the screen will go blank and then come up with the next message i.e. no proper flowing transition
 occurs - UNFIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>77. While playing music in the Music Player, and then entering the FM radio (while songs are still playing), the music already being played back stutters for a couple of seconds before it finally goes into the radio application, and the radio station starts
 playing - UNFIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>78. When in Settings &gt; General &gt; Navi-wheel, and then opening Options &gt; Help, the help text about enhancement settings is displayed instead of the one about the Navi-wheel settings - UNFIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>79. Phone freezes completely, when I have taken a photo, zoomed in on the photo using the Photos application, then used the task manager to exit back to the main menu - FIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>80. When you are in the Carousel menu, and watching the Now Playing song entry, and the next track appears, the scrolling of the song title is wrong. For long song titles, it will scroll maybe half of the song title for a couple of times, then after about
 three or four go's it finally scrolls the whole song title - UNFIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>81. For albums that have &nbsp;album cover art for every song, the album art is not always displayed correctly as the thumbnail in the Carousel menu - UNFIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>82. When first opening main menu after startup, the scrollbar will be displayed though there are only twelve entries. When you enter a sub-menu, and then go back, the scrollbar will disappear - FIXED&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>83. If you are playing music through the FM transmitter, and plug the headphones in, the FM transmitter is deactivated, however no music can be heard and upon exit to standby screen, the phone freezes - UNFIXED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So after about a year now, the N78 can finally be considered to have mature firmware. I myself have declared the experience finished, as there are hardly any new bugs to be found or existing ones to be fixed. Thanks again to every user who has posted their
 experiences with the N78, and contributed to these series of bug list threads. It's been good and I'm sure we can all now say that we have very fast and stable N78's. Cheers everyone!&nbsp;</p>

<p>my sincerest apologies to everyone, it does seem there is 30.014 floating around, and entering certain product codes on the "Can i update?" section on the Nokia website does appear with a 30.014 version. with details: 30.014.051.1, Build Date: 22-06-2009.
 very strange that is, other regions are stating 30.011 only. is yours an operator-branded version sa3d12, or generic as far as you know? and what country are you living in?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>do you also happen to see any other changes apart from the ones i've stated at the beginning of this thread, such as different icons/new features? this is quite interesting now.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Excel for Android won t open files.</h2>
                    <p>The only way I can get the excel app to open a file is if I clear data first and it only works once. I've tried updating the app and that didn't seem to help. Otherwise it just stays on the green opening screen not doing anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any fixes for this? Is it a known But?</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you confirm which device and which app version do you have? Are you on the Insider version of the Excel app?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case you have an Oppo F1S we are currently looking into an issue with that device where our apps do not work.&nbsp;</p>

            I am having a similar issue on a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4. I have uninstalled and re-installed it but it simply will not open. I have Outlook installed but haven't set it up on this device yet. I also have One-note but it doesn't want to do anything either.
 The opening page just hangs there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            can&#39;t get subform to update in Tab control</h2>
                    <p>I am using a tab control.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two tabs -&nbsp;each containing a subform, each of which is based on a different query, with each query tied to a common table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I add records to the subform1/query1 on tab1, the records on subform2/query2 on tab2 are not updating/inserting.&nbsp; I added a button to tab2 to try to refresh/requery the subform, but it doesn't do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any suggestions please?</p>
<p>

            <p>Without seeing the code for your command button, it's not clear why it wouldn't be working.&nbsp; In principle, it ought to work, since the tab2 subform definitely needs to be requeried -- not refreshed; that's something different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe the simplest solution, though, is to do the Requery when that tab page becomes active.&nbsp; You could do it with a little code in the Change event of the tab control, along these lines:</p>
<p>
</p><p>'------ start of example code ------</p>
<p>Private Sub tabMyTabControl_Change()</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Me.tabMyTabControl = 1 Then&nbsp;&nbsp; ' page numbers are 0-based</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.sfSubformOnPage2.Requery</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If</p>
<p>
</p><p>End Sub</p>
<p>'------ end of example code ------</p>

            Please answer <strong>all of the following diagnostic questions</strong> by number in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):
<p>1. Did you upgrade to Win7 or is it a new computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; • Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit</a></p>
<p>2. Is it a Win7 64-bit computer?</p>
<p>3a. When (approx. date) did you install Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) and was the computer fully-patched at Windows Update at the time?</p>
<p>3b. Can you open &amp; scan with Windows Defender? Can you manually update Windows Defender?</p>
<p>4. Did you download/run the <a href="http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool</a> BEFORE you installed MSE?</p>
<p>5. Was your McAfee subscription still current (or was the free-trial period still valid)&nbsp;when you replaced&nbsp;the McAfee application with MSE?</p>
<p>6. Did a Norton free-trial or a McAfee free-trial come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>7. Is <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Turn-automatic-updating-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Automatic Updates</a> enabled and is the computer currently fully-patched at <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/How-can-I-tell-if-my-computer-is-up-to-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Update</a>?</p>
<p>8. Finally, is "the internet" still slow if you connect via a hard-wired (e.g., ADSL or cable broadband) connection or even a true WiFi connection (e.g., at a friend's house, public library,&nbsp;or a cafe)?</p>
<p>Note: Unless the computer's located right by a window (or outdoors)&nbsp;AND you're very close to a mobile tower, you'll find a mobile broadband connection is never as reliable as a hard-wired or true WiFI connection.</p>

<p>Here are the answers I hope you need.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; New computer bought Feburuary 2010 and it is running the 64 bit version&nbsp;of Windows.</p>
<p>2. I think it is 64 bit computer but I am not sure, I do know that I have both version of IE8 and I use 32 bit version because Adobe Flash Player can not work in the 64 bit version of IE8.</p>
<p>3a. The moddle of november is when I installed MSE and I was fully patched at the time.</p>
<p>3b. I can't scan with Windows Defender because MSE has its&nbsp;own spy and malware, tells me I can't have Defender on at the same time.</p>
<p>4. Yes I downloaded McAfee Removal Tool before downloading MSE.</p>
<p>5. My subsccription with McAfee was current, it started acting funny, telling me my computer was at risk, real time scanning was not coming on(tried turning it on manually and still would not come on), sometimes Windows Sercurity Center would tell me that
 McAfee wasn't turned on, so I removed it and put in MSE.</p>
<p>6. There was Norton on the computer preinstalled but I removed it before I ever used it and I used the removal tool for it also.</p>
<p>7. Automatic Updates is enabled has been seen I first turned on computer in February 2010 and is fully patched.</p>
<p>8. Can not connect to Wi Fi or any of the others because my computer is not a laptop it is a PC.</p>
<p>Note: There has only been one other time since I have had Cricket Broadband that this has happened but with in two days it was back to being fast, this has been going on for ten days now.</p>

<p>1. Does the behavior persist if you start IE8 32-bit in No Add-ons mode?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; =&gt; Start | (All) Programs | Accessories | System Tools | Internet Explorer (No add-ons)</p>
<p>2. Does the behavior persist if you Reset IE Advanced settings &amp; reboot?<br />

<p>3. Were you having these problems BEFORE you replaced the McAfee application with Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE)&nbsp;in mid-November?</p>
<p>4. Did you recently move your Desktop PC to a new location (e.g., away from any windows or in a room without windows)?</p>

<p>2. Yes</p>
<p>3. No, I wasn't having these problems before, the problem didn't start until December 26 almost a month after I replaced McAfee with MSE. I had MSE in for almost a month before this started.</p>

<br />
<p>Chances are&nbsp;a lot of people in your neighborhood got&nbsp;kewl new cellphones/iPhones (and Cricket modems) for Christmas! Everybody's who's downloading/using apps or watching movies on their phones are affecting the quality of your connection.</p>
<p>How's your cellphone reception in the same room? How many bars do you get? If you get more bars elsewhere in your residence, that's where your Desktop PC should be located if your only connection option is Cricket Broadband.</p>
<p>If your webpages, etc.,&nbsp;load faster in the dead of night (e.g., between midnight &amp; 6:00 AM, especially on weekdays), you're seeing the results of excessive demand (i.e., on the mobile network, not your&nbsp;computer)&nbsp;at other times.</p>

<p>My cellphone reception is the same all round my house, the bars do not go down.&nbsp; I have full bars, I have alot of windows in my house.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter what time of the day I am on the internet the pages are slow, so the problem could just be Cricket it self and yes the only other option I have to connect to the internet is dial up had that with my old computer and decided with new computer
 that dial-up wasn't an option. Can't get anything else but those two options -- dial-up or wireless modem that plugs into computer.</p>

<p>You have my sympathies but I know someone who's worse off. He lives deep in the woods of northern Wisconsin (no phone or cellphone). He's got an infra-red antenna nailed to the top of a tree which connects&nbsp;via line-of-sight to&nbsp;another&nbsp;infra-red antenna in
 the top of&nbsp;another tree&nbsp;about 10 miles away. That antenna connects to a lethargic 24 kBps dial-up connection in a guy's house at the bottom of&nbsp;that tree. The guy with the dial-up connection charges others $20/month for the privilege of&nbsp;sharing his&nbsp;connection.</p>
<p>So count your blessings! &lt;wink&gt;</p>

    <title>Unread Filter broken &#40;Outlook for Mac Vers. 15.31&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unread Filter broken &#40;Outlook for Mac Vers. 15.31&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Filters used to work...now they don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what happens. I'm viewing the Inbox. Tab is Home. I select the dropdown for Filter Email. Select Unread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It now shows half Unread and half Read messages all mishmashed together. It does cut down the list of visible emails...removes most of the Unread ones. But it leaves a random smattering of read emails in the view. I've also experienced it not even pulling
 in all Unread emails into the Filter view also, although it's not presently doing that. But it happened last week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to create an Unread Smart Folder and it does the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is incredibly frustrating because i need to see all my Unread emails quickly and not miss any for work. Any advice would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Jarkko,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your issue on how removing your unused phone partnership, you can actually remove it since you can still access your account on your desktop. You just need to check the settings and unlink the phone number that you want to remove.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we want to know what is the exact error message that you are receiving?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
