    <title>How to convert a decimal foot value into feet inches and correct - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to convert a decimal foot value into feet inches and correct fractions up to 15&#47;16&#63; &#91;Excel Office 365 on Windows 7&#93;</h2>
                    <p>No VBA answers please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the following formulas:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=ROUNDDOWN(JA1,0)&amp;"' "&amp;TEXT(MOD(A1,1)*12,"0 #/##")&amp;CHAR(34)</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Which returns an extreme (and difficult to measure) fraction like 23/50.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">
</p><p style="text-align: left">&nbsp; =INT(A1) &amp; " ft " &amp; TEXT(MOD(A1,1)*12, "# ??/16 ""in""")</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Which rounds to the nearest sixteenth but ignores all of the least denominators so we end up with numbers like 10/16 which should be 5/8.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">
</p><p style="text-align: left">What I want to accomplish is converting numbers like:</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">28.27433388<br />
56.54866776<br />
84.82300165<br />
113.0973355<br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Into:</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">28 ft 3&nbsp; 5/16 in<br />
56 ft 6&nbsp; 9/16 in<br />
84 ft 9 7/8 in<br />
113 ft 1&nbsp; 3/16 in<br />

</p><p>To understand the need for TRIM, test with =13+1/12 in A1.&nbsp; Without TRIM, the result would be "13 ft 1&nbsp;&nbsp; in".&nbsp; Note the interstitial spaces.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Note that if A1 rounds to whole feet, the result will be 14 ft 0 in.&nbsp; Okay?</p>

<h2>            Ping on VPN&#39;s Virtual IP gives TTL expired in transit</h2>
                    
<p>E72:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a VPN policy using which i can get connected to intranet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get the following message in VPN Logs:</p>
<p>Information: Address info for VPN access point 'XXXX': virtual IP 'xx.xx.xx.xx'. local IP 'xx.xx.xx.xx', NAT status code 0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But i am unable to access any of my company's internal websites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried pinging this IP Address, and i get the following:</p>
<p>Reply from xx.xx.xx.xx: TTL expired in transit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On running tracert, i get circular hops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that the virtual IP address which i get is correct, but for some un-known reason this is happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            If you're seeing circular hops in the traceroute, that's not your phone, but your company's routers. I would bring this to the attention of the IT department. If you're still unsure, perhaps you could test a different phone? (I'm unsure how your VPN policy
 is being applied. Maybe through a login or a certificate?)<br />
<br />
Incidentally, what programs are you using for ping and traceroute? Are they free? I don't currently have anything like this for my E73. :)

<p>That's less definitive, but I stand by my point.&nbsp; I don't like the looping.&nbsp; Perhaps you could get the IP from a colleague's phone (Symbian or otherwise) that works properly on your Intranet, to run another traceroute test?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's also disappointing that I still can't find a ping/traceroute tool for my phone, hehe...</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion.&nbsp; The program at Symbian Freak was unstable, but looking up the author (Pradeep Kumar) led me to his followup program PNTools, which does seem to work okay.&nbsp; It also includes traceroute and telnet, but I haven't tested the latter
 yet.&nbsp; It also needs signed, which isn't so easy to do today.&nbsp; But for me, that's one more stone turned. :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And hopefully the op has Intranet access working by now...</p>

</span>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for bringing up your query on Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Apologize for the difficulties that you're experiencing in Windows 10.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Not to worry, we’re here to help you out.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>Initially, I suggest you to run Huey Pro as an Administrator and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>As some programs requires administrator privileges to run properly.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>You may right-click on Huey Pro, and select Run as Administrator.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>If the issue persist, let us try to run it in compatibility mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the below steps:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong><span>Right</span></strong><span>-<strong>click </strong>on the setup file of the game and select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>Select <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.</span></li><li>
<span>Place a <strong>check mark </strong>next to <strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong> and select the
</span><span>previous <span>version of Windows from the drop down list.</span></span></li><li>
<span>Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps.</span></p>

<p>I believe I have discovered the root cause of the problem, my Asus monitor driver has/had been updated subsequent to installing Windows 10 (not at the same time, quite separately) and having rolled back the driver to the earlier version the Huey Pro now
 seems to work as it originally did. Thanks to everyone who took the effort to try and help me.<br />

<h2>            help transferring video 5800</h2>
                    
<p>i cant figure out how to transfer a video from my pc to my 5800 so that i can watch it.</p>
<p>if somebody could please explain step by step it would prevent me from smashing the phone with a hammer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i tried using ovi, nokia suite, straight drag and drop, everything.</p>
<p>somehow the file shows up on my memory card when i search, but i cant find it on my phone.</p>
<p>i must be an idiot</p>
<p>the memory shows that the file is somewhere on the phone because it dropped .7gb free space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i just cant figure out how to play it.</p>

<p>The first question is what file format are your videos in? Your phone will play 3GP, MP4(H264), MP4(VSP) and WMV files.Files which are not in a format recognised by the phone, they will not show in the gallery hence your not seeing them, but use the phone's
 File Manager and you will see them even though they are not openable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not familiar with Ovi Suite, I use its sibling N-Series Suite and standard PC Suite personally; but check the settings in the file transfer for conversion. If there is not a possibility to convert the files types that you have into a format suitable
 for the phone, then they will need to be converted prior to the transfer.</p>

<p>I use a program called <font>Joboshare Video Converter V2.4. I hope there is no problem if I mention the name.</font></p>
<p>I choose mp4 from a drop down list of file formats (which is in alphabetic order). Please note that there are several mp4 formats available on the list. I go with the regular one.</p>
<p>It converts the files I plug in the the phone and transfer the file and voila :)</p>

<p>Sounds like files in wrong format. Nokia converters are rubbish IMHO, use another converter. Super converter

<h3> thomas guess  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;The Operation Failed&#34; When opening file attachments on an email.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm having an issue with Outlook 2010. Whenever opening an attachment (txt, pdf, xls, doc, etc.) for the first time I get a message "The operation failed". If I try to open certain files again (pdf, txt) it will open the file correctly. If I try to open
 other files (xls, doc) it tries to open the file with the correct program but says that the file is corrupt. These same items will open on another machine with no problems. And there are no errors in the event logs when this issue happens.</p>
<p>I've tried uninstalling Office, recreating the mail profile, etc. to no avail.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>

<h2>            Install completes-fails to boot after-no error message, nothing</h2>
                    <p>I'm not installing this on an old machine. It's a Dell Latitude 5540 with an i7 and 8GB of RAM. It's only about 2 months old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed from the ISO and the installation completed successfully. As usual, the messages read that the system will reboot several times. When all of this is over, I get the new 'blue' window and the circling dots rotating. This goes on for a few seconds
 and then I just have the blue window left. It just renders this image - no drive activity - no error message - nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

    <title>Multi Column Data validation List - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrewlouwrens  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multi Column Data validation List</h2>
                    <p>I need to populate a Football Team Sheet with Players First Names, Players Surnames, Student Number, Jersey Number, and Bone Fide Number. So 5 columns of info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sheet 1 contains all the player info, that are in that Teams Squad, as described above.
</p>
<p>Sheet 2 has the Blank Team Sheet with the Headings as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I create a Drop-down list, in the Team Sheet, containing the players Information for each of the players that have been picked for a match.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when I place the cursor over the first cell in the Team Sheet all the various players in the squad will appear in the drop down list. I can then scroll and select the player for that position.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One could copy and player from Sheet 1 to Sheet 2, but the Managers we are dealing with are not computer literate and therefore a drop down would be easier for them.</p>

            <p>Hi Selina,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I KNOW this is long but you have several problems and each needs to be explained and addressed in the proper order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see&nbsp;three potential issues here.&nbsp; First, you seem to be infected and that needs to be addressed.&nbsp; Second, I'm not sure how you are protecting your system or what you are using, so once the infections are resolved, we need to address that.&nbsp; Third, it sounds
 like you could benefit from some general security advice -&nbsp;including networking.&nbsp; But, let's take it one step at a time.&nbsp; The&nbsp; most urgent is to clean your system of all infections,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You say you have been infected.&nbsp; What are the full names of these infections and where were they located?&nbsp; How did you discover this - what told you about the infections?&nbsp; What operating system are you using?&nbsp; How is your network setup and what is telling
 you about the unknown accounts?&nbsp; If you can take screenshots and put them on SkyDrive with access to everyone and create links and post them in your next reply (or include the images) that would be helpful since "a picture is worth a thousand words."&nbsp; For
 help doing this, see <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/feedback/forum/feedback_other-na/how-to-insert-images-in-ms-answers/94a5cb36-a21f-4a6a-b266-611cf6c910c8">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*************************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let's address the current infection(s):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm thinking you mean Microsoft Security Essentials rather than Windows Security Essentials (which does not exist and means you either are using some fake product or depending on what comes with Windows - which is not enough).&nbsp; If using MSE, then follow
 these instructions as written for MSE.&nbsp; If not using MSE, use whatever you are using when it calls for MSE and follow the instructions for not using MSE in terms of seeking help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would help to know what infections are involved and all security software you have installed, but lacking that, here are generic instructions.&nbsp; The more you do, the better the chances of cleaning the system - but feel free to jump to the links at the
 end of this section for free expert help at any point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be honest, I'd probably skip to the end and post for help to one of the recommended free malware-removal forums for expert help - but if you want to try some things on your own, here's what I recommend:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Use Disk Cleanup to remove all temporary internet files and all Windows temporary files (and anything else you feel comfortable cleaning up in the process). Then, to be sure, download and use Old Timer TFC to truly get rid of all temporary files:<a href="http://www.geekstogo.com/forum/files/file/187-tfc-temp-file-cleaner-by-oldtimer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.geekstogo.com/forum/files/file/187-tfc-temp-file-cleaner-by-oldtimer/</a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Reboot and empty the Recycle Bin.<span> </span>Then update and run a full scan with the updated MSE.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Even if that comes up clean, if you want to be more sure, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. If that's too many for you, try MBAM, TDSSKiller, and ESET Scanner in that order first. Keep in mind that if we've reached this point,
 we've exhausted pretty much everything short of professional help, so it's up to you how much you want to try yourself before moving on. You can decide to just jump to professional help.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/</a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://superantispyware.com/</a>.
 Then run a full ESET online scan:<a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>. I'd also try Microsoft Safety Scanner:<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a>
 and. because it is likely a win32 infection, especially try TDSSKiller:<a href="http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/solutions?qid=208280684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/solutions?qid=208280684</a>.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try Windows Defender Offline to see if it helps. You probably should create and update (if needed) the disk/USB on a different and clean machine rather than the infected one. The best instructions are this tutorial:<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/166445-windows-defender-offline.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/166445-windows-defender-offline.html</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Properly and completely removing some infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Start here if using MSE - <a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</a> and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected. Options will vary by region, but phone support leads you to Microsoft Answer Desk (<a href="http://www.answerdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.answerdesk.com/</a>)
 in the US at this time. After an initial free consultation, a fee will be charged for assistance, based on the details of the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In other regions not served by the link above or if not using MSE, go here:<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://Support.microsoft.com/security</a> and go to the “assisted support” or contact us menu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you find that too costly, some free malware-removal forums (which take much longer - both to get someone to respond and then to go back and forth working the problem, are forum-based, depend a great deal on the "luck of the draw" concerning who
 gets assigned to your case, and are not guaranteed, and often do not include repairs to damage but just removal of the infection -but your symtoms seem more like a redirect infection than damage to me, but I've seen them help a lot and I've seen them not help
 much at all - and suspect it has more to do with the person assigned than with the sites themselves) include:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>That should take care of the infections once an expert has pronounced you cleaned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>**************************************************************************</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now we'll address your real-time AV program.&nbsp; From what you said, I'm not sure what you're doing or using.&nbsp; You should not be depending on MSRT at all.&nbsp; I'm going to assume you either have nothing but MSRT and possibly Windows Defender or something
 (or many other things) and want to use MSE.&nbsp; Now that the system is clean, we're going to either install it or re-install it (doing all the necessary things along the way).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To be sure, we're going to assume that even if you're using MSE, it was either not installed properly or corrupted by infections and start from scratch.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE<span>.</span><span>This means not only current
 ones but any EVER (including free trials you may never have used) or done years ago and possibly forgotten. See the following compliments of Dave__M:<strong><span>If you aren't sure of what may still be on your system as remnants, which could be interfering
 with the MSE install, try a scan of your system with this security application detection and removal specialist:</span></strong></span><a href="http://www.appremover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://www.appremover.com/</span></strong></a>. THIS IS
 A KEY STEP TO RESOLVING THE PROBLEM. RUN APPREMOVER EVEN IF YOU'RE SURE (one "sure" person was finally convinced to do it and found THREE AV programs on her computer she didn't even know existed - and yes, you installed it before so that shouldn't happen,
 but for some reason V4 seems to be more sensitive to that than prior versions and finds things that others let slip by).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install “McAfee Security Scanner”, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally
 installed Norton, uninstall it and use the&nbsp;Norton cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the
 PC and like any battery can eventually run down).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Then, if anything changed, restart your PC.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To uninstall MSE (if you ever tried whether or not it worked or is&nbsp;what you're using,&nbsp;we must remove that attempt), proceed as follows:</span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</span></a><span>
 or try </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120</span></a><span> If you have some problem with uninstalling the prior version, you may need to focus more on the manual procedures
 in the first link or the second link with the Mr Fixit in aggressive mode AND manual procedures to be sure it is completely removed. THIS IS A CRUCIAL STEP AND MAY BE THE KEY TO THE PROBLEM. BE SURE TO DOUBLE CHECK THE STANDARD UNINSTALLATION WITH THE MANUAL
 PROCEDURES IN YOUR CASE IN PARTICULAR.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install or re-install MSE, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4</a>-
 but also check out the next paragraph before you begin the download. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do or ever did have any other AV program which includes real-time protection even if disabled) installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it or do anything but uninstall the trial version that may have been included), you need to make sure
 they are all uninstalled and fully removed after downloading MSE but before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing of removal tools<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.<span> </span>You cannot just uninstall these programs – you MUST also use the removal tool – even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn’t use a removal tool at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> and click on more languages and versions and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. If you don't see your version listed, don't choose the closest
 one you think might work - post back and tell us what your operating system is so we can help you choose or explain your options. When you download, save it to the desktop (rather than running it). When finished, uninstall and remove any remaining AV program
 you retained for protections during the download and then reboot.Then right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you’re logged in as an administrator) as I’ve found this sometimes helps (this last part does not apply to XP).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a&nbsp;full scan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is as safe
 as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine and
 save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on MAPS and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining the
 infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the MAPS database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now reboot and you should be fully protected by MSE.&nbsp; Next, we'll address security in general:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let's talk about security in general. Because my work entails more risks than the average user, I do more things more frequently than most would need. However, some of this might help (you could reduce the number or the frequency) and some of it applies
 to everyone (especially the bold section):</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Here's what I do (and it isn't 100% but nothing is, and in some cases only catches things after they've already gotten into the system, but it's a good process while remaining reasonable and they can all work together - as proven by the fact that I
 use them):</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I use MSE for real-time protection and run scheduled daily quick scans with a scheduled bi-weekly full scan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I update and periodically (every couple of weeks or so) run full scans with Malwarebytes:</span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><span>and SuperAntiSpyware:
</span><a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a><span> and ESET online scanner:</span><a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</span></a><span>
 Get only the free versions. Any that also have paid versions include features like real-time protection that cannot be used along with MSE anyway (in these cases), so there's no point in spending the money anyway.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I use WOT </span><a href="http://www.mywot.com/en/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.mywot.com/en/download</span></a><span> to help identify safe and dangerous web sites.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I use Secunia PSI </span><a href="http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/</span></a><span> to make sure all my programs are updated and current (since updates often
 plug security holes in the software and thus can be important as many people never check and/or update their software unless prompted - and this way I don't need to check everything since notifications and sometimes updates are automatic).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I always follow the following advice from Stephen Boots - MVP:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure that the Windows Firewall is enabled. </span></b><span>No other firewall truly offers better protection or is needed. This one is perfectly fine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure that all important/critical updates, including service packs for the operating system and programs are installed from Microsoft Update (Windows Update).</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure Internet Explorer is at version 8 or 9 and updated with all patches.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-In Internet Explorer 8 or 9, use the SmartScreen Filter.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure that IE Internet Security settings are at least set to medium-high (default).</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Enable the pop-up blocker in IE.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-On Vista and Windows 7 make sure that User Account Control (UAC) ON and not running with elevated privileges.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure that Windows Automatic Updates are set to at least notify, but the preferred setting is to download and install automatically. If you update manually, be sure to update as soon as possible after being notified of available updates.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-<u>Make sure that installed applications, especially Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Flash, and Java are at their latest versions. Many vendors are regularly updating and patching for security holes.</u></span></b><span>Secunia PSI mentioned above can help
 automate this a lot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Never click through links from unknown sources and use caution even if they are from a "trusted" source.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Never open unsolicited email attachments.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Practice safe web browsing. </span></b><span>No adult sites, no peer-to-peer file sharing sites, no sites offering cracks or free software that you know can't be true, lockdown Facebook to only Friends on EVERYTHING, use WOT mentioned above, use
 Task Manager to close all open instances of your browsers if you ever get a suspicious pop-up {as opposed to clicking the red button or Cancel to close it which could be all it takes to infect you as they may have other code than just what those things commonly
 do}, double check all links in browsers and emails by hovering over them or otherwise checking to see if what they say and where they say they are directed match what is really there {many scams say</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.microsoft.com</span></a><span>
 or user @ microsoft.com but turn out to really be </span><a href="http://www.youarehosedbecauseyouclickedthis.ru/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.youarehosedbecauseyouclickedthis.ru</span></a><span> and when you click you find out why that's the name} and I could
 go on but you get the idea.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>-Always use a standard user account unless you have a specific need for an administrator account. Then switch, do the administrative task, and return to the standard account. This greatly limits the access of any type of infection of intrusion into
 your system since administrative access isn’t in place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>***************************************************</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As far as the networking issues, there's a good chance the above will fix them if caused by infections.&nbsp; If they persist, then we need the information (hopefully screenshots)&nbsp;about your network and the "intruders" to determine if they're real (or&nbsp;misinterpretations)&nbsp;or
 just connections based on what you have installed that you don't recognize, some type of network setup or security issue (like wireless router that isn't secure), or real "intruders" (uncommon but possible).&nbsp; But if it continues, we need that information to
 help as there are way too many possible explanations unless we can narrow it down a lot first.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>*******************************************************</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.&nbsp; If not, post back with as much information as possible about what happened at every step along the way and how you are trying to do this and where you are now stuck and any error messages and/or codes word-for-word (especially any
 that look like 0x80077064 or some other alpha-numeric code) and we'll see if we can figure it out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Kosh</span> </p>

<h2>            How to properly remove&#47;uninstall Azure Ad Connect</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I have installed Azure AD Connect and am hoping to get some guidance on the removal. This is in a test environment utilizing a test tenant in O365.&nbsp;I installed using the SQL express and have too many objects (100k+). I need to get this switched over to
 a SQL standard install but am worried about the implications to existing user objects in O365. I also have duplicate objects for some of the objects and could use some assistance on cleaning that up with something other than IdFix. Is there any documentation
 on uninstall procedures and the pitfalls to look out for?</p>

            <p>Hi Ryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, there is no official guidence to uninstall the AAD Connect. Based on your scenario, you just need to reinstall the AAD connect tool via Control Panel. The objects that have been synced to Office 365 will not be affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>The inbox rules don&#39;t work with connected accounts. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hotmailusersk  say:</h3>
<h2>            The inbox rules don&#39;t work with connected accounts.</h2>
                    After the outlook upgraded, the inbox rules don't work with connected accounts. For example, I got an email to my gmail account, and the email is shown in the inbox. The problem is that the email from my gmail account is not moved to the folder that I
 assigned for emails from the gmail account. None or rules that I assigned don't work with all connected accounts. Is this just a bug?

<p>Is this a migrated account?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Everything used to work perfectly before. The rules still apply for the messages I directly receive on my main (outlook) account. But every other email is somehow ignoring the rules. I've tried reintroducing the rules but they are still being ignored.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Kindly refer to our Technet link below, follow the steps provided by our IT technicians:</p>

2. Click the <strong>Cog icon</strong> located at the upper right corner of the page then select

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>The problem certainly is not "setting up the rules" in fact every person in this conversation said that they already have rules in place, and they are working perfectly fine for emails coming directly to their Microsoft account. The problem is that "same"
 rules don't affect when an email is received via a connected account (like Gmail).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also regarding the steps you mentioned, I'm pretty sure that's the way we could add (and edit) rules in the previous layout, but right there is no "Customize Outlook" to begin with. Regardless, I can see and edit my rules by going through:</p>
<p>Cog Icon -&gt; Options -&gt; Mail -&gt; Automatic Processing -&gt; Inbox and Sweep rules</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've noticed there is also an option the main interface, that when you move an email you can request to create a rule based on your action. For example when I manually move an Email sent by "linkedin" to my "linkedin" folder, there is an option to create
 a rule so that "new mails sent by linkedin should be moved to that folder as well". Using that option didn't help either, it just created a duplicate rule (to what I already had) and now neither of them work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>

<p>Hi, Anthony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't help the rest of us if solutions or follow-up occur off the page! &nbsp;:-) &nbsp;The same question in a linked post (by Ali) also ended without a public solve for the issue. &nbsp;It would be great if you guys (or the tech who ultimately works with the user)
 could do a follow-up reply to the open question, otherwise I'm just wasting time reading through questions and no answers.... &nbsp;Thanks for considering.</p>

</p><p>I didn't get online with the chat with same reason Primrose13 mentioned. It's not just me having a problem, many others do have same problem. And I'm pretty sure we have exactly described what is happening: Something was working, we didn't change anything,

            <p>I will add I have the same issue. &nbsp;With the migration to the new interface, it does appear that rules are not applied to connected accounts. &nbsp;The e-mails sit in the connect account Inbox and are not processed by the rules to move them to other folders. &nbsp;Makes
 it hard to use the interface as a "central mailbox" to consolidate the various addresses I have around the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The rules are there. &nbsp;I even deleted ALL of them and spent time recreating a set of them from the e-mails I wanted moved. &nbsp;Making the rule parsed the Inbox and moved the messages, but each rule was created as "Move these and all future emails from..." and
 the future e-mails are sitting in the Inbox and are not moved. &nbsp;I hope there is a way to get the rules to apply to the connected accounts to move the messages it sees and cleans out the connected account Inbox.</p>

    <title>Excel Survey - Reordering Columns &#38; Loss of Data - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> k gilgenast  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Survey - Reordering Columns &#38; Loss of Data</h2>
                    <p>I created an Excel Survey to collect travel itineraries data from event participants. After I created the survey and submitted a couple of test responses, I realize the need for a couple of additional questions and went back to add them to the survey. I
 found that the instructions provided at the bottom of the help/instructions page here are incorrect:&nbsp;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Surveys-in-Excel-hosted-online-5fafd054-19f8-474c-97ec-b606fcda0ff9</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you copy and paste a column, the connection between the survey and the column that you attempted to move to relocate the data in the same order as it appears on the survey is broken and the data is recorded in the old column in the same order that it
 was added to the survey, at the end, with the column header "Column 1", while the cell under the new column with the copied header is blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I be inserting columns, or completing a different step before the copy paste or is this just a bug? The goal is to get the columns to appear in the same order that they appear on the survey, with the data being recorded in the correct columns in that
 order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>For your situation, you may create a new Excel Survey as a workaround and share it again. Or use the Survey list to collect data, the questions on the Survey list can be reordered
 easily. For the details, please refer to </span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-a-survey-ea52a787-822e-4f7e-b5ed-77bb14df3aba?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Create a survey</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Felix,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply and follow-up. Saving a copy of the Excel Survey and re-sharing it seems to work ok, but that becomes extremely problematic when I need to a update the form and re-publish or share with the users that I have asked to complete it, and
 then combine the data sets in two versions of the survey.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To my knowledge, the Surveys feature is for internal users only, and cannot be shared externally... is this correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a potential solution to the problem of needing to add and reorder questions in an existing Excel Survey that would not have the negative impact noted above?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Excel 2016 on Mac - Slow &#47; Laggy Performance</h2>
                    <p>For over the past year, I have found Excel 2016 on Mac to be incredibly painful to use. When moving between cells or sheets, it's as if there is a delay in the application catching up with what I am doing. Despite Microsoft releasing an article stating that
 this laggy issue was fixed in version 16.11 (https://support.office.com/en-us/article/scrolling-between-cells-in-excel-2016-for-mac-is-slow-df4664ef-160f-4ec9-a596-aa380278ea1c), I am currently on version 16.22 and the problem persists.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I am running Excel 2016 on a powerful MacBook Pro which has far greater resources than the application should need to operate correctly. It runs a 2.9Ghz i7 processor, 16GB 2133Mhz LPDDR3 RAM and 512GB SSD. The operating system is macOS Mojave 10.14.3 but
 this issue pre-dates Mojave too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also get the issue whether or not I have other applications running and regardless of the spreadsheet in use although the bigger the spreadsheet, the more laggy it becomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone come across a fix for this issue please?</p>

<p>Hi space,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re sorry for the inconvenience caused by it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to your description, we would like to convey that, the possible reasons that cause the lag are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. In Excel application, if the view used other than <strong>Normal view.</strong></p>
<p>2. Third-party menu management software.</p>
<p>3. Handoff</p>
<p>4. Corrupted macOS user account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We suggest you check the possible causes one by one, and check whether problem disappears:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. For checking whether view is in Normal or not: Open Excel application&gt; View&gt; Check whether Normal view is selected or not, if no, select it and check.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>In addition to checking Normal view, Open the Mac in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
safe mode</a> and check whether the problem resolves or not. </p>
<p>
</p><p>b. If you enabled Handoff, <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25169?locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
turnoff</a> and restart your Mac to check the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above didn’t help, create a <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25796?locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
new user account</a> in macOS and check whether the problem persists or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anything doesn’t help, can you please provide the following information to move further:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Your detail Excel version with build number. (Open Excel application&gt; Excel&gt; About Excel)</p>
<p>2. If possible, can you please record a video of your problem and provide to us via

<p>Hi RouslanIskhakov,<br />
<br />
I understand that you have sent emails to the *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. As far as I know, after sending the request to that email address, it will take several working days to evaluate it, and then fix it.<br />
<br />
Based on the error message "550 5.7.1 Service unavailable; Client host [X.X.X.X] blocked using FBLW15", it seems that the sender IP address has been blocked by
<em><strong>EOP</strong></em>. So, in order to quickly fix this issue, please help us collect the following information via Private Message:<br />
1. The detailed Non-Delivery Report (NDR).<br />
2. Office 365 tenant information. Please contact the recipient admin and get it.<br />
After getting the information above, our relevant team will check if your public IP has been in the block list of the Office 365 and verify if Office 365 business users need to receive the emails from the affected IP address. If so, they will help you to delist
 it.<br />
<br />
I’ve sent you a private message to collect the requested information. Please click on the link below to access to your Private Message.<br />

<h2>            Can IE10 &#38; IE9 be installed at the same time on the same machine&#63;</h2>
                    Some applications are not recognizing IE10. A solution could involve installing IE9 at the same time that IE10 is installed on the same machine. Is this possible and/or advisable?

            <p>You couldn't install it directly, however you could run it using Application Virtualization. I suggest try run those websites or applications in compatibility view and resolve those problems instead of downgrade to IE9. Windows 8 shipped with IE10 and IE10
 comes with features that improve security and reliability of system.</p>

            <p>A point or 2 you would want to know................</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. You cannot install a program if the computer already has a " higher " version of the same program.</p>
<p>Meaning, if you already have IE10, you cannot install IE9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. It depends on what IE version you were using BEFORE IE10 is installed.</p>
<p>Example.........................</p>
<p>If you had IE9, then install IE10, IE 9 actually is still in your system. If you uninstall IE10, the system will revert back to IE9 automatically. You don't even need to reinstall IE9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. <strong>Warning : do it at your own risk as I do not have the experience in using this method.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;I do know one can " toggle " between IE versions. However, I do not know if that method actually works, because I do not have a program that works in IE9 but not in IE10.</p>
<p>Here is the method I have come across.............</p>
<p>Using IE10 as example : Open IE10 &gt; click Tools &gt; click F12 developer tools ( or you can simply press F12 key ) &gt; wait a bit &gt; at the bottom of your screen, click Browser Mode IE10 &gt; click Internet Explorer 9.&nbsp; I don't know what is the next step.</p>
<p>To get out of it, click File &gt; Exit. Or just simply press F12 key again.</p>

            The compatibility mode of the IE doesn't guarantee the javascript engine will run at the same version like in the previous version of the browser.

<p>I recently, yesterday, downloaded the windows technical preview for windows 10. Shortly after it downloaded, or right after i cannot remember which, the the right click function on my mouse pad stopped working. The multi-touch functions stopped working as
 well, such as using two fingers on the touch pad to scroll down a page. I have been trying for several hours to try to resolve this and I cannot find any solutions. Any help would be much appreciated.

<h3> gwxguesser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Lumia 1520 Lock With Cortana on Start Screen</h2>
                    <div><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; The following describes an issue that is prevalent with the Nokia Lumia 1520 that was brought on by the upgrade of Windows Phone version 8.1. &nbsp;After the upgrade from 8.0 to 8.1, the Lumia 1520 started overheating in the top of the phone
 near the camera. The phone also experiences a “loading” delay between the Lock screen and the Start screen that can only be overcome by conducting a soft reboot of the phone.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I told AT&amp;T that I felt the issue was software related, AT&amp;T preferred replacing the new Nokia 1520 with refurbished Lumia 1520’s twice due to the issue described above. &nbsp;After experiencing the same issue on the 3rd phone received from AT&amp;T, I began
 intensive testing of the software and have concluded that the issue is the result of Cortana being pinned to the Start screen. Yep!, CORTANA is the culprit and needs to be unpinned from the start screen.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the process if CORTANA is pined already:<br />
1) Unpin CORTANA from the start screen<br />
2) Go to "Settings and slide over to Applications and open Cortana<br />
3) Turn off Cortana<br />
4) The phone will RESET<br />
5) Go to "Settings and slide over to Applications and open Cortana<br />
6) Turn on CORTANA<br />
“DO NOT PIN CORTANA TO THE START SCREEN”<br />
7) Swipe the start screen over to the application listing<br />
8) Select CORTANA and allow it to set itself up again<br />
<br />
Now CORTANA is still accessible by the Search icon or from the Application menu.<br />
<br />
Before the update my battery was reading "1 day, 14+ hours". &nbsp;After the 8.1 update I was getting 14 hours and it would start draining.<br />
<br />
After taking CORTANA off of the Start screen my phone stopped getting hot near the camera and the battery has returned back to reading "1 day, 14+ hours".<br />
<br />
My assumption - The matter should be resolved with the Lumia Denim update coming later this quarter.<br />
<br />
When that arrives my understanding is CORTANA will no longer be in BETA in US. Some additional Firmware tweaking, along with camera updates, the issue described above "SHOULD" be resolve.<br />

            <p>Hi, what if one factory resets their phone? Does one have to follow the process? This would mean to enable Cortana as on a fresh install, Cortana isn't functioning. Have unpinned it, however.
</p>
<blockquote>
<div><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; The following describes an issue that is prevalent with the Nokia Lumia 1520 that was brought on by the upgrade of Windows Phone version 8.1. &nbsp;After the upgrade from 8.0 to 8.1, the Lumia 1520 started overheating in the top of the phone near
 the camera. The phone also experiences a “loading” delay between the Lock screen and the Start screen that can only be overcome by conducting a soft reboot of the phone.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I told AT&amp;T that I felt the issue was software related, AT&amp;T preferred replacing the new Nokia 1520 with refurbished Lumia 1520’s twice due to the issue described above. &nbsp;After experiencing the same issue on the 3rd phone received from AT&amp;T, I began
 intensive testing of the software and have concluded that the issue is the result of Cortana being pinned to the Start screen. Yep!, CORTANA is the culprit and needs to be unpinned from the start screen.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the process if CORTANA is pined already:<br />

<h2>            How to upload pictures from my device to my computer&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Hey everyone, I'm really frustrated on how to do this, I've tried looking through the manual but it really is not helping me at all.
<br />
I'm trying to upload pictures from my Samsung Omnia onto my desktop but I cant seem to find them at all after I've synched my device to my computer.<br />
I try to cut and paste from 'My Storage' and to 'My device' but then when I try and open the file to view it on my computer the pop up message says that it's a read only file' Arrrggghhh!!!! I've been trying to work this out for so long and I'm about to through
 my mobile against a brick wall!!!! Been trying to do this via the data cable. I cant do it any other way because this phone was purchased in Australia and I now reside in New Zealand so it has no mobile service anymore. So using the e-mail or MMS to send the
 photo's is out of the question and my PC does not have bluetooth capability so file transferring has to be done via the data cable.....<br />
<br />
Someone! PLEASE! Help Me!<br />
<br />
So basically all I'm trying to do is upload all my photo's from my mobile to my computer.<br />
<br />
My device is a Samsung Omnia (SGH-i900) my computer has windows XP

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You must copy the files from the My Storage to a folder on your computer, not the My device folder.
<br />
<br />
Do you see a folder with your device name on your PC's desktop. If yes, your synchronized&nbsp;pictures should be there.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Adrian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, I'd like to say this forum mainly focuses on Office 365 for Business online services (ie, Skype for Business online). So, for Skype related issue/question, please visit the Skype forum and post there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, please be noted that the content related to Skype for Business (IMs, Files transferred during the meeting) is encrypted. Let me explain more: By default, Skype for Business IMs will be saved in Exchange online Conversation History folder. As a
 result, the content is encrypted via the Office encryption as well as the files transmitting. For detailed information, you can refer to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Encryption-in-Office-365-0A322724-08CA-43DB-B69A-AFBFA20484CD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 Encryption</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Alan</p>

            Do you mean that you want to change the font PPT uses to display your notes text when you're in Presenter View?
<div><br />
<div>I'm afraid PPT doesn't allow that.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The next version will at least allow you to change the size of the text though, a big improvement.&nbsp;</div>
