<h2>            Password cannot be changed</h2>
                    I'm trying to change my password to access the computer, but it's giving me a message that this action cannot be taken at this time. Is there a work around?

<h2>            Ark Survival Evolved - Harassment, threats, abuse, griefing, and racism from a player</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday night my brother and I were harassed, threatened, and abused in the game Ark Survival Evolved. I&nbsp;have written the game designer company Studio Wildcard over the matter and was pressed to write it here as well. The events involve others over the past few weeks but I am not one to put up with stuff like this. We play on the XBox official North American&nbsp;PVE&nbsp;server -&nbsp;The Island -&nbsp;201. It is a public Xbox server and no ones personal server they can control. However this one player by the XBox&nbsp;gamer tag: DG Ancient believes that because he is such a higher level, that he can do what he wants, when he wants, and if you don't do what he says, forces people to do so or forces them from the server. By which,&nbsp;because he is so high level and his dinos he has tamed are high level, will kite other high level wild predator&nbsp;dinos into bases to kill off&nbsp;your&nbsp;dinos and destroy their bases. Yesterday afternoon a player was wanting to buy a high l



<p>So the early evening comes&nbsp;and my brother and a few others tell&nbsp;me about this guy's nerd rage from earlier&nbsp;and then someone posted a few minutes later&nbsp;about wanting to buy a dino, in which I wrote in the general server chat "that I&nbsp;thought that was frowned upon and that you'll face the wrath of a certain player..." not knowing DG Ancient was even on, nor would I&nbsp;care. It was an indirect comment with no threat, harassment, swearing, etc. from me. I&nbsp;then go AFK for 10-15 mins to make coffee then my brother yells at me saying a dino is inside our base killing our dinos... I&nbsp;get back to the game&nbsp;and go outside our base (which was walled up all around&nbsp;but that DG Ancient exploited a break in the wall along the cliff face our base is located at&nbsp;due to the cliff face at a slight angle but could no longer build our perimeter fence&nbsp;on). As I get outside DG&nbsp;Ancient&nbsp;writes "someone ordered a giga party". Giga being the trophy dino for large raid gr



<p>Now for the griefing, DG Ancient's&nbsp;tribe in the game has posted pillars on a majority of the map as well... essentially controlling where anyone can build. They didn't get the whole map because it is pretty large and&nbsp;heavily wooded,&nbsp;dense areas, however they do control a majority of it, being marked off from other players building where they want. As for the racism, he posted why are&nbsp;people are speaking French when it was a North American server and that they are lagging out the server... obviously not knowing about French Canadians who play. Some of the other players took offense to it and asked me to report it as well.</p><p><br /></p>



<p>As I have said, I&nbsp;did contact the game designer company Studio Wildcard&nbsp;and let them know of the events, as well as the people and their gamer tags who were involved and those of us who are being harassed, threatened, abused, etc. Listed below are the definitive&nbsp;gamer tags of those who did the event and his lackeys and those who have been subjected to his "rule" and can verify said claims.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>Hey Steven!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to bring this issue to us! Since the Power and Start Up settings seem to be correctly set up the issue seems to be on the update itself (the Operating System). We suggest a Reset of the console to clear any issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>
Go ahead and perform a<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Ctrl+Click to follow link https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults">
Soft Factory Reset</a> (while keeping games and apps) <strong>
IF AND ONLY IF THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA IS MET:&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">There
 is a stable network connection.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The
 information for all profiles is known (email and passwords)</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Once the setup is complete it will ask if we want to keep settings or manual setup lets do manual setup. Give it a shot and let us know of any changes!</p>

            Thanks for the reply! So when the reset is selected it does give two options.
<strong>IT IS VERY IMPORTANT: </strong>Select the second option, Keep Games and Apps so it doesn't affect any games or saved data. Keep us posted on how it goes!!

<p>Hi there Steven, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply! If you are still experiencing the same issue after going over the solution provided on the articles, it may be a possibility that some troubleshooting needs to be done on the external hard drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend checking out the <a href="https://www.seagate.com/contacts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Seagate support page </a>for more assistance with the external hard drive. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. </p>

<p>I'm having similar issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After updating to the latest system software, I was having various issues with the dashboard not performing particularly well, so I decided to do a factory reset of the console (an Xbox One X). After doing the factory reset, my external hard drive (Seagate
 Backup Plus Hub 8TB) was no longer recognised by my Xbox. I tried different USB ports, different cables, even another factory reset, but nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When connected to my PC, the drive showed up in Disk Management just fine, so it appeared to be physically working. As my options were exhausted, I decided to format the drive in Windows and see if the Xbox would pick it up then. That worked and as soon
 as I connected the freshly formatted drive to my Xbox, it was detected and I was able to format it for use as Xbox storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, now I have 2 further problems: -</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If I use "instant on" mode, when I turn the console off, my hard drive constantly spins up and down. I only have one game stored on it at the moment (Pinball FX3). The drive powers on, spins up, powers off, spins down, and this happens every 30 seconds
 or so and goes on indefinitely. None of the settings related to external hard drives make any difference to this behaviour. Before the latest update, my external would spin up periodically when the console checked for updates, was downloading an update, or
 I remotely queued up a game download, but at all other times it would be off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If I use "energy saving" mode, when I turn the console off, the power light on the external goes off, but the drive inside continues to spin and never actually turns off. The only way I can get it to stop is to unplug the USB cable from the console. Before
 the latest update, when I turned my console off, it would also fully power off my external, which would stay off until the next time I turned the console on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, right now, the only way I can get the drive to actually turn off and not keep constantly power cycling or spinning is to unplug the USB cable from the console when I turn it off, then plug it back on just before I turn it back on - far from ideal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded Seagate's SeaTools application and used it to run several tests on the drive to check for issues, but it passed them all and no issues were found. Also, it is working as it should on my Windows 10 PC, which makes me think this is an Xbox system
 software issue, especially as other people both here and on Reddit are saying that they're having similar issues after the latest update.</p>

<h2>            Millions of Credit on Forza 4.</h2>
                    
<p>How do people get millions of dollars on Forza 4? I heard this guy say he was going to give someone 7Mil, And the other day someone else said they got like 80Mil from someone. How do you get that much money? I've been playing Forza 4 for like 2-3 months
 now and the most i've got to was like 150,000 Credits.</p>

<p>80 million credits is possible if you have played the majority of the game and sold cars and designs on the storefront.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>however there are many people using a credit cheat that they obtain from the internet that gives them hundreds of millions of credits.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>using this credit cheat will get you a 20 year ban from all forza games as you will get caught the second you buy anything.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>even receiving these credits from someone else that has cheated can get YOU banned.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>after finishing the 10 year career mode i had around 10 million credits.</p>

<p>With being able to get 100% discount on parts after only 4 car levels, its easy to save bank for cars. I think that was their original plan since there are lots of cars worth tens of millions of credits, and having to buy parts makes it difficult.</p>

            <p>Are you running cCleaner automatically or manually?</p>
<p>Do not use the Registry Cleaner component in cCleaner. Otherwise you should not get the problems you describe if you manually clean. I have not run cCleaner automatically but I am surprised that cCleaner might have caused the problems you describe.</p>
<p>Removing restore points is an option separate from the main cleaning function. It enables you to selectively remove less important restore points. This is an infinitely better arrangement than exists with the system provided Disk CleanUp utility. What anti-virus
 software and what firewall are you using&nbsp;as these can cause problems for system restore?</p>
<p>What backup files were removed. In what folder were they located?</p>
<p>To&nbsp;lose data on your external drive you must have selected the drive and then a sub-option of Drive Wiper as the default option for Drive Wiper is to wipe free space only.&nbsp;Another, non-default option wipes all data from the selected drive.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Unable to use Windows Live Mail 2012 with Windows 8</h2>
                    I have been using Windows 8 since last 3-4 months and I always use Windows Live Mail for my hotmail and other accounts.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Until, last month the Windows Live Mail used to work perfectly with Windows 8. But then I don't know what happened to my system, Email never got downloaded anymore. If I click send &amp;&nbsp;receive&nbsp;tab then I used to get the following error:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>Unable to send or receive messages for the Hotmail (parinbhimani) account.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Server Error: 3204</div>
<div>Server: 'https://mail.services.live.com/DeltaSync_v2.0.0/Sync.aspx'</div>
<div>Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x8DE20003</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been in contact with the Windows Live team and they said that I needd to edit the registry on the affected machine. And for the same they said to contact Windows 8 Forum.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I really need your help. Your help in this matter would be highly appreciated.</div>

            <p>Thanks for that info.&nbsp; I've seen that this error can sometimes be caused by issues that need resolved in your account from the website, but visiting the website should have prompted those if they were present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I start suggesting some steps, I'm curious what you might have already tried?&nbsp; I don't want to ask you to repeat steps, but some things I would try first would be removing the account from the Live Mail program and adding it again, or uninstalling
 the Live Mail program completely and then installing it again.</p>

Does this mean that you&nbsp;did the registry change and it didn't help, or that you haven't done it?<br />

<p>I too am having problems, again, with my Windows Live Mail 2012.&nbsp; I have Windows 8.&nbsp; And have McAfee antivirus.&nbsp; I have not been receiving any email the past 4-5 days.&nbsp; This happened back in May &amp; I was sent to "Fax Fix 123".&nbsp; I know, I'm a fool, but they
 did fix the problem, after charging me an arm &amp; a leg,&nbsp; They said it has something to do with McAfee updates filling something up on the computer.&nbsp; Is there something I can do to fix this?&nbsp; I don't want to go back &amp; pay another arm &amp; leg again as I have a
 feeling this will be happening every few months.&nbsp; Just can't afford this.</p>

            <p><span>Hi JEM, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer this question to get more clarity on this issue.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur if some system files associated with the Windows Update components folder are not working properly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us follow these methods and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1.</strong></p>
<p><span>Try using the Windows Update troubleshooter to fix the problem. It makes sure that your computer is connected to the Internet, and checks to see whether your network adapter and Windows Update services are running correctly.
 After running this troubleshooter, restart the computer and check the update status.</span></p>
<p><strong>Open the Windows Update troubleshooter</strong><span>:

<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 2.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>You may boot the computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue persists. When you start Microsoft Windows, typically there are several programs that start automatically
 and run in the background that may interfere with the game. These programs may include antivirus and system utility programs. When you perform a clean startup procedure, you prevent these programs from starting automatically.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow steps under “<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>” in the article to boot to normal startup.</span></p>

    <title>Exchanging a digital game for a different one&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sickmanjaro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Exchanging a digital game for a different one&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I usually purchase a hard copy for games, but decided to purchase Halo 5 digitally a few days ago. I was a huge Halo fan from the start of H1, H2 and H3. I even modeled my gamer tag SICKMANJARO off the games kill streak medal killimanjaro. Sadly Halo series
 has gone downhill for me in my opinion after H3. I have bought every halo game to date hoping they would fulfill the void since H3 but no luck. I played the H5 beta and with friends and we loved it! But After a few days of playing H5 I am shocked at how different
 it was from the beta and how truly bad it is. I cannot stand to play the game It's so bad. Personally think that 343 is doing a terrible job with the franchise and shaming the game which started it all. I won't even get into COD AW(couldn't stand either) and
 Black Ops 3 beta was terrible. Only reason I'm debating buying the game is for Zombies. But that's a big if. Maybe I just don't like the direction these shooters are going in. Hopefully Fallout 4 lives up to the hype. Tomb Raider looks awesome as well. But
 I most likely won't buy anything digitally again if you can't exchange if you arent a happy customer. So I'm reluctant to buy anything at the moment as I don't have $65 to throw around to see if a game isnt worth it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am humbly asking to exchange the game in return for another game. Not a refund. I have been loyal to only Xbox since 2005.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Barwel,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry that the issue still persists!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may be getting this error message if the ‘print spooler’ service is corrupted. In Windows 7 we will not be able to re create the service so you might have
 to perform In-place upgrade.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Configure the machine in clean boot state. You can follow the given steps:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The steps to be performed in clean boot are given below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:
</strong>Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not
 do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For further information on clean boot please follow the below given link:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NOTE:</span></strong> To perform an upgrade or the “in-place Upgrade” you must roll back to whatever
 Service Pack is on the installation DVD i.e. if you have no Service Pack on the DVD, and there shouldn't be any Service Pack on the machine before trying these steps.&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>To upgrade the current Windows operating system on your computer to Windows 7, follow these steps:
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start the computer and make sure that the current version of Windows has started.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Start and then click on Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Program and then click on Turn Windows Features On or Off under Programs and Features.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncheck –</span></p>
<p><span>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft .Net framework 3.0</span></p>
<p><span>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remote Differential Compression</span></p>
<p><span>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows DFS Replication Service</span></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once done, restart the computer and follow the rest of the steps.</span></p>
<p><span>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Insert the Windows 7 DVD into the DVD drive and then close the drive tray. Wait a moment for the Setup program to start automatically.</span></p>
<p><span>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Setup program does not start automatically, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>Click Start and then click Run.</span></p>
<p><span>Type Drive:\setup.exe and then click OK.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Note:</span>
</strong>Drive is the drive letter of the computer’s DVD drive.</span></p>
<p><span>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Setup program starts and the Install now screen appears, click Install now.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Note:</span></strong> When you receive with the Get important updates for installation message, click on
 Go Online. </span></p>
<p><span>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Upgrade when the "Which type of installation do you want?" screen appears.</span></p>
<p><span>10.&nbsp; Follow the instructions to install Windows 7.
</span></p>

Uninstall it and get something better. Free (not from some ISP/computer manufacturer getting a kickback) and probably less resource intensive with better results all around.<br />
&nbsp;
<p>Get rid of McAfee. Anything and everything made by McAfee.<br />
&nbsp; </p>
<p>As far as AntiVirus - the free ones are fine: <a href="http://www.avira.com/en/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">Avira</font></a>, <a href="http://free.avg.com/us-en/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">AVG</font></a>, <a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">Avast</font></a><br />
You could spend ~60USD for two years of <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/home/products/antivirus-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">eSET NOD32 AntiVirus</font></a> (not the suite - just the AntiVirus product) and that would be more than worth it.<br />
&nbsp; </p>
<p>In your case, here is what I suggest...<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pick a product other than McAfee and/or Norton. Get it.<br />
&nbsp; </p>
<p>Uninstall the McAfee stuff (use their <a href="http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=TS101331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">removal tool from here</font></a>.)<br />
&nbsp; </p>
<p>After a reboot - install your new product and update it after the install.<br />
&nbsp; </p>
<p>Perform a full scan with it.<br />
&nbsp; </p>
<p>Then - just to make sure you started out on the right foot...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong><u>Check for malware:</u></strong></p>
<p>Download, install, run, update and perform full system scans with the following two applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://malwarebytes.org/mbam-download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">MalwareBytes (FREE)</font></a></li><li><a href="http://superantispyware.com/downloadfile.html?productid=SUPERANTISPYWAREFREE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">SuperAntiSpyware (FREE)</font></a></li></ul>
<p><br />
Removing everything they find. Rebooting when needed. (You can uninstall one or both when done.)<br />
&nbsp; </p>
<p>Then perform an online scan with the <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">eSet Online Scanner</font></a>. Remove anything it finds.<br />
&nbsp; </p>
<p>Reboot.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Don't forget to come back and comment.</p>

            <p>Your post is slightly confusing however although you are asking for help removing McAfee what Kaspersky is actually complaining about is residue from an installation of F-Prot which is actually a completely different antivirus package.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So in fact you need to follow both suggestions. Gerry's link takes you through uninstalling F-Prot although I suspect the 1st part can't be done because it has already been run. If so then the section after the Warning in bold needs to worked through carefully.
 You may not find all of the registry key references but check each one and delete if found. Again after the reboot you may not find all of the files/folders listed but delete those that you do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>McAfee may have actually been uninstalled but it does tend to also leave some bits behind so then download the MCPR.exe from Shenans link as it may help and certainly will not do any harm. If possible as at the moment you do not have an effective AV installed
 it would be better to use a different protected system to go on the web and put the file on a USB key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Install the Kaspersky as that is what you have already chosen, nothing wrong with that AV,&nbsp;update to the latest template file and then do a full system scan. You really don't need the other programs (SAS, MalwareBytes) unless you think you have a problem.</p>

 5 months old!!!!&nbsp; So, with no help.... we decided to try to hook my C Drive up as a slave to my room mates computer.&nbsp; We got it working and the drive appears to be fine (except for a friendly worm)<br />
<br />
We are going to move all contents of the drive to an external and wipe the current drive clean, and reinstall vista.&nbsp; No problem right?&nbsp; Well.... When I look for my personal user profile, it isnt there.&nbsp; I have the option of Default and Public.&nbsp; Yet, the Users
 folder is HUGE and is the same size as it was when hooked to my computer.&nbsp; I just cannot see any of the files associated with my name.<br />
<br />
How do I get to see my profile?&nbsp; Yes, I am the Admin (but the profile is named Lor).&nbsp; When scanning the drive with Malware Bytes, it shows all the folders in my Profile, I just cannot access them from the drive itself.<br />
<br />
What am I missing?&nbsp; I'm ready to pull my hair out!

    <title>P.N.04... Or a Product Number 03 sequel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> isturbo1984  say:</h3>
<h2>            P.N.04... Or a Product Number 03 sequel</h2>
                    
<p>I randomly remembered this game from the early 2000s. P.N.03 was one of five Capcom games to be released on the GameCube, including Killer7, Dead Phoenix (cancelled), Viewtiful Joe and Resident Evil 4. They were all meant to be exclusives, but P.N.03 was
 the only one that remained such. It is a really fun and different game at the time and would live to see a sequel. There are so many things with a title like this, the character and setting that could be molded into a stupendous game of this generation of
 games.</p>
<p><br />
Anyone remember this game?</p>

<p>I remember the game itself, though I never really had the chance to play it. I just remember seeing a lot of screenshots and the main character herself way back when. P.N. 03 served a huge inspiration for me, even though it was just few pictures that I saw.
 If I remember correctly, wasn't it like some kind of third-person shooter? It sorta looked like Vanquish, right?</p>

<p>Sorta Vanquish-like, yeah. TPS... the main character shoots energy bolts from the palms of the hands from her suit. Fairly tough game. Very, actually.</p>

<p>Love that game, bought it back when it release in 2003, got a lot of flak because of its stale visuals (except for the main character) and boring gameplay apparently.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I liked it, it was like an arcade shooter in a 3d environment, the ending was neat too.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Would be nice to see some sort of sequel, but seeing how Capcom sucks these days I doubt we will ever see one, it was also made by Shinji Mikami (of RE fame) and he has long left the company.</p>

            Hi Alma.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />This can happen if you're using the WIndows Printer Preferences or Properties and not the actual full printer software that maintains all of these features.  
<br />
<br />Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Reinstall the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall the printer software.    
<br />
<br />3) Use one of these methods to remove all of the old printer drivers:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-uninstall-printer-driver-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-unin...</a>
<br />
<br />4)  Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click the printer to delete the Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />5) Go to the printer model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />
<br />6) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>I cannot uninstall MS Flight Simulator Delux - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peter fitzsimmons  say:</h3>
<h2>            I cannot uninstall MS Flight Simulator Delux</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I have tried several times to uninstall MS Flight Simulator Delux [<strong>MS Flt Sim</strong>] as seem to be having some issues with the Saitek Smart Technology Program and
<strong>MS Flt Sim</strong>.</p>
<p>I endevoured to do a repair using the DVD's that I bought a couple of years ago, but there seems to be no repair vacility, it was at this time that I uninstalled the Service 2 and then endevoured to uninstall the program, the uninstall would start, however
 after 15 to 20 seconds it would drop out like the program was not there, how ever in the Uninstall or Change Window of the Control Panel it says the program is still there.</p>
<p>At this time I thought that there might have been some sort of cruption in the installation system&nbsp;somewhere, so I unintalled another program that&nbsp;I could reinstall, this worked well. The next step was to think that there was an issue with a corrupt file
 in&nbsp;<strong>MS Flt Sim</strong> so I &nbsp;endevoured to reinstall it. I could not acomplish this as the DVD installing proceedure went well until I had nearly finished loading the 2nd DVD, the instalation asked for another DVD and gave&nbsp;identification of the DVD
 required. I put the 1st DVD in as one does and the instalation proceedure stopped. I was at a loss as to what to do at this stage, so as it was late I though on it over night.</p>
<p>The next day&nbsp;I reinstalled the Service Packs 1 and then I went to reinstall Service Pack 2. for some reason when I went to do this it asked me for the english version of this program. As&nbsp;I could not open the
<strong>MS Flt Sim</strong> program to get a new download of the Service pack 2, so&nbsp;I went and look on the NET to see what&nbsp;I could find. After a little I found a
<strong>MS Flt Sim</strong> trial I downloaded this into my PC and and using this program to redownload and run Service pack 2, same result, looking for the english version of
<strong>MS Flt Sim</strong>.</p>
<p>So now I tried to to first, uninstall the program using the &nbsp;reinstall the program from the DVDs to no avail. So then I manually deleted the MS Flt Sim from the C drive and tried to uninstall it, nothing, then to reninstall it, nothing, all the same issue
 as discribed as above. So here we are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mother board is: Foxconn H55MXV Series (CPU 1)</p>
<p>The CPU is:&nbsp;Intel Core i5 760&nbsp; @ 2.80GHz&nbsp;Lynnfield 45nm Technology</p>
<p>The RAM is: 8.0GB Dual-Channel DDR3 @ 664MHz</p>
<p>the System is: MS Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit SP1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope to hear from you soon</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Peter Fitzsimmons.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you get any error message?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you consider uninstalling it in
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>safe mode</strong></a>?</p>
<p>If not, try uninstalling it in
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>safe mode</strong></a> and check if it uninstalls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To manually uninstall the game follow these steps:</span><br />
<b><br />
WARNING</b> - this will completely remove everything associated with FSX including your saved flights and fsx.cfg. &nbsp;Back these up if you'd like, but it is imperative that you start off completely
 clean to ensure such files weren't involved with your issue. &nbsp;Leaving them there through the reinstall could trigger the issue again if it is related to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Go to <b>Add or Remove Programs</b> under Windows XP or
<b>Programs and Features</b> under Windows 7. &nbsp;Remove any addons you have installed for FSX, including aircraft, scenery, and utilities such as weather addons. &nbsp;You need to do this because many addons (like our own) feature validation protection that will get
 reset when you uninstall, if you leave your addons there, they may fail to reinstall correctly later. &nbsp;You cannot just copy addon folders and then copy them back in later - this does not work for most due to things that need to happen during their installation
 to properly setup and validate them.<br />
<br />
Double check the list and make sure you got all of them. &nbsp;You may also want to check the Start Menu Programs list and see if you have any addons remaining there as well which may only uninstall through a link in the menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Find the entry for FSX and uninstall it. &nbsp;This may say Acceleration, Service Pack 2, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Once it is done uninstalling, close the control panel and reopen it. &nbsp;It is likely you will now see FSX still present in the list. &nbsp;This is because the previous step only uninstalls the Acceleration pack or
 Service Pack. &nbsp;Uninstall whatever is now in the list for FSX. &nbsp;Keep going through this step until no FSX entry shows up after you reload the control panel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Open Windows Explorer and find your FSX folder. &nbsp;By default this is located at:<br />
<br />
32-bit versions of Windows:&nbsp;<b>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X</b><br />
64-bit versions of Windows:&nbsp;<b>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X</b><br />
<br />
Delete this folder (just the FSX one, not the entire tree), answering yes to any dialogs that pop up warning you about it. &nbsp;You don't want anything left over in this folder so that we start out completely clean for the reinstall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Open Windows Explorer and find your FSX application data folder. &nbsp;By default this is located at:<br />
<br />
Windows XP: <b>C:\Documents and Settings\<i>(Your Windows Account Name)</i>\Application Data\Microsoft\FSX</b><br />
Windows Vista\Windows 7: <b>C:\Users\<i>(Your Windows Account Name)</i>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\FSX</b><br />
<br />
Delete this folder as before, being careful to only delete the FSX part, not the entire folder tree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Open Windows Explorer and find your FSX shader cache folder. &nbsp;By default this is located at:<br />
<br />
Windows XP:&nbsp;<b>C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\FSX</b><br />
Windows Vista\Windows 7:&nbsp;<b>C:\Users\<i>(Your Windows Account Name)</i>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\FSX</b><br />
<br />
Delete this folder as before, being careful to only delete the FSX part, not the entire folder tree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>g)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Open Windows Explorer and find your FSX saved flights folder. &nbsp;By default this is located at:<br />
<br />
Windows XP: <b>C:\Documents and Settings\<i>(Your Windows Account Name)</i>\My Documents\Flight Simulator X Files</b><br />
Windows Vista: <b>C:\Users\<i>(Your Windows Account Name)</i>\Documents\Flight Simulator X Files</b><br />
Windows 7:&nbsp;<b>C:\Users\<i>(Your Windows Account Name)</i>\My Documents\Flight Simulator X Files</b><br />
<br />
Delete this folder as with the two above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>h)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>The system is now clean of FSX.</p>

 matter what I try, including searching the internet for a fix on forums, none seem to work. My screen locks after 30-60 seconds no matter what and I need to log back in again each time even if I go into settings and disable this!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>please help a truly frustrated windows 10 user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p>You probably already checked these, but just to make sure one isn't the case, here's every location I can think of that can control this timer.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong><span>Right-click Desktop &gt; Personalize &gt; Screensaver</span></strong><span><br />
Even if you don't use a screensaver, this timer value is used to lock the screen.&nbsp; Set this to "none" and&nbsp;<em>make sure the checkbox is off so it doesn't require a password</em>.<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></li><li><strong><span>Power Options &gt; Change when to turn off the display<br />
<br />
</span></strong></li><li><strong><span>Power Options &gt; Change when the computer sleeps<br />
<br />
</span></strong></li><li><strong><span>PC Settings App &gt; Lock Screen Settings</span></strong></li></ol>
