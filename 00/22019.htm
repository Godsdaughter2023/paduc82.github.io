<h2>            Missing draft emails- folder shows 10 drafts but folder empty</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>I seem to have lost 10 draft emails. According to the outlook.com app on my Xperia M2 phone, I should&nbsp;have 10 emails in the draft folder but there are none the folder is completely&nbsp;empty. &nbsp;Yet according to my PC outlook&nbsp;account, I have&nbsp;5 drafts which I can
 see and access. &nbsp;I can't access these on my phone yet I have full access to every other outcome folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem has existed for several months and despite searching for a solution I can't find one. Unfortunately&nbsp;other than the current 5 I can see on my PC ( and I am not convinced they relate to the original 10) I have no idea what the other 5 refer to.
 Can anyone offer a solution, please?</p>

            <p>This may happen if you are using POP (Post Office Protocol) connection on your phone's Outlook application to retrieve the emails from your Outlook.com account. The following are what may have happened:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>The five draft messages from your Outlook.com account have been downloaded on your phone.
</li><li>Then, another five draft emails have been created on your phone. These will not reflect on Outlook.com since the connection we are using is POP.</li><li>The total draft messages becomes 10. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is about the 10 messages that are not showing, which can be related to the app. We recommend uninstalling the Outlook application and reinstalling it.
</p>
<p>

    <title>High CPU usage while using DownThemAll&#33; Firefox addon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ksib  say:</h3>
<h2>            High CPU usage while using DownThemAll&#33; Firefox addon</h2>
                    <strong>Problem</strong> <br />
Here's the problem. MSE makes my CPU usage go up to around 30-35 and I can actually hear my machine making noise (which I normally don't even with highly intensive graphics applications such as Batman Arkham Asylum on max settings) when I use the DownThemAll!
 add-on in Firefox to download a reasonably large file ~1GB (keep in mind this happens for smaller files, but not nearly as noticable compared to larger ones). I'm not sure if it's how DownThemAll! pre-allocates files or what, but MSE scans the file relentlessly.
 I also tried to download from an Ubuntu torrent using ÂµTorrent and turned on pre-allocate files to see if the same thing happened and it did not.
<br />
<br />
The folder that the file was partially downloaded using DownThemAll! wouldn't let me delete the file and the window as well as the Windows taskbar became unresponsive. I tried a reboot to see if MSE would let up on the scan and it wouldn't so I turned off the
 real-time protection and I could delete the file finally.<br />
<br />
Downloading via the normal means in Firefox seems to work fine so far. I haven't seen what it does when Firefox download window says "Scanning for viruses," or whatever. It's when I begin downloading a file and when I either pause, stop, or are almost done
 downloading a file using DownThemAll! this happens. My machine also (obviously) becomes noticably slower.<br />
<br />
This seems like a pretty big issue if people are using similar download tools and their machine becomes unresponsive for long periods of time. I waited 5 minutes or so and my machine never became fully responsive, this is when I decided to reboot and turn off
 real-time protection temporarily. I've downloaded files using Avira and Kapersky, but I haven't had these problems. However, I stopped using those for other reasons.<br />

            This file is clearly taking a long time to scan.&nbsp; I'm passing it along to the team that owns this area.&nbsp; Thank you for your feedback.<br />
<br />
If the game wasn't so good, maybe MSE was just looking out for you. :)<br />

<p><span>Hi Jamie,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please try the steps below to see if the issue can be resolved:</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>1) Start Outlook in safe mode following&nbsp;steps mentioned below and then try sending emails:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Hold Windows key + R.</span></li><li><span>Copy and paste, or type the following command in the Open box, and then press Enter:<br />
Outlook /safe<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
Note: There is space between Outlook and /</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>If Outlook works&nbsp;in&nbsp;safe&nbsp;mode as expected, disable the add-ins following steps mentioned below to determine the
 problem causing add-in:</span></span></p>
<p><span>2) a) Click on<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>File menu</span></strong>, click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Options</span></strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Add-ins</span></strong>,
 and Go button besides Manage: Com-in Add.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox.<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;c) Close the Office program and restart it.<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;d) Disable each add-in one at a time, restart the Outlook, and repeat the above procedure. If the issue reappears again, it will help you to determine which add-in is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>You may also update your video drivers to the latest version. Please use the following steps to
 update your video card drivers.</span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>On the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Start</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Screen, click Settings on
 the Charms Bar.</span></li><li><span>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Change PC Settings</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>.</span></li><li><span>In the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>PC settings</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>app, click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Windows
 Update</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>.</span></li><li><span>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Check for updates now</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>.</span></li><li><span>If updates are available, click the driver that you want to install, and then click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Install</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, please confirm the following information to better understand the situation:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Is it an Exchange Online account that you have configured in your Outlook client?</span></p>
<p><span>2. If yes, how do you configure it in the client, through Exchange, POP or IMAP?</span></p>
<p><span>3. </span><span>To check whether the issue is related to the Outlook profile, can you please
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-profiles-in-Outlook-2016-for-Mac-fed2a955-74df-4a24-bef6-78a426958c4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
create a new profile</a> to see if the issue persists in the new profile? (Please donât remove your old profile just in case the new profile doesnât work).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Robert</span></p>

            <p>I had the same "Time limit for logging on was reached while waiting for system resources. Try again. MAPI 1.0 [000004C2]" this morning. I have Choose Profile selected, but with this error, Outlook didn't even get to the point of prompting me to select a
 profile to open. &nbsp;I had tried to start Outlook in safe mode and I got the same result.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, it turned out to be a problem with a third-party MAPI application referencing an old profile I deleted. &nbsp;As soon as the stopped the application, Outlook opened. &nbsp; I corrected the problem by deleting the data file the application used to reference
 the old profile.</p>

<p>Hi Lisa Sykes (lisa.sykes),</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in our forum. According to your description, do you mean that your problem was fixed by creating a new Outlook profile? Based on my tests in the same version of Outlook as yours, it works fine from my side. If the issue
 was resolved by creating a new profile , the problem may be caused by something corrupted in the Outlook profile. All the data and custom settings are stored in the OST/PST file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this situation, if you encounter this problem again, you can also try using the

<h2>            Send as in stead of Send on behalf</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For one of my Office 365 the following problem occurs which I'm having trouble to solve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The company has multiple employees and they use a couple of shared mailboxes to send mail from. One user has problems sending e-mail from one of the shared mailboxes, he constantly sees this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>You are not authorized to send the message on behalf of the specified user</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>or&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Error is&nbsp;[0x80070005-0x0004dc-0x000524].</strong></p>
<p>The thing is, he's not trying to 'send on behalf' but he is trying to 'send as'. He also has 'send as' right on other shared mailboxes from which he can send without any problem. Other users also have 'send as' rights for the mailbox he's
 having trouble with and they can 'send as' perfectly fine. I've completely revoked his rights on the mailbox he's receiving this error. After which I've readded them again, problem still occurs. I've setup his mailbox on my own Outlook and then the same problem
 does occur as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems Outlook is forcing him to 'send on behalf' from that particular mailbox in stead of 'sending as'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

</p><p>Sorry, I've been away for a couple of days.</p>

</p><p>The problem is solved. I tried your possible solution but it did not work either. In the end I threw away the downloaded offline address book in&nbsp;%localappdata%\microsoft\outlook\offline address books. This has solved the problem.</p>

    <title>MSE using massive amounts of disk space at 4am - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mcbsys  say:</h3>
<h2>            MSE using massive amounts of disk space at 4am</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm running MSE under 64-bit Win7 SP1. There are two partitions on the main drive, C: (100GB, 25GB free) and D: (187GB, 79GB free).<br />
<br />
Starting on January 17, my disk free space monitor started tripping about 4am, telling me that as little as 5GB was free on C:.<br />
<br />
I set up PerfMon to watch free disk space and check IO Write Bytes/Sec for all processes. Sure enough, every day, disk free space is dropping drastically between 4:00am and 4:30am. During that same time window, only one process has really high disk writes:&nbsp;
 MsMpEng is writing as many as 83MB per second. After 4:30am, disk free space goes back to 25GB.<br />
<br />
I have configured MSE to do a full scan at 2am. The scan runs from about 1:49am to 5:30am.<br />
<br />
Based on advice received here some time ago, I have the following registry value set to 1:<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Antimalware\Scan\DisableScanningNetworkFiles<br />
<br />
Is this normal? What is MSE doing that it needs to write 10-15GB to disk at 4am?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />

            Hi Robear,<br />
<br />
This is on my personal laptop (which I use as a desktop replacement and which stays on 24x7). I'm pretty sure the 4625 errors were on the server at a client site. Can't remember if I had them on my server here. Once I learned in that thread about the registry
 key for disabling network scanning, I implemented it via group policy for all desktops at both sites.<br />
<br />
None of the computers was infected before the MSE install. I uninstalled the previous AV (Vipre) before installing MSE. Windows Defender is set to Manual, not Disabled.<br />
<br />
The disk usage thing just came on my radar a couple weeks ago when the disk space monitoring started reporting under 15% free. It's possible this has been happening before and on other machines, but that this disk is now full enough to trigger the alert.<br />
<br />
I was actually concerned that some nefarious process was using my computer in the middle of the night, which is why I went after it with ProcMon. I'm relieved that it's MSE, which is presumably doing this for a reason, but I'm still curious as to what is going
 on. Is there some way to find out?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

If all were well with the computer - both now &amp; when MSE was originally installed, MSE shouldn't have anything to do with decreasing disk space.</p>

            Well it only decreases for half an hour, then it's back to normal. Like some enormous 15GB cache.<br />
<br />
If I have time I'll check another machine and/or schedule a Sysinternals process monitor to see what files it is writing.<br />

            Finally took the time to track this down. The disk usage issue didn't seem to happen during an interactive Full Scan, so I
<i>scheduled</i> a scan during the day and waited several hours until disk free space dropped from 18GB to about 500MB. Then I fired up Sysinternals' ProcMon and checked the MsMpEng.exe process. It was writing tons of files to C:\Windows\Temp, reading from
 - aha! - the .zip files on my D: drive that contain archives of VirtualBox virtual machines. There are only about 4GB worth of archives, but a 1GB archive can include a 20GB .vdi file. MSE apparently expands each byte of those files, even though I had already
 excluded the vdi file type. <br />
<br />
I added an exclusion on D:\*.zip and disk usage no longer drops during a scheduled scan. In fact, I forgot to set it back to a nighttime scan and I haven't even noticed it scanning during the day.<br />

            Grr, maybe not as fixed as I thought. just excluding D:\*.zip wasn't enough after putting the scan back to run overnight. Even explicitly specifying the individual .zip files didn't do it. Trying now to exclude a folder full of ISOs as well.<br />

<h2>            How to &#34;fill in&#34; the background to an inserted picture in Powerpoint 2010.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am extremely frustrated with Powerpoint 2010. The 2003 version was easy to use. 2010 is a complete goose chase trying to relocate the icons/menu entries that were there right in front of you in the 2003 version.</p>
<p>Here is the latest: We use templates that have customized backgrounds for each of our various projects. When I insert a picture into a slide there used to be a little icon shaped like a ink pen that would fill in the background into the pictures (essentially
 making it transparent). Where can I find this now?</p>
<p>And please for the next Powerpoint version just revert it back to 2003. I have yet to meet one user that finds 2010 easy to use.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Dietmar</p>

            As Shyam suggests the background removal tool is MUCH more powerful than the transparent color tool in 2003. However the "old" tool is still there in Picture Tools &gt; Colors dropdown menu &gt; Set transparent color

<h2>            WindowsPhone8.1 phone update gives error code 800706d9</h2>
                    <p>WindowsPhone 8.1 device (build 8.10.14219.341), Nokia Lumia 520.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device was originally WindowsPhone8.0 out of the box. It was then upgraded to WP8.1 via
<strong><em>Preview for Developers</em></strong>. Note that previous Phone Updates on WP8.1 have been successful.&nbsp;Device currently has 3.09Gb free storage (4.19Gb used) after clearing out old files and removing unused applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since getting to&nbsp;build 8.10.14219.341 and then prompted there is a PhoneUpdate that it is getting error 800706d9. What happens is that PHONE UPDATE prompts there is an update. After selecting to download update, it errors at 4% with error code 800706d9.
 I have tried :-</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- using different WiFi points </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- ensuring that battery is fully charged and then doing update with external power supply</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- re-seated battery then restarted phone and tried doing phone update (again on external power)</p>
<p>but still get error 800706d9.</p>

GezHenry</a>. You may try rebooting the phone by pressing the power and volume down keys simultaneously for 10-15 seconds. Also, check if the date and time on your phone are set correctly. Go to Settings&gt; date+time. If these steps do not work, you may try using
 the Windows Phone Recovery Tool to update the software of your phone. Refer to this link:

            <p>Your IMAP settings are correct or else you wouldnât see you have 870 messages to download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try these ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click or Control-click the Inbox or mail folder where messages arenât downloading and choose Repair Folder. If that doesnât work...</li><li>Choose Outlook menu &gt; Preferences &gt; Accounts &gt; your IMAP account and delete it. This wonât delete messages from the server but will delete all messages along with the account on your Mac. Restart Outlook and add your account again. And if that doesnât work...</li><li>Use a web browser to log in to your account on Outlook.com and look for unusual messages. Possibly ones with very large attachments or spam with odd characters. Delete them and see if Outlook starts syncing. You might also try moving most of your older
 messages to another mail folder outside the Inbox. If your Inbox begins syncing then you still have a problem message. But at least youâll be syncing your Inbox.</li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            Hearthstone crashes after launch</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>I have this troubles to launch Hearthstone (Blizzard) since I became part of the windows insider program. I am also using the beta battle.net app. I am trying to run both battle.net and Hearthstone as admin (this was indicated as an answer on Blizzard Forum)
 but it seems to be even worse: my computer freezes and even an ACPI shutdown doesn't work.<br />
On a normal launch, the game freezes after the first click I do (so I can watch the cinematic up to the point the quest are shown). Last but not least, when I run the scan and repair tool, it doesn't find anything.</p>
<p>It worked once when I launched the app via the Windows Feedback Hub trying to record any errors. Now, since, I'm not able to launch Feedback Hub anymore (that's why I post my question here) ! Funny isn't it ?</p>
<p>Thanks for further help<br />
<br />
my versions are:<br />
Windows 10.0.17713 Build 17713<br />
Hearthstone 12.0.0.25770<br />
<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>So it appears that I solved my problem.</p>
<p>I fully uninstalled Hearthstone and battle.net using a 3rd party program (Ccleaner). then I reinstalled the game and the launcher on the same hard drive (which wasn't the case before) and now it's working again.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help</p>

<h2>            OneNote crashing after Windows 10 Upgrade on Onetastic</h2>
                    Since upgrading to Windows 10 Home 64bit my OneNote (Office 365) crashes frequently at startup claiming an issue with the Onetastic plugin. It isn't consistent but frequent enough to be bothersome. The last time I started OneNote Onetastic was disabled
 :( &nbsp;When I enable it, it works until I close OneNote and start OneNote again and it is no longer enabled.

            <p>It is definitely not an issue relating to any of the above. I first realised they weren't coming through on my phone, I tried on my laptop at home and on my work pc so it is definitely the email account which has an issue. I have been able to receive emails
 on an old account so it is definitely just my account itself which has a problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned, my account may have been hacked as someone told me they received a spam email from me and I have only had the issue since this happened.

            <p>Hi AndreaEQ,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We apologize for the delay in responding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand you're not receiving some of your emails. Let me assist you with your concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changing the password was a good move if you think the account was compromised. You may also check for the following configuration which was possibly changed by the hacker and is possibly the reason why you're not receiving emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check junk mail filters and ensure that itâs not set to exclusive which sends all mails from non-contacts to junk. To do this, please see below:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Custom filters could be filtering messages to some folder or deleting them. You may want to check if you've created email rules which might be filtering the emails you're getting. To do this, see below:
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to your inbox.</span> </li><li><span>Click on the gear icon at the top right.</span> </li><li><span>Choose "More mail settings".</span> </li><li><span>Click "Rules for sorting new messages".</span> </li><li><span>Check if there's any rule that might be preventing some of your expected emails from coming to your inbox.</span>
</li></ol>
<p>Please check if you have enabled mail forwarding. This prevents you from receiving emails to your inbox since they're being forwarded to another email address. Below are the steps on how to check this.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to your inbox.</span> </li><li><span>Click on the gear icon at the top right.</span> </li><li><span>Choose "More mail settings".</span> </li><li><span>Click "Email forwarding".</span> </li><li><span>Check the settings.</span></li></ol>
<p>Check if you have an account set up as Reply-To-Address. People who responds to your email will not go to your inbox but rather to the inbox of the email account specified in the Reply-To-Address.
</p>
<p>To check:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>From the Outlook Options page under âWriting emailâ, click Reply-to address.</span>
</li><li><span>Select Current e-mail address radio button. Click Save.</span> </li></ol>
<p>Should you have further concerns, let us know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Why can&#39;t I delete emails in hotmail from browser or phone&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jordanj777  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I delete emails in hotmail from browser or phone&#63;</h2>
                    My inbox is full, I am supposed to receive important medical information, financial information, bills, etc. Now I can;t receive any emails because whenever I attempt to clear deleted emails nothing happens and it says "deleting emails..." and never carries
 it out. I can't sync using the Mail application since my mailbox is full. This is ridiculous. Now my mailbox is useless and I tried clearing cache and using Chrome, IE, Firefox, and Safari yet it doesn't work in any browser or in incognito mode. I suggest
 Microsoft fix this HUGE bug.

            Dear Jordan,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />Please follow tips in this support article about exceeding storage limit <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/storage-limits-in-outlook-com-7ac99134-69e5-4619-ac0b-2d313bba5e9e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/storag...</a>
<br />
<br />After you will move all unnecessary emails to deleted items, go to deleted items and select any email, press CTRL+A (this will select all emails) and delete them. After you will delete those emails from deleted items, storage should be released. It is better to do in Private browsing.
<br />
<br />Afterwards please log here <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/general/storage/mailboxStorage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/general/s...</a> and make sure that you have used space less than 15GB.
<br />
<br />Please share the results!

            Hi Jordan,
<br />
<br />Hold the CTRL Key on your keyboard down and Press A this will highlight all the emails that are for example in your Junk folder. Then while holding the Shift Key down and press the Delete key on your keyboard. There will be a pop up say yes to permanently delete emails. Do not leave the folder you have just deleted emails from until the emails have been deleted. Give it a couple of minutes. Then do the same to the other folders. If you do not use shift then all emails deleted will go into your recover deleted Items folder. 
<br />I also like to filter my inbox by size to make sure there are not emails with large attachments that I can save for later viewing. Click filter All Checked then More Sort by size. Save attachments if you want to keep them before deleting emails. Again hold the Shift Key then press the Delete key. 
<br />Once completed the Deleted Items folder look in that folder you'll find Recover Items Deleted from this folder check and delete those if not needed. You can shift a or Ctrl and click on individual emails as long as your holding the Ctrl key when clicking the will highlight. I would then do the Shift Delete to remove these emails. 
<br />Clear your browser cookies CTRL SHIFT AND DELETE will bring up the box to delete cache and cookies. A restart of your computer never hurt. If still having a problem try deleting in a Private window. 
<br />Chrome and Opera Browser -Open a browser window hold the CTRL &amp; SHIFT Keys and press the N key to open a private (Incognito) Window 
<br />Edge Internet Explorer and Firefox-Open a browser window hold the CTRL &amp; SHIFT Keys and press the N key to open a private window 
<br />
<br />Do the delete from there after clearing your Cache. 
<br />Please let me know how it goes the biggest problem is when you change folders before the deletion has completed. Give it time!
<br />
<br />Regards, 
<br />Sam

</p><p>So I&nbsp;followed all your instructions.&nbsp; Thank you for clearly typing everything out by the way.&nbsp; Sadly my deleted folder and restore folders are still not releasing the emails. I am using Chrome from a PC.&nbsp; Any other thoughts as to why this might not work?&nbsp;
</p>

            Thanks for the helpful tips. I was actually able to fix this by upgrading my mailbox size (subscribed to Office 365) and then deleting the emails once it updated (which took a little while).

            Seriously a rubbish interface from Microsoft. Heck even 18 years back it was better. It just wouldn't delete any of mails. I tried Empty folder, Ctrl+A+Delete everything. It is still there. I am going to completely stop using Microsoft hotmail. I keep
 this account for nostalgic reason. This is my first ever email account created 20 years back.&nbsp; I hardly use it. But some communication still goes there.&nbsp;

            Unfortunately this is a scam by Microsoft to get you to do exactly that...signup up for their pay service. They've effectively stopped supporting this other than a call center overseas. And the ramification is people get upset and pay them to clear this
 issue up. Its elaborate ransomware. Very nice job Microsoft

    <title>Office365 &#40;2019&#41; explanation of &#34;Use this account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris tomypc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office365 &#40;2019&#41; explanation of &#34;Use this account everywhere on your device&#34;</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">
</p><p>So, I have just wiped the hard drive, installed the OS and have just reloaded the latest Office365 - full subscription, fully paid up, all good.
<br />
<br />
I'm setting up Outlook, I have several email addresses - hotmail, msn, outlook, ymail and gmail.<br />
<br />
My first email address (ie default) is a Microsoft address and after I put the password in I get a new window (not seen it before) which says "Use this account everywhere on your device". I don't know what this means - so I cancel out of it.<br />
<br />
Of course, this now means the account is not set up. I can't use Outlook without going through this and accepting. It would seem the minimum is "Microsoft apps". An incredible usability fail.<br />
<br />
So, what does "Use this account everywhere on your device" mean? <br />
<br />
What 'Microsoft apps' is it referring to?<br />
</p>
<p>What does it do? <br />
<br />
But then all the other Microsoft accounts get the same treatment - how the hell can it be using all these accounts everywhere on my device?<br />
<br />
So, I don't want to use these accounts everywhere on my device. I want to use them to send and receive emails via Outlook - I don't care about everywhere else.<br />
<br />
Can anyone explain what advantages I get for accepting (other than being able to use the software that I pay for).<br />
<br />
And how do I stop it and get a piece of software that does my email and doesn't need me to sign in everywhere on my device.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            The prompt message "Use this account everywhere on your device" means that the Microsoft account that you have used to install and activate the Office product can be used in any device where you can access Office via
 associated with the Office 365 subscription. This is ensures that you will still use the same account. The option Next is by design if you are trying to activate or install Office.

<p>Intersting, and thank you. <br />
<br />
I prefer to log on manually on any service attached to an email, and don't use the web services (or I log onto them manually). So is there anyway around this - and do you have a take on why it says the same thing for *all* my microsoft email addresses that
 I choose to use via Outlook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            No as you can see from the thread, there is no answer, I still have to have my outlook email addresses embedded in Windows 10 - in the old days the DOJ would probably be after you for that.<br />
<br />
My question stands: how do I have a stand alone outlook programme that isn't connected to the workings of Windows 10?
<br />
<br />
Yes I'm aware that Office 365 needs to check that my account is still paid for, but I don't understand why the OS has to have access to the emails that Office Outlook handles<br />

<h2>            Outlook reminders turned off LOST ALL REMINDERS. How do I get them back</h2>
                    <p>I recently wanted to turn off my 'reminders window' in outlook NOT THE REMINDERS ON ALL THE CALENDAR ITEMS, JUST THE WINDOW.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently doing that turned off all the reminders on ALL of my outlook items in my calendar.&nbsp; I've literally 1000's of items.
 I use my calendar for everything I do. </p>
<p>Now that I've turned the reminders back on in 'advanced' options under outlook all may reminders are still gone. IS THERE ANY WAY to get them back?? Any help at all?</p>

</p><p>There is no default setting/option within Outlook to turn on the reminder back at once for all the appointments.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open any of the appointment saved in the Outlook and check if you see the reminder option over there.</p>

            Oh, My... there most certainly is. 'file' 'options' 'advanced' 'reminders' 'show reminders'.&nbsp; This turned them all off.&nbsp; Turning it back on only turned on all new reminders it didn't remember all old or exsisting from the last it was on.

            Sorry Mark. I understand your frustration.&nbsp; Believe me. I lost several YEARS of calendar items.&nbsp; As you can see above this request is over a year old and no replies, of use.&nbsp; Once they're removed all you can do is turn them back on and remember NOT to
 do that again.

<h2>            Outlook 2010 - How do I get rid of annoying &#40;dying cat&#41; sound when I clear &#34;deleted items&#34; and junk  mail boxes&#63;</h2>
                    Have searched "help" numerous times, as well as the options for Outlook 2010 - the only items which I can find which deal with sounds are alerts for incoming messages and for appointments, etc. &nbsp;Nothing dealing with the sound when I clear the deleted items
 box, for example.
<div>Would most appreciate any help - I'm sure the answer is simple - finding it isn't.</div>

            It should be a Windows setting.&nbsp; Try clicking Start&gt;Control Panel&gt;Hardware and Sound&gt;Change System Sounds.&nbsp; Select "Exclamation" and reset the Sounds drop-down to "(None)".&nbsp; I think that should eliminate the sound you hear when you permanently delete an
 item in Outlook.

</p><p>May I know these info?:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What build is installed and how was it installed (clean install through ISO, upgraded from an earlier build, etc.)?</p>
<p>2. Can you still click on the taskbar icons or right-click the Start button to get the context menus (Programs and Features, Control Panel, etc.)</p>
<p>3. Are other user accounts affected by this, if you have any? You can try creating a new user account and check if the issue happens on that account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get back to me and I'll see what I can do.</p>
