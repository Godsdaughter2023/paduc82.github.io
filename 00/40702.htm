            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thermal error indicates that the problem is related to one of your hardware components not functioning properly that is triggering the computer to shut down.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span>Check if your CPU is overheating. Also c</span><span>heck if the heat sink or fan is functioning properly. If the laptop is under warranty, get in touch with the manufacturer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it isn’t, <span>get a good cleaning done for the fan and heat sink with compressed air only if you’re comfortable.</span>
<span>Otherwise seek the help of a technician. </span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also try updating the chipset drivers from the computer manufacturer's website or from Windows Update and then try updating to Windows 8.1 and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For further reference, you may refer to the following Microsoft Help article.</p>

<h2>            How do I get Music&#47;Photos&#47;Video apps to read from the NAS in my library</h2>
                    <p>I have a NAS with all my media - music, photos and videos.&nbsp; On my Surface RT, the Music, Photos and Video apps state that you need to add your respective media folders to the corresponding libraries so that you can access them through the apps.&nbsp; I followed
 the instructions in the help file on how to add an un-indexed location to the library (by creating a link to a folder on your C: drive) and successfully added to the library.&nbsp; From explorer in the desktop I can see the "new" folder which is the link to my
 NAS and see all the media.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, within the apps, they do NOT see the folders and still report that there is no content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there something I missed?&nbsp; How can I make these apps see my NAS?</p>

At your request, I've re-posted the question to: http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w8itprogeneral/thread/bc6b7cde-2360-4ee4-838d-da3350972ee6<br />
<br />
However, this is not an obscure technical question - this is a question about how to get the basic and documented (from the help file) functionality working - ie: I'd like to see my NAS-hosted media files in the Windows RT apps of photos, videos, music.<br />

            <p>I would also like an answer to this.&nbsp; I keep all of my media on a NAS device instead of leaving a desktop computer on all the time.&nbsp; It would be great if the native windows rt apps could access these instead of going thorough the desktop and explorer.&nbsp; If
 Microsoft could do this it would put the Surface ahead of android and apple tablets.</p>

            Ditto, how has this been overlooked?&nbsp; MS needs to get NAS support built into their library functionality.&nbsp; I have tried the symlink for Videos, Photos and Music with out much progress, how soon can we expect NAS support?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Try this - Open an Elevated Command Prompt :<br />
<br />
Start - type in the Search box -&gt; CMD.exe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top - Right Click on - RUN AS<br />
ADMIN - type in or COPY and PASTE - press ENTER after each line.<br />
<br />
net localgroup Administrators /add networkservice<br />
(Press ENTER)<br />
<br />
net localgroup Administrators /add localservice<br />
(Press ENTER)<br />
<br />
Close Window and Restart the computer.<br />
<br />
==============================<br />
<br />
More troubleshooting :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High
<br />
Definition Audio&nbsp;(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version.
<br />
Now Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers.
<br />
Then RIGHT CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on
<br />
and RUN AS ADMIN (This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the reboot to see
<br />
if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot until it is. It can take several
<br />
tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.<br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

            <p>It sounds like the update is stuck again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you could do is after rebooting like before, try to download the offline installer for the update, just take note of the number (KB . . . .), you can then download the offline installer from the Microsoft Catalog Page or from a third party website with
 any browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of people have had more success downloading the offline installers for Windows Updates that get stuck. Once the update has installed, Windows Update works normally.</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi Stanley L,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may take the ownership of the &nbsp;<strong>AppData folder</strong> and then use the steps to grant permission to everyone and then check.
 You can login as an administrator and make the required changes.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Before taking ownership I would suggest you to create a new restore point so that the system may be reverted back in case of
 any loss of data or irregular behavior. </span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Follow the steps in the below link to create a restore point -</span></span></strong><span><span>
 The System Restore tool uses restore points to return system files and settings to an earlier point in time. You can use it to restore the operating system to a point in time in which you did not experience the problem. To restore back you need to have a restore
 point available so I would suggest you to create a new restore point before taking ownership of the folder. Refer to the below link to create a restore point manually –<br />
<span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306084</a></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>You may take the ownership of the AppData folder and then use the steps to grant permission to everyone<span>–</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a. Locate the file or folder on which you want to take ownership in windows explorer like C: drive in your case.<br />
b. </span></span><span><span>Right click on file or folder and select &nbsp;<strong>“Properties”</strong> from Context Menu.<br />
c. </span></span><span><span>Click on &nbsp;<strong>Security tab.<br />
</strong>d.</span></span><span><span>Click on&nbsp;<strong>“Advance”.<br />
</strong>e. </span></span><span><span>Now click on&nbsp;<strong>Owner tab in Advance Security Settings</strong> for User windows.<br />
</span></span><span><span>f. Click on&nbsp;<strong>Edit Button and select user</strong> from given Change Owner to list if user or group is not in given list then, click on other users or groups. Enter name of user/group
 and click ok. You can even click on administrator here, if you are logged in as an administrator.<br />
g. </span></span><span><span>Now select User/group and click apply and ok. (Check “Replace owner on sub containers and objects” if you have files and folder within selected folder).<br />
h. </span></span><span><span>Click ok when Windows Security Prompt is displayed.<br />
i. </span></span><span><span>Now Owner name must have changed.<br />
j. </span></span><span><span>Now click&nbsp;<strong>Ok to exist from Properties</strong> windows.<br />
k. </span></span><span><span>Once you have &nbsp;<strong>taken the ownership of file or folder.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Grant Permissions to everyone (or your user account) -</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Go to C: and then click&nbsp;<strong>right click</strong> on folder and choose&nbsp;
<strong>properties.<br />
</strong>b.<strong> </strong></span></span><span><span>Then go to&nbsp;<strong>security</strong> tab and click &nbsp;<strong>Edit</strong> then click&nbsp;<strong>Add</strong> =&gt;
<strong>Advanced.<br />
</strong>c.<strong> </strong></span></span><span><span>If you click on advanced now click on&nbsp;<strong>Find Now</strong> and choose &nbsp;<strong>everyone</strong> and click &nbsp;<strong>Ok.<br />
</strong>d. </span></span><span><span>Then again click&nbsp;<strong>Ok
</strong><span>a</span>nd now click on&nbsp; <strong>Allow</strong> =&gt;
<strong>Full control</strong> =&gt; <strong>Ok</strong></span><strong><span>.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>DISCLAIMER:</span></strong><span> Affecting system settings incorrectly can cause serious
 problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly or may result in loss of data. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuration of ownership settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue persists I would suggest you to check if you can restore the files in a new user account.<span>&nbsp;</span>You may create a new
 user account on your computer and then check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Create a new user account-<br />

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I apologize for the late reply but I was unavailable for some time. Just to clarify some things</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Are you using Windows backup program to perform the backup and restore?<br />
2. Does the AppData folder in the backup contain anything?<br />
<br />
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Yes the folder should have got restored but yet we cannot be sure of what is the cause of the issue.</span></strong></p>

<p>Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>To answer your questions: 1) Windows 7 Backup and Restore was used&nbsp;to perform the backup and restore and 2) The AppData folder does contain the normal C:\User folders and files.&nbsp; As I mentioned before,&nbsp;even though Resotre skipped files in this specific folder
 during the restore process, I did a test and was able to manuallu copy files into the AppData Folders.&nbsp; I assume&nbsp;others have&nbsp;reported Restore issues as I have seen your proposed "take ownership of the AppData Folder"&nbsp;instuctions to others.&nbsp; Is there absolutely
 no other way to solve this problem?</p>
<p>Thanks Again in advance for you anwer.</p>

            <p>This is so discouraging. I faced the same problem a week ago. Hundreds of files were skipped during restore. I can see that even after a year no one bothered to correct this issue or to provide answer to why it happens. As you've mentioned, this issue defies
 purpose of Windows backup tool. More and more I'm losing faith in Windows OS.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>I had to reinstall Win7 from scratch and when I to restore my C:\User\Me files, restore skipped all my AppData files.&nbsp; It did some troubleshooting as follows&nbsp; I selected&nbsp;a single file in the Restore Database (from my Windows Live Mail storage folder) and
 it would not restore the single file to the same destination.&nbsp;&nbsp;The restore log saide&nbsp;"Restore skipped" path/filename etc&nbsp; I was able to restore the same single file to another location and then successfully copy it to the appropriate destination under C:/User\Me.&nbsp;
 I tried other single file restores throughtout C:\Users\Me and found I could not restore any file under any&nbsp; C:\Uses\Me\AppData folder or subfolder.&nbsp; I can restore all other data files (i.e. files in D:\ )&nbsp; This makes Restore totally useless to me for AppData
 files.&nbsp; What is preventing me from restoring any files to any folder under C:\Uses\Me\AppData</p>
</blockquote>
So this morning I was running into this exact problem after rebuilding my wife's PC. &nbsp;Trying to restore her Thunderbird AppData folder. &nbsp;After not having success restoring to the original location, I restored the folder to her desktop. &nbsp;At first I did not see
 anything, started searching about the issue of Windows Backup and AppData folder, found your post and a few others then it dawned on me. &nbsp;The AppData folder I restored to her desktop is "hidden". &nbsp;It restored that property of the folder. &nbsp;I navigated to the
 folder of her username, added "\appdata" to the folder path and voila, there is all the contents.
<div>That's the quick explanation. &nbsp;Hope this helps. &nbsp;I was about to throw in the towel on Windows Backup again...<br />
Let me know if you need more clarification.</div>

            <p>Meghmala's answer WOULD be helpful for me, but it's meant for Windows 7. Is there a Windows 10 version of this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Steps a-d work, but in steps e-k, it no longer applies to Win10. Nor can I figure it out. In fact, everything I see says that I have "Full control." Yet I cannot restore items to the AppData folder.)<br />

            <p>It's ridiculous that something this simple doesn't work cleanly and that Microsoft still hasn't fixed it yet.&nbsp; You shouldn't need to mess around with permissions or ownership or anything like that.&nbsp; It's a simple restore of the contents of a folder you owned
 previously into a folder that you also own in the same location with the same name.&nbsp;
</p>
<br />
<p>Anyway, don't waste your time messing with the permissions because that's a dead end.&nbsp; Just create a folder called temp on your desktop, restore the folders you want into that and then cut and paste them into the correct location in the AppData folder.&nbsp;
 As mentioned previously, make sure you've selected 'Hidden Items' under the view menu or you may not be able to find the items your looking for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it's a bit of a pain but in the end it will be quicker than jumping through hoops.</p>

            <p>Would you be so kind to go to your old Windows 10, and in Command prompt type<br />
Winver and show it here (screenshot is good variant).<br />
After that, check what version of Windows 10 you downloaded and prepared for installation.<br />
It is very important cause it can save your time and prevent many issues.<br />
See example </p>

<p>
</p><p>I would recommend you perform a custom install using the following instructions. This will let you perform a new install, while being able to recover your data after setup.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Immediately update the iaStorA.sys after setup is complete. You could have the driver downloaded and ready in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>also see:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-files/recover-personal-files-from-the-windowsold-folder/755e0ea3-b16f-4d5d-89b5-abecfbf68300" title="If you performed a custom install of Windows 10 intentionally or not and you are looking for your personal files after Windows is installed, then you might need to recover them manually. A custom install is similar to a clean install, but instead of wiping the hard disk clean, your previous Windows installation is moved to a folder called Windows.old. Windows.old is an archive of your old Windows installation. It is created by setup for a number of reasons depending on how the upgrade was initiated, including recovery of personal data or to facilitate the rollback to that previous version of Windows if you performed an in place upgrade. A custom install is sometimes initiated by booting from the Windows 10 install media (DVD or USB thumbdrive) or if you start the installation from within a previous running version of Windows at the desktop 
 personal files from the Windows.old Folder such as Documents Pictures and Windows Live Mail Emails in Windows 10</span></a>

<p>Unfortunately, I can't access Windows 10 as the laptop crashes due to the iaStorA.sys. Unless I boot into Safe Mode. Problem is, I can't find the Command Prompt in Safe Mode.</p>

            <p>Now you decided to make clean installation, Ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You simple assign old windows partition ( it is large one 100 GB and more) and ignore</p>
<p>warning that is not allowed partition for installation (from system).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When comes list of Upgrade or Custom installation, choose Custom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the end install Intel&nbsp;Storage Manager, version you know is good for your chipset, to

<h2>            Chess Titans - Saved Game Repeats</h2>
                    I recently purchased a new Dell Studio XPS 16 laptop and it came with Windows Vista.&nbsp; While exploring the new laptop I noticed Chess Titans and have played it several times.&nbsp; But I happened to save one game and now whenever&nbsp;I open CT I get the question
 whether I want to&nbsp;continue playing&nbsp;that one saved game.&nbsp; I've played it several different times to the end, hoping to erase that one game from memory, but I still get the question about playing it again the next time I open CT.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a&nbsp;simple way to erase
 the one game from memory?&nbsp; I've gone to Help for the game and a CT forum, but have not found an answer to that question.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.

<p><span>I think I found the answer.&nbsp; I went to the MS Windows Vista&nbsp;Home page and searched on Chess Titans.&nbsp; This took
 me to a Chess Titans forum post (Windows Vista&gt;Forums Home&gt;Windows Vista Forums&gt;Gaming&gt;Chess Titans Saved Games) with the same question.&nbsp; The answer for Chess Titans is below.&nbsp; I haven't tried the fix yet, but based on the info below it looks like it should
 work.&nbsp; Note the link to winhelponline.com.&nbsp; Based on that link I believe the Chess Titans solution below will also work for Mahjong Titans.&nbsp; Good luck.<br />

    <title>Windows backup stuck at 97&#37; &#39;creating a system image&#39; for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jh17-23  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows backup stuck at 97&#37; &#39;creating a system image&#39; for 6 hours.</h2>
                    <p>Every month or so I'll run a Windows backup of my Steam directory located in Prog. Files and my personal user account data alongside a full system image backup. I have a 2TB internal HDD of which I've have 1.2TB remaining and I'm backing up via USB 3.0 to
 a Seagate Backup Plus 2TB external HDD. On previous occasions this backup tended to take 4-5 hours to fully complete, spending about 2 of them at 97% 'Creating a system image of Windows (C:)' but always completing very soon after. I initiated a backup at 1pm
 today, it is now 9:30pm and the progress bar has been at 97% 'creating the system image' for the last 6 hours, during this period I've had very little interactivity with the computer and left it to run but when I took note of my external HDD's storage remaining
 statistic on its properties page, it's only dropped by 4GB in the last hour which would imply that it's only done 24GB of my 600GB system image backup in the last 6 hours? Since my last backup I've only added at most an additional 75GB to my system so I'm
 perplexed as to why the backup time has shot up from a 4 hour norm to 8 hours and counting. The fact that my external HDD is dropping in file size suggests that it isn't completely not-responding but at 4GB an hour via USB 3.0 something's going on. Should
 I cancel it? What would a cancellation affect and why has my transfer rate dropped so low?</p>

            <p>Hi, thanks for your reply, </p>
<p>I waited until 1am (10 hours after the system image creation process started) before deciding to cancel the backup process, despite being informed this would mean that my files were not backed up, my remaining external drive space stayed where it was before,
 suggesting it did not erase the backup and I now have fragments of a system image stored on it?
</p>
<p>I have the option to only keep the latest system image enabled but does that mean that it's overwritten my previous from the get-go or has it overwritten as it goes, meaning I now possibly have two half fragments of a system image on my backup drive?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then decided to cut loose the system image creation option from my scheduled backup settings and re-performed a backup of just my Steam directory and personal user files quickly (unusually so) with no issue (by the looks of things), however for the last
 hour I've been unable to remove the backup drive from my PC, when safely remove is clicked I get the error message "Windows is unable to stop the device 'USB attached SCSI (UAS) Mass Storage Device'. Don't remove this device while it is still in use. Close
 any programs using this device and then remove it." I have no fully open programs, I am idle on my desktop and this error message still occurs. With this I've been noticing a temperamental loss of signal through my other USB 3.0 port and a general slow down
 in my computer. So now I have a backup drive that's playing up with incomplete fragments of a system image and an internal HDD that is also not being its best. Alongside this Windows has scheduled updates to occur in a few hours and the option to reschedule
 them under 'select a restart time' is greyed out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>could you please advice on why I'm unable to remove my backup drive safely, why I'm unable to re-schedule updates and why my system image did not complete in a 10 hour period?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to ask so many questions but I'm afraid that in trying to back up my PC, I've, by the looks of things, managed to damage it</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Although I doubt it was in relation to this, my PC started blue-screening the day after (however this was also after the Windows 10 Anniversary update and the instillation of new AMD drivers. Its been sent off for repair, &nbsp;presumably without a complete

<p>Hi Nyima,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're right, I was swapping between backup devices (Intenso - Seagate - Intenso). It worked earlier (with some problems "can't find file" etc.) but in the end it successfully finished the backup.
</p>
<p>Now troubleshooting + rebooting kept being stuck at 97%. </p>
<p>So I tried <em>system image only</em> as someone said it worked for him and it finished successfully.
</p>
<p>Then I tried again the <em>all inclusive</em> back up and it finished successfully too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ordered another backup device, same model, Intenso 2.5 inch, 1 TB. </p>
<p>Will I be able to swap between those?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Helen</p>

<h2>            Windows XP - &#34;Secuirty Center&#34; service does not exist.</h2>
                    I have a Dell Desktop PC running Windows XP Home Edition, SP3.&nbsp; I noticed when opening Security Center, the message under Security Essentials displays, "The Security Center is currently unavailable because the "Security Center" service has not started
 or was stopped.&nbsp; Please close this window, restart the computer (or start the "Security Center" service), and then open the Security Center again."&nbsp; When I go into "Services" I notice the "Security Center" service does not exist.&nbsp; I scanned my computer with
 Malwarebytes and also with Avast Antivirus, but no malware was found.&nbsp; Is there an easy way to get back the "Security Center" service so I will again be able to view the system's security status?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            <p>There's a registry "fix" available at Kelly's Korner but before using you should
<strong>backup the registry. </strong>To do this I suggest <strong>ERUNTgui. </strong>
It will <em>autobackup</em> when starting Windows for 30 days by default but if you are low&nbsp;on free disc space it can be set for fewer days (7 days should be fine)</p>
<p>Download ERUNTgui from <a href="http://www.webng.com/krtech/programs/ERUNTgui.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.webng.com/krtech/programs/ERUNTgui.zip</a>&nbsp;(note:this is a direct download link) and save to location of your choice (somewhere in My Documents is fine) unzip and in the folder created double click on the ERUNTgui.Setup file to install. Launch from
 the shortcut created in All Programs select Options to specify the number of days for autobackup, close the options dialog box and then select
<em>Backup the Registry.</em> That backup will be placed in C:\WINDOwS\ERDNT by default.</p>
<p>Go to Kelly's Korner and scroll down to #338 on the right side (Restore Security Center Service) Right click&nbsp;and "Save target as..." to Desktop. An icon should appear as below named
<em>securitycenterstore.reg. </em>Double click to merge with registry then reboot your computer.</p>

<p>You were quite right to check for malware. Since the scans indicate you're clean I have to wonder if you perhaps use any type of
<em>registrycleaner/optimizer </em>program? If so and the above doesn't work check any such program for recent backups that may have been created before the issue with Security Center came about.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Flash Drive Capacity Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rosebudlr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Flash Drive Capacity Problem</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased from Costco a <strong>SanDisk Ultra 3.0 128 GB </strong>flash drive to create&nbsp;a Windows 10 recovery backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After performing the backup, I checked the properties on the flash drive and it said that the total capacity on this drive was only 32 GB.</p>
<p>I re-formatted the flash drive and also did a dos chkdsk and the capacity still shows&nbsp;32 GB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another question ... should the flash drive be formatted as NTFS or the Fat32 default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I take it back to Costco, am I missing something.</p>

<p>I've read an issue regarding Windows 10 not showing the right capacity of an external drive and it says that it's fine....</p>
<p>
</p><p>For NTFS or FAT, the system will automatically format your drive before it starts the backup process.<br />
<br />
Plug-in your device and search for diskpart and see if the right capacity is showing :D</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to delete the 32GB partition in Disk Management before reformatting the drive... The 32GB is the standard default size that windows uses for that purpose...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SanDisk and most other flash drives are formatted as FAT32 when new...</p>
<p>NTFS may be required for some specific uses of the drive..</p>

            Thanks for the info.&nbsp; I took the&nbsp;other flash drive back. I&nbsp;checked the capacity on the new one before I backed up my files.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 128GB flash drive gave me a capacity of 115GB.&nbsp; &nbsp; Kind of threw me when I checked the capacity after the back up was completed
 and the total capacity&nbsp;read 32GB.&nbsp; Now I know the reason why.

<h2>            How to run windows in &#34;audit&#34; mode&#63;</h2>
                    Hello.<br />
<br />
I do PC repair work on the side. From desktops to laptops, hardware and software. On the software side, I would like to be able to boot Windows (XP, Vista, 7) in "audit" mode so I can do updates and install default software I supply with out making any users
 accounts. I know the command to do this from a new fresh install (manual install using a Windows disc and an answer file via "unattended install") but I don't know how after using a system restore disc or restore partition (HP, ASUS, ACER, etc... auto restore
 back to factory). Is there a way to do this so I can install any updates and software so that when I'm done, it will ask the user/owner to accept the MS terms and license then make a user account? It would be a big help for me. Thanks.<br />

            Ok, but this doesn't tell me how to boot in audit mode after a system restore from the factory disc or recovery partition. After the restore from ether disc or recovery partition, the OS is displaying the terms and conditions and after that it is wanting
 to create a user etc... unless "<span style="font-weight: bold">SHIFT</span><span>+</span><span style="font-weight: bold">CTRL</span><span>+</span><span style="font-weight: bold">F3</span>"<span style="font-weight: bold">
</span>will work at the terms and conditions screen. I haven't tried this yet. If I still have VMware still installed on my laptop, I will install Win7 in
 it and try this since its technically doing the same thing.<br />

                    <p>My PC made Windows 10 update of April a few days ago. Now I can not repair VC ++ 2010 packages. When I'm trying to repair them, they're waiting for another install to complete. I've tried to repair them after restarting the computer, but it didnt work again.
 Reinstall did not work too - there was a problem installing, because they were "waiting for another install to complete" again. Now they are installed , but I think that only "formally", because software, that need them, does not work.</p>

            Hi PetrKosík,<br />
<br />
<br />
Since the issue happened after an update, I suggest that you uninstall and reinstall the update. You can refer to the steps under "<strong>How do I remove an installed update?</strong>" section of this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12373/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes and we'll assist you further if needed.

            So... I tried it. And it´s the same problem. When I´m trying to repair VC ++ 2010 package as soon as possible after restart of computer, it sometimes works . When it works and doesn´t say "waiting for another install to complete", it gives me error with
 error code (0x80070666) - "another version of this product is installed now."

<p>So...<br />
</p>
<div><strong>1)</strong> Why is Visual C++ 2010 so sensitive to "another installation"? The same problem is always here. After restart too. I don´t understand it, because another C++ are working good.<br />
<strong>2)</strong> Do I need both of links on Picture "VC ++ 2010"? Because I can´t install anything from the first link.</div>

    <title>File explorer not working properly windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jagrata parui  say:</h3>
<h2>            File explorer not working properly windows 10</h2>
                    <p>i am using windows 10 in my desktop. for last 2 days suddenly file explorer not working properly. after turning on my pc&nbsp;when i open "this pc" , first everything ( drives' names, networks etc) shows up like normal, but after few seconds the address bar on
 the top of "this pc" window starts to fill up with green color which indicates something loading, but that green bar never gets completely filled up ( it's completely looks like as my pc was trying to load a dvd, pen drive etc though there's no pen drive was
 connected in any usb port or there's no dvd was in my pc), and if i close "this pc" window then when i reopen again "this pc" , nothing ( drives' names, networks etc) shows up and&nbsp;that green bar starts to fill up and stays like that forever and a message "working
 on it" stays under the green bar. also all icons of all the files in my computer changes to small white blank page like there's no program is associated to those files though if i double click those files then they does get opened by their corresponding associated
 programs. also if i open control panel, the window of control panel stays completely blank without any control panel items. and also if i open file explorer from taskbar file explorer icon, the file explorer window&nbsp;also stay completely blank and quick access
 address bar continues to fill up with green color forever.&nbsp;but in this time, i could explore my folders in varius drives and files within them by just right clicking on file explorer icon on taskbar and clicking folders' names under "frequent" and also under
 "pinned". BUT THIS ISSUE DONT HAPPENS IN SAFE MODE. During this problem i can do other computer works ( like watching movies, gaming, using internet browsers, etc ) completely normal. so i can access my hard disk without any issue. So there's no issue in my
 hard disk. now to solve this issue i tried to use system restore but the restore operation failed and also deleted my last restore point ( no more restore points remaining now) and also showed an error message that&nbsp;the failure was caused by a file under my
 windows app directory. also another strange thing that&nbsp; WHEN I TURN MY PC ON IN SAFE MODE AT FIRST AN ERROR MESSAGE SHOWS UP IN WINDOWS APP ENVIRONMENT THAT "THIS APP CAN'T RUN IN SAFE MODE". And also those issues dont occur in safe mode, so i think there's
 any corrupted windows app or any bug in windows app causing this issue. Also i tried sfc/ scannow from both regular mode and safe mode of my pc and both time it shows there's some corrupted system file which cannot be repaired. although when my file explorer
 had no such issues, sfc/ scannow&nbsp;used to show that same&nbsp;"corrupted system file cannot be repaired" error message .also i uninstalled my antivirus avast but still same issue happening.&nbsp; ALSO WHEN I AM INSIDE ANY FOLDER&nbsp;AND SELECTED ANY FILE BY 1 LEFT CLICK
 AND THE RECYCLE AND PERMENENTLY DELETE OPTIONS UNDER "HOME" TAB ARE ALL GRAY COLOR AND CAN'T BE CLICKED AND ALSO MANY OPTIONS UNDER "VIEW" TAB (EXAMPLES-&nbsp;EXTRA LARGE ICONS,SMALL ICONS, LIST ETC ICON CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS, " OPTIONS" ETC OPTIONS ALL ARE OF&nbsp;GRAY
 COLOR AND CAN'T BE CLICKED&nbsp;). I am providing some screenshots which will clearly show my issues -.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience you are facing in Windows. We will help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let's try the below methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Perform a </span><strong><span>clean boot</span></strong></span> and check if the issue persists.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span><span>to disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called Clean Boot.<br />
Follow:<span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"> </span></span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you
 run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> I also suggest you to perform a <strong>
SFC scan (System file checker) scan.</strong></span></span></p>

            <p>i already told in my post that - "&nbsp;Also i tried sfc/ scannow from both regular mode and safe mode of my pc and both time it shows there's some corrupted system file which cannot be repaired. although when my file explorer had no such issues, sfc/ scannow&nbsp;used
 to show that same&nbsp;"corrupted system file cannot be repaired" error message ".</p>
<p>ALSO I USED <span>System Configuration TO HIDE ALL MICROSOFT SERVICES AND THEN DISABLED ALL THE OTHER SERVICES AND ALSO DISABLED ALL STARTUP ITEMS AND RESTARTED MY PC AND THE PROBLEM STILL THERE. "SO IT PROVES THAT MICROSOFT SERVICES ACTUALY CAUSING THE
 PROBLEM".&nbsp; also after this when i tried normal startup by selecting normal start up and enabling all services and start up items, then whenever i restart my pc goes to&nbsp;automatically safe mode even i disable safe mood each time from boot option. only when in
 general tab of system configuration, i select "selective startup" with "load system services" and 'load start up items" checked and the "use original boot configuration" could not be checked cause it was gray, after that i restarted my pc and it starts in
 normal mode without going safe mood automatically. also when my pc turns on in safe mode the problem doesn't happen and&nbsp;immediately after starting my pc in safe mode a error message is shown&nbsp;- "GET STARTED APP CANT RUN IN SAFE MOOD". so i think THIS PROBLEM
 IS ANYHOW RELATED TO THAT GET STARTED APP. Also this problem causing me so much wasting time, so i think i am not wrong if i hope for&nbsp;little sooner reply from&nbsp;any microsoft engineer (though it seems they dont care much cause i have to&nbsp;sometimes&nbsp;wait for reply
 like 2 or more weeks). </span>please someone&nbsp;help me to solve this issue.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
As OEM HP is responsible for the proper operation of the printer and their<br />
supplied drivers. Check with HP Support, their on-line documentation and <br />
drivers, and ask in their forums. <br />
<br />
Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver.<br />

<h2>            Like many others, my Windows powershell keeps randomly popping up.</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 10 and Avast. Both are completely up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked at the other threads and AFTER running Windows Update (it says I'm fine), a full system and boot scan by Avast to assure there is no malware, then looking at the events in&nbsp;Task Scheduler (there is none recent) , running sfc check, and rebooting,
 my Windows powershell still keeps randomly popping up..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to ctr-alt-del to close it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking logs, unless its a coincidence, it LOOKS like this started when Avast moved 2 versions each of NetAdapter.exe (one from Appdata. the other from AppData/Temp) and&nbsp;xsetup.exe (both from AppData/Temp) to Quarantine. It says both were ifected by&nbsp;Win32.Evo-gen
 [Susp]</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 days later Avast moved&nbsp;powershell.exe -- infected with "IDP.HELU.PSE13 - fileless malware" -- to Quarantine. This file came from&nbsp;Windows/System32/WindowsPowershellv1.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my powershell is in quarantine, I can assume this is a DIFFERENT one that pops up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also assume than when I ran SFC would have replaced powershell, netadapter and xsetup with new versions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I instead restore those files from Quarnatine -- or is there a different solution?</p>

<p>Hi Arthur Lortie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This issue is possibly due to system file corruption or software conflict. Since you have run SFC scan, I suggest you perform DISM for possible solution. You can refer to this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">Forum Article</a></strong> by
<strong>ZigZag3143 (MS -MVP)</strong> and follow steps under <strong>DISM</strong> section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue persists, I recommend performing <strong>clean boot</strong> for further troubleshooting. This will help eliminate software conflicts that possibly caused the issue. Simply follow steps on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabling Avast can also help us isolate the concern and identify if the issue is happening due to 3rd party program conflict.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward the results.</p>

    <title>Folder without Short File Name cannot be deleted - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> manuel_716  say:</h3>
<h2>            Folder without Short File Name cannot be deleted</h2>
                    <p>I am posting this because I believe other people might run into similar problems. I have found a workaround (below) but no real solution, so still interested if anyone understands what caused this situation and, ideally, knows a way to stop this
 from happening in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dec 19: An image extraction program created a folder on my desktop that cannot be deleted. I can move files into and out of the folder but cannot do anything to the folder itself (rename/delete/etc.) because Win 10 is unable to find it. The folder
 is not locked (no Malware or anything exotic blocking access to the directory) and dir /x in the command prompt shows that it has no Short File Name (SFN, 8.3 name). The usual methods for dealing with such a situation do not work:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Delete in safe mode: not possible, "Item not found"</p>
<p>Delete via Command Prompt: not possible, rd and del commands require an SNF, which the folder doesn't have. The usual tricks to use the LFN don't work. The folder exists and is visible in the directory listing but Win10 doesn't find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help with this?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Dec 22: Workaround - I used a Linux Live CD to mount my windows NTFS partitions and delete the offending folder without giving Win10 an opportunity to interfere. The folder is gone but obviously I just removed the symptom not the underlying cause.</p>

            <p>I don't know what exactly that program did, but I doubt the problem was due simply to the non-existence of an 8.3 name for that folder. I ran a test for you to try and replicate the issue by disabling 8.3 name creation on a drive
<em>and</em> stripping any existing 8.3 names for files/folders on that drive with
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff621566.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
fsutil</a>. You can see the results of my test below:<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/121694a9-9be8-405c-b240-202274e86b39" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/121694a9-9be8-405c-b240-202274e86b39" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, no problems whatsoever getting rid of folders with no 8.3 names. If you ever manage to recreate the anomaly though do let me know!<br />
