                    <p>I tried to enter a group call. The call-in worked, but when I tired to key in the access code number, skype did not recognize/hear it and just kept asking me to enter the code followed by the pound sign. Thank you for your
 support.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Mohit.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Reinstall the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall the printer software.    
<br />
<br /> 3) Next copy and paste in Start search box:  printui /s /t2     (Note that there is one space before each forward slash).
<br />
<br /> 4) Right click result to Run as Administrator.   
<br />
<br />5) Open the Print Server properties, Remove the printer’s drivers for this printer and for any other printers you don't use presently.  If you get a message about access denied or the printer being in use and you cannot find the driver or any installed program that would account for this, you may restart the computer in a diagnostic startup and then use the printui  command to remove the driver package(s): <a href="https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-diagnostic-startup-in-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-dia...</a>
<br />You must restart back to normal mode before you will be able to install the printer again.  
<br />
<br />6) Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click the printer to delete the Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />7) Go to the printer model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />
<br />8) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.
<br />
<br />---------------------
<br />
<br />As to the problem with Windows Update, What I'd do at this point is wait a few days for Spring Creators Update to be released, install Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the latest version (which you need anyway) and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />You can monitor the Windows 10 Blog here to get notified of the exact date for release of Spring Creators Version 1803 which is soon:   <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#utpDefLLBfmPO4gr.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#ut...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Try again or Use offline</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp; This morning, when I woke up, I wanted to play on my Xbox One. Shortly after signing in to my account and eager to play GTA V, I came across a message saying that the Rockstar servers were unavailable. Thinking this was just my typical internet problem,
 I went to play a different game and try playing GTA V later. So I attempted to play Call of Duty: Black Ops III and it gave me a hard time signing in to my online profile. I was then confronted with a message telling me that I couldn't sync my data with the
 game. So I tried playing Minecraft instead. Again, the same message displayed whenever I pressed "play." After receiving the message I pressed "play" and was brought to the list where all my worlds were. All but three had the Minecraft icon instead of a picture
 from what the world looked like when the world was previously saved. I tried to play on one of them and it loaded all the way until it said it was "finalizing." The loading bar under "finalizing" eventually filled, but nothing happened. It just stayed like
 that for 5 minutes until the game booted me out of the world, telling me that I couldn't load the world. I attempted to play Black Ops III again and the game booted me to the home menu after not loading, then I went back into the game and the same message
 displayed, saying I couldn't load my last saved data.</p>
<p>We couldn't get your latest saved data</p>
<p>AYExTHEND</p>
<p>Try again or use this game or app offline.</p>
<p>&nbsp; So, I figured a hard reset would do the trick but I was still confronted with the same continuous problem. I did a hard reset at least 5 times before getting very frustrated and quit trying to play Xbox. I returned a few hours later and the same thing
 still happened. I researched the problem and couldn't find anything helpful. Before stopping again, I unplugged my xbox following a hard reset, and came back a few hours later again. I plugged it back in and tried it again. Nothing was fixed. I figured that
 maybe deleting my profile and downloading it again would work and now my Xbox will not allow me to download my profile again, instead displaying the message:</p>
<p>Try again later</p>
<p>There was a problem, and we couldn't continue. (0x80a40019)</p>
<p>&nbsp; I did yet another hard reset and made another attempt at signing in. I was allowed to actually enter in my e-mail and password for my account and it let me sign in and download my account. So I tried Minecraft and it told me that it was syncing my data
 for Minecraft again. It actually worked. Once I tried to load up a world, it told me I had to sync it first, so I tried syncing it. Once it reached 14%, Minecraft crashed. Now the same syncing problem persists withe same message. What do I do from here?!?!</p>

<p>Sorry for the issues, but all the services are up and running so the issue is your connection.</p>
<p>Please try this [Go to settings &gt; network &gt; advanced settings &gt; alternate MAC settings &gt; clear and this will reboot your xbox] Then turn on your console again, if the issue is still there try resetting your router. And make sure your xbox is allowed to access
 a port.</p>

<p>I also have app, games and DVD movie watching. However I now can't get to my Subscription or Billing and I can only launch ESO via that games HUB, then I disconnect after about an hour. I have 2 Xbox One consoles and 2 Xbox Live accounts. Aryotus (acct.,
 #1) is all good after only Clearing and restarting from the Advanced Network settings/Alt Mac. However Aamegwyn (acct., #2) as first mentioned above has far worse problems. Can't play a dvd movie, can't watch Netflix or any other streaming movie. Can't even
 find the movies I purchased and downloaded into my Ext., HD on console #2. Both consoles 1 and 2 have the same brand external HDs. I do know the problems started with the latest patching from Microsoft. They are both in the 3rd block of console OS's for the
 offline update riggamarrow* which I haven't had to deal with for console #1 and I am dreading doing it for console #2 to see if it helps. Why can't console #2 retrieve my account info, billing info and all pertaining there-in? I'm here on my laptop and that
 information shows my Xbox Live Gold paid till June of this year, However it is listed in the "Cancellations" section here on line. Now I can't even play ESO which I was before posting this. What gives. Pay your programmers more, correct your analclivity in
 contracts with your own and outside publishers. The console is an awesome product ......personal lubricant would go along way. You and I have had a topsy turvy ( I pay you --- You provide ) relationship. we all know the history prior to and still forthcoming
 since launch. The dudes and dudettes with the money and the power need to throw out their garbage disposals, rinse your dishes prior to washing and allow the drain the flow. I'm having a bad day also :(. It's the update, we all over America can't all have
 the same local net problem. I have faith Microsoft will correct it.....can't tell you why I have faith......but I do.</p>

<p>Same problems here, except I have absolutely no content on ONE and none of my games will sync, since the latest update. I can't sign in to my 360 either, I've had to change my password, &nbsp;just to access this site. I've tried everything except resetting to
 default, which if I have to do that, me and XBOX are parting ways. Let's get it fixed Microsoft. If I can't play online, I'll just have to go back to Playstation.</p>

<p>Tried the above fix, still a no go. It's connecting to the internet, but not xbox live. I've tried to reset my IP and stuff, but still comes with no IP address. Any more suggestions? Resetting to factory settings wouldn't really bother me if I wasn't paying
 $165 a month for 25 GB plus $10 GB over the 25.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Both statements are incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most wireless mice operate on the 2.4 GHz band. Bluetooth also operates on the 2.4 GHz band. Anything that operates on the 2.4 GHz band
<em>might</em> interfere with anything else that operates on the 2.4 GHz band. Or it might not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in the case of a mouse the signal strength is very low, since the associated computer is usually just inches away. So the likelihood of interference is very low.</p>

    <title>Cannot Start Windows Firewall &#40;Windows 7&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jared pryatel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Start Windows Firewall &#40;Windows 7&#41;</h2>
                    Alright, so it's come to my attention that Windows Firewall will not start on my computer. I have no idea what could have caused the incident but I need to fix it as soon as possible. I've run 3 malware scans from different programs and the results I've
 found are irrelevant or useless. I've also ran Advanced System Care 4 (Professional) and there are no relevant errors other than maybe some of the registry problems, but those are low-risk and are fixed by the program. I have the logs saved if you request
 them.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Steps taken so far:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-I get reminded by the Action Center that my firewall needs to be turned on. When I try to fix it it says it's unable to, then a link to turn it on manually appears. That fails and I get&nbsp;<span><u>Error 08x007042c</u>&nbsp;(I have checked the other thread regarding
 this error, but either the steps aren't very clear or they're just not working)</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>-I've opened services.msc, and the<i> Base Filtering Engine </i>is and has been working fine. When I try to start the Windows Firewall manually, it says "Windows could not start the firewall service on Local Computer. Error 1068: The Dependency service
 or group failed to start."</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Now, I looked at the dependencies, and there's two specifically it depends on:</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>+Base Filtering Engine</span></div>
<div><span>+<b>Windows Firewall Authorization Diver</b></span></div>
<div><span><b><br />
</b></span></div>
<div>As stated, the Base Filtering Engine is working fine, but there's not an option in the service.msc for the Windows Firewall Authorization Drive. Would this be my problem perhaps? How do I access the options for this driver.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried changing the information in the Log On tab to Local Service and leaving the passwords blank, which it then said manual control was give to me (or something similar), but this doesn't actually do anything.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Background Intelligent Transfer Service is also working properly</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, will running SFC /SCANNOW command in the command prompt actually fix the problem? It's a long process so I want to make sure it'll work first.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried also doing a system restore to about a week ago, but after the computer restarted it said it was unsuccessful and to try again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any other suggestions or help would be very appreciated. I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium x64 and
<u>have not upgraded it from Windows Vista</u>, the machine came installed with Windows 7 already, so telling me to re-install Windows 7 is a pointless suggestion.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I'm unable to fix this problem, would getting a firewall from another company such as McAfee or Norton be a good alternative?</div>

    <title>Microsoft Edge freezing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roger_1982  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Edge freezing</h2>
                    Has anyone heard any useful response or information regarding the issue with Edge slow to respond and/or freezing?&nbsp; It's been going on ever since I upgraded and I've found no useful answer yet.&nbsp; Microsoft techs can only suggest to clear cache and close
 and restart.&nbsp; Seems like loading videos and/or loading all the ad-**** you get on the sides, bottom and top of your browser windows nowdays is a problem in particular.&nbsp; When it's loading a bunch of junk on a page, it slows or freezes, then I goto task manager
 and find that my system CPU is usually over 90% used, with a big chunk of that going to Microsoft Edge.&nbsp; After the page loads completely after a minute or so, the CPU drops down to normal at around 5% and Edge responds ok.&nbsp; But it does this with darn near
 every page now.&nbsp; Won't be using it until they fix it.&nbsp; And it's not bad websites causing it because the same thing just happened on THIS page using Edge, LOL.

            I have come to the same conclusion, and have switched to Chrome, which also seems to have a few problems playing videos on msn.com. I think it is a Microsoft problem relating to browser extensions. Flash, for example, always crashes&nbsp;when displayed in&nbsp;Edge.

 I hope to make it to 50 before BF3 comes out. Once I get the achievements done on 'Nam, I will go back to regular Battlefield, I just do a lot better with modern weapons.

    <title>Transferring a Windows 10 Pro license from old PC to new PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pseudopete  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transferring a Windows 10 Pro license from old PC to new PC &#40;running Windows 10 Home 64&#41;</h2>
                    <p>When I use the "Change product key or upgrade your edition of Windows" option in Windows 10 Home 64 on my new computer purchased directly from the manufacturer and enter in a Windows 10 Pro license which was previously activated on my old computer using
 "Change product key" and click to Activate, it informs me "Windows is activated. We've activated this copy of Windows". I click to close the window.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I check "About" in System and it still tells me my "Edition" is Windows 10 Home. How do I activate/download/install/whatever the "Pro" features of the new license on my new computer which came with Windows 10 Home preinstalled. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And does "System--&gt;About -Edition" ever get changed o reflect the change in licensing from Home to Pro?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or am I, as I suspect, trying to do the impossible, or in other words, do something that is not supported.</p>
<p>

<p>Unless your Windows 10 Pro license on your old computer was a full&nbsp; Retail License it is tied to the original computer and you will have to buy a new copy of Pro according to Microsoft. You could always contact support and see if they might let you make
 the change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following article explains what I want to do which is upgrade my Windows 10 Home system to Windows 10 Pro but instead of me having to pay $99 at the Windows Store, I am attempting to re-use a previously activated Windows 10 Pro license on a computer
 that is no longer operational.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible or is my Windows 10 Pro license tied entirely to the microprocessor of my now retired PC?</p>

<p>If windows 10 Pro came as the original operating system it is OEM and therefore is tied to the computer it came installed on. If you want Windows 10 Pro on your new computer you are going to have to buy a license through the store.</p>

<p><span><span>Hello Vv_bharadwaj,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to the Microsoft Answers Community!</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>The system partition in Windows 7 doesn’t have a drive letter by default, but you can set it to have a drive letter if you wish. This can be done
 by:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Start Orb</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Right click
<strong>Computer</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Manage</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Disk Management</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Here you should see a partition that says
<strong>System Reserved 100 MB NTFS</strong>, right click it</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Change Drive Letter and Paths…</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Add…</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Select the letter you would like to assign in the drop down list</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>OK</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>OK</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope that helps, look forward to hearing back from you.</span></span></p>

    <title>High XP counts not sticking - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            High XP counts not sticking</h2>
                    
<p>So I play a game, rank up, but then when I get back to the lobby I notice that my rank didn't stay. So far I've only noticed it when I get a high XP count, but that may just be because that's when there's the greatest opportunity to notice it. This has happened
 to me several times on my trek to 20/80. However, I have only noticed one or two instances per prestige.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now I'm working my way through 20th and as such I'm paying more attention to my number. I've been dropped back 3 times in the last 5 games and it's really frustrating. All those challenges and more annoyingly all of that double XP time has been robbed.</p>

<p>@Jagriff: *facepalm* I'm pleased to report that your stance on boosting is in the minority. Also, there was a similar if not tougher stance on this with Black Ops.
</p>
I'm also curious to know why you would upload game clips of boosters if you're seemingly ok with them.

<p>Just a heads up: I think the threshold is 70,000 XP per game. I just had a game with just under that and was able to keep my rank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@DFlannagan10: I don't care about people boosting for XP as long as they don't affect my game. I'm also certain that this is the majority opinion. I never noticed any problems in Black Ops with my XP not counting. They did have some sort of auto-detection
 measures that resulted in me getting a temporary ban at one point, but they were quick to unban me and apologize for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is plain stupid to punish people that do good in hopes that you will prevent people from boosting. I fall on the side of those that would say that "I'd rather see 100 boosters go undetected than 1 legit player punished".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I uploaded game clips of boosters because they were ruining my game. I even told the guys that if they would have gotten in a lobby by themselves (two parties of 6), then I wouldn't give a darn about what they did. The intrusion by IW's XP drop has been
 much more annoying than that one experience with boosters that I've had on MW3.</p>

<p>I think your pro cheating stance (well...it's certainly not anti cheating) is reflected in the bar of shame that lies on your Xbox LIVE profile..but without going off topic, I think it should max the XP out at a certain level before stopping you from earning
 anymore in that game. Boosting demeans the time and effort that others put into the game is is something that many think very negatively of. If the XP cap hinders a boosters progress, then to me, that's a very good thing.

<p>Haha at your reference to my account. Anyone who's been a regular here long enough will get a kick out of that :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not pro-cheating; I'm not pro-ruining-everyone's-game-in-hopes-to-flush-out-the-cheaters either. My time is better spent not worrying about what others are doing in an online video game. Again, I will say that I'm in the majority. Most people don't care
 about what others are doing as long as their game is not being ruined. Yeah, a few people do get mad that some just ease their way to the max rank, but most wouldn't even know of the cheaters if they didn't ruin their own game. Of course those few are the
 ones that get vocal about everything, so IW implements a line of code to their game to satisfy a vocal minority. Instead of the boosters ruining my game, I have silly enforcement policies doing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How about this? Since there is an enforcement team, why doesn't IW just flag people that consistently pass some threshold? Then, before any punishment is put forth, why doesn't said enforcement team ensure that said flagged player was actually cheating through
 the use of Theater Mode? Wasn't that one of main reasons for introducing Theater Mode? That seems like it's much better than a one-size-fits-all punishment imposed on the entire MW3 community. Not only would it prevent situations like mine, it would also allow
 IW to put forth much stricter punishments than a wasted 10 minutes. At the very least a system could be in place so that IW could return stolen XP to players on request (after verification of course).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, to save your words, I will answer my own points. IW doesn't want to put forth the extra time and effort only to satisfy a few of the talented gamers. Most of their fans won't even get close to the threshold and that's where the money lies. Instead of
 implementing a more efficient enforcement system, they would be much better off spending that time and money to add silly non-gameplay elements to the game to attract more unskilled gamers.</p>

<p>I have a philosophy when it comes to cheating: Don't do it. This includes (but is not limited to) boosting, glitching, hacking, modding, or lag-switching. Overall, if it affects the outcome of a match unfairly or ruins the fun of another player, then it's
 not allowed. I frown on players who share how to use cheats or glitches because it promotes cheating. Naturally, this goes against my philosophy - I want fewer cheaters in the world, not more. However, if the cheat is built into the game (&amp; is actually meant
 to be there) &amp; doesn't break the above rules, then I'm okay with it - Grand Theft Auto 4's single-player cheat codes, for example, are fine by me.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>As for boosting, I do consider it a form of cheating. Here's why:</p>
<p>- as previously mentioned, it undermines the importance of stats for everyone else who works at it legitimately.</p>
<p>- if boosting using a tactical insertion with the help of a "friendly enemy" you're inflating the game's score unfairly for others.</p>
<p>- if spawn-killing, you're boosting your k/d ratio while simultaneously preventing the other team from completing an objective &amp; keeping them from having ANY fun whatsoever.</p>
<p>- ignoring objectives in certain gametypes in order to get easy kills means that you're not playing the game the way it's meant to be played.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>If you can, take the time to look at my bio &amp; compare it to Jagriff's. It's entirely different than his. There's a reason I've been an Xbox Live member since the original Xbox - I know how to play fair &amp; make sure that everyone has fun, not just me. That's
 the reason I have an entire community that follows me &amp; plays with me regularly. They know that I will not take advantage of them like other players will. In the case of Xbox Live's policies, they are not a joke - it actually works (Jagriff's profile is proof
 of that). The saying that "nice guys finish last" does NOT apply on Xbox Live; if anything the reverse is true. Cheaters will never prosper...</p>

<p>-What they ought to do is make the stats personal, so they only appear to you. &nbsp;That way, it might provide a source of personal pride and a way to gauge your progress, but it won't have any bearing on the community, and hopefully, won't provide a reason
 for cheating.</p>
<p>-Boosting is usually done for stats or achievement awards, so again, only personal stats. &nbsp;They will still boost for achievements icons, they do it in any multi-player co-op game. &nbsp;No way to trace them before, except now in MW3 you can catch them on camera
 and report them..</p>
<p>-Spawn killing sucks, had it done to me, did it back to them. &nbsp;If there's only one spawn point for each team, that's the developer's fault. &nbsp;If I get spawn killed, when I re-spawn somewhere else, I go back to kill the spawn killer (you know where he is).
 &nbsp;Then I camp and wait for him to come back, stay to defend the spawn point, or start spawn killing them if the spawn points change for their team. &nbsp;I didn't start it, but I'll finish it.</p>
<p>-Ignoring objectives in a team game just to get a high kill count is a reason for selecting the "avoid this player" option. &nbsp;This really does significantly reduce the likelihood of you getting matched up with this player again. &nbsp;Same goes for all the other
 reasons. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Yoga tablet 2 1051F &#40;Win-10 32-bit&#41;&#58; Bluetooth not working &#40;Code 43&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I recently upgraded my Yoga tab 2 from Win 8.1 to Win 10 (32-bit). Everything works fine except BLUETOOTH. Under the device manager, there is a yellow triangle. Auto driver update shows "the driver is up to date". Downloaded Broadcom BT driver from Lenovo
 site, the installation wizard gives a message saying a better version has already been installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a very long thread on the same issue on this forum, but there does not seem to be definite solution as far as I can see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried all sorts of suggestions including uninstall and run scan hardware change etc. without luck. BIOS is updated as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone found a solution to this problem if you have the same issue or own the same model tablet with this issue after upgrading to Wind 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a work around you can suggest?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Harkanwar</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. To answer your two questions first:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Did you install the latest Windows 10 compatible Bluetooth drivers from the&nbsp;Lenovo website?</strong></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><div style="text-align: left">I downloaded from Lenovo site <a href="http://support.lenovo.com/au/en/products/Tablets/Yoga-Series/Yoga-Tablet-2-1051/downloads/DS101927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
BCM BT Driver (Version Win8_12.0.1.200)</a>&nbsp;as this is the one for Win 10 (32-bit). I am not able to update the driver through Device Manger -&gt; Update driver. When I run the installation, the device installation wizard says<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/79009026/bt%20update.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 "the wizard didn't update any of your software for your hardware devices because it was not better than the software your currently have installed."&nbsp;</a></div>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span><strong>Do you have any third party security program installed on the computer?</strong></span></li></ul>
<p>No. Clean install Win 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Hardware trouble shoot</strong></p>
<p>After running trouble shooting, it indicates (a) Bluetooth Radio is not working properly - Detected; (b) Your PC must be restarted. See the&nbsp;<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/79009026/m1-ts.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">troubleshoot&nbsp;result</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1- Install/Uninstall driver</strong></p>
<p>I carried out this process again (after many times). It uninstalls fine but once I run "Scan for hardware change", the yellow triangle in bluetooth appears again. See
<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/79009026/m2-erro%201.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><strong>Step 2 - Check for updates</strong></p>
<p>Device is up to date. There is nothing to install.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 - Update driver from Lenovo</strong></p>
<p>Downloaded the latest BT drive from Lenovo site, ran the installation wizard and had ""the wizard didn't update any of your software for your hardware devices because it was not better than the software your currently have installed."</p>

<p>
</p><p>In essence, nothing seems working at the moment and I am sure other people with the same tablet have the same issue. I really appreciate if you and the community can help me out here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi Ray,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any third party anti-virus program installed on your system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per my research on the type of issue that you are facing, it may occur if the third party firewalls from the security software block the connection. So, if you can install your favorite anti-virus installed on the system again, I would suggest you to
 completely uninstall the anti-virus program with its removal tool,&nbsp;<em>temporarily</em>&nbsp;to check if the issue persists. To check for&nbsp;your relevant removal tool, please refer to the following link by Stephen Boots replied on March 21, 2012:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/mse-protect_start/list-of-anti-malware-product-removal-tools/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/mse-protect_start/list-of-anti-malware-product-removal-tools/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Important Note:</strong><span>&nbsp;Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install
 other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Harkanwar,</p>
<p>Tried disabling defender as well but the same result. Bluetooth entry has a yellow triangle and Lenovo driver won't update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am surely not the only one with this problem. Does MS have a generic BT 4.0 driver I can download?</p>

            <p>Hello Ray,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, Lenovo provides for the generic driver as well. For once, I would suggest you to run the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool and then check for the issue.
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open an elevated command prompt. Press <em><strong>WinKey + X</strong></em>, click
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></li><li>Type the following command, and then press Enter. It may take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.<br />
<span><strong>dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth</strong></span></li><li>After you get message “The operation completed successfully” type second command and press enter. It will take some time to finish.<br />
<strong>dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong></li></ol>
<span><strong>Important: </strong>When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.</span>
<p>
</p><p><span>Reboot your computer, check for the issue and post back your results for further assistance.</span></p>

<p>Version 10.0.10586.0</p>

</p><p>I restart the tablet and still the same yellow triangle next to BT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also reset Windows 10 and repeated the above two commands. Same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lenovo Community has people reporting the same problem but there has been no solution either. I unfortunately can't go back to Win 8.1 so am stuck...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thank you very much for your time and welcome any further suggestions.</p>

            Hi Emil,
<br />
<br />This was also an issue in the Chrome browser and the following worked for the Chrome browser, hopefully it will also work for Opera . . .
<br />
<br />In the Address bar, paste this and hit Enter :
<br />
<br />opera:flags
<br />
<br />In the resulting list, look for 'Hardware Media Key Handling'
<br />
<br />Disable that setting
<br />
<br />Restart Opera
<br />
<br />Does that work in Opera?

<br />An attempt was made to access a pageable (or completely invalid) address at an

            OK, can go back and switch to the "Realtek Bluetooth Adapter" for now.
<br />
<br />Also, can you provide the following file which has more information on the blue screen crash:
<br />
<br />C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP
<br />
<br />The memory.dmp file will be quite large, you could zip and compress the memory.dmp file with a third party application such as 7-Zip.

            The bdelam.sys shows up as an "unloaded" driver.
<br />
<br />Can you temporarily uninstall Bitdefender and use Windows built-in antivirus and firewall and see if the errors resolve.

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Did you make any software or hardware changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
2. What is the make and model number of the computer?<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1</b><br />
I would suggest you to disconnect all the external devices except mouse and keybord and check if you are able to boot to the desktop.<br />
<br />
<b>Method 2</b><br />
<b>Step 1: </b>I would suggest you to boot the computer into safe mode and check if that helps.<br />
<br />
<b>Start your computer in safe mode<br />

<br />
<b>Step 2: </b>If you are able to boot to the desktop, then perform clean boot and remove the program that is causing the issue.<br />
<br />
<b>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
</b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><b>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</b></span></a><b><br />
Note: </b>Follow step 7 from the clean boot article KB929135 to reset the computer back to normal mode.<br />
<b>Method 3</b><br />
If the above methods fail, then I would suggest you to try booting the computer into Last known good configuration:<br />

Although in many places that particular model shows it comes with the Wireless Network card - if you did not re-install that machine after you got it (put a new operating system on it) and you don't see the wireless network device under "Network" in "Device
 Manager" and running the installer for the <a href="http://global-download.acer.com/GDFiles/Driver/Wireless%20LAN/Wireless%20LAN_Ralink_3.2.1.0_W7x86W7x64_A.zip?acerid=634534713868245038&amp;Step1=DESKTOP&amp;Step2=ASPIRE&amp;Step3=ASPIRE M3450&amp;OS=ALL&amp;LC=en&amp;BC=ACER&amp;SC=PA_7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
wireless network device that supposedly comes inside that computer</a> does 'nothing' and - new thing to check for - you do not see any unknown devices or devices with "exclamation marks" next to them in device manager - then you do not have a wireless adapter
 or it has completely gone defective.</p>
<p>Contact the manufacturer and/or those you purchased it from for assistance.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 settings won&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p>A few hours ago I updated my laptop from windows 8.1 to windows 10. I'm certainly not happy with the way windows 10 is working for me, so I decided to downgrade my system to windows 8.1. Normally this should have been possible by opening: settings -&gt; Update
 &amp; security -&gt; recovery -&gt; Go Back To Windows 8.1. However when I tried this I found out that I was not able to open my settings app. When I click on the settings button, the page will open for not even a split second, to close immediately after. I've tried
 opening my setting by using the searchbar and clicking on links that would normally open a section of the settings-app. Also, I have turned off my system in different ways for more that 10 times by now. I really want to go back to windows 8.1, but I just don't
 know how to solve this problem.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 in restart loop after update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 in restart loop after update</h2>
                    <p>I updated from windows 7 to 10 about a month ago and it has been working fine. However after my most recent update my laptop has been unusable. Halfway through the update a blue screen appeared saying an error had occurred (0xc000007b) and the system needed
 to restart. Upon restart it runs automatic repair tool however this always fails and tells me to restart resulting in the same problem. I've tried starting in safe mode as well as various other modes but I still have he same outcome it wont load windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm no computer expert but any help on the matter would be greatly appreciated as I could do without forking out for a new laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Ian</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. Apologize for the inconvenience caused to you.</p>
<p>

</span><span>and create&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;10 installation media.</span></li><li><span>Insert the installation&nbsp;media you created, and then restart your PC.</span></li><li><span>On the Install Windows screen, select <strong>
<span>Repair&nbsp;your computer</span></strong>. (If you’re not seeing this screen, your PC&nbsp;might not be set up to boot from a drive. Check your PC manufacturer's&nbsp;website for info on how to boot from media, and then try
 again.) </span></li><li><span>On the Choose an option&nbsp;screen, select <strong>
<span>Troubleshoot</span></strong>.&nbsp;From there, you can use Safe Mode. Select
<strong><span>Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>After your PC restarts,&nbsp;select 5 or F5 to restart you PC in
<strong><span>Safe&nbsp;Mode with Networking</span></strong>. If your PC won’t start in Safe Mode&nbsp;with Networking, try steps 2-4 again, and then, after your PC restarts,&nbsp;select 3 or F3 to
<strong><span>Enable &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; low-resolution video</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Once your PC is in Safe Mode, open Device Manager by typing device manager in the search box on&nbsp;the taskbar, select Device Manager, and select the arrow to expand Display&nbsp;adapters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></li><li><span>If you see two items&nbsp;under Display adapters:</span></li><li><span>Right-click the added display adapter (for example, Intel HD 4000 or AMD Radeon HD 4200), and&nbsp;then select Disable &gt; Yes. To see if that worked, shut down your PC,&nbsp;disconnect your installation media, and then turn your PC back
 on.</span></li><li><span>If that doesn’t work,&nbsp;restart your PC in Safe Mode (see steps 2-5), return to the Display&nbsp;adapter section in Device Manager, enable the display adapter, and then&nbsp;disable the other display adapter.</span></li><li><span>If you see one item under&nbsp;Display adapters, roll back the driver or uninstall the display adapter.
</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
</p><p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>To roll back the driver, open Device Manager and select the arrow to expand Display adapters. Under Display adapters, right-click the item and select
 Properties. Select the Driver tab, and then select Roll Back Driver &gt; Yes.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
</p><p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>To uninstall the display adapter, open Device Manager and select the arrow to expand Display adapters. Under Display adapters, right-click the item

    <title>Wifi&#47;ethernet not working after windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> najashanti  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wifi&#47;ethernet not working after windows 10 update</h2>
                    Hello, I updated my laptop almost two weeks ago to Windows 10 version 1607, and now I am having issues with my wifi/Ethernet. Randomly my wifi will stop working and my computer will say that my Ethernet cable is not plugged in or it is not working. The
 only way to temporarily solve the problem is to restart my computer and somehow the problem fixes itself. However, the wifi continues to work perfectly fine on my other devices. I would like to know if there is a solution for this, or can I go back to the
 previous version I had? I'm a college student and I&nbsp;need a reliable computer!! Thanks in advance.

            <p>Hmn. This is interesting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. On the one hand, I clearly owe you an apology for my sarcasm, given that as I now see, there were several responses. In that vein, my sincere apologies. I did not see the responses which an email alerts me to today, even after checking
 repeatedly. I should not have been so snide, since several people responded promptly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, I did wait two months before saying anything, and did check repeatedly. It is suggestive that I was notified of these responses only after in exasperation I finally said something sarcastic, two months later. I already had checked the
 box, "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><span><strong>Receive email notifications",
</strong>and yet received such notifications only today, after following up in exasperation.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>Thank you. By "the" problem, do you mean the problem I posted about with wifi, or the problem that I did not receive notification of the responses to my post about my problem with wifi? Either way, how would I "monitor [my] profile list"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also either way, it is now two months later, and many Windows updates later too, and this problem with wifi is still recurring. I have of course responded to the questions asked of me about my original post, but as of yet, have been given no possible solutions,
 other than that my drivers may be wrong, which I anticipated in my original post. Is this problem still the intractable mystery it seemed to be a year ago?</p>
