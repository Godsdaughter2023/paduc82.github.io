<h2>            Fed -up of Windows 8 wifi limited connectivty issue - returning it and getting a mac.</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello, just bought a TOSHIBA satellite U920T ultrabook for 1300$. Its running windows 8 and I'm getting the same limited connectivity problem for my Wifi as alot of other people are
 reporting. That is it connects for a while and as soon as I begin to surf the net and then I get a limited connectivity message. It’s off and on but when there is internet connectivity its super slow. Also when the internet is lost the whole system seems to
 hang.</span><span> &nbsp;BTW the nic is intel centrino N2230. My router is a LINKSYS&nbsp;</span><b>BEFW11S4.</b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;I tried all the solutions I could find on the net and nothing works. &nbsp;I updated wifi drivers; I deactivated the power management on Wifi, changed the protocol on my wifi router frop
 WPE to WPA, and did the netsh tcp commands on this link <a href="http://microsoft-news.com/solution-for-wi-fi-limited-connectivity-error-on-the-microsoft-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://microsoft-news.com/solution-for-wi-fi-limited-connectivity-error-on-the-microsoft-surface/.</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I don't get it!&nbsp;Perhaps it’s because my router is old but then I paid 1300$ for a device that can't match the other wifi devices that I have such as my old pc, Ipods, Macbook pro, Wii,
 xbox , win xp and window 7 laptops, etc ! &nbsp;Did you guys test your software before putting it on the market! &nbsp;If I don't get a solution today I'm returning this laptop a getting a mac.</span></p>

<div><br />
<div>Type "Identify and repair network problems" in the search box (under Settings).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Run it as Administrator.</div>

Thanks for the advice, but I had tried the repair wizard and it didn't work, I even manually verified the TCP/IP settings such as DHCP. Besides, like I mention above, I returned my windows 8 laptop and bought a Mac book air, it worked right away without having to do all this trouble shooting ****. Perhaps it’s a hardware issue but if you type windows 8 limited connectivity in goggle you'll find many people with similar issues and on different harware platforms. Just as another comment on windows 8, in the first hour I used my brand new windows 8 Laptop, I got at least two "Not responding" messages, not very impressed!!

You should try Ubuntu Live CD on your Toshiba. I have switched to it on all my home computers.<br />

            My computer, a Dell XPS does not have a Ethernet cable connecter. Also, what is the point of having a mobile device if you can not use WiFi? That is crazy!

            <p>Actually, it's a very logical suggestion. Had the PC worked fine via Ethernet it would certainly point towards WiFi being the problem. Had it not worked it would indicate something else entirely.</p>

            ...it would be logical if the U920T had an ethernet port - which it doesn't. I have the same problem.

<h3> gjergjizhuka  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio Driver not installing in windows 8.&#40;toshiba satellite&#41;</h2>
                    I got a Toshiba Satellite L750D (PSK36E 021002GE)OS: Windows 8.I had been using Windows 8 but had to make a fresh install.When I reinstalled Windows 8 a sound problem occurred.Windows has automatically&nbsp; installed the audio drivers but when I jack in speakers
 or headphones there is no sound and the drivers will not run correctly.This does not happen every time but it is frustrating when it does.The quickest way for me to deal with it is by putting my laptop to sleep&nbsp; and reopen it.In my previous installment of
 windows I had manually installed the audio drivers.I try installing them but it will always say device not found, or Failure.I used the same Conexant Audio driver as the previous installment but it wont work.I also tried several other versions of the driver.What
 should I do?I don't want to reinstall Windows so should I just wait for windows to fix it?

            Go to the device manager and uninstall the audio driver from there. And Restart your computer.
<div><br />
<div>To go to the Device Manager, do the following:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Right CLick on Computer. Click on Manage. Click on Device Manager. Look for the audio driver. Right click on it then click uninstall. Then restart your computer.
<div><br />
<div>The computer will generate the audio driver. If it doesn't then you can go to the website of the computer's manufacturer to get the audio driver.
<div><br />
<div>If you have any questions, please drop me a line.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope this helps!</div>

                    <p>I am brand new to Skype and I have tried to use the internet to find out how to use Skype version 8.13.0.1 Calling version 2017.27.01.23 on my ZTE Maven 2 and all the pictures don't match up or buttons. I'm totally lost. I have been calling people because
 I don't know what the buttons mean and checking my profile and updating everything except what I want to do. I want to know how to change from one screen to another, but I keep getting a screen with +, my picture and two other icons I can't even begin to describe.
 I also have highlights, Chats and capture. I looked up those three and that's fine, but is this my home screen? Is&nbsp;highlights, Chats and capture the only pages I navigate to use Skype? except for the Settings page.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection for Mac allows to login only using an account with administrator rights.</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title: <span>Remote Desktop problem : Using my ipad, i can use remote desktop to access a windows 7 machine using any user account, however from a mac desktop computer (macpro running OS X 10.5.8), i can only remote desktop using an administrator
 account</span></p>
<p>So again... using my ipad i can log into my windows 7 machine using any user account, using the internal or external ip address. However if i try to use Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection for Mac on my mac tower, it only allows me to login using an account
 with administrator rights. I have added the unusable user account to the "remote desktop users" group, to no avail... i still can't login. It says "The credentials that were used to connect to ***.***.***.*** are incorrect. Please enter your credentials again.
 If i physically goto the win 7 machine and login using the exact same credentials, it logs me in with no problem. In the remote settings of win 7 machine the user account in question is listed under the remote desktop users list. So i'm at a loss. We are on
 a domain if that matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why oh why won't it login from the mac?? any ideas would be most appreciated. Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3> sub-elite  say:</h3>
<h2>            XP does or does not support connections to an n router&#59; through an older g adapter pci card..&#63;</h2>
                    This might sound stupid, but I recently purchased an n router to hook up an n adapter. I cannot connect, however, to this n router [in mixed (g and n) mode.] I just need to know if there is some reason an xp media center 2005 system cannot connect to a
 n router. See, I ask because on my win 7 pc, with a g card, it can connect; but the 'wireless networks in range' specifically says 'n radio' about my router. I guess I just thought that maybe because of the oldness of the xp technology or the newness of the
 n technology, I'm getting this connection failure just due to an issue that would force me to upgrade my xp machine to vista or 7, or if I just need to buy a new adapter for my xp pc, and connect to my n router that way and be done with it. Either way, currently
 I have my old g router piggy backed on one wired switch on my n router, and delegated ip's of the devices and just run that way. Any way, hope to know [if xp supports 802.11n or not] soon. Thanks.

            Windows XP doesn't determine what wireless protocol you can use.&nbsp; The computer's wireless network adapter does that.&nbsp; You might have to update the wireless adapter's driver program or replace the adapter with a new one.

<p>I realize this is an old post, but I'm hoping someone will see my reply anyway.&nbsp; I have a wireless network with two machines; one XP and one Vista.&nbsp; The network is fine, but speeds are very slow.&nbsp; I'd like to take advantage of the 802.11n network driver
 on my XP machine to increase my Dlink router's throughput.&nbsp; I can't find the driver anywhere.&nbsp; Right now, I'm stuck with 802.11g on both machines.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me where I can download the n driver?</p>

<p>It does not matter if it is Win XP, vista, or Win 7.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>802.11g card would connect only at g speed.</strong></p>
<p>To be able to use an 802.11n Router at its N speed, the computers have to equipped with 802.11n Wireless card.</p>
<p>Once you change to a 802.11n Wireless card and install its drivers, Win XP will support 802.11n</p>

<p>give it another try. If this happens again, let us know by entering the code below at xbox.com/errorhelp so we can investigate." And at the bottom of the screen the numbers were &lt; removed by CM &gt;</p>

    <title>Printing in Windows 10 DOES NOT WORK.... Period..... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joel chappell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing in Windows 10 DOES NOT WORK.... Period.....</h2>
                    <p>This seems to be a common problem for windows 10 Upgrade.... Dell says it's HP's problem, HP say's it's Microsoft's Problem, Microsofts forums says update drivers...<br />
<br />
I have tried multiple different printers HP varieties laserjets, inkjets, usb, parallel, and an old epson... None of them print... Each and every time it goes to print que and then says error printing... That's it....&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have tried going into settings of printer and have it "Print directly to Printer" that causes word, or any app to go into not responding....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried Universal print drivers with exact same results... I've uninstalled printers, uninstalled drivers, done a clean reboot, verified printers print on windows 7 machines... 6 different printers do not print, I have added them manualy as a shared
 printer nothing prints! Ever...&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So then.... I decided what the **** let's go to the error logs.... Interesting stuff here:<br />
<br />
Event ID: 215 PrintService<br />
Installing printer driver Ricoh Aficio SP C410DN PCL5c failed, error code 0x0, HRESULT 0x80070BC8. See the event user data for context information.<br />
<br />
Event ID: 370 PrintService<br />
The print spooler failed to regenerate the printer driver information for driver Ricoh Aficio SP C410DN PCL5c for environment Windows x64. Win32 system error code 3016 (0xbc8). This can occur after an operating system upgrade or because of data loss on the
 hard drive.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Event ID: 372 <br />
are errors that describe my machine name not able print and try restartiong the print spooler<br />
<br />
Now here's the thing: I do not own that type of printer anymore.... I used to have it.... &nbsp;I sold it many moons ago to a friend who loves the printer... And it is now hundreds of miles away...&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I suspect event ID: 370 is the issue.... Any ideas on how to get rid of a printer that does not show up in devices?&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused to you. <span>I'll certainly help you with this.</span></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key,</strong> type <strong>Services</strong> and hit <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li><li>Locate the <strong>Print Spooler </strong>service in the list of services, and then confirm that&nbsp;its status is
<strong>Started</strong>. If its status is not <strong>Started</strong>, select the service and then click
<strong>Start </strong>on the <strong>Action</strong> menu. </li><li>Right click on <strong>Print Spooler </strong>and click on <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Change the start up type to <strong>Automatic </strong>and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: You can also do this from an elevated Command Prompt (right click on Windows key)&nbsp;window by typing the following command:
<strong>net stop spooler &amp;&amp; net start spooler</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also run the <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/fix-printer-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Printing troubleshooter</a></strong>.</span></p>

            <p>Did all of that.... &nbsp;I checked the spooler folder folder in System32 as well for corrupt stuck files...&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But here is a bit of interesting: IN doing a walkabout of my building I found another<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;Ricoh Aficio SP C410DN... Grabbed my laptop and was curious.... I had to reinstall the drivers for
 it brute force...&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;It printed successfully....<br />
<br />
But no other printer will print....It's as if I cannot install another printer at all.... It successfully installs... In fact the eventID 370 above is no longer occurring but Not one other printer will work at all...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have heard of this issue occurring on 2008 servers as well... This is a serious issue that needs remediation.... Re-installing the operating system is not really an cool option because... Well, it would take days to reinstall windows 7 and then redownload
 the upgrade that would not probably authorized because my code has already been used for an upgrade... Then it's phone tree ****....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Others are reporting this issue and the printing trouble shooter restarts the spooler clears the failed print job and the cycle starts all over again.... Been there done that...&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>The printer is set up on my router with TCP/IP address and connected to my router via an Ethernet cable.</p>

            <p>Hello hobbes3000,</p><p><br /></p><p>Your deposit is being prevented due to a mismatch between your Rewards Account region and your Microsoft Account region. Since your Rewards Account is a separate entity from your Microsoft Account, migrating your Microsoft Account region will not also change your Rewards Account region. Therefore, when your Rewards Account attempts a deposit in one regional currency, it cannot complete when your Microsoft Account is of a differing currency. So when we attempt to deposit USD&nbsp;from your US&nbsp;Rewards&nbsp;Account, we cannot complete the process since your Mexican Microsoft Account only accepts deposits made in MXN.</p>
<p>However, this issue can be fixed by heading over to the Microsoft Commerce page at (<a href="https://billing.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://commerce.microsoft.com</a>) to update your Microsoft account to match your Xbox Live Rewards location. Another option if you wish to continue with Rewards in your current Xbox Live region is to opt out of the program at (&nbsp;<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/optout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/optout/</a>&nbsp;) , wait 48 hours and then sign back up again, which can also take 48 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;While you will lose your progress by starting a&nbsp;brand new&nbsp;account, you can start earning Rewards Credits that will successfully reward your newly registered regional currency. To confirm that you have re-registered correctly, you can check your join date from the&nbsp;MyRewards&nbsp;page at (<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/</a>). If your join date shows a specific date and not a date of "???", then your account has successfully been re-registered. If you open a new post after being able to log in to your new Rewards account, you can&nbsp;request&nbsp; any&nbsp;pending deposits from your old account to your new one.</p><p><br /></p>

<br />
Hi<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If I (for example in&nbsp;MS Word) click print or press Ctrl and P nothing happens at all&nbsp;(including no message).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If I try it in Excel I get&nbsp;a message telling me No printers are installed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Under "Services" in Windows 7&nbsp;if I look at the Print Spooler it says service has been stopped.&nbsp; If I click Start I get the message: Windows could not start the print service spooler on local computer. Error 1068: Then dependency service or group failed to start.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I hope this is enough info to help.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Many thanks<br />

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>Under Dependencies it says:</p>
<p>HTTP &amp; Remote Procedure Call (RPC).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For info: Today the printer has decided to work, however yesterday it wouldn't.&nbsp; Not sure if this makes a difference as to what is showing today in the box?&nbsp; Last time it stopped work it was for 1 month, maybe it won't work tomorrow?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Thanks for your help,</p>

            <p>Hi Yumpin,<br />
<br />
The Windows update should not take that long to install. After a force shutdown, the update should start and complete after a restart. However, with your experience, there might be other factors affecting the installation of the update. For us to further isolate
 this case, we suggest running the Windows Update troubleshooter. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Windows</strong> key and search for <em>troubleshooting</em>.</li><li>Once the search result comes up, click <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>Under <em>System and Security</em>, click <strong>Fix problems with Windows Update</strong>.</li><li>In the&nbsp; <em>Windows Update window</em>, click <strong>Advanced</strong>.</li><li>In the advanced settings, make sure to check the box for <strong>Apply repairs automatically</strong>, click
<strong>Run as Administrator</strong>, then hit <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Follow the on-screen instructions.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you still encounter issues with installing the Creators Update.<br />
<br />
Regards.<br />

            <p>I have finally (but not sure exactly how) gotten this update to terminate the 'downloading' progress bar scenario it was stuck in for almost a full day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have run the troubleshooting tool and the show/hide updates tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This update now shows in the updates tool as being 'hidden' which I was able to do by running this tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER, when I start Microsoft Updates (from 'Settings Menu') the update also shows up as being 'ready to download' and there is the obligatory 'Start Download' button also........</p>
<p>
</p><p>Needless to say I don't think I will press this button........</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am curious 'why' this update still appears as a 'Ready to Download' item when it also appears in the show/hide update tool as 'being hidden.....'</p>
<p>
</p><p>This machine was perfectly happy under Windows 7; but every day under Windows 10 has been a 'Forrest Gump Box of Chocolates' kind of day; you never know what you are going to get......</p>

</p><p>Maybe so, but frequently it is possible to find out what is causing the problem and devise a workaround based on that knowledge.&nbsp; There is an abundance of diagnostics if you care to look for them and at them (or allow others to look at them for you).&nbsp; The
 Troubleshooters are only intended to help in the most common cases; however, they also generate diagnostics to let us discover things that they may have missed.</p>

            <p>We appreciate the feedback, Yumpin. Aside from the Windows Firewall, do you have other firewall installed on your computer? Just to isolate this case. we suggest turning off the firewall on your computer while installing the updates and see if it completes.
 Please do a force shutdown first before installing the update. Press and hold your computer's power button for
<em>5 to 10 seconds</em> or up until the computer shuts down. Once done, start your computer and the update should automatically resume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the result.</p>
<p>

            <p>Yes, I do have two 'FlashDrives' set up as 'ReadyBoost' devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps their presence might be an issue?&nbsp; Had forgotten about them being installed on this machine; although my other computers have them set up also and have had no similar problems with accepting Windows 10 updates.&nbsp; The 'ReadyBoost Drives' have been
 'out of sight and out of mind' installed on the back of the machines......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, have no other 'Firewalls' in place except the Microsoft Windows Firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From checking their websites, this computer (HP 8100 Elite) appears to be one which has not been 'tested by HP' for running Windows 10; so I really believe this might be the major underlying issue here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine's age might be a factor as the Windows 10 updates get more and more complex......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also have a Printer wirelessly (no cables) attached to the machine.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft RDP web browser</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a problem with RDP. I'm using Windows Server 2008 R2, as host and connecting to it with Apple iOS, Windows, Android, etc. using RDPclient program on client computer. I would like set connection in the way so I could connect to host by
 a web browser and not to install any software. As an example: in web browser type in host ip address and port number, and it connects to it, asking about username and password, then showing me my user desktop in the web browser&nbsp;</p>

<h3> steadfastlamb  say:</h3>
<h2>            wont connect to linksys router</h2>
                    
<p>i have two consoles, one elite and one slim. on the elite i have the black xbox wireless adapter. both worked great. played online in the morning, no problems. came home after work and neither console will connect to the router. i know it sounds like it's
 the network that is having problems but i'm posting this from my laptop which hasnt had any connection issues at all.</p>
<p>i went through the trouble shooting pages, restored the default settings, checked the mac filtering and dhcp, but still cant get the network to even show up when i'm scanning now.</p>
<p>do you know of anything that might be causing something like this? any help would be greatly appreciated before i have to go drop another wad on a new router and then reconfigure everything in the house again.</p>

<p>I changed routers after I started having the problem. With the new Netgear router I can connect with the new XboxSlim, but not with the older elite. I'm thinking that it has to do with the encryption I'm using. I'm using the WPA2 now whereas before I was
 using the WEP with the linksys router. If I could figure out how to enable the WPA2 setting on the elite, I think I'd be set, but whenever I go to the settings, that option and WPA option are always greyed out.

    <title>Mouse Lag and Beeping With Built-In Synaptics Pointing Device TouchPad - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mouse Lag and Beeping With Built-In Synaptics Pointing Device TouchPad as well as with a Microsoft Wireless Mouse On Windows 10 Home</h2>
                    <p>I have been having this problem on my personal HP Pavilion g7-1310us Notebook PC were the Mouse Lag and Beeping With Built-In Synaptics Pointing Device TouchPad as well as with a Microsoft Wireless Mouse On Windows 10 Home occurs occasionally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This same problem hasn't happened on the Windows 10 Test PC at the computer repair shop I work at as a computer repair technician, but that is because it isn't used extensively in where it's using a lot of its physical memory or all its RAM as well. The
 catch is I've noticed on my personal computer that has had this problem &nbsp;happen is that it occurs when the computer decides to use all of its available memory for System and Compressed Memory where it's memory tab is in the red through Task Manager and it's
 stated to be using 98%-100% of the available memory. My computer has 6GB of RAM and there is no way it should be using all of its available RAM when it never did this or this mouse problem when it was using &nbsp;Windows 7 Home Premium as its OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my Drivers are uptodate according to Microsoft and Windows Troubleshooter under Hardware and Drivers. I've even tested the problem to see if it's only mouse pad related by disabling my&nbsp;HP Pavilion g7-1310us Notebook PC's Synaptics TouchPad and used my
 Wireless Microsoft Mouse which also has updated drivers but it too lags and gives off these beeps. There is like about 4 beeps but more if you continue trying to use the mouse (either one) in an attempt to free it up from its lag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is clearly not a computer issue and driver issues though because I've also heard about the same problem affecting non-Synaptics Pointing Devices and also for the fact it's also happening with a Microsoft Mouse that has drivers made by Microsoft. So
 logically this is just another annoying Windows 10 error that Microsoft needs to fix!</p>

</p><p>As a Computer Repair Technician I really hate and despise being told to do something I've already done to troubleshoot any and all errors when it comes to Windows 10 and any other Windows OS. It's the one reason why I hardly ever post here because 90% of
 the time any suggestions given I've already tried and then people here turn it into an argument thinking they know more than I do about computers yet as a repair technician I am repairing Windows 10 lately for customers five days a week and sometimes on Saturdays
 as well.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all that said, the reason I've said all that is yet again I'm being asked to do something I've already done. Everything I've tried for this mouse lagging and beeping problem would have made my initial post a lot longer than it already is. So I've already
 done a clean boot and it found no problems whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, there is no malware on my computer and there hasn't even ever been any viruses because I'm extremely smart and don't use Microsoft's piece of junk virus protection built-in to Windows 10 (Windows Defender) and that's because all the times I've
 ever used it it's always allowed viruses, spyware and malware onto my computer. All of which I got Norton Internet Security and it found and removed all of them and that was all when Windows Defender first came out, and before I even went to Norton I had tried
 Microsoft Security Essentials and it was just as bad as Windows Defender. Never again will I ever use any virus protection software by Microsoft!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And lastly, my computer is 100% uptodate on all Windows 10 Updates through Windows Update. Every program I have that has the chance of having any updates I check for updates daily for and I mean manually. There no Windows 10 updates currently available for
 Windows 10 and thus my computer is 100% uptodate. Since I've already done everything you are saying to do and none of it was ever even remotely fixing this issue (and I do it all every time the error occurs to no effect) I am not going to waste my time doing
 it again. The only thing that's ever fixed it is restarting the computer and thus clearing the hogged up memory that System and Compressed Memory uses up. Plus other times without a restart when the memory/RAM stops being hogged up by Windows 10 the issue
 100% fixes itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, this issue isn't an everyday, every week or even every month occurrence. Until I made my initial post this problem hadn't occurred since late November way after Windows 10 Version 1511 was released. &nbsp;Plus I'm the type of person that does my
 research and I know that other people are having this exact same error at times as well. I've already discovered at least two forums threads on the exact same issue but they apparently all have Acer Computers and assume it's an Acer thing, the fact that it
 occurs on other computer types, means it's either Windows 10 related or Windows Update is ruining computers by installing Generic Drivers instead of the ones especially released by computer manufacturers. For HP with my user manual and HP Support Assistant
 has warned against installing Generic Drivers even if they are by the driver manufacturers because a lot of the times the computer manufacturers modify the drivers before installing them to their manufacturered computers and thus the driver software gets modified
 as well to the point generic drivers like the ones Windows Update installs for Windows 10 can be very bad for the everyday workings of people's computers.</p>

</p><p>I've already done with his as well and it was one of the first things I've tried as well. System File Checker (SFC) always finishes giving the result "No System Integrity Violations were found".</p>

<div>Pure and simple logic with ALL Troubleshooting Results showing that there is NO computer problems, NO system corruption of any kind, as well as ALL drivers being up-to-date shows that the TRUE problem here is Windows

            <p>Nothing ever fixes this issue and it's gotten worse since the recent Windows 10 updates via Windows Update from this past Update Tuesday (2/9/16). Along with other Windows 10 issues. Including issues that were once not happening anymore like with the entire
 Task Bar freezing and taking out the clock and totally killing the system. Also the error with System &amp; Compressed Memory using all of (98%-100%) of available Memory/RAM when there's a total of 6GB of RAM on my computer is back as well after these recent Windows
 10 Updates! Add into that when Microsoft Edge stops responding and crashes still it STILL takes out the Start Menu so it's unusable and after such crashes and stopping to respond Microsoft Edge won't relaunch and the Windows Store as well as Windows Update
 stops working. All these still show that the Windows Shell in Windows 10 is clearly the problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This all proves that these are Windows 10 issues directly and Microsoft needs to admit to them and how Windows 10 is still buggy and doesn't work right!</p>

</p><p>The links aren't useful or helpful. I've tried them myself and my computer being manufactured by HP wouldn't allow the software to even be installed. And that is because simply you don't want to install anything to your computer that isn't truly related
 to the&nbsp;hardware you are using, and that hardware is what your computer manufacture (such as HP) put into the computer when they built it, you want to go to their website and their page dedicated to your computer make and model for the correct software drivers
 so it actually interacts with the hardware correctly. If you don't you'll just be further damaging your computer, causing repair technician more of a difficult time to fix your problems with your machine, and in the long run costing you more money to fix it
 when you could have prevented it by not installing sanctioned software or drivers. Its one sure way to null your computer's warranty if it is still in warranty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it doesn't matter if it is caused by an update, which it isn't. People have had the Mouse Lag with Windows 10 since its Day 1 Mainstream Release on July 29th 2015. Even if it was caused by an update, you can't get rid of the offending update anymore.
 Windows Update AUTOMATICALLY INSTALLS ANY AND ALL UPADATES that you are missing so if your get rid of an update, the next time you turn on your computer it automatically searches for and installs any and all updates you are missing. I've personally removed
 a few Cumulative Updates for it seemed they were causing problems (they weren't the cause though) and the next day Windows 10 was reinstalling all of them since they weren't installed anymore. So even if you keep removing any update including KB3140743, you'll
 just be getting it again and again, for you don't have that update installed well the next Cumulative Updates Package will automatically install KB3140743 again since it is then included in that new Update Package, and so on and so forth with every Windows
 10 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, every Windows 10 computer gets every Cumulative Update so no matter what you will have KB3140743 especially if you are running Windows 10 Version 1511 (which in itself was its own Cumulative Update for if you pay attention to each Cumulative Update
 after its is installed, its changing your Build-# for Windows 10 Version 1511.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, well trying to diagnoise what is causing this error I have made a startling discovery, it is connected to another Windows 10 problem. That problem is System and Compressed Memory using all or almost all of a Computers Memory/RAM. When checking Task
 Manager with with this Mouse Lagging problem, I've discovered that a majority of the time System and Compressed Memory is using up all or almost all of my HP Pavilion g7-1310us Notebook PC's Memory/RAM; a totally of 6GB worth of RAM (and the computer's max
 potential is only 8GB). The evidence almost everyday is starting to mount up that all these problems aren't computer related but directly related to the Windows 10 Operating System and can only be fixed by Microsoft but they rather keep using System and Compressed
 Memory when thousands of computer users using Windows 10 have noticed that their machine's are lagging and all their Memory is being used up. Many of these computers are former Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 computers that never had such problems until they were
 upgraded to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh and by the way, the links you linked to, they REMOVED THE SOFTWARE and its entire package to use.</p>

<h2>            Why does age of empires 2&#58; conquerors expansion not work on my Alienware m14x Laptop&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I figured this computer would run games flawlessly but it doesn't want to run this aoe game because it randomly says the game "stops working" right when the start up loading screen pops up, and also World of Warcraft has not been working either... i'm
 really considering returning this laptop. A little advice or help would be great thanks

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>As you have already tried a lot of things already, please check if the graphic card/Display adapter drivers are updated. If
 not please visit the manufacturers site and get the drivers updated to the latest ones.</span></p>
<p><span>Age of Empires 2 – The Conquerors expansion edition is not listed in Windows 7 Compatibility Center, so the status of your
 game’s compatibility with Windows 7 is unknown.</span></p>

    <title>Skype for Mac OS 10.14 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hotdogsandmustard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype for Mac OS 10.14</h2>
                    <p>I have Skype&nbsp;8.27 and the app sounds are missing. Normally there is a sound panel in the older version where I can pick my sounds for sending or receiving messages. These sound are not there any more. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>Also i have done complete delete and re-install of both versions. Skype 7.59.37 does not work any more, I get the rainbow pin wheel and cannot type in the chat section.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So with all this said , if skype is running and I am using my browser I can't tell if someone typed me a message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using Skype since day one when they released it to Mac Users. Since Microsoft has acquired the product they have destroyed it for mac users. That is a shame.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I do not like all those bots in the new version, I do not trust them, it is a bot and useless for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>How do I get the in app sounds for the new version of Skype ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes all my preferences are correct, no I am &nbsp;not gonna keep deleting and downloading.</p>
<p>Oh and I did a live screen with someone last night and I do not think they know Mac computers.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Donald,
<br />
<br />SppExtComObj is a legitimate Windows Process, also known as KMS Connection Broker
<br />
<br />Do not touch that file, it is a required component of Windows, unless an Anti-virus application is flagging that file as infected, leave that file alone
<br />
<br />With all these exe and dll file names, if you Google them you will always find websites reporting them as a virus or malware, when this is rarely the case, they are just trying to sell you some malware application . . .
