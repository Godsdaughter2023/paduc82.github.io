            <p>I've experienced the same&nbsp;problem when I got my new play and charge kit about a week ago. I&nbsp;nearly thought my pack was defective.&nbsp;<strong>If you allow the battery to fully cycle (charge and discharge) one or two times, the cable LED should be lighting up.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Just keep the cable plugged in and play normally, don't worry about the LED for now. After a few hours, disconnect the cable, and play until the battery dies. Then, plug it back in. At some point, the LED should start turning on.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Perhaps the battery needs to be calibrated with some charge cycles&nbsp;for the cable LED to finally&nbsp;work? Wished they mentioned that in the manual.</p><p><br /></p><p>Give it some time, and post back with results!</p>

    <title>Firewire Camera not connecting after last updates winxp64 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Firewire Camera not connecting after last updates winxp64</h2>
                    Hi!<br />
After the last regular updates from win xp 64-bit it seems like it is not possible anymore to connect a firewire camcorder (Canon XH A1 in my case)&nbsp;to my PC. Normally the Autoplay poped up and asked wheather I want to Capture something or if I want to take
 no action, but now only a "bling"-sound appears but nothing happens, in adobe premiere pro&nbsp;I am not able to capture any video from my cam.
<br />
There is a Update for Windows XP (KB885222) that addresses sort of such problem, but this is only for the 32-bit version of windows. Is there something for the 64-bit version?<br />
I found some posts where they said I should uninstall Service Pack 2, but I think this can't be the solution...

            Oh, sorry, I just realized that I posted in the vista-forum, sorry.<br />
I solved the problem, it was a setting in the camera that was wrong, there is under Signal setup a setting av&gt;dv that has to be on. So problem solved here.

    <title>How to recover from a hack - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to recover from a hack</h2>
                    <p>On 6/22/15, I got a pop-up claiming to be a support agent to fix my infected computer. I allowed access and only because my other computer, the desk top, has been acting up where&nbsp;it won't stay&nbsp;on for any longer than 4 to 5 sec. and then shuts down. Also,
 I had just changed ISP's. Dumb me, fell for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did&nbsp;not buy into the service which was $199. to $499,.&nbsp;But my bank acct. was hacked. So I assume they found my debit card number. I received a phone call from MasterCard fraud dept. 2 days later informing me of suspicious activity. I&nbsp;copied the url down
 while on the remote with them and it brings up a support service website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got some support from&nbsp;Malwarebytes who found&nbsp;a virus and I did some&nbsp;troubleshooting. But until I got online remote support through Microsoft did they find swdumon malware and did a complete virus scan and cleaned files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found on a link given by support, the log in's for the week and I found 6 foreign country attempts to hack in. One of them being a persistent attempt at 7 times. I tried to change my Windows PW. but it&nbsp;keeps telling me, "wrong password"&nbsp;so I can't change
 that but I did change my outlook and google logins. Yesterday morning I lost my wireless mouse driver so had to reinstall. I still don't feel clean..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, with my desk top not working and shutting down as soon as my browser log in appears, I think I'm infected on that machine. Although&nbsp;it went down 7 days before the hack. Maybe I just&nbsp;need to clean it of dust and assure the fans are coming on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I logged out of the remote session with the hacker, I got&nbsp;a flash of, "jims not dead".&nbsp;My hack has been reported. I have a Dell inspiron lap top running Win/7. Do you think I would be wise in reformatting my hard drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If I were you, it would be wise (to reformat already)..</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't know which settings the impersonating support agent messed up with.. giving someone access to your computer is basically giving them all the tools to fix (or tamper) your Windows installation..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus, it's better to be on the safe side, it already happened, so the only thing you could do is to prevent any possible after-effects that could potentially happen..</p>

            <p>You should consider that your identity has been compromised.&nbsp; Do not&nbsp;use the computer until it is re-built.&nbsp; You have no idea and can have no idea to what extent your private information and the computer are compromised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is serious stuff.&nbsp; You should be contacting the local police fraud squad, all of your bankers, credit rating agencies, and credit card issuers.&nbsp; They will want to cancel all and re-issue, and will advise you.&nbsp; Consider even warning the Post Office --
 these guys have been known to submit change of address to the post office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to make your computer safe is to delete the partition and install Win7&nbsp;from scratch.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had this happen to two clients and in each case, I did a complete re-install.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your mistake was allowing them to log on to your computer.</p>

    <title>Icon images slowly disappearing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> randykesselring  say:</h3>
<h2>            Icon images slowly disappearing</h2>
                    <p>Two months ago I purchased a new computer with Windows 10. &nbsp;After setting up my desktop with a few short cuts, the icon images began to slowly disappear. &nbsp;At first, I just deleted them and made new shortcuts. &nbsp;The new shortcuts had icon images for a while,
 but then they started to disappear again. &nbsp;Now I just have blank pages displayed on my desktop. &nbsp;I searched the database here and found some information on previous versions of Windows mostly having to do with rebuilding the icon cache. &nbsp;I also did a Google
 search and found some information on rebuilding the icon cache in Windows 10. &nbsp;So far, none of these methods work. &nbsp;Mostly they consist of deleting all of the icon cache files by using the command prompt and making sure to close all programs that might use
 the icon cache.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Microsoft have any sort of solution to this? &nbsp;I don't want to have to completely reinstall Windows on a new computer.</p>

            <p>Hi Randy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are glad to provide the assistance requires to help resolve your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the information stated below:</p>
<p>1. Did you make any changes to your PC prior to the issue?</p>
<p>2. Do you install or run any programs when you notice the icons missing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To begin with, I suggest that you re-run the icon cache command to rectify if the command you processed ran successfully.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Close and save anything that you are working on before proceeding. The next steps will involve killing explorer and restarting the PC.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>2. Right click on the Start Menu and select
<strong>C<a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3288-command-prompt-open-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">ommand prompt</span></a>&nbsp;(Admin)</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>3. Copy and paste each command below one at a time into the command prompt, and press
<strong>Enter</strong> after each command.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>ie4uinit.exe -ClearIconCache</span></strong><span>
<br />
<br />
<strong>taskkill /IM explorer.exe /F</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>DEL "%localappdata%\IconCache.db" /A</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>shutdown /r /f /t 00</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. The last command will shut down your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the above still portrays the same effect, the I suggest that you perform SFC to check if there are any system corrupted files that&nbsp;may cause the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">System File Checker [SFC] scan on the computer which will replace the missing or corrupt files &amp; check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a.&nbsp;Right click on the Start Menu, locate and select Command Prompt (Admin).</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> If you are prompted for an administrator

<p>
</p><p>I don't know of any change that I made that might cause this problem--though I am sure that I made some sort of change--doesn't that happen all the time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your directions as accurately as possible. &nbsp;Now I have black squares in front of the empty white pages for icons. &nbsp;The scan said that it found no integrity issues. &nbsp;Is there something else to be done?</p>

            <p>I have solved part of the problem. &nbsp;In the midst of my problem with disappearing icon images, I had taken action to delete the arrows indicating that the icons were shortcuts. &nbsp;I reversed that procedure and I am back to blank white pages. &nbsp;So, I tried the
 same procedure recommended by Vanessa again with no results. &nbsp;I also ran the scan again and it said that there were still no integrity issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a solution for this? &nbsp;It's truly annoying and I don't think I should have to completely reload Windows 10 to solve this problem. &nbsp;So, does Microsoft have anything to offer? Anything?</p>

            <p>Hi Randy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The .lnk file type settings are correct.. Was especially checking if the IconHandler was missing; but it was there. If the shortcuts are functioning normally and there are no icon overrides in the registry, then create a new local account
<p>
</p><p>Can you also post the results of these three commands, run from a Command Prompt window&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>reg query "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{00021401-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}" /s<br />
reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Icons"<br />
reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Shell Extensions\Blocked"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 3rd location doesn't exist by default..we're checking to make sure no objects are blocked there.</p>

<p>If it's unsaved, you're likely out of luck. Unless Word did a recovery autosave, in which case you'd be prompted to choose what to do with the autosaved file when you launch Word.</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player 11 Remembers Shuffle Order</h2>
                    
<p>for the longest time in windows media player 11 on XP SP3 I would turn on shuffle and play all songs. I would hit the next button to go through the songs but sometimes I would skip past one that I wanted to listen to so I could hit previous and media player
 remembered the order in which it had played the songs in.</p>
<p>Now when I go to hit previous the song is random and windows media player 11 no longer remembers the order in which it played the songs in while in shuffle mode.</p>

<p>Do you have any third-party plug-ins for WMP installed? You can check by going to&nbsp;<strong>Tools
</strong>-&nbsp; <strong>Options </strong>-&nbsp; <strong>Plug-ins</strong> (press Ctrl+M if you don't see the Tools menu), and going through all categories. Disabling or uninstalling these plug-ins might help.</p>
<p>Another thing that's worth trying, is resetting WMP's media library. First note that resetting the library will make you lose all current play counts, and possibly ratings too. Then, follow these steps:</p>
<p>- Reboot the PC.<br />
- Go to Start, type&nbsp; <strong>services.msc</strong> in the Search field, and press Enter. In Services, find the&nbsp;<strong>Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service</strong> . If its status is&nbsp;<strong>Started</strong> , double-click the service and click&nbsp;
<strong>Stop</strong> .<br />
- Go to Start, type&nbsp; <strong>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft</strong> in the Search field, and press Enter. This folder will open up in Windows Explorer.<br />
- In this folder, rename the&nbsp; <strong>Media Player</strong> folder to something like&nbsp;<strong>Media Player old</strong> . If you can't see the folder, then it's probably hidden. Set Explorer to show hidden files and folders, and to show protected system files.<br />
- Start WMP, your library will have been reset and will be rebuilt. Check if the issue still occurs.</p>

<h2>            After installing Windows in Sony Vaio VGN-C140g, my Fn -&#43; for brightness not working.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Fn + brightness not working</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sony Vaio&nbsp; VGN-C140g&nbsp; running Windows XP ( everything worked fine on it)</p>
<p><strong>Upgraded to Windows 8 Pro via the $40 download from Microsoft on 10/30/2012</strong></p>
<p>Now my Fn&nbsp;-+ brightness keys don't work,&nbsp; before they worked. My Fn&nbsp;-+ volume work alright.</p>
<p>I checked the device manager and the display&nbsp;adapter is <strong>Mobile Intel (R) 945&nbsp;Express Chipset Family</strong></p>
<p>The Windows 8 driver version running on it is:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.15.10.2697&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; date of the driver: 10/1/2012</p>
<p>The Windows XP driver version that used to run on it&nbsp;was:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.2.9200.16384&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; date of the driver: 6/21/2006</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to go back to the original drivers, the same ones on&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;XP, but the Fn -+&nbsp;brightness still don't work. Rolling back the driver, uninstalling , disabling....don't help.
</p>
<p>I&nbsp;created&nbsp;restore points and installed the utilities and shared library drivers that had come with&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;XP from Sony's website, Restarted the computer, but still no joy.&nbsp; I went to the battery option and the Enable Adaptive Display was off already.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help me fix this issue?&nbsp; I am not very tech savvy, but with a little help I can find my way around.... Thank you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hello, Basith...</p>
<p>I did what you told me, but it didn't restore my brightness control. In fact, it disabled my ability to control the volume from the keyboard (Fn&nbsp; and f3 + f4 buttons). Now I can only control the volume from the speaker icon in the taskbar, which is a pain
 since I&nbsp;mostly use the touchpad for scrolling, clicking,&nbsp;and such. </p>
<p>To gain the brightness control back, I had to download one more file from Sony's website, called Sony Shared Library.&nbsp; After the restart, my brightness controls&nbsp;(Fn&nbsp; and f5 + f6) keys work perfectly, but as I said before, I have lost the volume control from
 the keyboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to control the volume from the keyboard, the graphical bar appears on the screen and the bars increase and decrease,&nbsp; using the Fn and f3 +f4 buttons, but the&nbsp;sound level&nbsp;remains the same.&nbsp; I even tried to download Realtech High Definition&nbsp;Audio
 Device Driver from&nbsp;&nbsp;Sony's website, but still no help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By now&nbsp;I have done so&nbsp;many installs and uninstalls, restore points after restore points that I am really getting tired....&nbsp; Anything else I might retry?</p>

<p>I did it but it made no difference on my system.</p>
<p>I tried doing it in the compatibility mode also, but a drop-down window came on and said the driver package was only for Windows 7 and Windows Vista.&nbsp;

<p>Against my instincts, I decided to heed this advice and redo the whole damn thing from scratch.</p>
<p>Well,&nbsp;I did...<u>and it didn't do anything</u>. The computer is still the same way... brightness works but the volume must be adjusted from the icon in the taskbar.</p>
<p>So, as I am typing this, the computer is downloading all the updates from a month ago...</p>
<p>&nbsp;Anyway, no pain, no gain...as the saying goes!</p>

            Absolutely unhappy with Windows 8 upgrade and such...<br />
<br />
After using Windows 8&nbsp; on and off for a couple of months, I finally decided to get rid of it and go back to Windows XP, though I don't really care that much about XP either, but it actually works better than that travesty I purchased as Windows 8 upgrade from
 XP.<br />
<br />
As some of you guys know, I had a lot of problems with Windows 8 from the get-go. With Windows 8, only my volume control would work and not the brightness keys. I was told that I had to install my original drivers for Windows XP in compatibility mode. I did
 that, but then volume control stopped working and I was only able to control it from the taskbar. Then I&nbsp; noticed that my sound drivers were not the correct ones either. I installed and uninstalled different drivers ( after creating a restore point for each
 installation so that I could keep a tab on them), yet there was always a grinding sound while watching You Tube videos.
<br />
<br />
Then I decided to install Linux Mint 14 on my hard drive. Guys, everything started working perfectly. All my functions keys worked flawlessly, sound was great, screen brightness control worked like a charm, touch pad was so smooth and functional.... See, Linux
 Mint is a relatively minor distro and there are so many people who haven't even heard about it, yet that little operating system brought my computer back to life.
<br />
<br />
My question is, why is it that a small, obscure system like Linux Mint can make my computer work without a hitch, but a gigantic software company like Microsoft can't write and bundle some generic drivers that would actually make the upgrade actually work?&nbsp;
 Microsoft invites people who want to upgrade&nbsp; their computers to contact their system manufacturers and other hardware makers to see if there are going to be issues. I think that is absolutely BS. A company like Sony is not going to write new drivers for an
 operating system they sold seven years previously, and the same goes pretty much for all other hardware manufacturers. Yet Microsoft encourages you to do just that. Why should I pay for an upgrade then get an operating system that almost cripples my system?
 None&nbsp; of the answers I got from these so-called experts here actually worked. The original drivers didn't work, the generic Microsoft drivers didn't work, and subsequent Windows updates didn't help either. So whose fault is it? Microsoft boldly claimed that
 you could upgrade from XP to Windows 8, but they failed to mention that part of your system may never work properly.
<br />
<br />
I believe that Microsoft must be sued for these BS claims. I had Windows 8 on one partition but most of&nbsp; the time I wasn't using it. I was just using Linux Mint 14.&nbsp; Then I decided to get rid of my copy of Windows 8 and go back to XP.&nbsp; I couldn't even do that.
 The recovery disks that I had created for Windows XP would no longer work. So I installed Linux Mint 15 this time and told it to delete Windows 8, which it did. From there I poped in my recovery Windows XP&nbsp; CDs and reinstalled&nbsp; XP again. Microsoft got my $40
 and downloaded a half-assed operating system into my computer, then implied to me that from there on I was on my own, which I finally fumbled my way back to safety.<br />

<h2>            Have HP envy 700-019 desktop, since update to 8.1 have corrupt files</h2>
                    <p>Have windows 8 but since the 8.1 downloaded I have had nothing but problems, no sound in HP connected music,, never have been able to make a system Image disc and many corrupt files.</p>
<p>HP techs took remote control and did a factory restore and then re downloaded windows 8.1, now I have corrupt files again and no sound from HP connected,</p>
<p>Tech tried to do a recovery with the recovery discs purchased from HP but they would not work the first time so he recovered it from the hard drive&nbsp;partition, now the techs tried to do the same thing again only this time it says I have no hard drive partition
 to do a restore from, the recovery discs do not work and I cannot even play my own CDs in the disc drive which is supposed to play blue ray discs too.</p>
<p>Are customers only allowed to do one recovery from the partition, also Java is installed but the applets do not work and Java does not show in my browser.</p>
<p>Help please.</p>

            <p>Thanks for replying, I have found the sound to be intermittent, at times it works and others it does not.</p>
<p>The security tab in IE11 Java Scripting of Java applets is enabled yet I get a message saying sun systems Java 2 plug in is null. Also in security it has my name but it has an x through it saying this is not a Trusted computer.</p>
<p>As for my CDs working on it that too has been hit or miss since day one. I tried to contact HP tech support but got nowhere, now they are going to send me a box to send it back for repair. The hard drive tests passed when the tech took remote control of
 my PC, I am supposed to be able to restore from the hard drive partition as many times as I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem with a printer I bought, while it was still under warranty and I could have taken it back to the store for replacement not one tech at HP would help me, they told me they were waiting for a patch to download to fix the issue. Now I
 am getting these fixed with my care packs which I bought.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Java problem has also effected my windows 7 64 bit desktop and I never had a problem with it before.</p>
<p>That is an HP Pavilion Elite 150F desktop which also has IE 11 on it. That too has the radio button checked as enabled for Java scripting of Applets.</p>
<p>The sound is fine in that desktop.</p>
<p>Getting back to my 700-019 desktop the same thing happens in google and I have downloaded both the online installer and the offline installer of Java but still no luck.</p>

            <p>HP tech support took remote control and tried to do a factory recovery, the recovery discs would not work, when the tech tried to do a recovery from the hard drive partition it said it did not have one, two different techs tried with it but no luck.
</p>
<p>It was sent off to HP for repair but I got it back yesterday and they claim that everything works fine on it and did not do a thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have had really bad storms here and have been without water for 2 months and without power for 3 days so I have not been able to hook it up but if it is the same I have 90 day's to call them on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Microsoft security center it has my name but it has a red x beside it saying this is not a trusted computer, why I would get this message I have no idea, I am the only user and purchased it from HP, I should be able to do as many recoveries as I wish
 from the hard drive partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They tell me not to download 8.1, if I do not then I cannot upgrade to windows 10, this is not a cheap computer but is supposed to be a high end one.</p>
<p>Anyhow once it is hooked up and if I get the same errors I will let you know and in the mean time thank you for your help.</p>

            <p>Set up my computer now that we have power back and my desktop has been sent back to me from HP , they did not repair anything yet I am still getting the same error messages, in Java the error message is Java applets, Null Pointer Exception: Null at Sun.
 Plug in 2 applet. JNLP2 Manager. get App information (unknown source) at Sun Java Plug in 2.</p>
<p>I am using IE11 and Java is enabled in my browser and I have the latest drivers installed.</p>
<p>I contacted tech support and they tell me I should be able to do as many recoveries as I wish to from the hard drive partition, I have not tried that since getting it back but if they never did anything I am guessing it is the same as before.</p>
<p>Also in HP photo creations I get a runtime error , Microsoft visual C ++ Runtime Library. Runtime error. Program : C :\windows \File Manager\ photosApp.exe. This application has requested the runtime to terminate in an unual way. Please contact the application's
 support team for more information.</p>
<p>Microsoft shows my name but has a red X beside it and says this is not a trusted computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so sick of it, I have less than 25 hours of use on this computer and that has been with the techs taking remote control to fix it.</p>
<p>I have a Phone number to call but I am guessing as I have sent it back once and only just got it back without them doing anything I will not get anywhere when I do call them. I am still using 8.1 and have not tried a different browser.</p>

<h2>            Bingo</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Am I the only one growing very frustrated with&nbsp;Microsoft Bingo game? Very irritating game! Can not&nbsp;tell me these bingo number's are random. Game will let you get maybe 1-2 bingo's per game,&nbsp;with the potential of several bingo's if you spend coins, which is okay, but then the number's called,&nbsp; goes all around&nbsp;the number or number's I need to bingo until coins are all&nbsp;used up, to get a couple&nbsp;extra bingo's. Lol. Ridiculous! I know Microsoft wants me to spend money buying coins etc. Also, one more complaint. Why does it take soooo long to reach next level?? I have noticed when the gold bar gets very near the end of the bar, it will actually jump back a little. Then when it actually does move to the end of line, it sets there, sometimes for a couple of days before the reward is given &amp; I move to the next level. You should be rewarded as soon as the gold bar&nbsp;gets to the end. I have already complained about the bingo server being down frequent

    <title>Windows 10 USB Bootable won&#39;t install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markfredricks  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 USB Bootable won&#39;t install</h2>
                    <p>Hey so I've been having a very baffling problem that I was hoping you guys could help me with. My 8 year old HDD finally failed on me earlier today, my boot times had been really slow lately and today when I tried to boot it up it just went to the blue Windows
 recovery screen. So I went and bought a PNY cs1311 480GB SSD to replace it. I'm a college student so I had access to a free version of Windows 10 so I went ahead and downloaded the ISO from the website and used Rufus to make a bootable USB from my 32 gb PNY
 flash drive. &nbsp;I just wanted to do a totally clean install on the SSD and worry about recovering from my old hard drive later. However when I put in the bootable USB and tried to boot from it the Windows logo would pop up, and then the computer would go back
 to the recovery screen. I had set the BIOS to boot from the USB, so I was confused there. So we totally disconnected the old hard drive and disabled all bootable drives in the BIOS aside from the USB, and it would still go to the Recovery screen, or sometimes
 it would give me an error saying that the file was corrupted. So after downloading a new ISO from microsoft's website, using the Windows 10 image creator, and testing on 3 different USB drives, nothing has changed except now instead of going to the recovery
 screen, I just see a windows logo for 20 seconds before my system restarts. I'm totally lost. Going to try a DVD with my friend tomorrow but at this point I'm not even sure that would work. If anyone has any suggestions, I'd appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reinstall the Windows 10 Operating System, we suggest you to use a DVD copy since the USB won't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also download installation media and use it to restore from a system restore point or reset your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<ol>
<li>On a working PC, go to the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=616447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft software download website</a>.</li><li>Download the media creation tool and then run it.</li><li>Select <strong>Create installation media for another PC</strong>.</li><li>Choose a language, edition, and architecture (64-bit or 32-bit).</li><li>Follow the steps to create installation media, and then select <strong>Finish</strong>.</li><li>Connect the installation media you created to your nonfunctional PC, and then turn it on.</li><li>On the initial setup screen, enter your language and other preferences, and then select
<strong>Next</strong>. If you're not seeing the setup screen, your PC might not be set up to boot from a drive. Check your PC manufacturer's website for info on how to change your PC's boot order, and then try again.</li><li>Select <strong>Repair your computer</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Choose an option</strong> screen, select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>. From there, you can:
<ul>
<li>Restore from a system restore point by selecting <strong>Advanced options</strong> &gt;
<strong>System Restore</strong>. This will remove recently installed apps, drivers, and updates that might be causing your PC problems. Restoring from a restore point won’t affect your personal files.</li><li>Select <strong>Reset this PC</strong> to reinstall Windows&nbsp;10. This will remove apps and drivers you installed and changes you made to settings, but lets you choose to keep or remove your personal files.</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

                    <p>I am getting this screen after I start the Sniper Fury on Windows 10, I don't know where to go from here and how. I clicked every where at the screen but nothing came up. I tried reinstalling but that is also not working. My all game progress is on Microsoft
 account. I don't know how to delete my progress from Microsoft account to start from very beginning. Please help me to sort this problem</p>

            Thank you. I tried it but didn't work. I think, if I would able to disconnect Sniper Fury from my Microsoft account, it will work. But I don't know how to do that.

<p>Pra quem tá com esse problema, o menu não aparece porque ele tá lendo as músicas que tem no hd. Vai ter que mover elas pra algum pendrive. Ou só espera o menu aparecer, mas demora. Eu tava com esse problema, foi só eu tirar o pendrive que tinha música e
 o menu carregou logo.</p>

<p>Disable the windows defender service, restart the machine and then start the windows defender service again and see if the issue is resolved or not.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Type <strong>services.msc</strong> in the start search box and hit enter.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: Locate a service called Windows Defender and double click on it and open it.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: Now stop the service and then click apply and then ok. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now restart the computer and then go and start the Windows Defender service from services.msc

<p>
</p><p><strong>copy&nbsp;&lt;filepath&gt;\spreadsheet ??.??.2014 &lt;destination folder&gt;</strong></p>

</p><p>An asterisk is a wildcard for infinity number of characters.&nbsp; Question mark is a wildcard placeholder for one (and must be one) space.&nbsp; So ??.?? guaruntees it only matches files that have two characters, then a dot, then two characters, then a dot with 2014.</p>

            Thanks for your answer, Geethu B,<br />
The main question is the driver problem USB Host controller 3.0, Typ Intel WiUSB. I've noticed that far too many people are having problems with wi-fi drivers and Windows 7 and 8. At 'system manager' - Device manager - USB-IF xHCI USB Host Controller shows
 a yellow '!'. Unter 'Eigenschaften' I see the error message: "Das Gerät funktioniert nicht ordnungsgemäß, da Windows die für das Gerät erforderlichen Treiber nicht laden kann. (Code 31)". A manual driver load doesn't work because Windows doesn't see the device,
 thus the error code 31.<br />
<br />
Problem with Kies &amp; Samsung Galaxy S: That is not my biggest problem. I uninstalled Kies and made a download with the actual Version 2.5.2.13021_10. Kies do not see the cell phone Galaxy S I9000. Nothing happens. A manual firmware update do not work. Kies refuses
 to recognize my cell phone.<br />

            <p>Please don't ask technical questions in the Feedback forum.&nbsp; That forum is for supplying feedback about the Microsoft Comunity web site.&nbsp; I moved your post to the Windows 7 "Performance and Maintenance" forum where backup questions are on-topic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether or not you can delete previous backups and still have viable backups in the remaining files depends entirely what backup program you use and how you have it configured, neither of which you've mentioned.&nbsp; You can configure backup programs to make
 full backups or incremental backups.&nbsp; If you make full backups, each backup is completely self-contained.&nbsp; If you make incremental backups, then a restore will require the most recent full backup plus all of the incremental backups since that full backup to
 reproduce the current state of the disk.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your prompt reply. Sorry&nbsp;I posted in the wrong place.&nbsp;It is often quite hard for the less technical among us to get it right! I have made a note of what you say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I simply back up by using the Windows 7&nbsp; backup, as I was advised to&nbsp;when my PC was set up for me. I&nbsp;have the schedule set to run monthly, do not know if it does full or incremental&nbsp; backups.
</p>
<p>Can you advise me how I can set it to make full backups.&nbsp; I assume if I did this, I could safely delete old ones when the external hard drive became too full?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have system backups separately on discs. </p>

<h3> gwizdjrg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pressing w minimizes active window</h2>
                    Has anyone seen an issue in Windows 10 Pro, where pressing w in a search bar in file explorer, Virtual DJ 8, or Serato DJ on a laptop, minimizes the active window and shows all windows and a vertical timeline? Pressing W (capital w) doesn't do this only
 lower-case w. CTRL-ALT-P seems to fix this, but I want to know why and if I can prevent this from occurring every time I boot up the laptop because it is destroying my DJ performances.

<p>Hi&nbsp;GwizdjRG,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The vertical timeline you're seeing is the Task View. Pressing <strong>Windows key + Tab</strong> is the shortcut for this. Can you tell me if you have apps currently running on your laptop when this issue occurs? It's highly possible that you have an app
 that is causing the shortcuts to mix up. With that in mind, I'd like to suggest starting up your laptop in a clean boot state. This state makes Windows run with minimal apps and if the issue doesn't occur, it means that there is an app causing the issue. Follow
 these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Sign in to the computer as an administrator.&nbsp;</li><li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and type <strong>msconfig</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>System Configuration</strong> from the search results.<br />
<br />
<span>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fmsegceporticoprodassets.blob.core.windows.net%2fasset-blobs%2f4013453_en_1" /></div>
</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong>Important</strong> If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend that you don’t use the System Configuration utility to change the advanced
 boot options on the computer unless a Microsoft support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">4. On the <strong>Services</strong> tab of the <strong>
System Configuration</strong> dialog box, tap or click to select the <strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong> check box, and then tap or click
<strong>Disable all</strong>.<br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">6. On the <strong>Startup</strong> tab in <strong>Task Manager</strong>, for each startup item, select the item and then click
<strong>Disable</strong>.<br />

<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">7. Close Task Manager.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">8. On the <strong>Startup</strong> tab of the <strong>
System Configuration</strong> dialog box, tap or click <strong>OK</strong>, and then restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue doesn't appear, try to remember if you have apps that alter shortcuts or any app you've recently installed prior to this issue happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To start Windows normally, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From <strong>Start</strong>, search for <span><strong>msconfig</strong>.&nbsp;</span></li><li>Select <span><strong>msconfig </strong></span>or <span><strong>System Configuration</strong></span> from the search results.</li><li>On the <strong>General</strong> tab, tap or click the <strong>Normal Startup</strong> option.</li><li>Click the <span><strong>Services </strong></span>tab, clear the check box beside
<span><strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong></span>, and then click <span><strong>Enable all</strong></span>.</li><li>Click the <span><strong>Startup </strong></span>tab, and then tap or click <span>
<strong>Open Task Manager</strong></span>.</li><li>In task manager, enable all of your startup programs, and then tap or click <span>
<strong>OK</strong></span>.</li><li>When you're prompted to restart the computer, tap or click <strong>Restart</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Update me if there are improvements.</p>

            <p>The pre-existing folders belong to your previous user account. Your new user account has to take possession of them. No problem - just follow the directions. Search the web for: takes possession of folders in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you come across directions for Windows 7 or 8, they will also work in Windows 10.</p>
