<h2>            Manual Changing Colour with Conditional Formatting</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I want to manually add a background colour, to a number of specific cells on a workbook that I have conditional formatting applied to currently the text colour.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is it possible to do both of these things. I don't want to set up another conditional format for the background colouring, I need to do this manually.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Your help is greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank You&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes it is possible to do both these things on the one conditional formatting rule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should be able to adjust the background colour of ther cells using the original conditional formatting rule that you have applied to the text. The steps below should help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Firstly you can do one of two things, </p>
<p>a) Highlight the cells with the Conditional Formatting applied to the text then click Conditional Formatting, then manage rules.</p>
<p>or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>b) Click on Conditional Formatting, then manage rules, then click the drop down menu at the top of this tab, select this worksheet, and then click&nbsp;once on whichever formatting you need to amend (if you have more than&nbsp;one Conditional Fornatting set that is).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. After doing either of the above click on 'Edit Rule' tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. A box will pop up showing what you've chosen to format and what formatting you've chosen. In this box there is a preview box showing you a preview of your formatting, next to this is a button labelled "Format", click this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. This will then bring up another box with four tabs "Number, Font, Border, Fill", click on the Font tab to adjust the font to your liking, i.e. which font, font&nbsp;style, font size, colour etc...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Once above done click on&nbsp;"Fill". Here you can choose what colour you want the&nbsp;cell background to go&nbsp;when the&nbsp;conditional format rule&nbsp;has been met.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Click Ok when ready, then&nbsp;click OK on the next box, you should be back at your Rules Manager box now, here you can either click Apply then OK, or just OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once all the above&nbsp;done, the&nbsp;background and font colour of your chosen cells will adjust itself to your Conditional Formatting Rule once it has been met.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steve.</p>

    <title>Office 2013 - Need to Activate WITHOUT creating MS Account&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gcs ltd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2013 - Need to Activate WITHOUT creating MS Account&#33;</h2>
                    We are a small business providing IT products and support for a number of small to medium businesses in our local area. Providing new PCs with MS Office has long been a big part of what we do. With Office 2013 OEM, it seems that activation requires creating
 a unique MS account for each installation with no obvious way around it.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is utterly stupid. Office is supposed to activate on HARDWARE - not an individual. Companies that have many computers and a high turnover of staff use the same computer for many different people. Linking Office to an individual's email account is
 a very bad idea - especially in a business environment where using personal email is not acceptable.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Creating a company-wide MS account to activate all the software seemed like a usable workaround; until MS informed us that each activation had to be with a unique account.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Add on to this the confusion that many people face when asked to create an MS account of their own and activate their software (things that are completely unfamiliar to many of our customers) and MS seem to have created a support nightmare for us front-line
 support engineers.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And what about re-installing Office in the future? If an MS account is created but only used for the Office Activation, surely it will expire after so long?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And what about customers that have no internet access? They do exist! How are they supposed to use the software?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>MS have tried to cut out their long-time sales partners by introducing and pushing subscription-based Office 365, which eliminates the profit we made from selling physical products with machines - and the latest Office OEM versions that we CAN sell have
 shot up in price to almost&nbsp;unsalable&nbsp;levels. Volume licensing is also not a solution for many businesses that simply do not have the cash flow to purchase large numbers of licenses at once. Customers also do not want to be tied in to subscription services
 for software that they are used to owning outright with no recurring costs.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We desperately need an easy solution to this - any suggestions appreciated. Or should I just start recommending OpenOffice to our customers now?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>Alex</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>EDIT 12/04/13:</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It is even worse than I thought originally. I have just been contacted by a customer complaining that they activated their new Office 2013 using the Administrator account before rolling the machine out to their user, only to find that Office then prompted
 the user to activate AGAIN when they logged on. it then refused to activate again, saying that it had already been activated!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is completely unacceptable. Some customers have a large turnover of staff using the same machine; most require at least a couple of different users. What are MS playing at?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

<div>We are in the exact same situation Alex and are looking for a solution as well. I spent (wasted) about 40 minutes tracking down user info to create a Microsoft account today, in order to active a PKC on one of our OEM systems installed with the 2013 OPK.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately I don't think this issue is getting enough attention - there are scattered posts about it in various online communities including this one, SpiceWorks, Technibble, and others with no real solution.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What is the proper solution for your smaller OEM partners Microsoft?</div>

            It would be better if you initiate the feedback using the official channels within your own organization.<br />
Your organization i am sure would have a better way of communicating directly with MS.<br />

            Same problem - MS Office 2013 installation for small businesses NOT a manageable task.&nbsp; I have spent more that 8 hours trying to get a copy of Office 2013 and Access 2013 installed an operational on a customer PC and I am still not finished.&nbsp; I cannot
 correct mistakes I made associating the software with an inappropriate MS account and support calls are basically telling me that is impossible.&nbsp; A better approach needs to be rolled out quickly or it will not be feasible for me to sell this product.

<p>I'm in the same boat.&nbsp; The best we've come up with is to not buy Office 2013, instead buy Offcie 2010 licencses, where ever we can.&nbsp; While begining to train our end user base on using OpenOffice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A freinf of mine&nbsp;sent 8 PC's out to the field to be setup on site by and indipendant setup / install agent.&nbsp; However he later&nbsp;learned that the agent used his own microsoft account to activate each license.&nbsp; In doing so he took ownership of the software.&nbsp;
 This was a very small business who really could not afford to blow all that money.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The agent can now deactivate and reactivate these license anyway he chooses.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Not a good idea to push people to open office.&nbsp; Will be a headache to manage for sure.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already went through that with 200+ users across 5 states and 13 offices.&nbsp; An absolute nightmare.</p>

<p>But then again it was easier than dealing with an Office 2013 install!!</p>

            <p>I work for a company who support SMEs and spent the best part of two hours trying to re-activate 2013 on a new PC yesterday. Thanks Microsoft!
</p>
<p>Not enough that the installation dies with the PC? Seems like a cynical marketing exercise to get everyone to sign up to MS.
</p>
<p>Also Outlook 2013 does not work with Exchange 2003 at a time when small companies can ill afford to upgrade. Once again, thanks.</p>

<h2>            Outlook Calendars have &#34;No Connection&#34; error message</h2>
                    Several people in our company when opening calendars are getting "No Connection" error messages. It was happening just one calendar at a time, now it seems that the people who were experiencing the issue are not able to access anyone's calendar. We are
 using the Outlook Desktop app, but have Microsoft 365 E1.

Outlook Web App</a> to see whether they can access calendar without any issue.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Try to troubleshoot those affect users issue via using different PC (<em>e.g. any non-problematic colleague’s PC</em>) to determine whether it is a client issue.<br />

    <title>BCM Database Corrupt - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fcusa online  say:</h3>
<h2>            BCM Database Corrupt</h2>
                    
<p><span>I am operating Vista on Dell Studio XPS with Office 2007 Small Business. Not even 1 1/2 years old - I use Contact Manager for our small business and launched Marketing Campaigns
 successfully 1-2 times a month during this time. Several days ago I tried to launch and received the above error.</span></p>
<p><span>I receive that error when launching Campaign Manager from the filter report (happens when choosing all contacts or selected contacts).&nbsp; I also tried from Publisher:&nbsp; when creating
 a new Publisher file (without including previous data for contacts), I receive the same error;&nbsp; when creating a new Publisher file including previous data or using a previous Publisher file, it allows me to launch the campaign, but will not allow me to change
 or filter the contact information - it is pulling contact information from 1 year ago (I can tell based on the number of contacts).</span></p>
<p><span>We have three users on this computer and only 1 user is affected (the one, of course, we use for our business).</span></p>
<p><span>I have located some suggestions and have tried some - nothing has changed.&nbsp; We have done the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li><span>I first tried a re-install of Outlook and there was also an error in the re-install (pre-installed by Dell) - location not found!! I have SP2 and am concerned about a full re-install
 as Microsoft no longer supports this if SP2 is not installed. I even used my product key at MS to locate the info and it tells me my input of the key was an invalid format and try again - I tried three times - I am quite sure I did input the key correctly.</span></li><li><span>I have created a new Outlook Profile - error still there</span></li><li><span>I deleted the registery key for the user - it did regenerate, however error still there</span></li><li><span>I have done a Restore close to the point of my last successful launch (which was Aug 21, 2010).&nbsp; There was not restore point to cover that date.&nbsp; I chose Sept 1 because there
 had been some MS updates mid month September and one was for Outlook 2003 which I thought was odd.&nbsp; Somewhat disappointed this update got through if it doesn't pertain to my software. - error still there</span></li><li><span>A couple of 'strange little things' occurred after the Restore - favicons on IE8 are all switched around - even sites that are not part of my history.&nbsp; I have my backup disconnected
 - I am not sure if I should undo the Restore or allow a backup to happen.</span></li><li><span><span>We have tried sharing the database with the unaffected Users and although the other Users do not have trouble with their own database, the error occurred with the
 Shared Database.<span>&nbsp; </span>So we believe now that the Database is corrupted.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></li></ol>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>We
 have now created a new User and all appears fine with Outlook and the new user.<span>&nbsp;</span>We are attempting to Export and Import the data into the new User and currently have not been successful with that.</span></p>
<p><span>I have tried defrag and check for errors in BCM but no errors show.&nbsp; All other aspects of the software appear to be working as usual - only launching
 a marketing campaign</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Creating&nbsp;a new Database within the affected user corrected the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For future reference, these were my steps:</p>
<p><span>For those of you having a similiar problem, here was my resolution:</span></p>
<p><span>I created a New Database within the affected user:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Business Contact Manager</span></li><li><span>Database Tools</span></li><li><span>Create or Select&nbsp;New Database</span></li></ol>
<p><span>With the new database created, I exported Business Contacts &amp; Accounts separately using the .csv option.&nbsp; (On previous attempts, the .bcm file did not work (probably because, for
 us, we narrowed down our problem to a corrupt database through a process of elimination).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I exported and imported in .csv format and most all fields populated.&nbsp; Had to import Business Contacts and Accounts separately.&nbsp; Unfortunately, each Business Contact is associated
 with (actually created from within) an Account - that connection did not import.&nbsp; The upside is at least the Business Contacts imported with their Category intact (something I painstakingly updated several months ago when I realized the benefits of pulling
 reports by that value - so glad I did).&nbsp; I tried launching from Publisher and again, all seems to be fine.&nbsp; The old database is still intact, so I'll print that report (hopefully it will print) and manually reassign the accounts.&nbsp; A month ago, I would have
 been annoyed about this extra task and today, I feel blessed - funny how that works!!</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps!</span></p>

    <title>Larger font size causes my page to print blank - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fantasyquill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Larger font size causes my page to print blank</h2>
                    <p>This is an odd problem that took me an hour to figure out what was happening, but I still don't know why.</p>
<p>I have a document with name badges, 10 per page, and have two images in each name badge and then a text box for their name. I used a downloaded Christmas Font and was adjusting the size depending on the name. Then, my page printed blank. I could see it in
 Print Preview, but the printed page was blank.</p>
<p>Also, I printed it to a PDF, which I could also see when opening the pdf, but it also printed blank.</p>
<p>So, to troubleshoot, other than reading online for about an hour with no success, I deleted all but one name badge, but it continued to print blank. I had also created envelopes with identical images and name font, so I tried printing that, and it WORKED.
 Then it occurred to me that the font size was smaller on my envelope, and SURE ENOUGH, when I decreased the font size on the name badge, it printed just fine! I played with it and discovered that if I go over 35 point on the font size, it prints blank. Sadly,
 I wanted to make some of these names a larger font, but I may not have that option.</p>
<p>Does anyone know WHY this would be happening?</p>

            Aha! I deleted the font I had downloaded from the page you cited and went to
<a href="http://www.dafont.com/search.php?q=kingthings+christmas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dafont.com/search.php?q=kingthings+christmas</a> instead. That's a site I trust for fonts, and in fact the download contained Kingthings Christmas 2.2 (evidently a later version) and
 an additional EULA text file as well as allfontsinfo.txt. This one does display properly for me in both Word and Publisher. Perhaps give that a try?

            Neither Word's translators nor Google's (which may well be the same) is adequate to translate a book. They're okay for rough-and-ready translations, but you can certainly test either by translating an English passage into a foreign language and then back.
 If you get gibberish (as you likely will), you'll understand why the job of translating a book should be given to a professional translator.

            I think Baron is trying to tell you to make sure that you have chosen a default web browser in your system settings. If the one you chose isn't working, try updating it or try choosing a different web browser.

 'Virus &amp; Spyware definitions couldn't be updated.&nbsp; Check Internet or network connection and try again'.&nbsp; There isn't a problem with my connection that I know of.&nbsp; How do I solve this problem?&nbsp; (My PC is using Windows Vista.)&nbsp; Many thanks.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Andria :</p>
<p>To reply with your email, here are the answers :</p>
<p>1. Are you referring to the Outlook Express ? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes and No. I'd like to use "window Live Mail" as my mail program but it has not been working for long time.</p>

<p>I did reply because the answer I received did not help me at all but have not heard since.
</p>
<p>I still have difficulty to send out email by " Window Live Mail 2011" with scanned PDF documents.&nbsp; I also tried to send email as attachments by change mail program to " Microsoft Outlook" mail but that does not work either.
</p>
<p>When I used window 7 (before change to window 10), I was able to sent email with scanned PDF files by using window Live Mail 2011 without any problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sending out email from "window live Mail 2011&nbsp; is not works at all and can't not make it works.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2003 Rules processing not being applied</h2>
                    
<div>
<div>Hi, folks<br />
<br />
I have just started using Outlook 2003. I use it to POP3 an account on our mail server (Mercury/32). The account only&nbsp;receives messages from one sender (generated by monitoring software).<br />
<br />
My problem is that although I have set up quite a few rules to separate messages into dedicated subfolders off a root folder, I have discovered that these rules are not being applied as I was expecting.<br />
<br />
The rules have been arranged so that certain rules are processed before others. These were created by copying and pasting unique text from the relevant message body to the rule. The last rule, which filters by sender address (which is the same for all received
 messages), places messages not affected by the previous&nbsp;rules&nbsp;in a catchall folder.<br />
<br />
The rules are applied to all incoming mail (Inbox). When I initially fire up Outlook and it imports new mail&nbsp;messages&nbsp;are sorted correctly (with one exception*). However, if the program is left open, quite a few messages will be placed in the catchall folder
 when they should have been moved by a rule to a different subfolder. It is as if&nbsp;the rules are being skipped. Messages are arriving all the time so this is not satisfactory.<br />
<br />
If I open the Rules and Alerts dialog and apply the rules to the catchall folder,&nbsp;messages are moved to the correct subfolders.<br />
<br />
I've had a look at the help, but it is incredibly basic and I cannot find anything useful.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any useful hints or tips on how I can resolve this, please?</div>
<div>* I have a rule that filters messages containing EventID: 20201, 20200 etc so they are moved to a subfolder. I also have a rule that filters messages containing EventID: 2020 to a different subfolder. The rule containing 2020 is located below the rule
 containing 20201 etc, otherwise messages containing 20200, 20201 are moved to the 2020 folder. Well... that's what I thought. However, all messages containing 2020 : 2020, 20200, 20201 are moved to the 2020 folder regardless.</div>
<div>As I mentioned above, if I apply the 20201 etc rule to the 2020 folder, the relevant messages are moved to the correct subfolder.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div>

<p>Are you getting the 2002* messages duplicated into two folders? If so,&nbsp;are you using Stop processing on the 2020* rules? If they only go into one folder, do the 2020* rules workif you use Run Rules now?</p>
<p>How often are you checking for new mail? Do it no more frequently than 8 - 10 min, longer is better. Under 5 min is too quick and can lock up the MAPI process.</p>

<p>Thank you for your replies.</p>
<p>I have changed the 2020* rules to include the stop processing rule.</p>
<p>With regards to the interval, this is not really acceptable. Before using Outlook 2003 for this I was using Pegasus Mail to filter messages and *never* had a problem either with the filtering, not having duplicate messages (yes,&nbsp;I've had those too in Outlook
 2003, though why is beyond me when the message is supposed to be moved),&nbsp;or the 1min interval send/receive&nbsp;settings.</p>
<p>The reason I switched over to Outlook 2003 is because the monitoring software developers&nbsp;have not formatted their Time: header correctly. This means that compliant mail clients such as Pegasus Mail display these messages in list view as being sent in 2000.
 This is no good for me. Similarly, one of the servers is quite old and the 2020 error requires instant attention. 10mins is too late.</p>
<p>So, because the monitoring software developers did not correctly configure outgoing email parameters I had to change clients. This is not really working out for me.</p>
<p>I'll persevere with the new settings changes&nbsp;and see how the filtering goes.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>Hello again</p>
<p>Many messages are still&nbsp;being dumped in the catchall folder without any apparent filtering, despite the rule that moves them to the catchall folder being the last in the list. This is now occurring when Outlook 2003&nbsp;is first started.</p>
<p>Thanks for the tip about preventing duplicate messages.</p>

<p>I have spent more time trying to configure this so that filtering works as it should than actually using Outlook 2003. I have had no luck at all.</p>
<p>Is there not a fix for this? There is something very wrong with the filtering mechanism in Outlook 2003.</p>

<h2>            Lumia Recovery Tool</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have a Lumia 650 and I want to flash It to a previous version. I've downloaded Lumia Recovery Tool and I've also installed the required package which was 1.87GB. After that my phone restarted, It displayed the Microsoft logo as usual but after some
 seconds it booted back again on Windows. It didn't enter flash mode as Recovery Tool shows "Switching to device to flashing mode". It kept restarting after this for some minutes and at the end Recovery Tool showed me Operation failed. I tried to reinstall
 Recovery Tool, formatted phone to factory default, disabled Firewall. Nothing changed. What could it be?</p>

                    I just updated my iMac operating system from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion.&nbsp; Now, when I work on Excel, the horizontal scroll bar ARROWS are grayed out AND are located all the way to the left. In addition the vertical scroll bar no longer has any arrows.&nbsp;
 How do I get them back, with the horizontal SCROLL bar arrows available and located to the right (not the left) and the vertical scroll bar arrows available. Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.<br />

            That has little or nothing to do with XL. It has to do with Apple removing scroll arrows from scroll bars in OSX Lion and Mountain Lion. (And the scroll bars to the left are for scrolling through Sheet Tabs if you have too many to display, not scrolling
 the active window.)
<div><br />
<div>There are haxies that will restore them &nbsp;in OSX Lion (you can Google them to see if they work in Mountain Lion - I've stopped needing them), but you can also use your keyboard's arrow keys for the smooth scrolling that the arrows used to provide.</div>

<div>That should have read:&nbsp; LTrim, RTrim, and Trim Functions</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Or you could look at the WorksheetFunction.Trim, but that will remove not only left and right leading/trailing spaces, but also multiple spaces within the string (change consecutive spaces into a single space).</div>

            I apologize for the late reply.&nbsp; This new Answers forum makes following my threads much more awkward than when it was accessible via a regular newsreader.&nbsp; But TPTB (MS) in their wisdom decided that was too easy, and removed the access, and also made notification
 of responses difficult.<br />
<br />
To Trim the contents of myCell:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myCell.value = Trim(myCell.text)<br />
<br />
To trim the contents of each cell in any particular worksheet you'll need to do a loop through the range you want to trim.&nbsp; For example:<br />
<br />
Dim c as Range<br />
Dim dst as worksheet<br />
&nbsp; Set dst = 'whatever<br />
for each c in dst.UsedRange<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.value = trim(c.text)<br />
next c<br />
<br />
You could certainly substitute a predetermined range for UsedRange.&nbsp; e.g.<br />
<br />
for each c in dst.Range("A1:A" &amp; LastRowDst)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; c.value = Trim(c.text)<br />
next c<br />

<h3> dorsey---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N95 Can&#39;t get it to connect to PC</h2>
                    
<p>Can anyone please suggest why my N95 will not connect to Nokia PC Suite - it has connected in the past, the cable is the correct one and the keypad is unlocked.&nbsp;&nbsp; I get as far as step 3 on the connection wizard but then nothing happens other than the picture
 of the cable trying to connect to the phone.&nbsp;&nbsp; I took all the Nokia programmes off and re-loaded them but made no difference and don't know where to go from here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I do get connected I am then hoping to sort out problem No 2 which is the camera isn't working and all I get is a blank screen with an oblong shap on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help much appreciated, thanks guys.</p>

<p>Problems connecting phone to pc are more often due to the pc rather than the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try removing pcsuite and reinstalling again. You can remove and clean your existing pcsuite installation using pcsuite cleaner which you can download using this

<p>Some say to change the automatic time zone update. Done, no change. It works sometime and not work often.</p>

    <title>VBA Save as HTML in PowerPoint 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> diego fachinotti  say:</h3>
<h2>            VBA Save as HTML in PowerPoint 2013</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have problem with the PowerPoint 2013 Presentation.SaveAs Method when setting&nbsp;<b>ppSaveAsHTML&nbsp;</b>for PpSaveAsFileType. I had a VBA macro that used to work fine in PowerPoint 2010 and that is not working&nbsp;any more. I have an error message stating:
<i>Saving as an HTML presentation is not supported in this version of PowerPoint.</i></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Although, it sounds like it is a normal behaviour, as I have read all across the Internet that this feature has been removed from PowerPoint 2013 because this feature wasn't popular.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However the PowerPoint 2013 API states it is still available. Here's the link&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff746389.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff746389.aspx</a>.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After doing a few tests, I noticed that a number of the PpSaveAsFileType options that are also listed in the 2013 API are not working&nbsp;any more&nbsp;either. Here's the list :</div>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>ppSaveAsHTMLv3</li><li>ppSaveAsHTML</li><li>ppSaveAsHTMLDual</li><li>ppSaveAsPowerPoint3</li><li>ppSaveAsPowerPoint4</li><li>ppSaveAsPowerPoint4FarEast</li><li>ppSaveAsPowerPoint7</li><li>ppSaveAsWebArchive</li></ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>So, does anyone know if it is the API that is wrong or if is the work still in progress and it is planned to add these features back in the future (or in the case of the HTML SaveAs methods if it is planned to replace them with an HTML5 SaveAs functionality,
 which would be great) ?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am wondering about this simply because a part of one of our product's process relies on the HTML SaveAs feature, and we will have to look for another solution if this is meant to be removed for good.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I hope someone can help me&nbsp;clarifying&nbsp;this.</div>
<div><br />

            I've had another look at the documentation page; &nbsp;it's trash.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>If you want to see what's available, go into the VBA IDE, press F2, type ppSaveAsJPG (or any of the other saveas types) into the search text box, then click on the resulting hit under Search Results. &nbsp;That'll open a list of current save as types.</div>
<div><br />
<div>At least 8 are mistakenly listed on the MSDN page, and another dozen or more that SHOULD be listed there are missing. &nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Unsupported Content Lumia 920</h2>
                    <p>My Lumia has been working great for years, no problem. Now suddenly I have multi problems:</p>
<p>1. When I save email photo attachments it says saved but they are no where to be found.
</p>
<p>2. When I try to share a photo instead of the photo attaching to messenger the tile just closes</p>
<p>3. When someone sends me a photo if I click on it to save it it says..."Unsupported Content. We don't currently support this type of media file.
</p>
<p>I tried a soft reboot no good. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Lumia 920 Windows Phone 8.1</p>

            <p>Hi Rick, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let's start working on this by checking if there's a pending phone software update. To check, just go to
<strong>Settings&gt;</strong> under <strong>System</strong>, tap <strong>Phone update&gt; Check for updates</strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is still not resolved after updating the phone software, the next workaround is to back up the phone and perform a hard reset. To hard reset the phone, just go to
<strong>Settings&gt;</strong> under <strong>System</strong>, tap <strong>About&gt; Reset your phone</strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Please create a backup before performing the hard reset as the phone memory will be wiped out. For creating a backup, click
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/11688/windows-phone-back-up-my-stuff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Back up your stuff</a></strong></em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>
