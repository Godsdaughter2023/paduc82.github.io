<h2>            How to get windows 10 key code</h2>
                    I recently purchased a tablet at a conference and was not given a box for this purchase, now the tablet is requiring that I update windows 10 and redownload but I do not have the box or the product key for my windows 10 that is already on this product.
 &nbsp;How do I find the product key for this tablet so that I can update the tablet and get this product to run properly? &nbsp;I know that there is someplace in settings that has the key like all the previous versions of windows do but windows 10 is new to me and I
 do not know where I need to go to find this product key. &nbsp;Can anyone help please?

<h2>            Kokology</h2>
                    <p><span><strong>When Is a Door Not a Door?</strong></span></p>
<p>It isn't every day that you have the time to take a leisurely stroll around the neighborhood: a stroll without purpose or destination, a chance to stretch the legs, let the mind wander, and get reacquainted with some
 old familiar sights. On your way, perhaps you'd stop in at a cozy coffee shop, explore the paths of a favorite park, or take the opportunity to do some window-shopping. Then there are those days when it's enough just to let your feet decide your course....</p>
<p>Picture yourself on a stroll through town. The day is beautiful and you're half-lost in a daydream. You turn onto a street that you've never been down before, and as you walk you pass a beautiful house set somewhat back
 from the street. Pausing a moment to admire this lovely home, you notice the door is half-open. Why is the door ajar?</p>
<p>1. The house is being burglarized.</p>
<p>2. The owner forgot to close it.</p>
<p>3. The owner is inside, sweeping out the entranceway.</p>
<p><span><strong>Key to "When Is a Door Not a Door?"</strong></span></p>
<p>Doors have a twofold significance: they may be passageways, but they can be barriers as well. In particular, the front door of a house represents its first line of defense, all that stands between its inhabitants and
 the uncertainties of the world outside. By imagining as open a door that should normally be closed, you envision a scenario of vulnerability and exposure. On a subconscious level, the reason you imagined for the door being open is linked to the ways that you
 leave yourself open and expose your own weaknesses to others.</p>
<p>1. The house is being burglarized.</p>
<p>You instantly assume the worst in any situation, and this trait is nowhere more evident than when things actually do go wrong. You never get flustered in a crisis, but only because you're much too busy panicking. So
 the next time disaster strikes, it's important to keep a clear head and remember to take a few deep breaths first and count to ten. Then you can faint.</p>
<p>2. The owner forgot to close it.</p>
<p>You aren't the type to get carried away in crisis situations. On the contrary, you're so relaxed that you may not notice a crisis is occurring at all. The mistakes you make are caused more by oversight than bad intentions,
 but the end results for you (and the people around you) are the same.</p>
<p>3. The owner is inside, sweeping out the entranceway.</p>
<p>You may appear to be a laid-back sort, but you never let your guard down. Achieving that constant state of relaxed alertness is what has made you into the mature individual you are. Of course, you still have your human
 weaknesses; you just don't put them on display for all the world to see.</p>

<p><span><strong>Postmarked: The Future</strong></span></p>
<p>Lounging around the house one Saturday afternoon, you are startled out of your reverie by the doorbell. When you open the door, you're greeted by a most unusual surprise -- a pair of animal messengers has come to deliver
 news of your life in the future! But when you open their messages, you see they contain very different predictions of what lies in store for you. One of the animals has brought a letter foretelling a life of happiness and contentment; the other prophesies
 only disaster and despair.</p>
<p>Which of the animals below brought glad tidings and which an omen of doom? (Pick a different animal for each.)</p>
<p>1. Tiger.</p>
<p>2. Dog.</p>
<p>3. Sheep.</p>
<p>4. Parrot.</p>
<p>5. Tortoise.</p>
<p><span><strong>Key to "Postmarked: The Future"</strong></span></p>
<p>For most people, the future is greatly influenced by their selection of a mate or life partner. The animal messengers in this scenario actually correspond to your own perceptions of the kinds of people likely to bring
 you joy and grief. Animals are rich and complex in psychological significance, with a range of positive and negative attributes and associations. In this scenario, the animal you chose as the bearer of the message of happiness represents the type of person
 you perceive as an ideal spouse, while the doomsayer animal is the type you fear would drag you down into the depths.</p>
<p>1. Tiger.</p>
<p><em>glad tidings:</em>&nbsp;You see yourself happiest with an ambitious and powerful mate, possessed of an indomitable will to rule.</p>
<p><em>gloom and doom:</em>&nbsp;You dread the prospect of a vain, tyrannical partner who struts around like a lord of the jungle and growls at any mention of sharing the housework.</p>
<p>2. Dog.</p>
<p><em>glad tidings:</em>&nbsp;Unquestioning loyalty and absolute devotion are the things you seek most in your mate.</p>
<p><em>gloom and doom:</em>&nbsp;You are utterly incompatible with those who try to please everyone and fret over what others might be thinking.</p>
<p>3. Sheep.</p>
<p><em>glad tidings:</em>&nbsp;You see the key to contentment in a warmhearted, nurturing spouse.</p>
<p><em>gloom and doom:</em>&nbsp;You fear winding up stuck with a boring homebody content to spend each day grazing the same old patch of grass.</p>
<p>4. Parrot.</p>
<p><em>glad tidings:</em>&nbsp;Nothing would suit you better than a talkative, fun-loving partner who knows how to make you laugh.</p>
<p><em>gloom and doom</em>: No one could suit you worse than a chattering layabout with a severe allergy to work.</p>
<p>5. Tortoise.</p>
<p><em>glad tidings:</em>&nbsp;Your match made in heaven is serious, dependable, and sure to be there in your hour of need.</p>
<p><em>gloom and doom:</em>&nbsp;The prospect of a lifetime spent with a frustratingly slow-moving, slow-witted partner is your worst nightmare.</p>

<p><span><strong>A Glazed Expression</strong></span></p>
<p>Arts and crafts class is almost a rite of passage in our society, a grueling test of the human spirit in which young initiates strive to force rubber cement, pipe cleaners, modeling clay, and papier-maché to bend to
 their will. And few of us can claim to have managed to avoid the experience of creating an object -- be it ceramic mask, napkin holder, or the obligatory ashtray -- only to be confronted by an empty expanse demanding that you do something,&nbsp;<em>anything,</em>&nbsp;to
 decorate it.</p>
<p>A plain white coffee mug of your own design sits ready for the kiln and is staring at you in blank anticipation. You have chosen to use blue glaze; now, if only you could decide on the pattern....</p>
<p>Which of the following patterns do you paint in blue on the mug?</p>
<p>1. Stripes.</p>
<p>2. Polka dots.</p>
<p>3. Checks.</p>
<p>4. Wavy lines.</p>
<p><span><strong>Key to "A Glazed Expression"</strong></span></p>
<p>Blue is the color most deeply associated with the inner workings of the mind, from imagination to intuition to intellect. The white surface of your coffee mug provides a blank slate and gives your mind free rein to express
 itself in the most comfortable, natural way. In this sense, the pattern you selected reflects the structure and strengths of your mind in its approach to creativity and problem solving.</p>
<p>1. Stripes.</p>
<p>You favor a direct and clear-cut approach, making you a keen decision maker able to resolve problems and put plans into action instantly. It's only natural that people perceive you as a leader and pillar of strength
 in difficult times.</p>
<p>2. Polka dots.</p>
<p>Your strength lies in the adaptive, artistic nature of your mind. This may make you appear to be a little offbeat, perhaps even eccentric to some, but you make a real contribution to the world as a creator with a unique
 vision.</p>
<p>3. Checks.</p>
<p>You excel at mastering the demands of the everyday, but in no way does that make you average or ordinary. Few people are able to organize their lives with such quiet efficiency. And the result of your efforts is that
 you always seem to have the time, wealth, and compassion to share with those in need.</p>
<p>4. Wavy lines.</p>
<p>Your gift is in generating an atmosphere in which it's easy and comfortable to feel and express love. It's not that you crave attention or affection, but people just naturally feel good about taking care of and supporting
 you. And all that goodwill has a ripple effect, touching the lives of those around you in subtle ways. Ask the people who know and love you -- the world is a better place for your being in it.</p>

<p><span><strong>Wave After Wave</strong></span></p>
<p>Perhaps it's because we instinctively trace the roots of life back to the oceans, perhaps it's something hardwired deep within our brains; whatever the reason may be, the sea holds a special power over us. The tang of
 the salt air, the fine spray of the surf, the soft crashing of the waves -- the net effect is to stimulate and soothe. Sometimes a stroll along a sandy beach can transport you much further from your everyday reality than the actual distance you walk. That
 may be why the sea holds a special place in lovers' hearts. It provides them with the chance to journey together, if only for a brief time, into another world.</p>
<p>1. You are walking along a quiet beach. As you wander the dunes, you spot a surfboard washed up on the sand. Describe the surfboard and the impression it makes on you.</p>
<p>2. You climb onto the board and paddle out to try your luck on the waves. How are the conditions for surfing today?</p>
<p>3. You have managed to get to your feet and are experiencing the thrill of actually riding the wave, when suddenly you wipe out and tumble headfirst into the water. What do you think, feel, or try to scream as you struggle
 to find your way back to the surface?</p>
<p>4. You finally emerge from the water unscathed, and looking back toward the beach, you see that a person you know has been watching you. Who is that person?</p>
<p><span><strong>Key to "Wave After Wave"</strong></span></p>
<p>Most of us sense intuitively the strong psychological associations between the sea and sex. The way you imagined your experience on the waves tells us something about your expectations and desires in the sexual realm.</p>
<p>1. Throughout history and across cultures, the sea is portrayed as feminine. Against that backdrop, the surfboard provides an overt example of what Freud referred to as a "phallic symbol." Women: Your description of
 the surfboard corresponds with your image and impression of masculine sexual characteristics. Men: Your answer shows your perception of your own physical sexuality.</p>
<p>"It's just like every other surfboard out there. You've seen one, you've seen 'em all." Either you haven't seen enough surfboards, or you've seen far too many.</p>
<p>"It's a monster wooden longboard, freshly waxed and gleaming, with a red stripe up the middle." Thanks for sharing, but that's just a little more than any of us wanted to know.</p>
<p>"A sad-looking, beaten-up old board that nobody wants anymore." Don't rush to judgment. Who knows? A little wax, a little buffing, and that old board might look as good as new.</p>
<p>2. The surfing conditions you described reveal your own hopes and expectations from sex.</p>
<p>"The water is warm and inviting. Wave after wave breaks softly on the beach." That's enough to put anyone in the mood.</p>
<p>"The water's a little chilly, and there's not a wave in sight." Don't worry, there will be other days, other chances. Maybe today you can just snuggle up in a beach blanket.</p>
<p>"Towering surf! A fifty-foot tsunami! Cowabunga, baby!!!" Down, boy! Heel!</p>
<p>3. Total submersion within the churning waters is a metaphor for the peak of sexual pleasure. Your thoughts and feelings as you struggled upward correspond to those you experience in the throes of ecstasy.</p>
<p>"Oh, damn -- I almost made it that time! I was so close!" I take it you were expecting something more from the experience?</p>
<p>"Help! Somebody please help me! I can't breathe!" Hopefully somebody around here knows mouth-to-mouth.</p>
<p>"Hey, this isn't so bad. I think I'll just stay down here and have a swim around until the wave passes." Don't get too comfortable down there. You're going to have to come up for air&nbsp;<em>sometime.</em></p>
<p>4. The person you pictured standing on the beach is someone you show intense interest in, in a sexual sense. This doesn't necessarily indicate active sexual desire; it may be that you're simply curious about what that
 person is like in the most intimate and unguarded of moments. Then again maybe, just maybe, that's something you want to find out firsthand.</p>
<p>Was the person you named your current lover or a secret love interest? That shouldn't be too hard to accept. But then there are always those who name a member of the same sex, a cousin, their dentist....Don't worry,
 your secrets are safe with us.</p>

<p><span><strong>Building a New Tomorrow</strong></span></p>
<p>The clock struck twelve, the ball dropped in Times Square, and the sound of champagne corks popping was heard around the globe. And after all the buildup, hoopla, and hype, after the apocalyptic anxieties and eager anticipation,
 the world somehow managed to find its way safely into the new millennium. Looking back, we can see that the prophecies of doom were overblown and the Y2K bug seems like little more than a ploy to sell system upgrades. But we, the last children of the twentieth
 century, all shared for a moment that sense of newness and opportunity -- the chance to make a world better than the one we inherited and create a legacy to share with our children and theirs over the next thousand years.</p>
<p>1. You are working for an urban planning corporation and have been assigned to the community development team for a major new millennium project. You have been asked to come up with an inspirational theme for the city.
 What theme do you propose?</p>
<p>2. The project team has a number of members, each with a certain set of experiences and skills. Why do you think you were selected to participate in this project? (Give as many reasons as you like.)</p>
<p>3. What kind of person is the project manager? Describe his or her personality and qualities as a leader.</p>
<p><span><strong>Key to "Building a New Tomorrow"</strong></span></p>
<p>Towns and cities are natural symbols of social life. Most of the cities we are familiar with sprang up unplanned and spread outward and upward in a seemingly random fashion. But this scenario asks you to deliberately
 plan a city for the future, giving your mind the chance to express its vision of an ideal setting for human interaction. Your answers reveal your approach and feelings about the social world around you.</p>
<p>1. The theme you selected for the new city is something you feel is absolutely essential to your own happiness as a member of society. And for most people, that means the very thing they sense is most sorely lacking
 in their environment at present.</p>
<p>Was your theme something ideal, like "harmony," "peace," or "Mother Nature"? We all feel the need for more of those these days. Or did you pick something along the lines of a cartoon fantasy world where everyone smiles
 all the time and the sun is always shining? That may actually be an easier goal to achieve, but you're facing some strong competition in Orlando, Anaheim, and Tokyo.</p>
<p>2. The reasons you gave for being picked for the team are strengths you see in yourself that no one else recognizes. That may be because those "strengths" are not quite as strong as you might like to think. The people
 around you are the most objective judges of your potential. Don't be afraid to listen to what others have to say about your abilities -- their evaluations can steer you away from the dead-end streets of overconfidence and self-deception.</p>
<p>3. The team manager reveals your own image of yourself in the future. Do you see yourself developing into a supportive, motivated, and inspirational leader, or a harsh and unreasonable slave driver? If it's the latter,
 you may want to start reconsidering the particular path to personal development you're currently heading down. Even Scrooge got the chance to repent.</p>

<h2>            Intermittent screen shudder Surface Pro 4</h2>
                    <p>Since yesterday 24/10/17 my Surface Pro 4 is experiencing intermittent screen shuddering.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Not a connection issue</span></li><li><span>Not damaged through dropping or other</span></li><li><span>Happens every few minutes (intermittent - sometimes 2 min sometimes more)
</span></li><li><span>Seems to be when screen / keyboard are idle</span></li><li><span>Stops if screen is tapped or typing commenced</span></li><li><span>Advice to "return to the Microsoft store" is unhelpful for the thousands who have purchased a Microsoft computer but live outside the US or other locations
 where there are Microsoft stores</span></li><li><span>Mine was purchased 5/2/16 - is this still under warranty or is there a downloadable fix please?</span></li></ol>

    <title>Cant connect to wifi after 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tyguy19  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cant connect to wifi after 8.1</h2>
                    Ive recently updated my Gateway NV52L23u laptop to 8.1, and I cant hold a wifi connection for longer than 10 minutes before it drops to limited. Ive tried updating my drivers from the Gateway site but that doesnt fix the issue. My dad owns a Gateway as
 well, did the update, and it works fine. He didnt have to update his drivers or anything. And I know it has nothing to do with the router, because everything else in our house holds wifi just fine. Any suggestions?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Be sure to check for updates to the router firmware since that can have a definite
<br />
effect&nbsp;on Windows 8.1 connections even though other OS&nbsp;systems connections are <br />
fine.</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It is possible that the drivers you are using, even if the latest now available, are not<br />
100% Windows 8.1 compliant. Check with your System Maker's Support (Motherboard<br />
Maker for custom systems) and/or the actual device maker. The latter, such as Intel,<br />
RealTek, Atheros and others may have newer versions not available at the System/Mother<br />
-board Maker's site. And continue to check with them regularly over the next year +.
<br />
Also update the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate
<br />
device drivers.<br />
<br />
Get your apps and devices working in Windows 8.1<br />

Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible<br />
solution?&nbsp;And I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers. How far are <br />
you positioned from the router? Are there obstructions in the way?<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver and clearing the network logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click <br />
on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version - click Update Driver (may not do<br />
anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi<br />
Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated <br />
drivers as Windows&nbsp;8&nbsp;loves updated drivers.<br />
<br />

Make sure you know the login details for your wireless router - SSID and Password.<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Have you tried checking for drivers at the actual device maker's site such as Intel, RealTek<br />
or whoever made your WiFi Device? Did you check you router maker's site for firmware</p>
<p>updates? Are you using 3rd party antivirus/security programs?<br />
<br />
Check with Gateway Support for known issues.<br />
<br />
Consider a Refresh and even a Reset they re-apply the latest available drivers if needed.<br />
<br />
Windows 8/8.1 includes special methods to Refresh (keep files and settings)&nbsp;&nbsp;or a&nbsp;Reset
<br />
(new install removing all).<br />

            <p>Check Control Panel - Device Manager for your WiFi device - under network section.<br />
Double Click in it - Driver's tab - find your device version and look for it at Atheros.<br />
<br />
If needed check at Gateway where they usually include the Device version in their<br />
driver download information. And/or ask Gateway Support.<br />
<br />
There is a plethora of driver information in my first reply above.<br />

            <p>I've had nearly the exact same issue which has forced me to go back to Windows 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I installed 8.1&nbsp; on my desktop, my NetGear 802.11ac stopped responding completely. Using generic drivers from&nbsp;Windows, it will initialize work for 5 - 30 seconds and
 freeze up.&nbsp; I have to completely detached the device from&nbsp;my computer to get it working again and it only works for a brief second.&nbsp; Updated drivers from NetGear only cause the adapter to freeze.<br />
My Laptop is an ASUS i7 4500 series touch.&nbsp; When I updated it, the wifi will be stable for 2-10 minutes unless Skype is active and then, even though I lose internet connection, I don't drop the Skype call, leading me to believe the OS is not reading the status
 right and it prevents IE from connecting.</p>
<p>The Desktop is:</p>
<p>Gigabyte 990FXA&nbsp;Main Board<br />
AMD FX8150 </p>
<p>NetGear 802.11ac </p>
<p>Radeon HD6870</p>
<p>It's frustrating because I rather like the new features of 8.1, but it is way too buggy to use and lacks basic support for common core components.&nbsp; The only thing is, at least with the laptop, I know the wifi is working because live streaming is still possible,
 but opening IE often yields the Fix Connection&nbsp;screen and no internet.&nbsp; If I click on Fix Connection, I lose Skype, if I don't I can continue talking.&nbsp; And it will lose connection no matter what&nbsp;or&nbsp;if nothing else is running.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Stay tuned as the various WiFi device makers are beginning to come out with 8.1 compliant<br />
drivers. Bugging them to do so actually help.<br />

<h2>            FatMond is Better than you&#59; Deal with it.</h2>
                    
<p>So I was just playing Lips with my friend Wayne and I got 2.7 million on "Country Roads" by John Denver.
<br />
<br />
Basically, I'm better than all of you lot at not just games in general but specifically singing. I always get people asking me if I'm Justing Timbrelake when I'm up the pub and it has kept me warm at some cold evenings.<br />
<br />
So, in the spirit of a bit of bringing some camaraderie back to this forumz, my challenge is thus; Beat me on a Lips song.<br />
<br />
Seems simple right? It isn't though, that's the thing. I'm amazing. I make Cher look like a Womble. I'm like Pavarotti if he hadn't gone all hamburgeler.<br />
<br />
I only have the "Number 1 Hits" disc but I swear this to thee Xbix forum; I will download specific songs if you think you have a chance against me.<br />
<br />
But you do not.<br />
<br />
There is no shame in this, this is a good thread.<br />
<br />
Come at me, OXF [Thumbsup]</p>

<h2>            keep getting disconnected from xbox live&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I seem to get about 20 odd minutes out of a connection to live while playing online black ops. Nothing wrong with my internet connection, it's still humming along..... anyone else experience this or have any hints. Just recently downloaded the map pack so
 wondering if that has somethign to do with it??? Cheers</p>

<p>i have this too, every 10-20 mins im disconnected again, when i run a test it connects fine. used to have this with my old xbox and i figured it was just the wireless usb over heating, so i let it cool down and it worked. i have the new slim now so thats
 obviously not an option. my xbox has plenty ventilation, and my internet is running fine, pc and phone still connected, just xbox keeps doing that :(</p>

<p>Same here guys and three of my friends to but dont bother telling xbox they will just blame your router or internet instead of fixing there problem like maybe there was something wrong with the new update. If the new update would brick consoles then what
 else would it do. And they cant seem to answer a question of mine is if it is my internet and router then why does it only do it on certain games. Hmmmmmmmmm. &nbsp;Also I find it amazing how I got a Ps3 and it does not do it at all on it. Hmmmmmmmm. And its amazing
 how It did not do it for 7 months on same set up until I downloaded that stupid update.Hmmmmmmmm . &nbsp;Didnt they mention that there was security features in the new update. Maybe its doing it to people who has changed or upgraded there hard drives. ALSO BIGGEST
 QUESTION OF ALL WHY WOULD IT DO IT IF IT IS PEOPLES INTERNET AND ROUTER IF WE ARE JUST WATCHING A FRICKIN MOVIE. IT DONT EVEN USE INTERNET WHEN WATCHING A DVD . HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM. &nbsp;SORRY JUST VENTING.</p>

<h2>            Mail, calendar and people in 8.1</h2>
                    I now have an "x" in the lower right corner of my mail, calendar and people tiles. &nbsp;The message shown is "This app can't open. &nbsp;Check Windows store for more info about Mail. &nbsp;After hitting the repair in the store, it is showing it was updated. &nbsp;I still
 cannot get into my mail. &nbsp;I also tried to restore, that did not work either. &nbsp;What can I do next?

            <p>Hi Melissa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are unable to access your mail app, it could happen due to the broken files in the app, so I would suggest you to follow the Methods mentioned below&nbsp;and check if that helps:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to run the troubleshooter and check if it helps.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app</a>&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Uninstall and reinstall the apps.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To uninstall the app follow the below steps:</strong></p>
<p>a.&nbsp;In the Metro Start screen, scroll through the apps until you find the one that you wish to uninstall.
<br />
b.&nbsp;When you find the App that you wish to uninstall, right-click on it with your mouse and new dialog panel will open as shown in the image below.<br />
c.&nbsp;Once you right-click on an App you will see options that are specific to the particular app. For this App, we have the option to uninstall the App.<br />
d.&nbsp;Click on the Uninstall button. <br />
e.&nbsp;You will then be presented with a confirmation as to whether or not you wish to remove the App.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To install the app follow the below steps:</strong></p>
<p>a. When you go into the Windows store, right click on any of the tiles listed and you will be able to see a menu drop down from the top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. Click on “Your apps” in the top left corner. Once you switch the view, you will see a narrowed down and sortable list with just the apps you have installed in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Next, you just click on the apps that you want to install. Once you have selected the apps ,click the install button.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>d. As soon as you hit the install button the screen flips back to the Store but in the top right hand cover you will see a little notification letting you see how many apps are left to install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>e. Finally, when you flip back to the Windows 8 Start Screen you will see your new apps start to show up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further assistance post back we will be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>I tried the troubleshooting first. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Hardware changes might not have been detected. &nbsp; Detected</p>
<p>Windows Store configuration may be damaged &nbsp; &nbsp; Detected&nbsp;</p>
<p>Display adapter drivers may be out of date. &nbsp; Detected</p>
<p>Windows store cache may be damaged. &nbsp;Detected</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above are messages I received after several times of trying the troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I uninstalled and reinstalled the Mail, Calendar and Peope contact, still no luck. &nbsp;Still showing it needs repaved and it does not repair through the store. The tiles still have an "x" in the bottom right. &nbsp;I went into safe mode and ran virus scan. &nbsp;I am
 pretty computer illiterate, but have tried everything I possibly can.....your help is greatly appreciated! &nbsp;It is frustrating. &nbsp;Thank you.</p>

            <p>Like millions of others, I still prefer to use Eudora7.1.0.9 as my default mail program However, I am unable to add this to&nbsp; the default program list. Microsoft failed to make that possible to allow adding any program, giving preference to its own. That
 intolerable!</p>
<p>Why can there not be a simple {Add a program to the list]. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also note that when all the programs on the desktop are listed, Eudora is left out .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to a very recent changeover from Windows XP to8.1, I wish I were back in XP, where I controlled my PC, not Microsoft.</p>

            <p>I got rid of the tiles in the Start Menu ASAP and have&nbsp; [www.classicshell.com] installed which gives you a XP type list of the Start menu. Microsoft needs to learn and pay attention to what its USERS want, not what their designers dream up as improvements
 which makes their OS less useful. The worst is their attempt to exclude 3rd party programs which are necessary to supersede their misbegotten ones. I got a long list of problems with 8.1 like the popping up of the ["no app for is installed to open this..."]
 appearing right on top of the opened file. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to the Microsoft Answer Desk with 5 questions: Result?&nbsp; 0/5.</p>
<p>Then I went to the Genius Bar at the Apple Store for my iMac for one question - fixed directly.</p>

                    All of a sudden my SP3 decided it couldn't find any wifi networks anywhere. &nbsp;I have tried every fix I can find on the internet and even reinstalled Windows 10 and nothing has worked. &nbsp;I am about done with Windows 10. &nbsp;It has been nothing but problems and
 none have had easy fixes. &nbsp;SP3s are too expensive to be dealing with this crap consistently.&nbsp;

            <div>So I've tried all the trouble shooting offered on your website. &nbsp;</div>
<div>I am trying to do the recovery and bring it back to Windows 8.1 but that is more difficult than it should be. &nbsp;Downloaded that zip file in less than an hour on my husband's Sony Vaio but on my SP3
 it's at 3% and 7 hours left. So, I tried to open the file on my his laptop but it won't open. &nbsp;So we decided to move the whole thing to my thumb drive transfer it to my downloads folder on my SP3 but still won't open and now my thumb drive is recognized as
 a disk drive.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>So, finally was able to successfully install Windows 8.1 on my SP3 and found it still cannot find a wifi network. &nbsp;My computer guru friend and uncle both said that with all that troubleshooting done the only culprit left is the wifi chip.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How much does that cost?</p>

            <div>1. Microsoft won't replace the wifi "chip". if your Surface is out of warranty,</div>
<div>they will charge you $29 to speak to support and around $450 US to swap for a</div>

<div>still do not have wifi and the Marvel wireless network adapter AND the bluetooth</div>
<div>Marvell adapter are missing in device manager, then it definitely is a hardware</div>

    <title>Setup a wireless printer to work as a &#34;standalone printer&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chuckwilliamswk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Setup a wireless printer to work as a &#34;standalone printer&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a wireless printer; I cannot get it to be recognized&nbsp;by my Personal Computer (generic, I built myself and upgraded from win7 to win10).
<strong>I cannot see the "wireless icon" in the tool tray</strong>, bottom right of my computer.&nbsp;I cannot find that my computer is connected to my router.&nbsp;Now, I know my router works and has been for a year or so and all my family electronics (cellphones, laptops,
 kindles) can connect&nbsp;accordingly.&nbsp; I have setup the new wireless printer as a stand-alone and have satisfactorily connected/printed with everything except my&nbsp;personal computer.</p>
<p>I guess my primary question is: How do I add Wi-Fi to my "network &amp; internet" settings? I&nbsp;tried to add a "wireless router or access point" to no avail.&nbsp; It says the router may&nbsp;take 90 sec. to show; however, it never did.&nbsp;And, I don't even know&nbsp;that this
 step is what I need to do.</p>
<p>BTW, I'm sure someone else has had this problem, somewhere. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.&nbsp; My computer works great except for the occasional "Start Button"&nbsp;problem; it disappears every now and then, but always so far, comes back. This is annoying and frustrating; my computer has to be restarted several times or more and then it shows up.&nbsp;
 I wonder if there is a fix for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks ahead of time MS community</p>
<p>"Chuck"</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If you are trying to print in Edge Browser use CTRL + P or click the little 3 dots in<br />
the top right corner (under the "X" then - Print).<br />
<br />
As OEM&nbsp;the Printer Maker is responsible for the proper operation of the printer <br />
and their&nbsp;supplied drivers. Check with&nbsp;the Printer Maker's&nbsp;Support, their on-line
<br />
documentation and&nbsp;drivers, and ask in their forums.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver.<br />

    <title>No access, no domain controller, missing drive partition, and no - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> albertbeaupre  say:</h3>
<h2>            No access, no domain controller, missing drive partition, and no ability to restore system.</h2>
                    <div>Here is a some of the problems I have:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
* I cannot install any kind of programs<br />
* I cannot delete, edit, modify, or move any files<br />
* I cannot change permissions of folders/files&nbsp;<br />
* I cannot change account types/permissions&nbsp;<br />
* I cannot restore, refresh, or reset my computer&nbsp;<br />
* I cannot use the windows command line to change anything&nbsp;<br />
* I don't have an Active Directory or a program to change the domain controller&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am an administrator with a standard type account, but it will not allow me to change to administrator type. I have tried making and using another administrator account to do all of those things, but I am still blocked from everything.<br />
<br />
The problems from above are all from my experience of use. I don't have a CD/DRIVE slot to insert a disc, but I do have a reset (clean install) option to re-format the hard drive, but I cannot use it. When I try to re-format my hard drive, it says I'm missing
 a windows drive partition.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When I try installing new programs or deleting files, I get the same message: "Access is denied".&nbsp;<br />
When I try using the windows command line, I get one of the two messages (depending on the command): "Access is denied" or "This command can be used only on a Windows Domain Controller".&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Here are my computer specs:&nbsp;<br />
Windows 8.1 ASUS Laptop<br />
Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-2365M CPU @ 1.40GHZ&nbsp;<br />
Installed memory (RAM): 4.00 GB (3.89 GB usable)&nbsp;<br />
System type: 64-bit Operating Syste, x64-based processor&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I believe I need a completely professional computer/software expert to help me out with this problem.</div>
Additional Details
<div>This all happened after I was editing the security of the C:/ drive. All I did was change the owner of the C:/ drive, and when I changed it back, this all happened.</div>

<p>To change ownership without locking yourself out of the machine, you need to change a registry key.

            <p>The registry key only changes the name of the registered owner. If you right click the Start button and go to Run,&nbsp; type:
<strong>winver </strong>and click OK, you should now see your name as the registered owner.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This doesn't however affect file permissions. By assigning the root (C:) to the Everyone group,&nbsp; you've effectively given your co-users authority to change access permissions. This means any one of them could have changed permissions for you as well by removing
 your administrative rights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But hang around and hopefully someone else may be able to provide you with a solution.</p>

    <title>Alt key is acting like it&#39;s being repeatedly pressed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Alt key is acting like it&#39;s being repeatedly pressed</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have an issue that just started popping up after I installed the latest update, I do not know if it's related, but my Alt key starts to act like someone is pressing it repeatedly. It's not steady or continuous, but it is persistant and I can't actually
 find a way to stop it. I pulled up the onscreen keyboard and it seemed like it stopped for a bit. That was this morning, this evening it's back to the usual behaviour and I can see both Alt keys flashing on and off. It was extremely noticeable in firefox where
 the alt key hides and shows the top menues. I have done a few virus and malware scans and even windows own scans and error checking and nothing is being found. I deleted the drivers for the keyboard and mouse and didn't find that this helped at all. Anyone
 have any idea what could be causing this and what might fix it? Doing a clean reformat isn't an option at the moment, but obviously I'll do it if needed, but I'd like that to be a last resort.</p>

            Ok so basically I wanted to reset my computer to get more space because it was cluttered with junk I reset the computer but when I attempted to connect to the internet there were no option to connect and the menu that popped up just had the option to go
 to airplane mode. I poked around and tried scanning my computer in cmd and kept checking to see if the wlan selection in services would show anything other than stopping I tried to set it to start it wouldnt work so I came here and posted my question. Also
 mostly unrelated and not a priority but I reset my computer and my storage only showed 71 gigabytes free of 237 even when I reset my computer so I dont know maybe I did it wrong.

<h2>            Reverting back to Windows 7 from Windows 10</h2>
                    I had numerous problems when upgraded to Windows 10 and after remote help from a Windows Technician they suggested I go back to Windows 7. The main problem was that the settings button would not work, so I was given instructions to press control + alt+
 delete. Click on the power button and then holding down the shift key press restart. Choose advanced options and then select go back to previous build. I now have a screen up with "Go back to previous build" at the top and restarting with the busy circle below.
 The circle has now been going round for an hour and a half. How long will it take or am I stuck in a loop. Anyone know

    <title>Windows Administrative Templates - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Administrative Templates</h2>
                    <p>I have a very specific question regarding importing administrative templates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 Home (1607) and have installed the Group Policy Editor on the grounds it's much easier than finding the registry keys, and it's also easier to reverse changes. My computer, my rules, my risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gpedit.msc obviously didn't come with Administrative Templates, so my question is:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I import the ADMX templates (for 1607) into gpedit, will they overwrite my existing settings, or will they just sit there waiting to be set as required?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            Hi Jo-anne
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You will receive the calls on all devices where you have signed in to Skype using same login ID and password through which you have purchased. So, if you have logged in on a computer, phone and tablet, you will receive the calls on all 3 devices simultaneously.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

    <title>How to factory reset an old PC running windows XP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iacopo olivo  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to factory reset an old PC running windows XP</h2>
                    <p>Goodmorning,</p>
<p>I have a nearly 10 years old assembled PC running Windows XP.</p>
<p>I'd like to roll back the operating system to its factory state, in order to give it as a gift but I can't format it, since:</p>
<p>-I don't remember the hardware that is inside the machine and thus I am not able to reinstall the drivers once I formatted it</p>
<p>-I don't own the Activation key anymore (the machine of course is regularly activated)</p>
<p>Do you know a procedure I can use? I am particularly concerned about not loosing the actual drivers, since I had bad experiences with old PCs.</p>
<p>Thank you for the Help!</p>
<p>Iacopo</p>

            <p>One needs the xp installation cd to perform such..Or any windows OS install cd (2000.98) boot to cd,</p>
<p>format the HD,once its thru,install xp cd.Either way,10 yr old pc would only be compatable to Win XP,</p>
<p>or maybe VISTA,both are out-dated..</p>
<p>Best bet,locate a electronics recycle firm,this way at least the usable prts get recycled.For more info,try:</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply!</p>
<p>The main problem is that I can't format the machine. I can't find anymore the driver for the components that are actually inside the computer.</p>
<p>And also I would prefer not to trash it, it is not a solution to my problem :)</p>

            Create a backup of the whole hard drive. After that, format it. Than using the backup you can load the drivers. If it does not work (only rare case have I had this happen), than you can restore the backup full and will have to try another option.<br />

    <title>DCOM Error Locking Machine - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            DCOM Error Locking Machine</h2>
                    <p>My computer occasionally locks up (does not freeze totally, but the mouse moves so slowly and erratically that it is impossible to control). I end up having to hard shut down every time this happens. When I check the event logs, there are a massive number
 of DCOM errors (multiple per second). They all show the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The application-specific permission settings do not grant Local Activation permission for the COM Server application with CLSID&nbsp;<br />
{53362C32-A296-4F2D-A2F8-FD984D08340B}<br />
&nbsp;and APPID&nbsp;<br />
{53362C32-A296-4F2D-A2F8-FD984D08340B}<br />
&nbsp;to the user DOMAIN\USERNAME (S-1-5-21-451499621-1745117657-844659100-1211) from address LocalHost (Using LRPC) running in the application container Unavailable SID (Unavailable). This security permission can be modified using the Component Services administrative
 tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have determined that the CLSID refers to RemoteProxyFactory32 Class in Component Services. However, there are TWO of these in Component Services. One of them I can edit security permissions for, the other I cannot. I have edited permissions in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{53362C64-A296-4F2D-A2F8-FD984D08340B}
 so that my user is owner and has full permissions.<br />
</p>
<p>I need to know how to either remove one of the entries in DCOM Config or otherwise resolve the DCOM error so I can confirm whether this is the issue or not.&nbsp;</p>

<p>OK I had this same problem on a terminal server.&nbsp; &nbsp;Outlook 2013 AND 2016 were generating the same problems.&nbsp; &nbsp;Lockup on one user caused the whole thing to need to have to be rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that there are two keys, but they're different in the fact that one's related to 32 bit and the other 64.&nbsp; &nbsp;Mine was bombing on the 32 bit key.&nbsp; &nbsp;I deleted both keys.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not a problem since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What gives here ?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
