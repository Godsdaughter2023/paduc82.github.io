<h2>            Adding Office 365 Shared Mailbox in Mac Mail</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying to figure out how I can monitor a shared mailbox that is setup within our Office 365 account in Mac Mail. I saw a post in here from 2 years ago that said it wasn't feasible but I'm hoping that things have changed since that post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me figure out how to add this shared mailbox to my Mail app on my Mac? I've found some options on some collegiate IT sites with a process using adding an IMAP account and a combination of our email address / shared mailbox but that was not
 successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help/guidance would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            STOP Internet Explorer Add-On Installer&#63;</h2>
                    I want to disable Internet Explorer Add-On Installer Popups. I never had to deal with that before I reinstalled my whole system. I think that I clicked on something when I installed Explorer to allow this. BIG MISTAKE. My anti-virus is having trouble with
 some add ons also, with GOOD reason aparrently. Plain and simple, I don't want to manage add-ons I want to stop the popup that NEVER use to be there in the first place. PLEASE HELP!

<p><span>Hello, PURIFIERS</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for using the Answers Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>Does it say what add-on is trying to install?</span></p>
<p><span>Check if running without add-ons stops the installer popup. Go to Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools and open Internet Explorer (No Add-ons).</span></p>
<p><span><span>If it goes away, go to Tools, click Manage Add-ons, change the Show setting on the left to All Add-ons then select all of the add-ons listed and click Disable
 All. You can then restart normally and enable the add-ons one by one to find what add-on is causing the problem .</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We look forward to hearing back from you.</span></span></p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to set a permanant filter in the conversation view to remove deleted messages from a conversation(inbox/sent). When deleted from the conversation, and thus being obsolete, I would prefer those deleted items not to further disturb the conversation
 view.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Start with identifying what type of accounts you have configured in Outlook via</p>
<p>
</p><p>Control Panel --&gt; Mail app --&gt; email tab --&gt; shows accounts and protocol used for each (i.e. POP, Imap, Exchange ActiveSync etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>While there - take note of all the PST files configured for the account along with which one is designated as the default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without any other information - suggest you start with configuring a new Outlook profile using the previous info (where new = starting from scratch vs. copying an existing one) and see if that resolves the problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other potential issue may arise because of 3rd party Outlook addins that may be installed especially given the comment "my older Outlook didn't run on windows 7 - just how old is "older"? And what exactly is meant by "didn't run"? as in wouldn't start
 at all or would run but not work as expected etc?</p>

</p><p>We, at Skype no longer have an option to delete accounts. Microsoft aimed to bring convenience on your end and that means you do not need to contact us to process the cancellation. You may click the link below for the step by step process in deleting your
 account: <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA142/how-do-i-close-my-skype-account?q=account+dletion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How do I close my Skype account?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> If you proceed to delete your Skype account, the associated Microsoft account will be closed as well. This is due to the full migration of Skype to Microsoft and one credentials to all
 Microsoft products. If you are using other email domains such as Yahoo!, Gmail, etc., you can still use the email for signing in to any other email account but can no longer be used to sign in to any Microsoft products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, your account will be closed after <strong>30 days </strong>but if you change your mind anytime during the
<strong>30 day period, </strong>all you have to do is sign in to your account again to cancel the closure.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>the error message "unsupported video type or invalid file path" is for 
HTML5 video, not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
flash....</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It means that the website you are trying to use </p>
<p>(please, please include links to any website you are having problems with, with your questions... that way we can visit them to do some tests)</p>
<p>
</p><p>is not programmed correctly and is sending your computer a HTML5 video format that is not supported by IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without a link to that site we cannot investigate what may be happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try turning off IE's ActiveX Filtering, which would allow Adobe Flash content to play on the site (if the site still supports it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To turn IE's ActiveX filtering on or off&nbsp;for a web site please see the following blog post.</p>

            <p>Ms. B, I will try that next time I get a chance!</p>
<p>&nbsp;IECUSTOMISER, I'd gladly post a link, but I fear I may be judged for perusing questionable websites and their associated various clips,,,,, and the content! I&nbsp;know its warped, but we all have our vices right? this site is reputable as clean and no illness
 has ever become my pc as a result, where as others are harbingers of doom they seem!</p>
<p>&nbsp;I will see if I can find another site that behaves the same way and post that!</p>
<p>&nbsp; I just&nbsp;find it more than coincidental that 2 machines are doing the same thing!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>so, still unable to play these "particular" clips... I've tried finding another website that has clips that will not play, seems the site I was visiting is the only one posting these...</p>
<p>&nbsp;I do notice also that there are others that take a long time to play, buffering and what not, or play part way through and seemingly buffer indefinitely, could very well be my intermittent or poor high speed sat connection...</p>
<p>&nbsp;I did tap the F12 key at the clip in question, and on the left side in bottom window, there are errors, all 5 state "access denied"! as I'm no html programmer, this is greek to me.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have also tried every short lead on a cure, even a few sketchy ones, ALL prove nothing!</p>
<p>&nbsp;I did FINALLY manage to uninstall flash player... (what an absolute ridiculous bunch of work0 had to become owner of the program, inherit it, then I was able to unlock it so I delete it! then try to load it... more ridiculous than getting rid of! because
 as soon as the site with flash program recognizes I have 8.1, it reverts right away to saying that it comes preinstalled, and stopped! GRRR!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Anyway, I have it now, although it does not appear in the system32 files...?</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am reserved to not being able to play these on this site!</p>

    <title>Outlook Tasks Disappearing from the Task Bar - when located in a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Tasks Disappearing from the Task Bar - when located in a folder they were marked as completed.</h2>
                    <p>For over 6 months now, I have been having issues with my flagged tasks disappearing from the task bar in Outlook. There have been a few times where I have been in the folder the flagged email is in, and my Outlook suddenly freezes, and when it comes back
 to life the task is completed - but I never clicked completed. It used to be more frequent and when it was more frequent and would freeze, I would have tasks gone and OLD tasks show up as overdue. I'm talking tasks that were already completed maybe 6 months
 prior to them randomly popping up. It hasn't done this in a while, however. There is no correlation to what type of tasks disappear. It is always at random. Sometimes only one is gone, sometimes a handful are gone. I never know that they disappear unless it
 happens in front of me, which doesn't always happen. Sometimes the only way I found out they disappeared, is because I have someone emailing me regarding the task and I notice it is gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My IT department in the company I work for have taken numerous steps to try and resolve this issue and it still is happening. We have created, on multiple occasions, new Outlook profiles. We have tried Safe Mode, but we cannot do that because then the plug
 in's we use will not work while in safe mode, and we use them all to frequently to be able to switch back and fourth. I have checked the "Auto Archive" property and it is set to the default settings. We have exported tasks. I have my Cached Exchange Mode "Mail
 to keep offline" slider at three months. Any time we change it, it makes the issue much worse. It brings in dozens of very old completed tasks and many of my tasks go missing. This time frame shouldn't effect my tasks anyways, as they are all "due" within
 no more than 3 weeks from the date they were flagged. My IT has gotten into my computer and checked multiple other things that are above my pay grade, and nothing seemed to help. They have also changed out all of my ethernet cables, etc. I have also tried
 the To-Do app recently, and all that was on there was old completed tasks, and not a lot of them. It was odd actually. I don't care for the set up of the To-Do app and it hasn't proven to be any different than the Outlook program, it is all configured the
 same. I never delete tasks, ever, I just complete them. There is no set reason as to when this happens, for instance, Microsoft asked others with this problem if it was related to certain dates or when people moved the flagged email to folders, mine always
 happens at random. I located some other "questions" on this site and it seems other people have had the issue as well. I followed some of the steps in some of the posts that Microsoft has given people and I am running into issues trying to do them. I tried
 to use the "repair your Outlook personal folder file" and it won't let me do it. I can provide screenshots if needed. I also tried the "Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365" and it won't work either, I get the "Sorry, something happened
 while we were troubleshooting your problem, and we can't continue. We've notified our engineers about the problem so they can fix it" notification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My product information when I go to File - Office Account is "Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016" And "Microsoft Outlook 2016 MSO (16.0.4849.1000) 32-bit Product ID: 00339-10000-00000-AA965"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>At the bottom of Outlook it does say "Connected to: Microsoft Exchange" Any help would be greatly appreciated!!</p>

            There is a bug that the To Do Team is working on a fix for, "Clearing flagged emails marks item complete in Outlook when To-Do sync is enabled".&nbsp; I wonder if this could be a variant of that bug.&nbsp; Could you try disabling To Do task sync and see if the issue
 still occurs?&nbsp;&nbsp;

            There have been some complaints about the new equation editor.
<br />
<br />You may want to try downloading MathType's trial version. After 30 days it changes to a limited version which is essentially Equation Editor 3.0 that has been a part of Word.

    <title>Update 14316 - Upgrade your system bios error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevenpears  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update 14316 - Upgrade your system bios error</h2>
                    <p>When I try and apply Windows 10 update 14316 to my Dell Inspiron 14z, I get a "Fix Issues" button. When I click the button it tells me the update can't be applied and I should check with my manufacturer if my system BIOS can be updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been onto the Dell website and applied the latest BIOS update (version updated from A12 -&gt; A13), but the error is still appearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All previous updates have worked flawlessly (even when other systems have had issues) so I'm wondering if there's more information in a log I'm unaware of or if there's any BIOS issues anyone else has come across that might be causing me problems now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t reinstall Mahjong fm Store in dual boot w&#47; Win7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dicksandlin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t reinstall Mahjong fm Store in dual boot w&#47; Win7</h2>
                    <p>I love the Windows10-TP-9841 that I've installed in a dual-boot configuration with Windows 7 on my laptop after splitting the hard drive into two partitions. &nbsp;I've been able to get all my toolbars copied over and modified them all to work just fine in Win
 10 with one exception: &nbsp;Microsoft Mahjong. &nbsp;Many of the programs use registry entries and those had to be reinstalled in order to work properly while the rest of the toolbar items could simply be pointed to the old C drive (now changed to D in the new configuration).
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The MS Mahjong Deluxe Free program wouldn't allow me to reinstall it, saying that "the app is already installed on this PC". &nbsp;I did make a prior attempt to install it that reported that it worked (before I had entered my credit card information), but it
 never showed up on my hard disk (C drive). &nbsp;Is there a way to get the Store to delete/ignore the invisible installation and reinstall it? &nbsp;Or is there a way to bypass the Store and install it directly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I boot to the Window 7 partition, Mahjong still works fine. &nbsp;But if all works as planned, that partition will eventually go away when the official release of Windows 10 comes along.</p>

<ol>
<li>How was the Mahjong Deluxe installed on Windows 7 computer?</li><li>Have you checked for this game in start menu?</li></ol>
<p>I suggest you to check installed apps on your computer and check if it is listed over there. If it is installed try to run it. If you get any error message try to uninstall from there and then reinstall it.</p>

            <p>Sachin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll reply because you were so courteous to reply to me. &nbsp;However, I've decided to abandon the effort and simply use a different (online) Mahjong program until the evaluation period is over and the real Windows 10 is available. &nbsp;Even then, the MS Store may
 prevent me from succeeding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I caused my problem in two ways. &nbsp;First, I tried the method that has worked with most of the other programs. &nbsp;I copied the shortcut from my Win 7 installation and changed it to point to the now-renamed D drive (that is still C in Win 7). That probably
 didn't work because of registry entries not being copied over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, I went to the MS Store and downloaded a fresh (free) copy of Mahjong without noticing the admonition that you must provide a credit card to download even free programs. &nbsp;That download showed as successful, but I scanned the entire disc after the
 download and no copy of Mahjong was present. &nbsp;So, I complied with the Store's requirement, supplied a credit card, and went to download again. &nbsp;That's when I found out that the Store will not download again if it shows you have already downloaded it. &nbsp;That's
 what I meant by the Store preventing me from succeeding. &nbsp;It's a software Catch-22.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your trying to help me,</p>
<p>Dick</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the screenshots you requested:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(186, 20, 26, 1)">Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again.</span></p>

    <title>Build 15025 sleep - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vienna10  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 15025 sleep</h2>
                    <p>It would appear that sending build 15025 to sleep on my Sony Vaio SVS1512Z9EB doesn't work as it should. Closing the lid, sends it to sleep and should wake on opening the lid again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is ok, as long as connected to power, but a different story when disconnected. It would then appear to hibernate after a while. The settings are correct - sleep on power and sleep on battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main system of the dual-boot install (Anniversary build) will sleep for several days on battery, so nothing wrong there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alao noticed the screen being dark when it's eventually brought back - have to use the function keys to brighten again&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perhaps I didn't express myself properly. The laptop does wake from hibernation the next day. I actually have to press the start button to wake it, where it then goes through the Vaio splash screen before Windows desktop appears. If the lid is opened whilst
 the power is on, the desktop appears instantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know at what stage it goes into hibernation, but it did something similar with the previous build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't do it on my old Asus Pro52L, this I tested last night.&nbsp;The&nbsp;lock screen appeared almost immediately on opening the lid&nbsp;</p>

            It would appear that the sleep problem is fixed in build 15031. Tested it last night, sending it to sleep, disconnecting the power. Reconnected the power, opened the lid - voylla - desktop there, lighting unchanged &nbsp;

<h2>            Windows Marketplace Live ID Error</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have the Samsung SGH-i917, which has Windows 7.5, After resetting the cellphone and signing in with my Live ID, it takes me to a page telling me to setup my account for the marketplace, after that is done it pops up an error telling me: "There was
 a problem with your Live ID try again later or use another account."; therefore im not able to download any app from the marketplace.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My password is less than 16 characters long.</p>
<p>I already reset my phone again.</p>
<p>I tried 3 different accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The previous owner as able to download any app, before I made the reset and introduced my Live ID. I know the cellphone is pretty old but someone gave me this phone until im able to buy a new one. So I would highly appreciate if anybody has some fix with
 this issue.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I've encountered this same error recently on a Nokia Lumia 710 (Windows Phone 7.8). I hard-reset the phone to try and solve some battery life issues, but now I am encountering the "Problem with Live ID" error whenever I try to download any apps from the
 Marketplace. There are also problems trying to sync my Google account/email, which doesn't ever finish and stops text messaging from working until I hard-reset the phone again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially, the marketplace was asking me to set up my account (by entering my region/birthday) and I would get the ID error after trying to do that. I finally got the account setup to work (after logging in/out of some various services like Zune and my live
 account on the web, not sure what caused it to work though), and then I was able to update the "Nokia Drive" and "My Account" apps and download UC browser attempting to do it repeatedly (about 10 times). One of the attempts to download it somehow worked and
 I was able to get just that app, but I've been unsuccessful anywhere else, getting the ID error on every download attempt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, I can only hope some of that is helpful to someone. All I can suggest for now is maybe try logging into your Windows Live ID on the web/elsewhere and see if maybe there are some settings that could be played around with. I'm still struggling with
 this problem myself, and I'll post again if I am able to figure anything else out. I'm just about to cave and get a new phone, as the 710 is getting pretty old... but I'd rather keep it going as long as I can.</p>

<h2>            Error 8018830f When Installing 10052 -  Please Post Here &#47; &#42;RESOLVED&#42;</h2>
                    <p>We've had a small set of users note seeing error 8018830f after downloading 10052 when trying to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please share the following information so we can research:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device Model</p>
<p>Mobile Operator / Carrier</p>
<p>Current OS Version<br />
<br />
To find current OS version:</p>
<p>WP8 - Settings &gt; About &gt; (More info)</p>
<p>Windows 10 TP - Settings &gt; System &gt; About &gt; More info</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Jason</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>***edit***<br />
<br />
An insight into what happened:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like there was an update package conflict between 10051 and 10052.&nbsp; The newest update should have superseded the old, however for some downloads, the older version was being seen and the update package was then throwing the error when attempting
 to install.&nbsp; (New update package version should have been greater than old, but it wasn't.)<br />
<br />
Good news is that this should be fixed now.&nbsp; We'll have some "how did this happen" investigation to do on our end, but your quick replies helped us dig in and quickly identify the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you as always.&nbsp; Your efforts are appreciated!</p>

    <title>Bluetooth and WIFI Unstable after GDR2 update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bluetooth and WIFI Unstable after GDR2 update</h2>
                    Hey all,<br />
<br />
After the latest update on my Windows phone (HTC 8x 16GB ATT), I'm unable to maintain a stable link with WIFI and Bluetooth.<br />
<br />
Right after the update I tried to make calls via my bluetooth headset (Plantronics Legend) and my connection on bluetooth would collapse almost immediately, leaving me with a garbled sound quality.&nbsp; Also, my WIFI is failing to stay connected.&nbsp; Based on some
 of the other posts, I'm going to assume that this is due to the update we just recieved.&nbsp; Also, I can no longer send communications to my computer or any other bluetooth device (Arduino robotics, Netduino, etc.)<br />
<br />
I've tried deleting and re-pairing the headset with my phone, and it's failing.&nbsp; When I pair with my old HTC Titan, it works just fine.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Can you guys roll back the bluetooth and wifi 'improvements' but let us keep the fm radio?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
~D<br />

<p>think it may be bug..due to reduced power design as I'm testing with my surface&nbsp;RT&nbsp;and it is as if the Bluetooth is asleep until wakened by another device. although this may be normal behaviour. Not sure</p>

            I too am having problems on my RT, but that is mostly related to the wireless service crashing.
<div><br />
<div>I think you're on the right track with the low power thing causing Bluetooth to die out. &nbsp; I really want to see a MS post on this addressing it, or a full bug report on when its getting fixed. &nbsp;If apple can fix bugs as the pop up, Microsoft should be able
 to respond just as fast</div>

            <p>I am having the same problems with my Voyager Legend and my HTC8X (Verizon) after applying the GDR2 update. Not sure what to do now, I use my Bluetooth device everyday, all day. At this point, it is nearly useless. Pretty sloppy work to distribute an update
 that breaks a major function of the phone. I guess I will call Verizon, tell my story and ask if there is a way to roll it back to pre-GDR2.</p>

            Post-GDR2 update on my HTC 8X on Verizon is having similar issues with the WiFi. I can connect to my home network and do one web request (such as browse to msn.com), but after that all requests fail in any app (Twitter, Facebook etc.). I am still connected
 to my network with no errors, but I can't do anything. I haven't had this problem at all in the last nine months and it started happening immediately after the update.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>This needs to be fixed fast! I can't be using my Verizon data plan all the time.</div>

            I had the same issue with my Samsung ATIV S Bluetooth disconnecting from my 2012 Jeep Cherokee Overland (MS please fix for my model car). I tried everything you can imagine including a second spare Samsung ATIV S so to rule out the possibility of a faulty
 phone. The only way to fix the phone is to downgrade back to factory settings and the only way to do that with my Canadian carrier (Bell Mobility) is to visit the Samsung Service Center. Fortunately for me there is a New Samsung "walk in" Service Center in
 Mississauga. Phone was restored to original settings within an hour and life is back to normal. Unfortunately I am unable to take advantage of the GDR2 upgrade as well as any future ones (I guess) until Microsoft creates a fix either for my specific model
 vehicle or Bluetooth in general.
<div><br />
<div>MS, let me know when you've got a fix for my car. Thanks.</div>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, I did some testing of this issue. I think that the problem occurs when attempting to use a connected Bluetooth device and a Wi-Fi connection simultaneously. I was on a call using my Bluetooth device when I entered my office parking area and noticed
 the Wi-Fi notification attempting to connect. The Bluetooth connection failed at that point, first the call quality dropped and then the Bluetooth device disconnected from the phone. I thought this was interesting, so I did a test, turning the Wi-Fi off on
 the 8X, reconnected the Bluetooth and made a few calls, all of which were normal. Then I turned Wi-Fi back on and attempted more calls. The 8X connected with the office Wi-Fi and then the Bluetooth problem occurred immediately again. One more test, same result.
 I decided to leave the Wi-Fi off for the remainder of the day to see what would happen. I used the Bluetooth to make and receive calls all day with no issues.</p>
<p>I am concluding that GDR2 has broken the ability for the 8X to maintain a Bluetooth and a Wi-Fi connection simultaneously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would be interested to know if anyone else with this problem could try a similar test, and what those results would be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I will leave the 8X Wi-Fi off all day and I am betting my Bluetooth device works flawlessly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike</p>

            <p>Gentry,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I had a similar issue immediately following the GDR2 update. Could not connect to web sites, even though the 8X was connected to my Wi-Fi network.</p>
<p>I checked settings, and went to the Cellular setting, where I found the "For limited Wi-Fi connectivity" setting to be set at "don't use cellular data". I changed this to "use cellular data" and this fixed my problem with web site connection immediately.
 I have no idea why it needs to be set this way, but it worked for me, so I went with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe this can help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike</p>

            <p>So, I talked a bit with HTC on this.&nbsp; They said I needed to do a reset of my device.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would encourage everyone who has a phone problem to contact their phone manufacturer.&nbsp; Ultimately, it will be them who send out a fix. GDR2 stands for General Distribution
 Release 2, so it goes to everyone.&nbsp; If there are individual patches, the phone manufacturer (HTC/Nokia/etc) will issue that fix for their hardware.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I haven't talked to Plantronics yet, but I will be doing that tomorrow.&nbsp; Here is what I'm thinking tho, I think the Bluetooth 4.2&nbsp;component that is in there got a&nbsp;driver update, which changed the way it connects to the low power Bluetooth devices.&nbsp; If there
 was only a way to completely clear it out of the registry and devices, and start over from scratch, I bet it would work correctly with the right hardware profile/configuration settings.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This weekend I'm going to try to reset my device and see if that works, but I want to confirm with Plantronics first.&nbsp; Maybe find a registry editor for Win8 and try to wipe out the configuration.</p>

            <p>This morning I disabled Wifi on my Samsung Ativ S and it remained connected via BT to my car for the full journey into work this morning (not normal).&nbsp;Further proof&nbsp;will be the journey home this evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully MS will come up with a proper fix for this soon.</p>

<h2>            Creating a Backup Copy of downloaded Office 2007</h2>
                    How do I create a backup copy of Office Professional 2007 that I purchased by download? I purchased Office Professional 2007 as a download rather than purchasing it at a retail store which would have included CDs for reinstallation. My question is, can
 I create a backup copy of Office Professional 2007 so that I can put it on my laptop too and also to have just in case the computer that I downloaded it too should happen to crash and need to reinstall.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked all mail folders and this is wat&nbsp;I found out:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>folder "bewaren"&nbsp;shows only headers. mail content is not showing</p>
<p>folder "computer" shows nothing. error message after around 20 s Cannot Get Mail</p>
<p>folder "fotografie" shows nothing. error message after around 20 s Cannot Get Mail</p>
<p>folder "Icesave" shows nothing. error message after around 20 s Cannot Get Mail</p>
<p>folder "online shops" shows only headers. mail content is not showing</p>
<p>folder "sparen" shows only headers. mail content is not showing</p>
<p>folder "TomTom" shows nothing. error message after around 20 s Cannot Get Mail</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All remaining folder work normally</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally I also reinstalled the latest ios using the Ipad recovery mode. completely&nbsp;deleting the installed version (which also was the latest ios version). &nbsp;I then added my e-mail account. This did not solve the problem.</p>

            <p>One simple thing to try is checking what option you selected when up set up the exchange account on you iPad, iPhone, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The option is labeled "<strong>Mail days to sync</strong>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The choices range from "one day" to "no limit."</p>
<p>
</p><p>if if your emails are <strong><em>older</em></strong> than the limit you have opted for, the folders will
<strong><em>appear</em></strong> empty--even though a successful sync is occurring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try setting it to no limit and the older emails will appear "automagically"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems simple, but this problem frustrated me for over a year before I realized this was what was going on.</p>

<h2>            Tracking information in Excel from Outlook</h2>
                    I would like to send emails out via mail merge through Word with my database in Excel.&nbsp; My receipients are going to respond to the email by checking a box such as the check box content control.&nbsp; Is there a way to automatically send this information back
 to my Excel sheet so I don't have to manually go in and mark their responses?&nbsp; I don't need to mark if they have&nbsp;responded I need to mark their specific response such as "Yes, send the letter" or "No, do not send the letter".&nbsp;

    <title>Nokia Lumia 930 questionable battery life since update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> randomalianfromvietnam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Lumia 930 questionable battery life since update</h2>
                    <p>I've had my loyal old Nokia Lumia 920 for years and the battery life was fine, it wasn't exceptionally great but it wasn't horrible either, but when I had it I could travel half the country listening non-stop to music and my battery would never go below
 80% and then I bought my Nokia Lumia 930 to replace my Nokia Lumia 920, personally I would've liked to wait for a Microsoft-branded device but most unfortunately for me my (new)&nbsp;Nokia Lumia 930 never lived up, but despite that I could ride 40 kilometers on
 my bicycle and the battery would only go down to 60% (seems like a huge step backwards), but then I got the latest Windows Phone 8.1 update and now I charge on average 5 times a day and the battery lasts 3 hours,
<em>at most</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This wouldn't have been a problem for me if I didn't see telephones with better battery life
<em>all the time</em>. A friend of mine owns a very cheap Samsung Galaxy telephone which cost her less than $ 120,- and she only has to charge it once every 3 days and uses WhatsApp Messenger nearly non-stop, in fact since she became unemployed that has (literally)&nbsp;been
 all she's been doing yet she rarely has to charge her device, and it's not even limited to my Nokia Lumia 930, almost every other Lumia has no battery life, my wife's Microsoft Lumia 540 Dual SIM and my mother's Microsoft Lumia 540 Dual SIM both have no battery
 life and need to be charged twice a day, meanwhile I have to charge from between 3 to 8 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been withholding myself from buying the Microsoft Lumia 950 XL because of my bad experience with my Nokia Lumia 930, and I've literally disabled every background app and can understand that if the main difference between the Nokia Lumia 920 and Nokia
 Lumia 930 is that they share the same battery but that the Nokia Lumia 930 does more like data collection for height, altitude, how the device is positioned, and a step counter, these are all benefits that I greatly enjoy, but my battery life is simply very,
 very poor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to improve this? and is Microsoft planning on releasing a Microsoft Lumia device with enough battery to actually last the day in the near future? I'd buy that device in a heart beat.</p>

            <p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to share my sway with the community but unfortunately it shows client projects which can`t be shared with the public.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is exact times of my trials (european time / Berlin zone) today:</p>
<p>5pm41 &amp; 5pm45</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error follows me now longer than a week. Before it worked very fine..</p>
<p>All my others sway allowed me to duplicate them. Could be that my content is maybe too big to duplicate the sway (3 videos, a bunch of photos,....)?</p>

<p>You must:</p>

<li>Go to the Share option</li><li>Click on the More Options</li><li>Check the box "Viewers can duplicate this Sway"</li></ul>

            <p>Hi Gab,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. We appreciate your interest in Windows 10 Technical Preview.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to use the<strong> SFC /SCANNOW Method.</strong></p>
<p>System File Checker is a utility in Microsoft Windows that allows users to scan for and restore corruptions in Windows system files. Perform System File Check (SFC), and then check if this fixes the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press the <strong>Windows </strong>button + <strong>X </strong>on your keyboard, a mini dialogue box will appear<br />
2. Choose <strong>Command Prompt (Admin</strong>). You must run the command prompt in Administrator level<br />
3. On the command prompt type <strong>sfc /scannow </strong>and hit enter<br />
4. If everything went okay and no errors where found, restart your computer.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><br />
You can also try updating the network adaptor drivers from Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the steps given below to update the display driver.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> when you are at desktop.<br />
b. Select <strong>Device </strong><strong>Manager</strong>.<br />
c. Expand <strong>Network Adaptor</strong>.<br />
d. Right-click the display driver and click <strong>Update Driver Software</strong>.<br />
e. Select <strong>Search Automatically for Updated Driver Software</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the status after troubleshooting so that we can help you accordingly.</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>sfc quits after 3% with "Windows Resource Protection cannot proceed with this action".</p>
<p>All display adapters are reported as up to date.</p>
<p>There are no outstanding updates.</p>
<p>

            Good evening from manila.. I tried all the suggestions but they did not work. I am now in build 10074, but the problems just got worse. My settings app is now missing, so I don't connect to the internet to update. Dead end..
