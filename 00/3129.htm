<h2>            Color fonts print as grayscale, want them to print as pure black in Outlook or Word</h2>
                    
<p>Ok here is the situation. I have a dell 1710n mono laser printer.&nbsp; When I receive an email in Outlook that has color in it, such as a light blue color and I go to print this email, the light blue comes out as a light gray.&nbsp; How can I tell Outlook or Office
 in general, because this happens in word as well, to print in pure black. I know you can print in pure black in power point and but can't seem to find this in Outlook or in the printer settings. Any help is appriciated.&nbsp; Thank you</p>
<p>Michael</p>

<h2>            Disable live tiles</h2>
                    Hi, I've pinned some the tiles of some friends to my start page. The tiles keep updating, and i'm worried that that's using up too much data. How can I stop the tiles from updating? Thanks.

            I was worried too, but on a 500Mb data plan, I've never gone over once. It's nothing to worry about. The more important thing is to not actiave push notifications on apps you don't want and you can also check Settings&gt;Swipe left to get to 'applications'&gt;background
 tasks. Apps listed here can fire off a task every 25 minutes and if you don't like that, you can turn it off.<br />
<br />
Some apps can have their live tile functionality disabled, but for the built-in services? Don't worry.<br />

<p>hi jamie,</p>
<p>office 2011 for mac and office 2016 for mac can be used side by side on&nbsp;a machine. there is no need to uninstall office 2011 for mac to install office 2016 for mac.</p>
<p>for this issue,&nbsp;i would suggest you check&nbsp;the following:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;what’s the mac os version? <br />
the supported operation system is mac os x version 10.10 or higher. for the best experience, could you update to the latest version of any operating system.<br />
see the&nbsp;<a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/office-system-requirements#plans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">office 365 plans for business, education, and government requirement</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=bdbde01b-0bd2-46bd-b722-5d49f81f0969" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dbdbde01b-0bd2-46bd-b722-5d49f81f0969" /></a></p>
<p>2. to make sure the issue is not related to the office installer, i've created a workspace and uploaded the office 2016 for mac installer. could you please download it and check the issue again?&nbsp;<br />
a private message has been sent to you to show how to access the workspace, please check the private message via
https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations .<br />
<br />
3. if the issue persists, try using this command in terminal to install office 2016:
<br />
sudo installer -dumplog -verbose –pkg&nbsp; ~<strong><em>username</em></strong>/downloads/microsoft_office_2016_installer.pkg -target /</p>
<p>replace username with the current system login account name.</p>
<p>(we need to input the password of the&nbsp;current system login account.)</p>

<h2>            Submit form as attachment</h2>
                    <p>I'm sure there is an easy answer to this, but I'm not familiar with writing VBA script or macros, so I might need a little hand-holding... ;-)</p>
<p>I am creating a form in Word and need to insert a button at the bottom for users to click and send the form to the administrator by e-mail as an attachment. I read a thread from 2010 that linked to a page called "<span>How
 to send an email from Word using VBA," but since I don't know what I'm doing in VBA, I'm sure I didn't follow the instructions correctly.</span></p>
<p><span>I inserted text fields and check boxes for my form data, then inserted a command button using the ActiveX controls on the Developer tab. (I did not use any Legacy Form controls.) Then I copied
 and pasted the text from the "How to send an email from Word using VBA" article, subtituting only the correct e-mail address and subject. My VBA screen looked like this:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()<br />
ActiveDocument.HasRoutingSlip = True<br />
With ActiveDocument.RoutingSlip<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Subject = "Gate Access Request"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .AddRecipient "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Delivery = wdAllAtOnce<br />
End With<br />
ActiveDocument.Route</span></p>
<span>
<span>
<p><br />
End Sub</p>
<p>Private Sub CheckBox1_Click()</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>Private Sub Submit_Click()</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I saved the document as a .docm format. However, when I click the command button, I get a pop-up error that reads:
<strong>Run-time error '5892': That method is not available on that object.</strong></p>
<p>So what did I not do that I was supposed to? (Or what did I do that I was <strong>
not</strong> supposed to? &lt;sheepish grin&gt;)</p>

<h2>            Between Two Dates - display Years and Months</h2>
                    <p>I need help in access with a date range.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;am building&nbsp;a database for employees and I want to show&nbsp;how long they have been employeed with us.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am&nbsp;using&nbsp;the calculation from Today's Date- Hiring Date.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if an employee was hired 1/15/15 - and today is 5/15/15, it should show 0 years and&nbsp;4 months&nbsp;(The number of days is not needed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the DateDiff&nbsp;yyyy however it calculates a full year when it's not.&nbsp; As well as when I do the Months configuration (m), it shows all months and I just need the&nbsp;partial months after the year is taken out of the calculation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched the internet a few times and everything I see is not working for me (let me mention, I am not a&nbsp;programmer by any means and&nbsp;I don't even know&nbsp;where the codes get written to).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any&nbsp;suggestions, would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks !!!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Word List of Figures AND Tables &#91;Help on TOC Code&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently trying to generate a mixed List of Tables &amp; Figures as required by my university for my Thesis document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can easily have two different Tables of Figures targeting both Figures and Tables respectively, but that is not what they're asking for. They're asking for the two intermixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What would the Field Codes look like for both?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the Field Codes I have currently:</p>
<p>{TOC \c "Table"}<br />
{TOC \c "Figure"}</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I make one TOC that lists BOTH items?</p>
<p><br />
Thanks so much for the help!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've tried that prior and it does do both Tables and Figures, but it includes the entire caption and some of the images themselves. Not really ideal.</p>

</p><p>I'll keep trying.</p>

<p>It will include whatever is formatted in the Caption style.</p>
<p>It sounds like you are formatting the images with that style, as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible to include only part of what appears as the caption, if that is what you want. Doing this requires that the part you do not want to include be put in a separate Word paragraph that is formatted in a different paragraph style. That style can
 be based on the Caption style and have the same appearance. Then you combine the two paragraphs visually (and in print) using a
<a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/styles.htm#Style_Separator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Style Separator</a>. Word will pick up the text in the Caption style but not in the other style.</p>

<p>why would you end the life of skype for linux 4.3 - if your replacement skype 8.9 and 8.10 for linux is just full of bugs? not just minor one - but major -&gt; unable to start, unable to send messages... is this by design?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            By discontinuing 4.3 Microsoft is forcing everyone with a 32 bit processor to buy a 64 bit computer if they want to use Skype. &nbsp;I have Linux Mint 17.3 running on a laptop with a 32 bit processor so I'm forced to terminate my Skype account. &nbsp;It&nbsp;appears
 that Microsoft couldn't care less if they lose customers with older computers. &nbsp;Well, there are other ways to make calls such as an Obihai modem phone using a Google account. &nbsp;Bye bye Skype! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>The new skype doesn't display notifications for birthdays. Many a times, I'm unable to receive or send messages on this version (especially in group chats), but was receiving it on the previous version. (I used to run both for this purpose). The search history
 is not good. Please keep the older version support.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since updating to the Skype for Linux 8 series, I have noticed man MANY changes to how Skype looks and feels. I have yet to find a single change that I consider to actually be an improvement. Here is a list of the changes I have noted, and been frustrated
 by.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) separate windows for individual chats is gone. It used to be default that every chat had its own window. Then, in the change from Skype for Linux 4 to 8, that got changed to having to "pop out" every chat. Thankfully; Skype would at least remember that
 my last chat with someone was popped out and would open a new window whenever they launched a chat with me.&nbsp; Now, with the latest update, that option is gone as well. This forces me to click back and forth between active chats constantly, instead of just having
 side by side windows I can simply glance at. </p>
<p>
</p><p>2) In the contacts list it was once standard to have the ability to sort your contacts by online status. Now all you can sort by is time, unread and active. In addition, the original 8 had at least the option to create a list of favourites. The latest update
 has taken that away as well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>3) When the new update installed, I was walked through the initial configuration of the new version. This was unexpected, usually updates are expected to preserve most of your existing settings if at all applicable.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) The configuration walk through promised that I could always change the theme later in Settings. This is incorrect. The settings dialogue box makes no mention of themes whatsoever. Changing the theme can be found, oddly enough, within my profile of all
 places. There I find another path to Application Settings (note that this is a different label than found in the menu Tools|Settings, but takes you to the same place), but changing the theme is not there, it's all by itself further down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Among the settings that has apparently been taken away by the update is the option to NOT log chat history. Now logging everything is my only real choice. I can delete a chat, but that then kicks the contact off the top of my contact list when sorted
 by Active. Granted, for a sort based on Active, this makes sense, but what I am trying to achieve is something at least slightly similar to sort by Status and deleting chat history breaks that. Note that, despite the fact that I had chat logging disabled in
 the earlier Skype 8, all those chats which I expected to be unlogged reappeared. The visible chats go back for several MONTHS. Previously, with Skype 4, logging was done locally and it was assumed by most users that was the only place chats were being logged.
 Having old chats come back from the grave proves that chats are also logged on central servers against my wishes. (and despite Canadian privacy law that says Skype can only log with my express consent OR a valid court order...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) I have lost the ability to create custom groups of contacts (e.g. a Favourites list) that is not tied to a group chat. Creating a group chat is easy enough to figure out, but on first use, the labelling and phrasing is ambiguous enough that I thought
 I was creating a favourites list when what I was really doing was effectively creating a chat room.
</p>

</p><p>7) The process to remove people from a group chat is a tedious PITA. I don't know whose bright idea it was to make
<em><strong>invisible buttons</strong></em> that only show up if A) You've taken the pointer away from where the button will appear and then B) do a mouse hover. Note that the contact list by default only shows the top three contacts and reorders itself every
 time you delete someone. That means that the next contact is brought into view and then I have to repeat A and B again. I understand the desire for a clean looking interface, but working "under the hood" in tools, settings or preferences is no place for playing
 hide and seek with the buttons!</p>
<p>
</p><p>8) Starting with the very first update made after Microsoft purchased Skype, I have been getting the same bug with every update. Every time there is a minor version change (e.g. 8.8 to 8.10) very old and obsolete contacts get put back on my contacts list.&nbsp;
 With today's update I am once again looking at having to delete numerous contacts who have been dead for years. While we're on the subject of deleting contacts. I used to be able to just remove a contact, so that I didn't see them on my list and they couldn't
 see my status on theirs, but they could still send messages "blind" as it were. (chats to someone who appears offline, in expectation that they will see it when they next sign in). Now the only option is to block. On the plus side, the options for reporting
 abuse have expanded and that's a good thing. But losing the ability to just remove contacts and/or arrange contacts arbitrarily is irksome.

<p>I totally agree with Safiren and GenghisBarbarian. There is a word in German for this. It's called verschlimmbessern, which translates to improve for the worse. You, Sirs and Madams, waste our screen space with useless informations (like avatars in the chat)
 and fancy looks. Ever thought of that? Don't you find that quite daring? Oh btw, I can't change my speakers volume. It always jumps back to 0. So I get these annoying popups in the right bottom corner, which forces me to shutdown skype when multitabling poker.
 On the other hand I don't hear incomming messages when afk. So I would like to have a pure sound notification w/o popups. Well while writing this I noticed, that sometimes there is sound and somtimes not, which makes it even more wierd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More and more people I know are not present in skype anymore. I had to install discord to contact them.</p>

<p>I apologize in advance to this community of enthusiasts and Linux users (probably master users). I am a well seasoned Windows user and have been dabbling in Linux over the years off and on - more 'on' recently. I have to say that this new Linux appears (at
 first opening) to be an identical presentation to the Windows version. Since I am an avid Windows user of Skype - I feel like I've 'come home'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again... I am predominantly a Windows user, so likely I have already figured out how to 'compensate' for this presentation over my years of use. I hear all of your frustration with the change but if I can encourage you to be patient - you will learn to appreciate
 the presentation as it is.</p>

<p>Having a consistent appearance and function across platforms is indeed a desirable goal and I do appreciate the efforts the Skype team have made towards that end.
</p>
<p>However; I would like to say that it would be more accurate and more desirable to maintain consistent appearance and function
<em>across similar platforms. &nbsp;</em>Having the same look and feel across desktop platforms (Windows, Mac and Linux) is a good thing since the human interface is the same. But desktop and mobile versions use very different methods of human interaction, and shouldn't
 try too hard to look and work the same. Desktop users are accustomed to having a lot more options and fine level of control over their desktop applications. Moreover; they have the screen real estate to make use of separate windows for individual chats. Mobile
 users, on the other hand, do not have the screen space for that, and the touch interface requires simplified menus and functions. Much of the new look and feel would work very well for mobile users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said; losing two of the functions I mentioned (sort by status, grouping of contacts) negatively affects both desktop and mobile users. As does the bug of restoring long obsolete removed or blocked contacts after version changes. (note that spam contacts,
 contacts blocked with an abuse report do not reappear, which is a good thing) And the design choice to make invisible buttons within the remove contacts from group dialogue would probably impact mobile users even worse than it does desktop users.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally; I find the restoration of chats that I had previously set to be unlogged to be very disturbing. I chose that option for reasons of my own. I do expect that I have to again choose that option after major version updates (despite the industry standard
 of preserving settings across updates whenever possible) because I've always had to do so in the past. But I don't think it is unreasonable to expect that a) the option to not log chats is preserved and b) chats that were not logged at the time of creation
 never be visible or accessible to the users. I understand that technical and legal reasons may require recording all traffic on the server side. But, as I said in my original post, it's my understanding that Canadian law requires that you do not record my
 chat history without either my clear consent OR a valid court order. (this is covered by the Common Carrier legal standard)</p>

<p>Thank you all for the feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Bill kindly mentioned, Skype is now, for the first time in history, the same across all platforms - including Linux.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are really sorry for any inconvenience while switching to the new version on Linux. We are trying to make it as seamless as possible, but not everything can be retained - like the 32bit support or old UI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that the new features, improvements, security, consistency and, most importantly, continuous work on the client will outweigh the issues with the change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: We are now looking at the contact groups and other improvements you may find useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stay tuned and keep the feedback coming :-)</p>

<p>Thanks, but it not help,</p>
<p>
</p><p>my family, a specially sister, don't like every complications with that so we stop a problem and using now free Messenger for use a phone and land lines my provider give me free access too. Thanks for answer and wish you and Skype better options and offers
 in future for non-computer specialists like my family. Messenger works amazing like talk in 1 meter from me and for free :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I really use Skype and be happy on that but now with that complication, disable any normal, natural payments like this one what I need, everywhere and every time Credit Card, credit card, credit card... no way. Please, thing about really good option
 for loads like that (of course I mean developers or Skype think). Absolutely popular in Asia and Philippines
<em>coins.ph</em>. Thausands if no millions use that everywhere, why not Skype? Maybe Skype after taking by Micro$oft if poor company like M$ now, who know. Resent this opinion somewhere, its really the best option, cryptocurrencies and more. If Skype miss
 that it means Skype lost so much in future and maybe die, like many others communicators.</p>

  Wizard after doing it myself didn't work, but still no luck. I need to get 
  this mailing in the mail ASAP. I've never had this happen before. I do not 
  find a fix on MS's site.

<h2>            I have some software programs, IOBits, Malwarebytes, and Mcafee Total Protection Antivirus.</h2>
                    <p>Can these still be used inside Windows 10? I mean, I am uncertain if the encrypted info is causing problems or not. and don't want another program changing an update that I need to attend to. I am on an Dell&nbsp;Inspiron X64 laptop. running win 7 home professional
 or premium/ Mcafee anti-virus running. And I read that it would not work w/Windows 10. I tried using Windows Defender, but I have never used it on this laptop before.
</p>
<p>I have been getting calls from people saying they are from Microsoft Windows security. Then hang up when I try to get their Employee ID. Because, I got one of them on my Laptop to write his name, number, and I.D. I don't know if it's legit or not.
</p>
<p><em>So another question, will Support be contacting individuals about problems? And asking for 149.00 to fix foreign IP intruders. witch PreSource Techies says my network is fine. But it was thru them that I got the "A Omega Solutions" scam that the FBI
 supposedly recovered all my stuff.??</em></p>

            <p>total scam. Simply tell them to 'efF' off !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run windows defender rather than McAfee, it is bloatware and not very good either !.</p>
<p>iobits and malware bytes you dont need either.</p>
<p>If you want a good alternative free AV then download and install Avast Free. - to be honest, with the very limited knowledge as you appear to have, I would recommend that you stick with defender and nothing else.</p>
<p>I have no idea what you mean by 'presource techies' and am baffled by how you link them to someone scamming you out of money ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, what 'encrypted info' are you talking about. ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest that you take your PC to a <em><strong>reputable </strong></em>local PC shop and have it properly checked and tell them to install Avast Free - no payware - just ensure your machine is clean which at the moment it sounds as if it is probably
 infested with malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also recommend you wait at least 6 months for win 10 to stabilise as you may well hit many problems with incompatibility at the moment which you would be at a total loss to sort out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry if that sound harsh, I simply think you need to take stock of where you are and get the system sorted out as it is LONG before you consider updating to anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, maybe consider taking basic computer classes that cover security awareness &nbsp;- if there are any in your area.</p>

<p>I got scammed from a Salesman from Pre Source Techies after purchasing Malwarebytes. &nbsp;The FBI was called in by the technology company. &nbsp;MS. &nbsp;Jenny called personally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I'll be honest with you. &nbsp;First my machine is clean. &nbsp;Second I'm being scammed because it says defender is working. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I hit the be in Preview button before I seen it said developer. &nbsp;I want to work in security. &nbsp;I have been very busy with unexpected circumstances. &nbsp;It's called life. &nbsp;But I'm a quick learner. &nbsp;Just need help sorting out what I've got since I've got it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And any FREE virus protection out there can be researched and you'll get life time licenses for software. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I lost and recovered 300 dollars from a FAKE AOmega Solutions. &nbsp;I was 1 of about 25. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the input.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to figure out if I should try and install my Office 2010 product so I can use office one note. &nbsp;And BTW I'm now replying to you from my cell phone. &nbsp;So I'm no dummy. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>1.&nbsp; You purchased MalwareBytes instead of going to the MalwareBytes site and downloaded the
<strong>free</strong> version.</p>
<p>2&nbsp; One of the easiest ways to get scanned it not being careful where you go for things.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; If you want Avast free go to Avast not one of the others that say they have Avast
<strong>free</strong>.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; When you load any of the software read each and every page, un-click the extra offers as this is where you get malware and offers for things you do not need since the pickup your address.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Sometimes you may have to remove the anti-virus software to upgrade Windows 10.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does it happen only when browsing with Internet Explorer?</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>: I would suggest you run the Internet Explorer troubleshooter
 and check if it fixes the issue:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Internet-Explorer-Performance-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Internet-Explorer-Performance-troubleshooter</a>
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Try to run the Internet Explorer in no add-ons mode and check if it helps:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Click the Start button, click All Programs, click Accessories, click System Tools, and then click Internet Explorer (No Add-ons).</span></b></p>
<p><span>For more details, refer the below link:

<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b><span> You can also check the status of the issue in clean boot to
 identify if any third party software is conflicting:</span></p>

</p>
<p>Note: Reset the computer to usual startup by following the step 7 from the link above.</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 4</span></b><span>: You can also try resetting the Internet Explorer settings
 and check if it helps:</span></p>

<h3> ruddy_tpl  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Publisher 2016 - dual monitors dragging and dropping</h2>
                    <p>Ive just installed MS Publisher on an new laptop , with new Dell P2217H as a second monitor.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 10 Version 1709,&nbsp; Build 16299.248</p>
<p>Publisher&nbsp; Version - 1801 9001</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dragging and dropping works correctly&nbsp; on laptop screen, but when publisher is dragged to second Dell screen drag and drop ceases to work correctly with the cursor moving randomly round then jumping to laptop screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried ticking and unticking graphics exceleration</p>
<p>I have tried unticking snap to grid</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen this post from 2016 , but as it suggests that the error is with all MS applications where as the issue I am finding is with MS Publisher only I havent tried it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>**********************</p>
<p>If this issue occurs only when using Office applications, you can try the following steps:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; a.Open any Office application (Word, Publisher, Excel and etc.), click File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced then scroll down to the Display section. Uncheck the “Disable hardware graphics acceleration”, then restart your Office.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b.Create a DWORD key in Registry Editor at<br />
HKEY_Current_User\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Common\Graphics (<strong>Note:* for Office 201</strong>3)<br />
HKEY_Current_User\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Graphics (<strong>Note:* for Office 2016</strong>)<br />

    <title>Suddenly stopped receiving PayPal notification emails from - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ragdollbaby  say:</h3>
<h2>            Suddenly stopped receiving PayPal notification emails from &#42;&#42;&#42; Email address is removed for privacy &#42;&#42;&#42; in May</h2>
                    <p>Ever since after the 26th of May 2016 I had suddenly stopped receiving notification of payments received fromPayPal. The address is: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. I do however receive emails from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have few hotmail addresses that I have set up to forward to one hotmail address so I only need to log in once. When I specifically log into the accounts (that are being forwarded) I always have junk mail that sits in the junk folder.&nbsp;Coincidentally, around
 May/June, I noticed that I had stopped receiving any mail within my junk mail folder on just
<strong>one</strong> of my hotmail addresses (the same address as I had originally used for PayPal).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had not made any changes to my options/settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since checked options/settings and the junk email filter is "standard". No PayPal address/domain is within my blocked senders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried adding the paypal addresses to my safe senders and domain list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed my PayPal address default to an optusnet email (which I have to check on my pc) and all notifications came through fine. So then I tried setting up a forwarding rule that "notifications" would be be forwarded to my Hotmail address - which it did,
 but I never received them into my Hotmail account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried changing my default PayPal address to the hotmail address that is <strong>
not </strong>being forwarded. And the&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** emails still didn't come through!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's as if Hotmail have an internal filter that is blocking this email address. How can I get that checked/removed?</p>

            <p><span>Hi EnterpriseIT.co,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>HCW needs to be run on an Exchange server. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ba5c6a1-fd5f-4d23-885f-114fd1f3d422" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ba5c6a1-fd5f-4d23-885f-114fd1f3d422" /></a></p>
<p><span>I notice that you also have Windows 2008R2 server in your environment. So I understand there’s a mixed Exchange deployment with Exchange 2013 and 2010 in your environment, in which situation the CAS server need to be the Windows 2012R2 server. We suggest
 you run the wizard in the Windows 2012R2 server. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Does the local Exchange deployment work well? </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I downloaded the latest HCW and ran it from my lab successfully. <span>&nbsp;</span>My version is 16.0.1589.2. What’s your detailed HCW version?</span></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am actually testing all the features of Internet Explorer 8 and I am actually testing how to block sites. I've done some research and found that you can block sites via the content advisor. But when I try to block a website in the<strong>restricted sites</strong>,
 I am not able to block the desired website and it enters the website as usual. Maybe I am missing a step to do so. Could someone please inlighten me on the<strong>restricted sites</strong>&nbsp;problem that I am having?</p>
<p>Thanking you in advance,</p>

<h3> sly11  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t see Sent To email address when using Outlook Connector. Seems to not sychronize. Is this a bug&#63;</h2>
                    When using Outlook Connector with Hotmail and my Google mail account which I have to use through my work connector seems to work great. The issue I am having is that when I go to my sent Items my sent column is not showing who I sent the email to. If I
 click on the actual email and open it then it will download the sent to persons email address but this makes it difficult if I am searching or looking for a sent item as I can't go through and open each individual email.&nbsp; I see that this question is on the
 forum too and no one has been able to figure it out.

            <p>Hi, I have the same problem with several Hotmail and Live mail accounts:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In Outlook 2010, with the Live connector, I send an email from my account to someone else (no rocket science yet
</span><span><span>J</span></span><span>).
</span><span>In my sent items folder in Outlook, it nicely states who it has been sent to.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now I go to the Live mail web interface, look at my sent items folder, and the “To” address in my sent email is my own address!</span></p>
<p><span>I also tried to send an email using the web interface, but then everything is normal: In the sent mail folder, it nicely shows the “To” address.</span></p>
<p><span>And it's not just me...</span><span> (I've tried several account, and they all show the same:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In the web interface, Sent items folder, mail sent using the web interface shows the correct "to" address, and mail originally sent using Outlook
 2010 shows my own address as the "to" address. Both in the same list / view / colomns. If I open the emails in the web interface, the right "to" address is shown at the correct spot in the top bars. But the list view remains wrong.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If this is a bug, I can easily help by reproducing it.</span></p>

    <title>Zune device not connecting to my computer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Zune device not connecting to my computer</h2>
                    
<p>I got a 30 GB Zune for Christmas and everything's been working swell with it since. However, just tonight I ran into a very frustrating problem.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, I plug my Zune into my computer today and it won't show up in my Zune software. The battery icon on the Zune shows the "lightning bolt," then it disappears, off and on.</p>
<p>I uninstalled the Zune software and reinstalled it, it didn't help. I reset the Zune device, that didn't help. Worried that it was the Zune itself somehow damaged, I connected it to my Xbox 360, but that instantly recognized it, connected it, and was playable.</p>
<p>When I plug my Zune into any of my PC's four USB slots, my pointer arrow does nothing but flicker the hour glass on and off as nothing happens. I guessed it was something USB related, but other USB devices of mine work in it. This is really baffling me because
 everything was working perfectly fine as recent as last night. Also, if I go to 'update software' in the Zune program, I get error message C00D11CD.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you.</p>

            <p>I had the same problem. What i did was press all the buttons at the same time (the on/off button, the button on the side of the zune, home button (the one in the middle)) you press and hold. After a few second a picture should pop up of a computer and at
 the bottom it will tell you to plug you zune in to the computer, after you plug the zune in follow the instructions. Doing this will take everything off of your zune but you have the option of re-synching. All your highscores and achievements&nbsp;from the apps
 will be erased.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helped. </p>

<h2>            Bluetooth Connection problem between BH-105 and 5730</h2>
                    Hi guys. I got a problem with my BH-105. I tried to connect my 5730 with my BH-105 using bluetooth, but for some strange reason, it doesn't seem to be able to detect it. I managed to connect using a Nokia 6500 Slide and even a Samsung Preston. The 5730
 is able to connect with the other 2 phones with bluetooth but not with the BH-105. Help please...

    <title>Word keeps breaking links to image files. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markhardiman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word keeps breaking links to image files.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I've recently converted back to Word after using Latex for my PhD thesis. I like to edit my images in .eps format and when I add them to my Document I like to use the "Link to file" option as it keeps the document size low (cloud storage on slow connection)
 and allows me to edit the .eps files externally in Illustrator without having to worry about re-embedding them in the document afterwards.<br />
<br />
In order to add images to my document in this way I go to:<br />
<br />
Pictures -&gt; Insert -&gt; *select EPS file* -&gt; Insert (dropdown) -&gt; Link to file.<br />
<br />
I have noticed from going to File -&gt; Edit links to Files, that I need to do this twice for every image since after the first time they embed in the document as normal for some reason. But that's fine.<br />
<br />
The issues I'm currently having is that occasionally when I save, the majority of my images (but not all !?!) suddenly become embedded in the document, leading to a large file size and confusion as to what files are linked.<br />
<br />
Is there a reason for this or a better way of doing this that I'm missing?<br />
<br />
Advanced thanks for the help.<br />
<br />
Mark</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. Yes that is the procedure I use to insert all the images. I have been using the "Edit links to files" option to check if the images are linked or not. I have 20 images in my document and when I save the links are broken for 16 images
 and 4 images remain linked. I have re-linked all the images twice and it happened again. I have not tried using other formats but I have given up on this feature now since it is clearly broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark</p>

            It may be that your Office installation, rather than the 'feature' is broken. Have you tried repairing Office (via the Control Panel)?

<h2>            &#91;N95&#93; US - No New Firmware v12</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have an unlocked N95, downloaded the latest Nokia Software Updater and I still do not get the latest firmware, I am still getting v11.0.026 as the latest.<br />
<br />
I asked before and was explained about a kind of sequence that eventually will reach my phone, does anyone knows how long usually it takes to be available to an US unlocked phones?<br />
<br />
Does works to use a SOCKS proxy in UK and run the Updater? or definitely is something stored in the phone.<br />
<br />
Thanks

<h2>            Excel Workbook Share in SharePoint Cannot be Edited by Members on Excel Desktop Application</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to ask you for help fix the problem of the shared Excel edited by a lot of people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my company, we are using Office 365 to speed up and facilitate our work. Unfortunately, recently, it seems the online Office is giving us frustration and headache. In my department, Training Department, we use a shared Excel workbook which we locate it
 in our SharePoint Group. We share it through OneDrive for Business in hope that everyone in the team can do their report on the same workbook. However, although the setting is set to allow everyone to edit, everyone cannot do that. When opening the file on
 the Excel desktop application, the file shows "Read-Only". We cannot save change to that workbook in the SharePoint, and it asks us to save as a copy to our computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Upload center of the OneDrive show that the saved file is failed to upload because it is locked by another user.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Please look at the image below.&nbsp;<br />

<p>
</p><p>I try to find the solution, but it seems to be beyond my existing knowledge. Or, maybe it is a problem of a new update by Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
