    <title>Media Player in Windows 7 Home Premium will not start - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomaspeery  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media Player in Windows 7 Home Premium will not start</h2>
                    <p>When attempting to start Media Player there is a brief flicker of the screen. That is it. I have turned the Media Player feature off, restarted and back on with the same result. I do not have an install CD as I have inherited the computer. I am hesitant
 to delete the Media Player folder. Will it re-install itself?</p>
<p>Is there a "Fix-it" tool available for this issue in 2017 or has this been eliminated?</p>

<p>Hi - when you turned off WMP did you remember to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
click OK and reboot</span> - after both turning off and back on? If you're sure you did that correctly the next thing to try would be a system</p>
<p>file check. Run the instructions for W7 from this link... If this does not find an issue you may be looking at user account corruption. Deleting folders won't help.... Try SFC and update. - Ric.</p>

<p>Thanks for responding. Yes to both "OKs" and Yes to both restarts. So I ran System File Checker and that did not restore Media Player.</p>
<p>I went through the features instructions again and deleted the Media Player Folder from C:\Program files and turned it back on in&nbsp;Windows Features and it still does not work. Can I use a Windows 7 Pro installation disc to Repair Files? I have one of those
 available.</p>

<p>Sorry for the slight delay... when you ran SFC did it find <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
any</span> violations? If so it may need running several times. However it does sound like a clean install of Windows may be needed. That's a bit out of my comfort zone and really a topic for a different forum section.</p>
<p>You could try the new <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">user account test</span> (Control Panel - User Accounts) the guest account won't do - you'll need to set up a new account and see if WMP installs correctly there. If it does then the problem will
 be corruption in your user account... that again will require some level of reinstall/repair</p>

<p>I'm on W10 so the link for W7 is not immediately available to me but usually Windows will automatically link you to&nbsp;according to your system so try it anyway!</p>
<p>Update on what happens with a new UA - we can decode on the next best move then... Ric.</p>

            <p>Hi, saad5241.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have actually <span>3 GB of physical RAM. Since, you are using a third party application to check RAM status of your phone, it's not detecting the whole allocation of your physical RAM and it is only showing the allotted RAM you can use for your apps.
 The 1gb RAM is allocated for your OS, GPU and some System Services.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, some apps posted on Microsoft Store are not updated by Developers. You might want to check it with them as well for the apps your using to check your RAM status.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope we provide enough information.</span></p>

            <p>Storing data on the desktop is in any case a very bad idea.</p>
<p>Mail moved/copied from MS&nbsp; Outlook to an external source will be saved as a msg file, which can only be opened in MS Outlook. You cannot in any case move an Outlook Folder and its contents to an external source.</p>

<li>Google has fixed server search on Windows Phone.

            Thanks for that heads up. It was rolled out for me here on the Canadian East Coast as of last night.<br />
<br />
Some people are also pointing out that there may only be an English version of the page for the time being, so maybe that's an issue with the rollout as well.<br />

<p>Hi Robby,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my test, in SharePoint app on my android device, I can view managed metadata column in SharePoint list, but I cannot edit them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you cannot view this column, to help you investigate the issue, we would like to collect the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What is the version of your SharePoint app?</li><li>What does your list look like in android app and on your computer?<span>&nbsp; </span>
Please provide the screenshot of the list from your SharePoint app on android and your computer.</li><li>If possible, to test, please create managed metadata column in another list in a different site collection and check if you can see the column.
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Neha</p>

<h3> cadhead  say:</h3>
<h2>            Accidentally pressed install&#47;download button instead of scrolling down to ISOs on webpage</h2>
                    <p>It's my fault. But I followed the directions to hide the Windows 10 update and a day later it popped up. I read you could delete the directory where updates are stored, but that is not a very wise decision.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the filename of the Windows 10 update so I can just delete that one without messing up my Windows 7 install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also fear that when the next Windows 7 update comes, Windows 10 will try to install again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running the ISO in Virtual Box with no problems, and I can see my self purchasing Windows 10 someday.</p>

<p>

            I am not Sandro. The only thing I am grateful for is that you folks have to work with software that is as sorry as that which you provide to your customers. I despise Microsoft 365. I despise the new Word.docx. And to attempt to change the payment option
 is impossible. I have tried for 2 days. So I guess I will be unable to use Microsoft 365.

<h2>            Can&#39;t run mail merges after upgrade to 16.9</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">I updated Office for my Mac to 16.9. And since I did this, all of my mail merges are broken.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">When I try to open a mail merge document in Word, I receive the following message:</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">If it was simply a matter of clicking "Yes" then this would be annoying but not an issue. But clicking "Yes" usually just freezes my computer. Or if it eventually does work, it prompts me to find the data source, only to give me
 this warning again after I locate it. When I click Yes again, it prompts me to find the data source again. Other times, I've received the error that Word is unable to read the data source.</p>

<p>Hi Jerry:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I sent you a message with more details but cannot see it now so perhaps it was deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to be with the Excel workbook text converter. It hangs, freezes and ultimately crashes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried it with both existing data files and an Excel spreadsheet I created specifically as a test. Both yielded the same set of errors. &nbsp; I have also now had another person running 16.9 try it as well on their copy and they also experienced the problem.
 That leads me to believe it's a problem that transcends my personal circumstances.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
I did discover a temporary workaround. I downgraded my Excel file to an XLS file and the problem disappeared. So I have a temporary—if unsatisfactory—workaround.</p>

<h2>            Browsing network shares outside of Office works, browsing to same network folders within Office really slow</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a machine that is causing the user an issue when they are browsing through network shares within the Office 2016 apps (Word and Excel used the most). The folders list appears really slowly using File &gt; Open &gt; Browse. Some can be viewed initially
 and then the rest load a few at a time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the user is navigating to the same network folder using file explorer the full list of folders appears straight away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone come across this before? We have looked at a few different things including doing an office repair and then a full office uninstall and reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue occurs when browsing files locally, it means that the problem might be on the Office application itself. However, since it happens when browsing to a shared drive, the issue might be on the network. Office applications are having difficulties
 fetching the documents due to data traffic. With that being said, I highly suggest that you contact your administrator to check what's blocking the user to load the files using the Office application/s through a network drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have questions, please don't hesitate to post back.</p>

<p>Hi Jomel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. We have checked software on the PC such as anti-virus by temporarily disabling real-time scanning and has made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not that the files are not loading, the list of files and folders are taking their time to fully populate when browsing the network share within the application. The same applies when they are saving a template or a new document as a different document
 within the network share.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>Rob.</p>

</p><p>Hello ChupunguManzei,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each Office subscription is only designated for a specific country or region. This issue is called Geo blocked and the reason why you're experiencing this is because it detects the IP Address of the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span>I would highly recommend you to contact<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Microsoft Answer Desk</a> so they can provide you an alternative product key that you can use while you are still
 in Zambia. Just let them know that you are not able to use Office application due to Geo blocked. Make sure that you have your product key with you when you contact them so they can be able to provide the alternative one. If you're not familiar with the product
 key for your Office application, you can log in to your Account page through this
<a href="https://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you have any other concern, feel free to reply on this thread. </p>

    <title>E71 memory card &#38;quot&#59;disappears&#38;quot&#59; and returns - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elarroude  say:</h3>
<h2>            E71 memory card &#38;quot&#59;disappears&#38;quot&#59; and returns with glitches</h2>
                    I've been having trouble with my MicroSD 2GB memory card that came with my phone. I've downloaded applications, games, books etc. to my memory card and created folders to arrange them.<br />
<br />
From time to time, however, the memory card seems to "disappear" from the phone (i.e., none of the installed applications or music files etc. are visible). When I physically take out the card and put it back in, the files are usually (not always) visible again,
 but:<br />
<br />
1) ocasionally the icons for applications aren't right -- they all look like the "Installat." icon in the menu (to solve this I repeat the process of taking the card out and putting it back in).<br />
<br />
2) sometimes the files (especially more recent ones) are all out of place (not in the folders to which I had moved them) and I have to move them all over again.<br />
<br />
This "disappearance" almost always occurs when I turn the phone on (and then removing and reinserting the card is usually successful), and also when I remove an application (and then I usually get the files out of place).<br />
<br />
Has anyone experienced similar problems? I would appreciate any assistance with this.<br />
<br />
To anticipate a few questions that may be related:<br />
<br />
a) Yes, I do get the "Remove memory card and press OK" message (covered here: 
/discussions/board/message?board.id=communicators&amp;thread.id=27831), but only when I am physically removing and reinserting the card.<br />
<br />
b) Yes, I do get the "Unable to complete installation from memory card..." error (covered here:

/discussions/board/message?board.id=communicators&amp;thread.id=23988) when I reinsert the card (or when I turn the phone on and there was no "disappearance"). I began to get this message very early on (although I can't say for sure if from day 1 or not). I
 have not applied alexjx's suggestion in message 11 of that thread, because I'm not yet convinced it's safe, but I suspect this error may be connected to the issue I'm facing.<br />
<br />
c) Yes, I have checked out the "Nokia E51/E71 losing email messages/settings on memory card" thread (covered here:

/discussions/board/message?board.id=messaging&amp;thread.id=11781) and there may be a connection between that problem and this one, but I haven't been able to identify it.<br />
<br />
Hope someone knows how to solve or at least work around this disappearing memory card issue. Between this and the others mentioned above, the memory cards seem somewhat unreliable.<br />
<br />
Thanks!

            Hi,<br />
<br />
besides that it could be hardware problem with the phone itself, have you tried to use a different memory card?<br />
<br />
I'm using a SanDisk 8GB MicroSDHC class 6 card on my E71 and I never had any of the problems you describe (not on the old SW version 100.x and also not on the newer 110.x version).<br />
<br />
So if you have a chance to test a different memory card, I think it's worth a try.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I think our problem has something to do with the E71 hardware contruction itself.<br />
<br />
The phone is superb, but I am also having the same problem. It is not software related for sure.<br />
<br />
The best thing to do is to return the phone to the nearest Nokia Care center for repair. I will be bringing my phone soon as well.<br />
<br />
good luck.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I had the same problem. I think (not really sure) it started happening after I used bluetooth to transfer files to the memory card directly from my Macbook.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I solved it by formatting the memory card (through the phone option. Go Tools &gt; Memory card &gt; Options &gt; Format memory card). Do a full backup of the phone, just in case). Reinstall all applications that were there (you can dload most of the preinstalled
 stuff from Nokia, use the phone to do it).<br />
<br />
After doing this, I've never encountered that problem again (more than a month now).<br />
<br />
I've never tried to bluetooth transfer files from a laptop again for fear of the problem coming back. I use PC Suite for that now.<br />
<br />
Good luck :-)

            I have an E71-2, product code 0569371, firmware 100.07.76.<br />
<br />
I've been having similar problems with a memory card, in this case a 4GB PQI microSDHC card (Class 6).<br />
<br />
About once a week or so, the phone all of a sudden can't find the files on the memory card, says the card is corrupt, and asks me if I want to reformat. If I restart the phone at this point, (turn it off then on again) everything comes back.<br />
<br />
I bought a new memory card (PNY brand, 4GB microSDHC, class 4) to see if the problem goes away. After nearly a week with the new card, I haven't seen any problems, so I hope switching to a different card has cured my particular problem.<br />
<br />
Does this sound similar to what you've been seeing?

            Thank you all for responding!<br />
<br />
freebird123, apparently mportuesi and gerabast have tried your suggestion, but with very different outcomes (I myself have not tried it yet) -- maybe it depends on the brand of the memory card?<br />
<br />
wst7, I'll keep in mind your idea of formatting the card, as a next-to-last resort (and if THAT doesn't work, I follow rheicel's advice to take the phone to a Nokia Care center). I bluetoothed some data from my former phone to this one early on, but I can't
 say for sure if the problem began before or after that (and I don't really know if they're connected).<br />
<br />
mportuesi, your description sounds familiar. Lately, I haven't been experiencing the "out of place" files so much (problem #2), but the card still "disappears" when I turn the phone off and back on. When I open my menu to see if the files are there (and they
 aren't), I see that the "Tools" item is marked (as when signaling that something is in use) and when I click on it I see that the "Encryption" item is marked. When I click on that, I get a message saying "This memory card is encrypted but the phone encryption
 is off. Decrypt this memory card?" If I select "Yes", the next message is "Memory card encrypted with another key. To decrypt it, import its key. Importing the new key will destroy the current key in driver. Continue?" Although that sounds scary, I've risked
 it -- and get the message "No keys found" (which is not all that surprising, since I never encrypted the card in the first place). Then I just exit "Encryption" (with both phone and card set to "off" ). I get the same result if I just select "No" to the first
 question.<br />
<br />
At this point I look for my files again, and they're not there. I remove and reinsert the card, and sometimes nothing shows up, so I try again, and sometimes get problem #1 (the files are there but the icons aren't right). I try yet again, and finally find
 the files with the right icons. By the way, now I haven't been getting the "Unable to complete installation from memory card..." message when I reinsert the card.<br />
<br />
It doesn't always take three tries, and ends up working, but it's still pretty annoying. I think rheicel's right: this feels like a hardware problem.<br />
<br />
I hope this detailed description is helpful. I'll keep watching what happens over the next couple of weeks and post results to this discussion.<br />
<br />
Cheers!

            I see that same thing with the Encryption menu with my lexar 4gb memory card. Every time I turn on my E71 (I turn it off at night) it will always go to the encryption menu. I tell it 'no' and don't seem to have any problems with it.<br />
<br />
I don't know WHY it does but. It is kinda annoying to keep telling it 'no' but I only have to do it once every morning when I turn on my phone.

<p>Updates on the problem: turning the phone off and back on is still almost invariably followed by the "Encryption" issue described in message 9. The "Unable to complete installation from memory card..." message has not been appearing when I reinsert the card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the "files out of place" issue&nbsp;(problem #2) has&nbsp;been occurring often -- now more often when I&nbsp;install an application too (but sometimes also when removing one or simply when reinserting the card). In addition, some files are also missing at this point,
 but magically reappear at a later point (and are still out of place). Removing and reinserting the card is not helpful (haven't tried it 10x...) and neither is turning the phone off and on again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is very annoying AND troublesome -- not happy to reorganize many files just because I installed something new. I would love to find a workaround that doesn't involve formatting the card. Has anyone tried encrypting the card to see if that helps?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/b7a058c4-655b-4b15-83ad-55cf3a7ca712" title="LeeArmstrong1">
<p>
</p><p>It might be best to close the accounts that you will not use, however since there are credits and auto-recharge involved you have to cancel all recurring payments first and send the credits to the account you will use moving forward.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cancel <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA633/what-is-skype-auto-recharge-and-how-does-it-work?q=auto-recharge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">auto-recharge</a></strong> by following the steps below.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Sign in to My Account on the Skype website. </li><li>Go to <strong><a href="http://www.skype.com/go/autorecharge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a></strong>.
</li><li>Select <strong>Disable</strong> to turn off Auto-recharge. </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>After disabling auto-recharge then proceed with <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12197/how-can-i-give-skype-credit-as-a-gift-to-my-friends-and-family?q=gift" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">sending your credits as a gift</a></strong>.
 Follow these steps. </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Add the accounts as contacts.</li><li>Once the accounts are part of your contact list, use the <strong><a href="http://go.skype.com/send.credit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">send Skype Credit link</a></strong>.
<strong>Note</strong>: You have to do this on the account where the credits are. </li><li>Select the amount of credit you’d like to send. If you don’t have enough Skype Credit in your account, you’ll be prompted to buy more first.</li><li>Choose a gift card design. Your contact will receive the card with the gift.</li><li>Click the <strong>Confirm selection</strong> button. </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you successfully cancel the recurring payment and sent the credits as&nbsp;a gift, you may proceed with cancelling the other accounts. Please be informed that closing a Skype account will close its associated Microsoft account as well that is why it is very
 important to read through the list of things you need to consider before you proceed. You can find the list and the step-by-step guide on this FAQ.
<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA142/how-do-i-close-my-skype-account?q=close" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I close my Skype account?</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once an account has been marked for closure, there will be a<strong> 60-day waiting period</strong> before the account is completely removed from Skype's database. During this period, the account is still searchable but is considered inactive. Should you
 change your mind regarding the closure, you can cancel it anytime by logging in to the account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Let us know if you have questions. </p>

    <title>Permission Issues in 10074 and 10122 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williamtrotter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Permission Issues in 10074 and 10122</h2>
                    <p>I've now installed build 10074 and upgraded to 10122 five times, and as soon as this machine finishes the process of building a bootable flash drive, I'll be going for number 6. &nbsp;Not every install has used exactly the same steps. &nbsp;On some, I've installed
 a bunch of support software and then done the upgrade. &nbsp;On others, I've patched the basic 10074 by updating the time zone/clock, setting the power options and fully patching/updating 10074. &nbsp;As soon as the upgrade window</p>
<p>with basic settings shows all clear, I toggle from "slow" to "fast" and then install 10122. &nbsp;Now here is my question. &nbsp;With certain combinations of steps, I run into</p>
<p>what I believe are permission issues. &nbsp;To be specific, the last three installs, on three different machines, all get to the stage where I am asked to enter my Microsoft user login and password. &nbsp;After a brief delay, I get a reboot and arrive back at the
 same make user step. &nbsp;I try to enter my Microsoft identity info a second time</p>
<p>and I'm dropped to what we used to call a "local account" sequence. &nbsp;Now I enter an alternative user and the machine boots into that individual. &nbsp;I do the minimal steps necessary to get to a reboot, and now by other identity, the real me, shows as a login
 issue. &nbsp;Of course, that's the option I take.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*However*, even though the Administrative management tool shows that I am an administrator, I must be less than fully powered. Certain actions, such as over-riding a license file during a software install fail. &nbsp;Also, most recently Windows Live Essentials
 won't install (it works when done in 10074). &nbsp; This seems to suggest that there are some subtle permission issues with administrative users created at install time who are not first when the actual first boot is done. &nbsp;Am I right on this? &nbsp;Has anyone else
 had these kinds of problems?<br />

            Thanks very much! But there seem to be something wrong with syntax. From where in Excel I could check the name of that chart &nbsp;that I'm linking?

<div>This doesn't work:</div>

<div><span><b>LINK&nbsp; Excel.Chart.8 "C:\\path\\excel_file.xlsx" "Chart 1"</b></span></div>
<div><span><b><br />
</b></span></div>
<div><span><b><br />
</b></span></div>
<div><span>... and this works fine</span></div>

            Hi DavidBURN2 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. Try following to delete them -
<br />
<br />Open Skype application &gt; Right click on the contact / conversation &gt; View profile &gt; Scroll down &gt; Remove from Contact list
<br />
<br />If you still face a problem, you can delete a contact through Web Skype as well. - Can you login to Web Skype (only Edge/Chrome browsers) and follow the above steps.
<br />

<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.
