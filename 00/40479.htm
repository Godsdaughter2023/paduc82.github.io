<h2>            My gamescore has changed overnight..</h2>
                    Hello, I've been directed here from the xbox live chat support with hopes to fix my problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Last night I had 985 thousand gamescore, I set up happy dungeons so I could leave it afk over night (as only needed 7 hours playtime for my final achievement.) I woke up this morning to pop the achievement, it was 1250/1250 so I turned the xbox of to go get
 breakfast.&nbsp; Now upon loading my xbox up, I have 639,525 gamescore and most of my games, including happy dungeons read as 0/1000 Gamescore.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have tried all the steps of removing accounts, power cycles and so on, with no change to my gamescore, tho strangely enough, my " monthly gamescore" changed from 15 thousand (which was correct) up to 23,150.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Can anyone help with this issue?&nbsp;

            It is a glitch and happened to me last year. I did the same thing as you to no avail. However, it will return to normal in a few days. I think it took mine 3 days so don't fret. You still have your score.

<h2>            Pinned Items on taskbar not opening</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>So i have been having this problem for like a year now. I wish I could go back to windows 8 because it was brilliant and I am highly dissatisfied with windows 10 but sadly i have to deal since it forced me to update to it.. Anywho, my problem now is that
 any pinned and recent items that i have do NOT open the application. As a matter of fact it doesn't even do a thing. I have tried nearly EVERY attempt to fix this to NO avail. Please help! I feel like there might be something else wrong and i just haven't
 found it yet. There is just no reason for it to have done this. I tried ShellExView trying to find if it was a third party software/app causing this to happen, but HERE is the kicker!! -&gt; Pinned Items open just like they are supposed to when i BOOT into SAFEMODE!!
 Plain safemode and it works, It worked temporarily as well when I made a new account on local but UNFORTUNATELY the darn thing forced me to combine it with my original and that screwed that up again. This is driving me crazy to the point I hate using this
 computer. I just borrow someone elses or use my phone. Mainly because I am stubborn and if there is something not working right I will push myself to find a solution.. ugh. Please some one help!? Please don't link me to another "answer" because believe me
 when i say, I have done everything except factory reset, which i shouldn't have to do anyway because whatever didn't boot up in safemode helped it work properly. The problem is I can't find what software or app or whatever it is so I can get rid of it so my
 pinned and recent items start opening there respective applications properly again. Thanks in advance. Please help!</p>

            <p>i have reinstalled windows 10 through recovery or an install package several times. Didn't work. I do not know how to reinstall Explorer.exe since this was the first thing that stopped working properly. Everything on the task bar now does not allow me to
 open pinned items, remove them or add them. Recent items show up and disappear at random. It worked at first when windows 10 first installed (without my permission). But then an update came along and broke it. I have NO idea which update, I have had this problem
 for so long now I don't remember exactly when it happened. I have done SFC and another thing that went along with that. It says there is nothing wrong. Which frustrates me. I have never done clean boot but I have had bad luck with laptops I really don't like
 doing things like that. By the way my Mother's new computer had windows 10 preinstalled and this function I am having trouble with, does NOT effect hers. Everyone else's computer in my family that has windows 10, pinned items (right clicking on the program
 on the task bar) works properly. It frustrates me that this is only happening to mine. Like I said above, i booted in safemode and the function works properly.&nbsp;</p>

 persists I hope there is something else that could fix this:</p>

<p>Seems likely since the kinect stuff for Fable 3 never actually happened and Lionhead has definitely been working with kinect, and I'm sure MS wants them to put an actual product out rather than show of the same old tech demo again of Milo.</p>
<p>I don't like motion gaming, and the Fable games get a little bit worse with every game, so meh.</p>

<h2>            &#34;The computer restarted unexpectedly or encountered an unexpected error.&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>I am reinstalling Windows 7 on my computer. I have used thsi same disc probably 3 or 4 times already on the same computer. This is just a regular reinstall. The disc is retail. I got it at the Windows 7 launch event from Microsoft.</p>
<p>The install runs and then the computer restarts. It goes through the rest of the list, "Completing installation..." and then suddenly shuts down. When I turn the computer back on I get:</p>
<p>"The computer restarted unexpectedly or encountered an unexpected error. Windows installation cannot proceed. To install Windows, click 'OK' to restart the computer, and then restart the installation."</p>
<p>No matter how many times I go through the installation this always happens. I have tried 2 different hard drives. I have also tried running chkdsk, no errors. I also updated the BIOS.</p>
<p>Here is perhaps the weirdest thing: I can successfully install Vista. No errors when installing Vista. Again, my Win7 disc is retail directly from MS and has been used before on the same computer.</p>

<p>First did you go to the motherboard manufacture's support web site and download and install the Windows 7 device drivers? Same for your ATI or NVIDIA graphics card.</p>
<p>Yes I know you mentioned the system is stable with Vista but I've included a set of test tools I use for every computer I build (or repair).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are OverClocking or use any automatic overclocking BIOS features, Intel EIST or Turbo Mode (Disable it),&nbsp;<br />
then drop back to the stock speed as a starting point.</p>
<p><strong>First try running Memtest86+,</strong> this runs from a boot disk or CD and should eliminate or<br />
confirm if your one or more of your memory sticks are bad or the SPD values in the BIOS are correct.<br />
Let it run for as long as you can: 2,4,6,8 or more hours, if no errors by then your ram is OK.<br />

<p>Hard drive Testing - Bootable CD:<br />
If you have a new Seagate hard drive the very next thing would be to download Seagate's Seatools (the bootable CD) and check for bad sectors:<a href="http://www.seagate.com/ww/v/index.jsp?locale=en-US&amp;name=SeaTools&amp;vgnextoid=720bd20cacdec010VgnVCM100000dd04090aRCRD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.seagate.com/ww/v/index.jsp?locale=en-US&amp;name=SeaTools&amp;vgnextoid=720bd20cacdec010VgnVCM100000dd04090aRCRD</a><br />
For Western Digital drives use WdDiag: <a href="http://support.wdc.com/product/download.asp?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.wdc.com/product/download.asp?lang=en</a></p>
<p>If you have a copy of Windows XP around try installing it temporary (if not Windows 7 will work as well)<br />
"No need to activate as you get a 30 day grace period which is perfect for testing"<br />
and then use the following tools (this assumes the memtest shows no failures)</p>
<p>Device Drivers: Did you install the motherboard manufacture's latest device drivers? Check their support site for the latest drivers as the CD that came with the motherboard may have older less stable drivers.</p>
<p>Check the Graphics card manufacture's download site for the most recent Windows 7 drivers for your card.<br />

<p>Some manufacture's now supply driver that are both Vista and Windows 7 compatible.</p>
<p>I suggested the tools only because I've found that Windows 7 in some cases is less tolerant of marginal systems.</p>
<p>Also if you have a BD drive that has been a known problem.</p>

            <p>Programs that support parallelism in CPU's is a very rare and complex thing to do right now. Its something farely new in the industry. A lot of the best programmers are still figuring out how to take advantage of multi-core CPU's.

<h2>            Outlook has disappeared from the Mail app&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased Windows 8.&nbsp; Why I first used the Mail app, it was labeled "Outlook" and all my past Hotmail mail was there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suddenly, the Mail app no longer says Outlook - it is labeled "Hotmail", and all my past mails no longer show.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why did Outlook change to Hotmail in the Mail app, and how do I get it back to Outlook?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also sees as if the app has reverted to the Win 8 demo I once had.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using Settings, I tried adding my Outlook account to the (what is now a) Hotmail app, however it would not allow me to do so.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>sounds like you just changed your account, you can have multiple mail accounts on one Microsoft account.</p>
<p>Open you mail app, on the left top you see Hotmail correct?</p>
<p>One bottom left should be several option (up to the number of accounts you set up)</p>
<p>One selection should be Outlook (or whatever you called the folder)</p>
<p>Click on it and you should see all you old files and folders.</p>
<p>If you are still having issues, let me know</p>

<div>Hi Eddie, thanks for your help.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The Mail app doesnt show my Outlook account. &nbsp;When I try to add an Outlook account, using settings, it won't allow me to. &nbsp;I was able to add a Gmail account with no problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The biggest mystery to me is, when I first installed Win8, instead of the Mail app being labled "Outlook" in the upper left corner, it now says "Hotmail". &nbsp;The color is even different (before, it was blue).</div>
<div><br />
<div>I included a couple of photos which show what the app should look like, and what mine looks like, which may help to see what I am talking about. &nbsp;Follow this link...</div>

            <p>I lost my Outlook Mail when I refreshed my system - (Win. 8.1); it was much like the older Windows Mail /Outlook styles. Now all I get is this new Mail app, or have to go online for web access to all email. This sucks! I hate 8, 8.1 and very disgusted with
 Micorsoft right now!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why so many problems with email? "It was not broken; so why did they try and fix it"? Just trying to mimmick what Apple does - apps, etc. ? Is Windows still running on a DOS platform - anyone??</p>

The Microsoft Virtual WiFi Miniport Adapter and Microsoft Virtual WiFi Miniport Adapter #2 are a part of My WiFi Technology.<br />
<br />
Try reading the thread at...<br />

<br />
<br />
And this will lead you to the drivers and how to install. Without knowing which wireless adapter you have, it's best to follow the instructions to install.<br />

            It seems to me that the Skype free 60 minutes get attached to the account which has subscribed to Office 365. It doesn't get attached to the accounts with whom the subscription has been shared.
<br />
<br />Microsoft documentation is silent on this fine point.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the causes for this WiFi issue is due to outdated drivers. We suggest that you update your Surface and Windows for optimal performance. if the issue still persists and you are in the U.S. region, we suggest that you visit the nearest Microsoft Store
 in your area.</p>

            I've never been so dissatisfied with a purchase. Your solution is for me to drive 30-40 miles to one of 2 limited choices for locations to wait in line at a Microsoft store in my metro area. For an obviously defective product that has experienced these
 issues since it came out of the box. A tablet that cannot maintain connectivity.&nbsp;

<p><span><span>We'll need to do a general troublehooting to see if we can identify and resolve the problem.<span>&nbsp; You may need to use the disk to do some of these procedures.&nbsp;
 Skip any you can't do because you can't access the drive (and come back to them one access is re-established.&nbsp; Can you get in using Safe Mode?&nbsp; Can you get in using the disk.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</a><span>.&nbsp; Be sure to check the box
 to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should be able to restore with
 no problems.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (you may need to do this from another computer)<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;startup (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer –
 or typing eventvwr from the command prompt starting from C:\Windows\System32).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></a><span>. &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p>Hopefully this information will help us identify and/or resolve the problem.&nbsp; If none of them work, we'll try something else.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h3> deamonomic  say:</h3>
<h2>            100&#37; disk usage problem</h2>
                    hello everyone :P ive been struggling with a 100% disk usage issue bogging down my PC. As far as I can tell, this issue occurs when I open the Xbox App on my Desktop. Disk usage might be around 10% before the App is opened and goes to 98-100% until the
 App is closed. Ive tried doing a number of the fixes you find by googling this issue but none of it has fixed my issue. I am running this on a older PC (by old i mean its about 10 years old at this point) So im wondering if this is a sign to get a new hard
 drive or if there is something I can do to stop it&nbsp;

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />First try these fixes which are working most for 100% disk usage in Windows 10:  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/how-to-fix-100-disk-usage-in-windows-10/7c5c979b-0ed0-4855-b9b8-05b9499533e2">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/fix-100-disk-usage-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/fix-100-disk-usag...</a>
<br />
<br />You can next reset Xbox app to see if it helps at Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Xbox &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Reset.  
<br />
<br />Then if that doesn't help you can reinstall it from Option Two here <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />Next Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />If you want to replace the hard drive I'd choose an SSD which is lightning fast - faster than a new higher end PC without one.  Then do the install above with all other drives unplugged. 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            If you are able to run Windows 10 on a 10 year old computer I am frankly amazed. 
<br />
<br />No, I don' think that replacing the HD would fix the problem. I strongly suspect the XBox application as not working well with Windows 10.  Frankly, I wouldn't spend any money upgrading a machine that old. Any machine you spend more than a couple of hundred bucks on will have similar or better performance, and be new.

<h2>            video editing</h2>
                    <p>hello Community,</p>
<p>I have a feeling that WMM (not live version) may&nbsp; - &nbsp; (as one member put it - everything has its time ) &nbsp; &nbsp; needs to be replaced for me. &nbsp;&nbsp; I have been loving it for many years &nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; overcoming the many problems it seems to produce.</p>
<p>However this time I am really stuck (blank screen importing videos )&nbsp; and I am wondering if any other members have tried alternative video editing programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I note there are many, so expect everyone DOES have a favourite, &nbsp;&nbsp; but hoping a few suggestions would be a helpful start. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>My concerns are;- &nbsp;&nbsp; ease of use, &nbsp;&nbsp; and I guess this means fewer features</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; ability to fade the sound, &nbsp; (wmm doesn't really do this)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; output to DVD</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; text on pictures and credits</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; chopping up any video imports</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; conversion from .mov software included</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; suitable with windows 10</p>
<p>thankyou for helping.</p>

<p>Most modern video editing programs today will be able to do all the things you mentioned, even better than Movie Maker. They have the ability to fade sound, add text/pictures/credits, import .mov format, etc. In addition they have many features that Movie
 Maker doesn't have such as overlaying pictures or video on top of another, cutting away to different video but keep audio going, color correction, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most often the tradeoff is ease of use, so that may take some work on your part to learn the features. Assuming you want to look for something free, I'd start with
<a href="https://www.provideocoalition.com/free-video-editing-software-2017-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
ProVideoCoalition's 2017 Guide to Free Video Editing Software</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One sticking point may be authoring a DVD. You won't find that in most free video editors. Most editors treat that as a separate step and rely on separate software. These days, with HD video, most people are just streaming their video or storing it on hard
 disks, portable media devices or USB drives. The video DVD standard is viewed as outdated since it was created in the late 90s in the era of analog TVs and has a maximum resolution of 480p. If you are really looking to archive your completed movies, DVDs are
 not the best choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, if you are still committed to wanting to save a video DVD, look for freeware options like DVD Flick or DVD Styler. Or perhaps Freemake Video Converter which can also author a DVD along with its conversion capabilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thing worth mentioning is that Microsoft has announced that an upcoming Fall update to their Photos App will have a "Story Remix" feature that allows you to combine photos, videos and music much like the current Movie Maker 2012. Much like that
 version of Movie Maker, it will probably lean more towards a quick, easy to use program instead of one that allows you to make precise millisecond edits, audio fading, multiple video, etc.</p>

<p>Considerate-guy &nbsp; - &nbsp; thank you so much for your reply.</p>
<p>You have explained many things and I will read it several times whilst making decisions.</p>
<p>You make one particular point that DVD's may not be the best way to store the final video. &nbsp;&nbsp; I always make just the one video per year of the whole years photographs and have them on DVD thinking it the best way. &nbsp;&nbsp; This is so useful when showing to the
 family and friends. &nbsp;&nbsp; I thought that usb sticks were unreliable, &nbsp; CD's liable to a short shelf life, &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; so from what you are suggesting I just keep them on an external drive and carry it around as I would a DVD. &nbsp;&nbsp; (probably with some other back up !!?</p>
<p>Is this anything to do with my final video quite often has the edges of my pictures missing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most interesting that Microsoft are thinking video too. &nbsp;&nbsp; You are also correct that a free program is what I will be initially looking for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for all the other advice too,&nbsp;</p>
<p>very kind regards,&nbsp; David &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (with 80 year old brain )</p>

<p>I understand the convenience of a DVD in that you don't need a computer but just a standalone DVD player connected to a TV. For your needs, that may be just right so I don't want to discourage you in that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have some slightly more modern equipment (e.g. an HDTV and a Blu-ray player), then you can just burn the .wmv or .mp4 file that Movie Maker creates directly onto a disc (e.g. a DVD disc). This would not be in a format playable on a standard DVD player
 but would be understood by an HD device like the Blu-ray player. It would have better quality compared to a video DVD played in a DVD player. But again, no pressure to do that if a DVD is working for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to why you often see parts cutoff when using a DVD, the main cause is overscan. I'm sure you remember back to the advent of television with CRTs (cathode ray tubes). The picture is formed by electrons being "drawn" onto a screen over and over at a rate
 of 60Hz (or maybe 50Hz in Europe and other places). But because of the technology in CRTs, these scans would actually go beyond the edge of the screen as "overscan". So content near the edges would often not be seen. If you were a television station, you would
 just always make sure that you wouldn't put any important information, especially text, near the edges and so the viewer wouldn't really notice that they weren't seeing all the picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(43, 45, 50, 1)">So if CRTs are dead then why do we still have overscan? This is where the bad news comes in, but the short answer is because it used to be there. The source of the problem is that broadcasters expect
 the TV to crop the image so they don't mind putting garbage on the edge like a misc yellow line on the left or black and white dots along the top containing "metadata" such as captions, content ratings, show title, etc. To hide that, even modern HDTV manufacturers
 will often zoom in the content and not show the edges. It's happening less and less with HD broadcasts, but if you are using a standard-definition source (like a DVD player) it may still be zooming in the picture to hide these edges in the "overscan" area.
 The amount of overscan</span><span style="color: rgba(43, 45, 50, 1)">&nbsp;varies with the combinations of television and DVD players, so you may get different symptoms if you are playing it at home on your television or if you are going to a relative's
 house and using theirs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(43, 45, 50, 1)">Anyway, I hope that explains things. Let me know if there is any other knowledge I can impart on this or similar subjects.</span></p>

            Back to your original question, you mentioned needing to move on from Windows Movie Maker 6.0. I still use that program on a regular basis, even today on Windows 10, so it isn't really necessary to go away from it if it is doing what you need. The only
 problem I've seen is that when Windows 10 does a major update it rebuilds the Program Menu and it loses track of WMM 6.0 so I end up having to
<a href="https://goo.gl/B1eRC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reinstall Windows Movie Maker 6.0</a> each time and then repin it to the Start Menu and/or the Taskbar. It's not a big deal, but something to be aware of.

<p>Considerate Guy - thank you once again for help.</p>
<p>Yes, I have recently reinstalled WMM after it disappeared with major updates.</p>
<p>Your DVD advice was so good.</p>
<p>When I reinstalled it, it automatically picked up the pictures which I had imported on the story line&nbsp; before the update. &nbsp; I was surprised at this, expecting to have to start all over again.</p>
<p>This leads me to asking your good self for further help/advice as you seem so adept with my problems. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Somewhere on this Community (sorry I don't know where) I have asked about why my converted videos ( .mov to .wmv ) have a "available off line " tag
 &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp; so far not solved . </p>
<p>&nbsp; In addition,&nbsp; the imported videos won't play - just a black screen and causes WMM to stop working. &nbsp; &nbsp; I was wondering if lack of codecs could be the issue.</p>
<p>However I have used WMM for last years movie on same laptop (W10) and didn't have a problem. &nbsp; Used the same conversion prog too .</p>
<p>Just wondering if the codecs also disappear with the major update ? &nbsp;&nbsp; If so, where to find and which codecs should I use&nbsp; ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is mainly to enable me to continue with WMM &nbsp; - &nbsp; but I have listened to you and will try a new editing prog sometime, &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; kind regards, David</p>
<p>

<p>I'm not familiar with trying to sync external/network files to a local disk and using them in offline mode but in any case, I don't see why that should have any effect on how Movie Maker is able to use them or not. The only issue is that Movie Maker doesn't
 always like to deal with video on external drives since the drives can be removed from your system, so if you can, make sure you are dealing with source files on your main hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what you've said, you have some .mov files. First can you explain the source of these .mov files? Are they from a camera or camcorder? Were they download from the web? Were they created by a certain program? Were they converted from another format?
 Please provide as many details as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, it sounds like you converted them to .wmv format using a video conversion program to make them more "palatable" to Movie Maker which historically hasn't done well with .mov files. Can you provide any details on what steps you used to convert the .mov
 files? Which program are you using? Do you know how the file is getting encoded within the .wmv file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The .wmv file format is a container format. Think of it like an envelope. Generally video within it is encoded using one of the Windows Media formats, but it is possible to put other encodings within a .wmv file. So just because one .wmv works on your system,
 another may not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you able to just play the converted .wmv file directly in Windows Media Player? Can you add it to your Movie Maker collection and does it play there? Is it only when you move it to your timeline that you have problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the version of Movie Maker, is it <a href="https://goo.gl/B1eRC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Movie Maker 6.0</a>? Do you know if it is the 32-bit or 64-bit version? Do you remember where you installed it from?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, provide as many details as possible so I can try to figure out what is happening on your computer.</p>

<p>I don't know why they are getting a "available offline" tag, &nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp; not something I require, &nbsp; &nbsp; but all the original and conversions are on my main drive :c</p>
<p>Note another member has same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The .mov videos are from Panasonic camera &nbsp; and converted with Prism to .wmv &nbsp; (same as last years ).</p>
<p>They work fine on Media Player. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; It is when they are imported to WMM (6.0&nbsp; 64bit&nbsp; downloaded from Blainnes - again same as last year ) that they fail. &nbsp;&nbsp; The imported icon just shows a blank video symbol but NO picture, &nbsp; and a "windows movie maker is
 not responding" &nbsp; message&nbsp; and program just hangs. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is before trying to put them on&nbsp; story/time lines.</p>
<p>Don't know anything about how they get encoded &nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp; that's why I suggested lack of codecs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I repeat,&nbsp; same conversion prog and same WMM and same W10 laptop as last year.</p>

            Now you have a 'Edit, organize or Share' button. From there you can get Edit functions. Or within Photo Gallery double clcik a photo to get the Edit &gt; Adjustments. You can also add Adjustments to Quick Access toolbar.

            <p>Hi there,<br /><br />Remeeming errors are usually caused by issues on the account itself. Be sure to check your billing information at http://billing.microsoft.com and after that try redeeming the code on both xbox console and via xbox.com/redeemcode<br />If it is still not working properly please use http://support.xbox.com/error-code-lookup to search for any steps regarding the errorcode you are receiving.<br />If nothing is found then specify the full actual error message (and errorcode) you are receiving when trying to redeem the prepaid code they can help to determine a possible cause.<br /><br />Side note: Do not post any prepaid codes etc on the forums<br /><br /></p>

<h2>            Office 365 Home 2016 &#43; Skype for Business</h2>
                    
<p>I have looked in the Preview 2016 forums, and still no solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. My home PC has Office 365 Home 2016 fresh install today.</p>
<p>2. I use my home PC to communicate with work with Skype for Business as I have an Office 365 Business subscription (the one without the Office desktop lic) &nbsp;as well.</p>
<p>3. Skype for Business will no longer install with Office 365 2016 for Home.</p>
<p>I really don't understand....as I login with my home account for my office apps, and login with my work account for Lync , why can't they install side by side. I do not want to upgrade my home Office 365 to a business account just to do this.</p>
<p>Is there a Skype of Business stand alone installer?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ryan</p>

<p>Please advise,</p>
