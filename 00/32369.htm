<h2>            Responding to a call</h2>
                    <p>I used to use Skype without encountering any serious difficulties. I have now installed the new Skype (v. 8.12) on my Mac (with High Sierra, macOS 10.13.2), and have hit an absolutely major problem: I do not know how to answer an incoming video call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that if one of my contacts calls me, a screen should appear on which I can select 'Answer', 'Answer with video' or 'Decline'. But
<em>where </em>should this screen appear? I have never seen this screen. All that I have ever seen when a contact calls me is a green dot appearing under my contact's picture, presumably showing that the contact is active, and, of course, I hear the ringing
 sound. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I should be enormously grateful if someone could explain to me what I should do — what settings to choose and where, what button I should click, where I should look — so that I can answer the call. (So far I have had to arrange with my regular contacts that
 when they call me, I shall call them back to make contact.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 'Help' system has not helped at all, I am afraid.</p>

<p>Hi, Karen_E,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done exactly what you say, using AppCleaner to delete Skype so as to ensure that everything associated with Skype was removed. Because of the time difference between the UK and the
 USA, where my yesterday’s contact lives, and her work pattern, I have been unable to arrange a call from her again today, but I have arranged for another contact to call me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The result was worse than before: (1) No audible call signal was heard by me. (2) A green ‘active’ dot appeared against my contact’s name, but clicking on it did nothing.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I therefore tried calling him. That resulted in an audible signal at both his and my ends. When he picked it up I could see my own face on my screen, but he could neither see nor hear me.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>New problems have, furthermore, arisen as a result of deleting and reinstalling Skype. (1) Whereas before, under Contacts/Skype, I saw the 4 or 5 people with whom I have Skyped before, I now
 only see one. (2) Under Contacts/All, there are a few names, most of which I have never come across, but with whom, allegedly, I have contacts in common. The one I do know is shown as having one contact in common with me, whereas in fact we have dozens in
 common. (3) When I was asked to share my location, Skype found an exact address that I do not know at all, and which is a a couple of miles from my actual one.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This is now a complete disaster. Not only can I not receive calls, I cannot make calls either. Please help.</p>

<p>Dear Karen_[01],</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further to the above, I attach a screen-shot of my computer's system hardware. Can it be that the new Skype cannot work on this system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also downloaded the Classic version of Skype and tried to call a contact. It rang at his end but he could not see or hear anything.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/74787d5e-0500-49e7-9bae-7a49abda3b6f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/74787d5e-0500-49e7-9bae-7a49abda3b6f" /></a></p>

<p>Thank you very much for your further reply and private message, Karen_(01). I had already thought about engaging in a chat, but first tried some more trouble- shooting myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I removed Skype classic and all associated files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I once again deleted the new Skype and associated material, restarted the computer and reinstalled the new Skype.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I did some general maintenance on my computer: checked the disk structure, repaired permissions, did some basic cleaning and reset MVRAM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I <em>think</em> I may have solved the problem, but shall not know until I can find someone to call me on Skype. As soon as that happens, I shall report the outcome, and shall engage in a chat if the outcome is still bad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again.&nbsp;</p>

            I have now been able to get someone to call me, Karen_[01], and the situation is unchanged: the call comes through, but there is no alert screen from which I can choose to answer the call. So I shall now chat with a Skype technician. Thank you for your
 help.

<p>Karen_{01], I did engage in a nearly two-hour chat with a Skype technician, who took over control of my computer and once more deleted and reinstalled the New Skype (v. 8.13), and also installed the Classic Skype (v. 7.59). I then asked him, while I had
 New Skype running, to call me. He was, it seemed, only allowed to make a voice call, but that was enough to show that icons allowing me to accept the call appeared at top right of the screen, but no separate call alert display appeared. I now believe that
 these icons appeared right at the beginning of my attempt to use the New Skype, but that I did not notice them because I was expecting something much more obvious. So my immediate problem may have been solved — or have never been there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a great deal on the net, including in this Forum, about the non-appearance of a call-alert screen or display, and also about the unavailability of many preferences and settings, in the New Skype. In Classic Skype those settings
<em>are</em> available. I have not yet been able to verify whether a call-alert display appears in Classic Skype when called.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would now help me enormously, and, I believe, many other people who are as mystified as I am by the differences between what has been expected (partly on the basis of what can be found in various sources on the net) and what actually seems to happen,
 if you or someone else equally authoritative could definitively post answers to the following questions —
<em>remembering that I am concerned with Skype for Mac.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. In New Skype, when someone calls, a clear independent call-alert screen should appear: Yes? or No?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b: In New Skype, when someone calls, one has to find and click icons at the top right of the screen in order to answer: Yes? or No?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1c:&nbsp;In Classic Skype, when someone calls, a clear independent call-alert screen should appear: Yes? or No?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2a: In New Skype, there are many hidden settings (such as 'answer calls automatically') that cannot be accessed directly from the menus. Yes? or No?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2b: In New Skype, these 'hidden' settings are accessed as follows: (please describe)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2c: These settings are unavailable in New Skype, but are available in Classic Skype: Yes? or No?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the hope that what one should or should not expect and find when using New Skype and, alternatively, Classic Skype will at last become unambiguously clear, I thank you.</p>

<p>Replying to myself (as in my previous post):</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would still be good (for me and for others) to have answers to the questions listed in my previous post. But I have now been able to get a contact to call me, and here are the results:</p>
<p>
</p><p>• The statement that I have seen on the Net, and implicitly confirmed by my 'chat' with a Skype technician (who installed both new and classic Skype onto my computer), that it is possible to have both classic and new Skype simultaneously on one's computer
 seems to be wrong. New Skype only partially worked, and Classic Skype did not work at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>• I deleted both Skypes, restarted my computer and reinstalled just New Skype. (Tough about all the settings that are no longer available!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>• It is now clear (to me, at any rate) that in New Skype no separate call-alert screen or display will appear when a contact calls, but the icons at top right do work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Curiously, every time someone called me and I accepted the call, the microphone icon at the bottom indicated that my microphone (an external one) was not connected, and I had to correct that every time. Have I missed a setting somewhere, or is it one more
 New Skype quirk?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shall leave my travails and eventual discoveries there. Skype used to be vastly easier to use and, I think, more satisfactory years ago, but I can now use New Skype. Dare I ask whether the introduction of the web version of Skype is an admission that the
 app has got out of hand?</p>

<p>
</p><p>It is correct that some features and options in the previous version is not present or currently unavailable in the new version of Skype. In this case, I highly encourage you to leave a feedback using the Skype application, each feedback are being sent and
 viewed directly by the development team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your questions, here are the answers:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. In New Skype, when someone calls, a clear independent call-alert screen should appear: Yes? or No? &gt;&gt;
<strong>If you're pertaining to the call alert for incoming calls, this should be available in the new Skype. But to clarify, can you take a screenshot of your screen (new Skype) when someone is calling you?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1b: In New Skype, when someone calls, one has to find and click icons at the top right of the screen in order to answer: Yes? or No? &gt;&gt;
<strong>No, the pop up call alert should have options to allow you to answer or reject the call directly.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1c:&nbsp;In Classic Skype, when someone calls, a clear independent call-alert screen should appear: Yes? or No? &gt;&gt;
<strong>Yes</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2a: In New Skype, there are many hidden settings (such as 'answer calls automatically') that cannot be accessed directly from the menus. Yes? or No? &gt;&gt;
<strong>No, also that is not hidden </strong></p>
<strong>You can set up Skype to automatically answer calls if you prefer.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Select your avatar.</li><li>Scroll to <strong>Calling</strong>.</li><li>Enable <strong>Answer incoming call automaticall</strong>y.</li><li>Optionally you can set <strong>Start my video automatically</strong> as a secondary option.</li></ul>

<h2>            update error 80070002 and windows won&#39;t configure and reverts changes. Also can&#39;t access the Remote Desktop that I use for work.</h2>
                    <p>I have windows 7 64bit, use IE 10</p>
<p>I can't think of anything that I may have done to cause the problem.</p>
<p>I was able to access the Remote Desktop all last week until Friday then I was unable to. I have had the following problem for some time now and want to resolve it.</p>
<p>When I turn&nbsp;my Dell Inspiron N7110 I receive the message, "applying update operation 2 of 658 0000000000000000 CDF-MS", then it goes away and the "preparing to configure windows do not turn off the computer" screen comes on then "configuring windows 35%
 do not turn off your computer" screen comes up, then "failed to configure windows updates reverting changes" screen comes on. Then the system shuts down and restarts. This has been happening for some time and I am concerned about important updates. When check
 for updates I receive the 80070002 error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone through as many solutions as I&nbsp;could find online&nbsp;and nothing has worked.&nbsp; I restored back as far&nbsp;as I could without putting my external drive in (back-up). I deleted some programs and reinstalled Adobe.&nbsp;The Fixit has resolved some issues, so
 it says,&nbsp;the scans have found some problems and fixed them. Still not able to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi Winston,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to me. </p>
<p>I use Norton 360 for security.</p>
<p>I can't even begin to remember all the steps I have tried. I have been through all the 80070002 fixes that I could find and there are many.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recent update info that I was able to pull up is as follows;</p>
<p>On 3/2 the hotfix for windows # KB 947821 was successful 2 times, 3/4 KB2446710 security update failed error 80070002, also on 3/4 KB2478662 failed error 80070002, KB2898869 failed error 80070001, KB2901126 failed error 80070002. Then on 3/5 KB2901126 was
 successful. I ran a shut down to apply the update but it didn't fix anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to these updates the last update was 2/18/2014, there are 172 total. Must all be successful.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>During one fix I tried to restore, there were several dates to choose from, I tried to go back as far as it would let me but I received a message that the back-up information was not available. I&nbsp; used the date that was next to it. The restore didn't work.
 Should I plug in my back-up drive and try to restore again? I don't know, I am just grasping for anything. That is why I went to Solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am about ready to go to method #2. I have not checked to see what solution it is but I may have already tried it. I&nbsp;believe I did a clean boot during one of my many attempts to resolve this issue or issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My concern is if my computer crashes I don't know how to get it going again. I have a back-up on an external drive that isn't very old. So I am okay with that.&nbsp; And I have the program that came with my computer to start at the beginning if needed. Should
 I find instructions on how to recover my computer? I&nbsp;am a little uncomfortable&nbsp;about&nbsp;my system crashing and not knowing what to do next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I stay hooked up to the internet when doing method #2? Should I disable Norton's anti-virus?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Talk to you soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying with the status. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to temporarily disable Norton antivirus program and put the computer in clean boot state before installing the update. Also you may try to download and install the updates manually from Microsoft Download center.

<p>I'm not sure what the clean boot state is? Is that explained in the method 2 solution? Are you saying don't do method 2 and put it in clean boot state then try to install the updates? If you tell me how to get the clean boot state I'll do the manual updates.</p>

            <p>Winston,</p>
<p>Thanks for getting back to me.</p>
<p>I followed the instructions in method 2&nbsp;to get to the clean boot state and&nbsp;went to the download page and downloaded the failed updates manually like you suggested and&nbsp; I found that 2 of the updates that failed to install were not for my computer. They were
 for the &nbsp;6.1 version and would not install. KB2446710 and KB2478662. The description says that they are for windows 7 but when I downloaded them they would not install. Message said not for my computer or something like that. I put the computer back to normal.
 Oh ya, I disabled the anti-virus before doing all this</p>
<p>I didn't go through the process that is method 2, maybe I should. I thought by going to the download page and manually installing the failed updates that it would be the same thing.</p>
<p>Troubleshooter fixed a couple things and found some things that were not fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update error 0x800 72 EFD (2014-03-05-T-09_54_38P not fixed</p>
<p>Problems installing recent updates&nbsp;&nbsp; not fixed</p>
<p>check for missing or corrupt files&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; detected</p>
<p>some security settings are missing or have been changed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fixed</p>
<p>service registration is missing or corrupt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fixed</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after not having any success I tried to restore back to my back-up date with my removable drive installed and that wouldn't work either.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system came with windows installed so I don't have a disc. I do have the program on a removable drive, I guess you would call it. I had Dell send me one in case I needed to reinstall.&nbsp; Is that the next step?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Funny, the computer seems to be working fine other than I can't use Remote Desktop and updates are messed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have not run out of patience yet. I would like to resolve this, it is kind of a challenge now.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 slowed down my PC&#39;s performance</h2>
                    <p>After installing Windows 10, everything on my PC is running so much slower. When I click on anything that little blue wheel comes up and the program stops responding. Sometimes the screen will freeze and turn all sorts of crazy colors and it looks although
 as if there is something very wrong with my laptop. Everything takes so long to complete. It took several minutes to move one item to the recycle bin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm a college student and I can't afford to have my laptop running so slowly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've already done a maintainance test and I never got any feedback on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know what is making my laptop run so slowly, but I need it fixed.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues using Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the methods.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> Perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps
 eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to
 perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. It will scan your system files
 and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows. To run the SFC scan, refer to the Microsoft article below.</span></p>

            Not helpful.&nbsp; The question is about Windows 10, but both methods refer only to prior versions of Windows (7, 8, 8.1).&nbsp; They do not cover W10.

            <p>Your answer is not useful at all. One of the big reasons that Windows 10 slows down the computer's performance is that it performs several automatic updates a day that can no longer be made manual or shut off without some serious messing with the OS. I am
 furious at how slow my computer is now that I have upgraded - and I don't need to do a clean boot and there isn't any corruptions in Windows system files causing it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to listen to its customers and fix this serious issue and make UPDATES a VOLUNTARY thing. If this issue doesn't get fixed fast, I'm switching back to 7 and 8.1 (I have 4 computers and need the performance back now.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm one angry MIcrosoft customer!</p>

            <p>I just restored my computer back to Windows 8 and the system speed is back to its old self. I had Windows 10 for just a bit less than a month and I experienced the same slowness, frozen screens, and poor performance. It was nice looking but slows me down
 far too much. I teach online courses and cannot be sitting here wasting time waiting for frozen screens due to a bloated operating system. CAUTION: Windows only gives you one month to restore back to Windows 8 from the date you install Windows 10. So, don't
 delay if you want to go back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck all!</p>

            <p>I am having the same issue.&nbsp; I have only been on Windows 10 for about a week now but, I have noticed a significant decrease in my PC's performance, in every aspect.&nbsp; The Task Manager the other day took about 3 minutes to open.&nbsp; My web browsers (FF and Chrome)
 take so long to open, and then, it takes ages to even open a page.&nbsp; Once the page is opened, navigating through the site does not take so long (which is normal).&nbsp; ANYTHING I try to open
</p>
<p>C R A W L S......&nbsp; my PC never had an issue opening anything before this "upgrade."&nbsp; I was excited to upgrade to Win10 but, this was a downgrade..&nbsp; and that is saying something going from Win8.1.&nbsp; it is highly unlikely and, improbable that all these people
 have system issues, right after upgrading to Win10.&nbsp; Something needs to be done.</p>
<p>(I have an AMD A8 Processor and 4 GB RAM.&nbsp; Already ran a virus scan and, nothing was wrong.)</p>

            This might be more helpful if the directions you sent me to were for Windows 10 instead of Windows 8...

            <p>To make Windows 10 Faster:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to &nbsp;Privacy &nbsp;( there you disable all the apps or application that you are not using and the computer would be running faster) this is the cause that is making Windows 10 slow. &nbsp;This method was use in a Pentium computer that video streaming was lagging
 and the cause is apps running in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: &nbsp;Disable Update Sharing</p>
<p>
</p><p>Search for Update</p>
<p>Go to Windows Update</p>
<p>Go to Advanced Options</p>
<p>Go to Choose how updates are installed</p>
<p>Go to Choose how update are delivered</p>
<p>Click Disable Update from more than on place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Disable Shadow and Animation Effects to improve Performance:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tip (<strong>Win + R</strong>) to open run and type <strong>sysdm.cpl&nbsp;</strong>for System Properties to open</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Advance</p>
<p>Go to Performance and press Settings...</p>
<p>In Visual Effects</p>
<p>Go to Adjust for best performance</p>
<p>Click Apply then OK</p>
<p>Done</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is a work in progress because some pre install software not go well with low spec computer and this is simple fix.</p>
<p>

            <p>I think the issue is based on what CPU chip you use.&nbsp; I installed 10 on my Vaio VPCSC laptop with the 64 bit chip and it works with ZERO issues.&nbsp; I installed 10 on my custom built PC over a 32bit windows 7 Ultimate installation and it worked for 2 hours
 after I installed it and today is day 1 using it.&nbsp; It is crawling, unable to access websites or apps without literally waiting 4-5 minutes each click.&nbsp; I shut down almost everything.&nbsp; I only installed 2 app, Facebook and WeatherBug.&nbsp; And since I have disabled
 "LIVE TILE" to no avail.&nbsp; I am promptly removing WIN 10 from that system.&nbsp; I also noticed the SERVICE Host process on the Vaio is hovering at 1-4% where my 32bit installation is pinned at 98-100% all of the time.&nbsp; Thus, this is the culprit.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think MS should
 let people know in advance that this is not going to work on 32 bit systems as fluently as a 64.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; I have 4 gigs of ram, 2 of video Ram, a CORE i5-2500k chip on a top of the line MSI motherboard.&nbsp; No rocket ship there but Win 7 was cruising and all of
 my programs worked perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps people.&nbsp; I will repost something when the nightmare of removing Win 10 is over.&nbsp; I say nightmare because I can almost bet the farm it will leave my machine running Win7 worse than ever.&nbsp; These things never uninstall properly you know...</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.&nbsp; Loving Win 10 on one machine at least!</p>

            I had serious issues with my computer being slow. Boot up took forever and forget looking things up on the net. I finally had to revert back to Windows 8 then upgrade to 8.1. It didn't revert back to 8.1 like it said it would so it took most of the day
 to get things back to 8.1 and now its back to running like it was!! I will never upgrade to 10 until their performance issues are fixed.

    <title>Skype Text Messaging Scam - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clmett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Text Messaging Scam</h2>
                    I just discovered an issue with Text Messaging. &nbsp;According to Skype chat Tech support they are aware of it, maybe maybe not. &nbsp;A text message appeared from a known contact, now my fault was that I was in a hurry and did not pay attention. &nbsp;The text looks
 something like this, will not include the entire thing, starts with "http://www.goo.gl.........ends with "username". &nbsp;If you click on the link then my entire Skype Contact list received the text. &nbsp;Fortunately I do not allow Skype to have access to my entire
 contact list! &nbsp;My hope is that someone might see this post and avoid the problem. &nbsp;I did not get the sense that Skype has or is going to send an alert to everyone that this is going on! &nbsp;I wish they would!

            <p><span>Hi, </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue you’re facing could be related to display drivers and might be resolved by updating the display drivers. Without the correct driver, the hardware or device that you want to use
 won't work properly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Boot the computer in safe mode and update the display driver from Device Manager. Once this is done, restart the computer and check the status.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists then boot the computer in safe mode and uninstall the driver and restart the computer so that generic drivers are loaded. Download the latest drivers from the manufacturer’s website and try installing
 the drivers to check if this helps. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, then install the driver in Windows 8 compatibility mode. This mode installs the driver using settings from a previous version of Windows.</span></p>

            The phone number you are trying to verify has to be SMS-enabled and not block SMS short codes. Usually only mobile phones and some virtual numbers are SMS-enabled. If SMS is not supported by your number, you will not be able to verify it for use with Skype.

            <p>Well its not a win7 question, its one for asus, or their forums.</p>
<p>As a start you would need to install drivers/utilities direct from Asus, and not from some third party</p>

            <p>I, too have this problem with my Asus X71Q laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time I start/restart the laptop from a cold start, sleep or hibernation the wireless fails to connect and cannot see any connections. The only way I can get it working properly is to use the troubleshooter, which simply turns the wireless on. For some
 reason the wireless hotkey does not do this. I've enabled all the services I can find which relate to wireless, but only the troubleshooter sorts it (until the next time). Everything is obviously working but the wireless is just not switching on, since that's
 all the troubleshooter does. How can I get it to switch on automatically again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded all the correct drivers for W7 64bit from Asus website. </p>
<p>
</p><p>W7 has been updated totally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried Asus support, but they just tell me to reset to mfr's out-of-the-box by reinstalling from the backup. I don't want to do this as I have loads of programs installed and frankly do not believe that that is the best solution (even if it worked).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even (getting desperate here!) swapped the wireless card for another but it made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone got any ideas at all?</p>

            <p>I'm having exactly the same issue. &nbsp;There must be some way to change the computer settings to automatically connect to wireless when the machine is turned on. &nbsp;It always connected before I sent the laptop in to Asus for replacement of my AC adapter connection
 which had broken. &nbsp;Since it was returned, I have had to connect to wireless manually through the Windows Mobility Center each time I turn it on. I've tried troubleshooting through Asus, but they're useless and not very competent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be some way to do this in Windows 7 64-bit.</p>

            <p>These 3 instances are all with ASUS laptops - is this coincidence? Up until VERY recently all was well, but my problems started after a BSD event, which according to the error logs was related to my touchpad driver (this happened twice). I uninstalled it
 and reinstalled with fresh drivers and have had no more BSDs, but the wireless problem has popped up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried absolutely everything I can think of myself. Is there an expert out there who is monitoring these threads who can spare us a few moments?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just swapped the wireless card out for an intel model and the same thing happened, so I've gone back to the original.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing which stays the same is that the wireless on/off (Fn/F2) does not seem to do anything at all, not even the the 'on/off' popup, even though all the other hotkeys work fine. I've uninstalled the drivers, etc for the hotkeys and it still doesn't work.
 &nbsp;Are your hotkeys working? When you press Fn/F2 do you get the popup at top left of the screen to operate wifi on/off or does nothing come up?</p>

            <p>Hi LynnieM,</p>
<p>that's great news and I wish mine did! I'm happy for you, but this just masks the fault - the fact that it won't start up automatically. Still, as you say, it is easier than the troubleshooter business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since my f2 hotkey does not work, I'm still hoping that there is someone out there who knows something to help me.....?</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">Hope you can help, until today I had a system that was working pretty much flawlessly. I bought an Adata XPG SX8200 Pro M.2 drive - I installed it into my motherboard's 2nd M2 slot and that's when everything went wrong. I started
 getting random BSOD errors, ranging from 'kernel check security failures' to memory management stop codes too.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I've tried:- clean installs, memcheck, taking out memory sticks, taking out the new M2 drive, updating windows, updating BIOS, updating drivers and everything seems to produce a BSOD - sometimes it's instant after boot, sometimes
 it only comes after an hour into Overwatch (where I get an "Overwatch has crashed the graphics driver" error)</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I'm at my wits end as before I installed this M2 drive, it was fine but nothing seems to fix these constant errors. Please help!</p>

<p>Thank you both for your super helpful suggestions - I took them all on board and installed a fresh Windows install, with updated drivers for BIOS/Chipset and peripherals. It worked fantastically well for around 12 hours until I started getting periodic BSOD
 again. So after running a CHKDSK on all connected HDD's (all came back clear), I took it upon myself to run MemTest86 and got the following report:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.dropbox.com/s/9k67k9wexr4fds7/MemTest86-Report-20190605-031642.html?dl=0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically the test aborted due to too many errors, so am I correct in assuming bad RAM is the likely culprit here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows Vista games won&#39;t work</h2>
                    My Windows Vista games (solitaire, minesweeper, etc.) have suddenly stopped working.&nbsp; I don't get any error message -- they just don't launch when I click them.&nbsp; Recently I ran Advanced System Care and also installed some Windows updates, I think.&nbsp; In
 Advanced System Care, I tried going back and restoring to an earlier date, but it didn't help -- the games still won't work.

<p><span>Hi
<span><span>homsap1</span></span></span><span><span>,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The first and foremost thing which you can try out on your computer is turning
 windows features on/off.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1: Turn Windows Features On/Off</span></strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click the Start button, click Control Panel, click Programs, and then click Turn Windows features on or off.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>To turn a Windows feature on, select the check box next to the feature. To turn a Windows feature off, clear the check
 box.</span> </li><li><span>Click OK.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>Note:
</span></span><span>Some
</span><span><span>Windows</span></span><span> features are grouped together in folders, and some folders contain
 subfolders with additional features. If a check box is partially checked or appears dark, then some of the items inside the folder are turned on and some are turned off. To view the contents of a folder, double-click it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>See if this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>If this doesn’t help, then the next thing that would matter is whether Service Pack is installed on your computer.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Install Service Pack for Windows Vista</span></strong></p>
<p><span>From the article below, you can resolve this issue by obtaining the latest service pack for windows vista.</span></p>
<span>Icons are missing from Control Panel, or you cannot start Control Panel, the Welcome Center, or games in Windows Vista</span>

<p>
</p><p>I have a laptop Asus U43j with genuine MSW 7 Home Premium. I have downloaded the windows 10 upgrade and it prompted me to install update . After configuring windows 10 100% system got rebooted but within seconds, a message flashed out that"<strong> windows
 could not be installed and we are restarting the system</strong>(<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">There was an error related to THREAD</span>).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that i again landed at windows 7 home premium and following dialog box was there to irritate me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is very frustrating to invest number of hours which leads you nowhere.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><em><strong>How you are trying to install Windows 7?</strong></em>
</span>USB, I loaded windows 7 to it from a legal store bought copy of the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em><strong>Do you get error with regard</strong></em>
<strong><em>to digital signature when you are trying to install Windows 7 or booting Windows 10?</em></strong></span> Yes. 0xc0000428. Digital Signature could not be verified. When loading Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em><strong>Does the computer boot to the desktop?</strong></em> No. I came back to put in my 'legal' key but it was frozen on Toshiba Innovations start up screen</span>. Removed the usb, black error screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reading microsoft page I tried several times to disable digital signature and several times from various offers to the solution at different sites.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Please attempt to connect the monitor to another computer.&nbsp; In addition, please verify if your computer is configure to got to sleep or hibernate.&nbsp; If hibernation is configured, then the only way to restore Windows and the monitor is to press the power button
 for Windows to resume.&nbsp; Moving the mouse and stroking the keyboard will not wake the computer up.&nbsp; Please verify if your computer is entering a low power state.&nbsp; If the monitor is failing, please replace the monitor and verify if the issue is still occuring.&nbsp;
 I hope this information is beneficial.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

            That game is <strong>old</strong> . Chances are it's not compatible. Try running the installation file in compatibility mode for XP.

<p>
When I try to use wingdings from the charmap, it will not let me copy and paste.&nbsp; For example, I wanted to use the astrological symbols.&nbsp; I found the symbol for Sagittarius, selected it from the wingding charmap, hit copy, and when I tried to paste it into
 several docs, i.e., wordpad, Microsoft word, and notepad, as well as facebook, the symbol came out "f".&nbsp; Similarly, I tried to copy another symbol for Virgo, and it came out "s". I cannot copy any of them and paste them.</p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I am having trouble connecting my Xbox One wireless to my new router (Dlink DIR-882).&nbsp; It is seeing the wireless network just fine, but when I enter the password and let it check for connection, it tells me that it can not connect.&nbsp; First it says to turn
 off the router for 30 seconds and try again.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then, it says that my router might be filtering MAC addresses.&nbsp; &nbsp;I followed some of the fixes that were on here, and none worked.&nbsp; &nbsp;No where in my router manual does it talk about MAC Filtering.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was just wondering
 if anyone out here has one of these routers, did you have this issue and how did you fix it??</p>

<h2>            User account for public computer Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi All</p>
<p>
</p><p>We run a small hotel with a public access pc (currently running windows 8.1) &nbsp;when we upgraded to 10 the user account was disabled and I couldn't find any help anywhere for it. &nbsp;My question is does Windows 10 have a user account like windows 8.1 that lets
 anyone access the pc without loading any programs etc. We don't want a user account the needs MS login credentials. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>account hacked and set to russian&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> akumap  say:</h3>
<h2>            account hacked and set to russian&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>i need help.&nbsp; I've already called customer service about this but someone hacked my account, stole my 1200 ms points, and changed my console language to Russian.&nbsp; How do I go about fixing this?&nbsp; Calling customer service helped nothing and I feel like he
 was just helping them hack me further by asking all kinds of random account questions I wasn't comfortable answering.&nbsp; What the heck do I do?&nbsp; My BILLING was migrated to russia which I think is the problem.&nbsp; I can't change any language settings or anything
 and it's absolutely mind blowing that no one can help me with this faster than a few days with a large company like Microsoft at the helm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I work for a large company and we get things done when it comes to hackers and accounts being stolen.&nbsp; What is the progress of what's going on with my account?</p>

<p>When you called customer support what did they tell you? They should've filled out an unauthorized access claim for you.. for a migrated account the process can be more lengthy..that's the only thing that you can do. :/</p>
