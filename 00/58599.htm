            If you mean you are seeing a message like this:<br />
<br />
Error:&nbsp; Failed to successfully scan disks for Windows installations.<br />
This error may be caused by a corrupt file system, which would prevent Bootcfg from successfully scanning.<br />
Use chkdsk to detect any disk errors.<br />
Note:&nbsp; This operation must complete successfully in order for the /add or /rebuild commands to be utilized.<br />
<br />
First tell us something about your system.<br />
<br />
What is the system make and model?&nbsp; (Dell something or another)<br />
<br />
What is the Dell Service Tag number?<br />
<br />
Do you know if the system has SATA or IDE hard drive(s)?<br />
<br />
What do you think happened to the system prior to this affliction of hal.dll missing or corrupt?<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
How many hard drives are in your system and are any of them split up into multiple partitions?<br />
<br />
Do you just have one instance of Windows (just XP) or some kind of multi-boot configuration and describe it if multiple.<br />
<br />
Are you booting into the XP Recovery Console from a genuine bootable XP installation CD that you already have, a bootable Recovery Console CD you made (no XP media required) or some other way?<br />
<br />
When you boot into the Recovery Console does the prompt say C:\ or does the prompt say C:\WINDOWS?<br />
<br />
I have a system like that (not a Dell) with a 1TB SATA HDD where bootcfg /rebuild will not run properly and once tried to figure out why and couldn't make it work no matter what BIOS tricks I tried and I know the file system is not corrupt - bootcfg /rebuild
 just won't behave.&nbsp; I never did pursue it for there is more than one way to skin a cat.<br />
<br />
For the error message about hal.dll being missing or corrupt, it is always a good idea to start with a chkdsk with error correction (chkdsk&nbsp; /r) first.&nbsp; Around here, folks will often start with telling you how to replace your hal.dll but they don't know what
 they are talking about and never give the right instructions to do that anyway - and I have never replaced a hal.dll in my life for that message.<br />
<br />
The problem is always (at least so far) that XP just can't find the file either due to file system corruption (usually) or the boot.ini file is telling XP to look for the file in the wrong place and XP just can't find it.<br />
<br />
Assuming your chkdsk with error correction (you did run chkdsk&nbsp; /r, right?) worked and the file system is clean, the problem may be an afflicted boot.ini.<br />
<br />
Even if your bootcfg /rebuild worked, you would not want to run it without first renaming or deleting your suspicious/afflicted boot.ini file since the bootcfg /rebuild would build on top of the suspicious/afflicted one and it might work but you would have
 a sloppy configuration.&nbsp; Nobody ever tells you that part either (except me).&nbsp; This is how systems end up offering multiple XP boot options on startup - running bootcfg&nbsp; /rebuild several times without getting rid of the current boot.ini file first.<br />
<br />
We know that in a single partition configuration XP doesn't even need a boot.ini file to boot properly.&nbsp; If there isn't one, XP will try to load the Windows from the standard directory on the first partition it finds and will boot just fine.<br />
<br />
Microsoft explains it this way: <br />
<br />
<em>NTLDR starts by reading the boot.ini file. If the boot.ini file is missing, the boot loader will attempt to locate information from the standard directory. For Windows NT and 2000 machines, it will attempt to boot from C:\WINNT. For Windows XP and 2003
 machines, it will boot from C:\WINDOWS</em>.<br />
<br />
For example in a single partition installation where there is no boot.ini file, XP will complain like this (but still boot):<br />
<br />
Invalid BOOT.INI file<br />
Booting from C:\windows\<br />
<br />
So if you know your file system has no corruption, from the XP Recovery Console rename or delete the suspicious boot.ini file so you don't have one, then boot normally, then you can fix your boot.ini file.<br />
<br />
From the RC you would enter something like this:<br />
<br />
cd&nbsp;&nbsp; \<br />
attrib&nbsp;&nbsp; -rhs&nbsp;&nbsp; boot.ini<br />
rename&nbsp;&nbsp; boot.ini&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; boot.ini.bad<br />
exit<br />
<br />
Then if your system boots, you can work on fixing your suspicious/afflicted boot.ini or just make a new one.&nbsp; Since the boot.ini file is just a text file, fixing it or making a new one is easy.<br />
<br />
Just in case, you should consider making a Hiren's Boot CD since it give you more flexibility about fixing things than the XP Recovery Console and you can run your chkdsk with error correction from there.&nbsp; You can't run bootcfg&nbsp; /rebuild from Hiren's but you
 can edit/manipulate your boot.ini file a lot easier.<br />
<br />
Here's how:<br />
<br />
Make yourself a Hiren's Boot CD which you can download from here:<br />
<br />
http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/<br />
<br />
The ZIP file is large, so the download will probably take a little while to complete bit it is worth it.&nbsp; Then unzip the download to extract the Hirens.BootCD.ISO file that will be used to create your new bootable CD.<br />
<br />
Creating a bootable CD from a .ISO file is not the same as just copying the .ISO file to a blank CD.&nbsp; You have to use software that understands how to burn a .ISO file to a CD to create a bootable CD.<br />
<br />
In the Hiren's ZIP file are the BurnToCD.cmd file that you can double click to launch it, but I have never used it and prefer to use ImgBurn.<br />
<br />
If you need a free and easy CD burning software package, here is a popular free program:<br />
<br />
http://www.imgburn.com/<br />
<br />
Like many third party programs you might install, the ImgBurn installation defaults to installing things you probably don't want installed on your system in the form of extra Internet browser toolbars or may make other adjustments to your browser.&nbsp; You don't
 want to install any of that so you have to pay attention during the installation.<br />
<br />
When clicking through the installation screens be sure to pay attention to the screens and always choose a Custom install and UNcheck the following (or any other things like it):<br />
<br />
UNcheck:<br />
<br />
Install the AVG toolbar and set AVG Secure Search as my default search provider<br />
Set AVG Secure Search as my homepage and newly opened tabs<br />
<br />
Choose custom installation again and UNcheck the following:<br />
<br />
Uncheck:<br />
Install QuickShare<br />
<br />
There could be other things too.<br />
<br />
Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:<br />
<br />
http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61<br />
<br />
It would be a good idea to test your new bootable CD on a computer that is working.<br />
<br />
You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive as the first boot device instead of the hard disk.
<br />
<br />
These adjustments are&nbsp; made before Windows tries to load.&nbsp; If you miss it, you will have to reboot the system again.<br />
<br />
When booting on the Hiren's CD you will see a menu of options.&nbsp; Choose the Mini XP option.&nbsp; Then it will appear that Windows is being loaded and you will be presented with a desktop that has the look and feel of the Windows Explorer interface you are already
 used to using.<br />
<br />
Remember:&nbsp; You did not boot on your hard disk - you booted into the Hiren's desktop.<br />
<br />
One way to check the disk for errors is to open My Computer and right click your afflicted drive and choose Properties, Tools, Error-checking, Check Now... put a check mark in both the boxes and then Start.<br />
<br />
Sometimes that doesn't work, so you can also click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
cmd<br />
<br />
Click OK to open a Command Prompt window and enter the following command (assuming XP is installed on your C drive)<br />
<br />
chkdsk&nbsp; c:&nbsp; /r<br />
<br />
This disk checking can take a long time (perhaps several to many hours) depending on the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what the disk checking finds to do.<br />
<br />
Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. <br />
<br />
Depending on the the speed of your system, the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what chkdsk finds to do, it may take a long time for chkdsk with error correction to complete (several to many hours) or it may appear to be 'stuck'.&nbsp; Be
 patient.&nbsp; If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something so don't interrupt it.&nbsp; It will finish eventually one way or the other.&nbsp; Keep an eye on the percentage amount to be sure it is still making progress.&nbsp; It may even appear to go backwards
 sometimes.<br />
<br />
You may have to run the chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; it more than once.<br />
<br />
When the chkdsk runs clean, remove the CD and restart your system.<br />

            <p>I so appreciate your reply. However I need you to do what they do in Ireland when a Yank asks for directions. Give me what I need to get my system to successfully boot. Then I'll ask for help to get to the next step. Here is the additional info you requested.</p>
<p>Dell Inspiron&nbsp;</p>
<p>Model #PP12L</p>
<p>XP</p>
<p>One drive I think idea.</p>
<p>Service tag GXVKS71</p>
<p>I believe an improper shutdown was the offending event.</p>
<p>One month ago I successfully reinstalled corrupt Config system remedy.</p>

            <p>For a hal.dll missing or corrupt message, always start with a chkdsk with error correction (chkdsk&nbsp; /r) either from the XP Recovery Console or from the previously mentioned Hiren's Boot CD.&nbsp; The Hiren's Boot CD will give you the maneuvering room you need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still have the same message after the chkdsk with error correction runs clean (you may need to run it more than once) then I would rename the suspicious c:\boot.ini file to something you can remember like:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>c:\boot.ini.bad</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (now the c:\boot.ini file is "missing").</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then with no c:\boot.ini (since you renamed it) see if XP will boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what "I successfully reinstalled corrupt Config system remedy" means.</p>

            <p>Looking in the Dell forums there are a couple old support topics similar to your situation and their "experts" just suggest running the Dell diagnostics on the drive but don't say how or what to do it a problem is indicated (just like here).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>These topics seem to just be abandoned with nobody saying if/how they got their system running again or if their HDD needed replacement etc.</p>
<p>
Dell has some built in diagnostics that you can read about on their pages but if the HDD is afflicted, it will probably just report an error and not fix the problem.
</p><p>
Dell says your system does not have a SATA drive (PATA instead) so there goes that theory - if the information is correct.
</p><p>
</p><p>I would proceed with Hiren's and if you can't fix your issue, you should be able to still browse your HDD from Hiren's and salvage off your personal files to some external device...&nbsp; an external HDD or USB thumb drive.&nbsp; You would not be able to do this from
 the XP Recovery Console which is another good reason to make a Hiren's Boot CD.</p>

</p><p>For the hal.dll missing/corrupt message I always start with a chkdsk with error correction (chkdsk&nbsp; /r) and that (so far) has always worked to resolve that problem.&nbsp; If that works out, the chkdsk&nbsp; /r may also resolve your bootcfg&nbsp; /rebuild problem but you
 don't "need" bootcfg&nbsp; /rebuild to fix an afflicted boot.ini file - you can fix them with a text editor (also on Hiren's).</p>

<h2>            Windows apps dont work on windows 10 pc including search</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I have recently upgraded to the new creator's update and ran into several&nbsp;problems.</p>
<p>My display adapter's driver had an issue and I had to reinstall it via safe mode. I have done 2 resets before finding the correct way of fixing this problem (by installing the drivers manually).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, All of the windows apps either don't work at all, or work partially.</p>
<p>1. Windows Search - a very frequently used feature no longer works. When I type something, the dots at the top of the window just keep on moving and stop after a certain amount of time, showing that it is loading, but nothing really loads, and no results
 are shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried: All suggestions made by @<span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">Abdul_Malik
</span>and others in <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_cortana/cant-type-in-windows-10-search-bar/7dce8411-8671-4d3e-90d1-b9bdc0aa4734">
this post</a>, as well as activating Cortana, stopping its process, changing the search to automatically start via the task manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Also tried to troubleshoot the Search and Indexing - Found a privilege problem, fixed it, but it didn't fix MY problem.</p>
<p>I Also tried to Rebuild the indexes - 131,512 Items indexed, but the problem still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only 2 explanations that I came up with are the following:</p>
<p>a. System Language is messed up. I don't live in the united states, and the language in my country may cause problems sometimes. In the "Time &amp; language" settings, and then "Region &amp; language" menu, my "Country or region" setting seems to constantly reset,
 and, when trying to add a language in the "Languages" menu, no results are found when searching for any language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. Windows apps are problematic as well. I will continue the list:</p>
<p>2. Calculator: When trying to open is (via the keyboard shortcut, no other way due to the search function not working), The window opens with the calculator symbol in the middle, but closes after a few seconds without opening the actual calculator even for
 a split of a second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Windows store acts the same way as the calculator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried: In order to fix both apps, and hopefully the search function, I followed
<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224798/how-to-uninstall-windows-10s-built-in-apps-and-how-to-reinstall-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a> tutorial.</p>
<p>Again, no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scanned file system:</p>
C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;sfc /scannow<br />
<br />
Beginning system scan. &nbsp;This process will take some time.<br />
<br />
Beginning verification phase of system scan.<br />
Verification 100% complete.<br />
<br />
Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>
<p>If possible, I would like to find solutions other than reset, cause it takes some time and in the end, I don't think it helped.</p>
<p>I do have a theory though, that updates AFTER the reset may have caused the problem, cause I think I was able to search immediately after the reset finished, Though reverting to a previous system state didn't fix the problem as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will use reset, but as the last option, and please, if its the only way, suggest me how to avoid it from happening after the next reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, Microsoft Community!</p>

<p>Let's isolate your concern by creating a new local user account and see if the issue persist there.&nbsp; To assist you, follow the on-screen instructions on how to create a local user or administrator account in Windows 10
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/5de907f1-f8ba-4fd9-a89d-efd23fee918c/create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>here</strong></a>. Creating another user profile and checking if similar issue persists will deduce if the issue is related to the corrupted user profile or the corrupted operating system.</p>

<p>Thanks to you, I'm&nbsp;closer to the solution!</p>
<p>The calculator works on the new local non-Microsoft account, and the store doesn't&nbsp;immediately close anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER,</p>
<p>1. Search still loads forever with no results.</p>
<p>2. Language settings, which I suspect is connected somehow to the search problem, doesn't save changes, and although I can now search for languages to add, I can't add them to the list. Also, the language settings clearly state I'm in Uganda, which in Hebrew&nbsp;starts
 with the first letter of the alphabet (aleph) - Uganda is first in the list, and I can't change it to another country (After changing and reopening the settings window, the setting reverts to Uganda).</p>
<p>3. How do I fix my main account to avoid these problems (Calculator, Store, etc..)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The progress is really good! Thanks for the support!</p>

<p>Since some of the apps worked, we suggest that you use the local account instead. You can still use the files on the original account by moving it over to the new one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try to troubleshoot your search bar issue by following the steps below: </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Enable Search Service.</strong><br />
Ensure that Windows Search service is running with Startup type is Automatic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press <strong>Windows</strong> and <strong>R</strong> keys together.<br />
b. Type “<strong>Services.msc</strong>” without quotes and press Enter.<br />
c. Double click on <strong>Windows Search service</strong>.<br />
d. Set the Startup type as <strong>Automatic</strong> and then click<strong> Start</strong> under
<strong>Service status.</strong><br />
e. Click on <strong>OK</strong> and save the changes.<br />
f. Restart the computer and check the issue status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do the following steps as well, to troubleshoot the language settings issue and see if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Follow the steps below to remove and re-add the language pack on the computer to check if the issue is resolved.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Step 1: Remove language pack from Control panel.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Press <strong>Windows logo + X</strong> keys on the keyboard and select <strong>
Control panel</strong> from the context menu.<br />
2. Click on <strong>View by </strong>from the top right corner of the window and select
<strong>Large icons</strong>.<br />
3. Click on <strong>Language</strong> and check if the <strong>English </strong>language is displayed on the right side panel of the popped window.<br />
4. If present, double click on the language and select<strong> Remove</strong> option from the window.<br />
5. Follow the onscreen instructions and check if the changes are effective.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Step 2: Download the language pack.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Before downloading English language pack on the computer, set Country or region to USA or UK (depending upon the English language you want to add) on the computer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Press <strong>Windows</strong> logo key on the keyboard, type <strong>Settings</strong> and select the top most search result.<br />
2. From the window select <strong>Time &amp; Language </strong>and select <strong>Region &amp; language</strong> from the left side panel.<br />
3. Click on <strong>Add a language &gt; English</strong> and select the language pack you want to download from the window.
<br />
4. Check if you see <strong>Language pack available</strong> status under the recently selected language.<br />
5. If yes, click on <strong>Options</strong> and <strong>Download</strong> under <strong>
Language options.</strong><br />
6. Wait for the language pack to download and go back to<strong> Region &amp; language</strong> window.<br />
7. Click on the downloaded language pack and click on <strong>Set as default</strong>.<br />
8. Close the window, logout and login for the changes to be effective and check if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know of the above method works.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the details that you've shared, your concern can be caused by software conflicts on your device. We'd recommend that you perform a clean boot in
<strong>Windows</strong>. To do this, you can follow the steps posted on this&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the clean boot environment, perform the&nbsp;recommended steps of&nbsp;<strong>Rey Bel1
</strong>on how to remove and download the language pack. Once done, your device would need to revert to the normal boot up process. To do this, you can check the&nbsp;<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>
 section of the link. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes after you've performed the steps.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Do not run Driver Verifier all the time as it can cause instability when there would otherwise be none. Especially since it has found nothing (assuming you have checked in C:\Windows\Minidump folder).<br />
<br />
Sounds like a BIOS, chipset, or hard drive controller (even cabling issue). Check for updates with the System/Motherboard Maker.
<br />
<br />
Also check with the SSD maker for updated firmware.<br />
<br />
If all of that does not help then I would try a Clean Install. And if that did not help it has to be hardware.<br />
<br />
If you do a Clean Install then it would be activated with the Digital Entitlement.<br />
<br />
Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10 <br />

<p>Thanks Bob for the reply, I will turn off "Verifier"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Original problem happened on an install on a 3 year old HDD so, even though it passed all the tests I replaced it with a Samsung 850 EVO SSD. and a fresh install. It worked faultlessly for 3 weeks then this same problem started again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought the Minidump files would identify the culprit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled my Avira anti virus and switched to Defender. Yesterday I updated the Graphics and&nbsp; the Network adapter drivers, which made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to be banging my head against a wall.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The older minidump indicated Avira and the newer was of no help. Still probably hardware.<br />
<br />
<div>BugCheck BE, {ffffd27b56000178, 8a00000000800121, ffffc2810de0c3d0, b}</div>

<br />
avgntflt.sys dated&nbsp;7/10/2017 Avira.<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Uninstall Avira and Malwarebytes which probably are helping to mask the cause. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1 is a full antivirus.<br />

<br />
<strong>2. </strong>Be sure the SSD has the latest firmware! New products come with early stage firmware and drivers.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Check with ASUStek Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known issues. Update the<strong> BIOS</strong>,

<br />
Still would do a clean install After all of that which would only leave hardware if it still happens.<br />

<p>Rob thank you for your reply, sorry mine is a bit late but here in Cambrils Spain we have been a bit distracted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I did my clean install from the ISO that I downloaded from Microsoft website to my brand new SSD,&nbsp; I used Defender as my anti virus for 3 weeks&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">until</span></strong>&nbsp;I had this problem. I installed Avira
 and Malawarebytes as a result of the problem and scanned for problems, they reported none.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I have now uninstalled both. also re-seated Memory, Graphics, cables etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My reluctance to do yet another clean reinstall is because it has taken me the best part of 3 weeks to get my desktop and programs to how I want them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must emphasise that the problems on both occasion have only started after a Windows 10 update.</p>
<p>Both times I tried to Uninstall these updates but they would not uninstall or promptly reinstalled automatically. (Who's great idea was that?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system works perfectly from a boot/restart it is only when I attempt to resume from sleep.</p>
<p>If it was a hardware problem why does it not appear at other times?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>EDIT</strong></span></p>
<p>As of today 19th Aug upon an attempt to resume from sleep, no longer works, it just starts the fans etc.&nbsp;and even after 20 minutes nothing happens. Furthermore it no longer writes a Minidump file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That clean install seems to be getting nearer!!</p>

<p>Be sure the SSD has the latest firmware - this is critical.<br />
<br />
Other than that think BIOS, chipset drivers, or hardware. Though a program you installed could be involved. Check the startups and keep an eye open on what is running when you sleep the computer.<br />
<br />
Definitely check the startup programs.<br />

<br />
==================================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Double check ALL of these :</strong><br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : <br />
</p>
Run DriverView -&nbsp;set&nbsp;VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without <br />
Dump in their names (and&nbsp;update BIOS and chipset drivers).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p><br />
====================================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<br />
Type in Cortana's search box -&gt;&nbsp; Windows Memory Diagnostics&nbsp;<br />

<p>Thanks Rob for the very comprehensive answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Samsung SSD has latest update ie.&nbsp; EMT02B6Q.</p>
<p>BIOS &amp; Chipset are the latest available from Asus.</p>
<p>Clean boot with just MSoft running, still produced a stall on resume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated as many drivers as I can.</p>
<p>I have looked at the Autoruns, Driverview&nbsp; &amp; ProcessExplorer and I cannot see anything obvious.</p>
<p>Will now run Verifier and if no results then it is a Clean Install, yuck!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again thank you for your time, it is very much&nbsp;appreciated.</p>

</p>
<p>That might depend on how you set your machine to boot into Safe Mode.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The first thing I can think of to check is to go to System Configuration (msconfig) BOOT tab, and uncheck Safe Boot...</p>

<h2>            A Windows update &#40;KB958488&#41; which I believe was installed &#34;under the covers&#34; and which I don&#39;t think I need any longer</h2>
                    <span><font color="#000000">
                    <span><font color="#000000">
<p><span>I’m running 64-bit Windows 7 Home Premium.</span></p>
</font></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">On the 15 November last, I elected to install the Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center when it was offered in Windows Update.<font><span>&nbsp;
</span>According to my update history, the time of installation was 09:39.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I subsequently discovered, when looking in “Programs and Features”, that Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Client Profile had also been installed “under the covers”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The time of its installation, according to the update history, was 09:40.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">On the 21 December, I decided that I really did not require the Mouse and Keyboard Center, so I uninstalled it.<font><span>&nbsp;
</span>And I uninstalled .NET Framework 4 Client Profile as well.<span>&nbsp; </span>So far, so good.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Then I happened to notice, in my update history, that KB958488 was also installed at 09:40 on the 15 November and is described as “Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 Shared”.<font><span>&nbsp;
</span>However, if I look up the article KB958488 in Microsoft Support, it has the title “An update is available for Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2”.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">So I am now very confused. <font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Is KB958488 associated with .NET Framework 4 or .NET Framework 3.5?</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">And I know that Windows 7 comes with .NET Framework 3.5, but not with .NET Framework 4.<font><span>&nbsp;
</span>So, having uninstalled .NET Framework 4 Client Profile (as mentioned earlier), I was not expecting to find any further references to .NET Framework 4 in my system.<span>&nbsp;
</span>And yet, if I look in C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework, I find a directory called v4.0.30319 (and similarly in C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64).</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Also, KB958488 seems to be a slightly odd update.<font><span>&nbsp;
</span>In “Programs and Features” it appears simply as “KB958488”, and not as “Update for Microsoft Windows (KB958488)”, or something similar.<span>&nbsp;
</span>And there is no publisher associated with it.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is unique amongst all the Microsoft Windows updates.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">I now strongly suspect that KB958488 was also installed “under the covers”, along with .NET Framework 4 Client Profile, when I installed the Mouse and Keyboard Center.<font><span>&nbsp;
</span>I’m not at all sure that it was offered to me explicitly by Windows Update.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If it was installed in these circumstances, I would now like to uninstall it, even though it is classified as “Important” in the update history.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Does anyone have any views on this please?</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<span><font color="#000000">One subsidiary question.<font><span>&nbsp; </span>Having now uninstalled .NET Framework 4 Client Profile, is it always advisable to run a .NET cleanup tool (I believe they have names like “dotnetfx”), or do you only run one if you encounter

<p>E74 Is hardware failure. You need to have your 360 serviced. If you have a phat (and it sounds like you do), Microsoft no longer services the original large Xbox 360 consoles, and only services Slims and Super Slims. As these are the official Microsoft forums,
 I cannot suggest that you go to a third party for various reasons.</p>
<p>tl;dr, If you have a phat, you're ***, buy a new console.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>One of my two&nbsp;kids account doesn't seem to acknowledge the screen time limits&nbsp;I've set in the&nbsp;Microsoft family account settings page.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In doing some research I found that I can delete the contents of the folder&nbsp;<strong><span>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Parental Controls</span></strong> and then it will start to work... for the day. The next day I have to repeat this for it to
 work.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This doesn't impact my&nbsp;second child's account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As I was troubleshooting the issue this morning I noticed there was a difference between&nbsp;the time request notifications between my two kid's accounts.</span></p>

</p><p><span>Why are the screens of the working account blue and the non-working account red?</span></p>
<p><span>Why does it say at 12:00AM on 1/29/2017 the device will unlock?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I’ve tried this on two different PC’s with the same results.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I’ve scoured the family account settings and cannot find anything that is different between the two child accounts.</span></p>

            <p>I've had both accounts for at least 4 years. I have not made any recent changes.</p>
<p>Could it&nbsp;have something to do with how the associated xbox live accounts are associated with the Microsoft accounts? My son's xbox live account, which is the one with the problem,&nbsp;doesn't recognize him as a child but my daughters xbox live account does&nbsp;recognize
 her as a child.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>The card mentions that it can take a few days from when the steps were completed but the expiry date of the quest is the 30th of this month (2 days time) and I am not sure if they will be tracked in time.<br />

            My personal experience has been that even when the activity isn't showing as completed, when they close the month they do catch your activity. A couple months ago mine never showed as completed even though I knew it was, and on the roll over day I got
 all rewards. But that lag between completion and showing up on the punch card is worrisome some months.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows Update won&#39;t install new updates</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have windows 10 and windows update will not install updates. I click search for updates and it will look for a second, then try to install an update. Except it just sits at 0%. Forever. Then it just kinda forgets and goes back to the default option of
 "check for update". Click check again and the same thing happens, over and over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I've tried, and I put this here so please don't tell me to unplug my router and plug it back in again.</p>
<ul>
<li>Checked my internet connection - surprise, not that<br />
</li><li>Disabled my anti-virus<br />
</li><li>Restarted my computer</li><li>Verified all drivers are current<br />
</li><li>Ran cmd as admin</li><li>--net stop bits</li><li>--net stop wuauserv</li><li>--waited....</li><li>----net start bits</li><li>----net start wuauserv</li><li>The above commands with start wuauclt.exe in various orders</li><li>Deleted the items in %appdata%.local/temp</li><li>Deleted the items in windows/temp</li><li>Deleted the items in windows/software distribution/*"relevant files"</li><li>Cleared prefetch (runnin outta ideas)</li><li>Ran the windows update fix tool- which says every single time I run it (even back to back) that it fixed the problem. (nope)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure there are a million other things, and some of those may have been pointless. I don't debug and troubleshoot windows 10 for a living though so yeah. A little help folks?</p>

<p><strong>Hey, a couple months ago my mouse stopped working. I thought it was &nbsp;a driver problem, but windows said my drivers were up to date. Today, I got two driver updater programs, both saying I had 21 out-of-date drivers. I found most of them, but I still
 have 16 out-of-date drivers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I need to update:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Intel(R) ICH9 Family SMBus Controller- 2930</strong></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>A tip - ditch those driver checking programs and use manual methods - those programs<br />
always seem to create a mess eventually.</p>
<p>First check with Dell and their forums for drivers and known issues.<br />

<p>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

    <title>How do I add tooltip and title in&#47;for tiles on right side of the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ralph malph 2  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I add tooltip and title in&#47;for tiles on right side of the Start Menu</h2>
                    <p>I am working on customizing the Start Menu, not an easy friendly task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>That said, I have placed many items/tiles on the right side of the Start Menu, in the sometimes called "Metro" area. Most of the "tiles" have a title or description on the bottom of the tile such as Word 2016 for Word, or Videos for the users Video folder.
 But some do not. How do I add one in. There does not seem to be a way via the StartMenuLayout.xml file that can be exported/imported, nor can I find any other way to add in a title if Windows did not do it when I pinned the tile to the Metro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The other thing I noticed is that there are a couple of tiles that also have a "ToolTip" attached to them that shows up when you hover over the tile. I also need to know how to add a tooltip to my tiles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Common sense say's that if you can pin a "tile" to the "Metro" then just like a Shortcut on the desktop I should be able to right click it and rename it to give it a "title" as I want to see it, and I should also be able to then add in a tooltip since that
 is a nice feature to have and of course I should be able to tell it what Icon or picture to use for the tile if I don;t like the one it chose etc. That would be standard common sense custom configuration capabilities for any kind of Icon/Tile/button or whatever
 that will represent a program or action and that is meant to run/access programs or web pages etc when clicked on. Just like a desktop shortcut. I don't know who they have doing their designs but they seem to lack any kind of common sense. I could not imagine
 not having such common sense customization built in from the get go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>On these tiles you can see they have a title.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This one has a title and a tooltip.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This one, The "Microsoft Office 2016 Tools" folder does not have a title or tooltip, how do I add one or both to it?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This one, for "Settings" has no title, but it does have a tooltip. At least in Win 10 1709.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But in Win 10 1511 it has a title, but no tooltip. Dumb Dumb Dumb, wake up Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>There is NO excuse MS for not being able to do it from a right click - properties type of method.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, any help with how to add these common sense customizations to my start menu right side tiles, which I will export to an XML and then import so as to make it the default, per MS design, would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>

            The images you pasted in do not come through (the programmers at MS apparently don't know how to support that feature, actually they did, until it was "improved" out of the site a few years ago).  To add pictures to your reply you have to save them as JPGs. Then use the "insert picture" button, second from right, in the button bar at the top of the input box. 
<br />
<br />You have good questions. Unfortunately I have not been able to find answers to those specific questions.

<p>Pauli O,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help. I figured that if it let me paste it and it showed, like text, it would have posted it when I clicked submit, common sense, but I should have known better as this is a Microsoft site and they have no idea what common sense is, hence
 the reason I am on this forum asking questions that normally should be easy to figure out using....... wait for it...... common sense. That and 30+ years working with PCs since the old Apple II Plus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Oh well STUPID ME. I should have know better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks again for pointing out my stupidity Pauli.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This one, The "Microsoft Office 2016 Tools" folder does not have a title or tooltip, how do I add one or both to it?

<p>
</p><p>This one, for "Settings" has no title, but it does have a tooltip. At least in Win 10 1709.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4323e2c1-5284-41b6-b156-4759e0aa2f22?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4323e2c1-5284-41b6-b156-4759e0aa2f22?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But in Win 10 1511 it has a title, but no tooltip. Dumb Dumb Dumb, wake up Microsoft.</p>

<h2>            WWAN EM7345 not working after Fall Creators Update</h2>
                    <p>I installed Fall Creators Update (1709) the day it was released and my Sierra Wireless EM7345 WWAN adapter immediately stopped working. I uninstalled the update and it was working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I installed the update again. Same thing. The adapter stops working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By stopped working I mean no communication is working. The adapter seem to working as it looks good in device manager and I can connect to my operator without any problem. I get an ip address, netmask, gateway and ENS. But I cannot even ping my own ip address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Pro x64</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. Thanks.</p>

            If i'm not mistaken Sierra Wireless EM7345 WWAN is from Lenovo, so Lenovo is the one responsible to publish a compatible driver with Fall Creators Update. Check for one on Lenovo's website.

<h2>            How do I get my old product key&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi. My hard disk where the activated Windows 10 is installed&nbsp;failed and got corrupted.</p>
<p>Sadly, I wasn't able to create a media back-up on it. But I was able to create one from my brother's.</p>
<p>I got a new hard disk now, and installed Windows 10 but the installation is asking me for a product key.</p>
<p>I chose the "I have no product key" option, but now after installation,&nbsp;it's asking me to activate my Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way for me to recover the product key I'm using on my original OS?</p>

            <div>PC's that come pre-installed with Windows 8 don't have product keys any more.&nbsp; Instead of a sticker with a code on the back of the computer, the key is actually on a computer chip inside the computer, so that it can never be lost.&nbsp; The good news is that
 this means anytime you install Windows 8, it will see that chip and self-activate.&nbsp; The bad news is that for you to activate at this point, you're going to need to install Windows 8 first, activate (which will be automatic), then upgrade to 10.</div>

<p>I see it quite a bit. I know the FAL has a selective fire mode that you can unlock at lvl 10 but the KSG doesn't. ...I just googled jitter mod and found a heap of places currently selling modded controllers. I read somewhere on the forums here modded controllers
 like the Datel don't breach the xbox live ToS. So ..is it cheating to use it in COD? Am I supposed to report these guys?</p>
