<h2>            Dell Dimension E521 starts and shuts down on its own at random times...lot&#39;s of repair&#47;recovery attempts to no avail&#33;  What&#39;s next&#63;&#33;&#63;&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Alright, this is a bit of a long story, so I'll attempt to make it as short and easy as possible. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My grandmother has had the Dell Dimension E521 since sometime in December of '06. &nbsp;She had filled the C: drive with alot of junk and loaded the desktop with numerous useless shortcuts. &nbsp;Sometime in November of '10, she told me it had started to shut down
 and start up on its own at random times, so I tried to do what I could with Anti-Virus Scans (AVG Free Edition), deleting useless programs and applications, and trying out the short System Recovery application. &nbsp;While that made the computer run faster, it
 still started and shut down on by itself. &nbsp;Her house only has dial-up connection (meaning pretty much unable to update anything), so I brought it to my house for a better connection around 1/1/11 (9 days ago).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to update the AVG Free Edition and Windows Updates, and it found, and cleared, a Trojan Virus. &nbsp;The Dell still started and shut down on its own. &nbsp;My next step was to use the re-install disc for Vista Home Basic 32-bit. &nbsp;It saved the old programs
 in a "Windows.old" folder on the C: drive and totally re-installed every thing back to original. &nbsp;After I checked through the "Windows.old" folder and saved anything she didn't want to lose (such as pictures and videos) I cleared as much as I could from it.
 &nbsp;The only thing I couldn't delete from it was 4 "driver files." &nbsp;For a while the computer tried to run "chkdsk" on its own before it started, but froze in the middle of it. &nbsp;It did finally finish the "chkdsk" once and hasn't tried it again since. &nbsp;It downloaded
 and installed 100 or more Windows Updates on its own as well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After all that, it still does the same thing it has with the starts and shut downs. &nbsp;The shut downs don't just happen in the middle of running any particular program; they occur at any random time, even if I'm running the computer in safe mode. &nbsp;It always
 goes through the entire shut down process with the "logging off" and "shutting down" captions, so it's not as if the electric system is busted. &nbsp;The start ups happen randomly as well, even if a shut down is done on purpose through the Start Menu or holding
 down the power button. &nbsp;Sometimes it even tries to start up and shut down on its own repeatedly without fully loading.</p>
<p>Again, sorry that's so long, but I'd like to know if there's anything at all that can be done to get this thing to CUT IT OUT because my grandmother wants her computer back!</p>

<p>Sounds like a hardware problem, failing component of some sort; troubleshooting the same is not something the casual user/maintainer can do easily or cheaply.&nbsp; You may want to contact a reputable repair shop for assistance.</p>

Thank you Abdul_Malik. The browser is Chrome, the issue is when I open Chrome and search for any subject and it lands on The Search Engine Landing page. The search engine landing page is blank until I hit the reload arrow. So far today it is working properly.
 If it works properly throughout today I will mark this as solved, even though I never figured out why it was doing it.<br />

            <div>As of 11/04 @ 7:00pm on&nbsp;Chrome&nbsp;the Search Engine Landing Page is initially still blank. Hitting the reload arrow on the top of the browser always loads the&nbsp;landing page, but only if you hit the reload arrow. I've tried tapping the blank page, I cleared
 all the browser cookies, history, bookmarks. I uninstalled ALL add-ons (AdBlock and Popup Blocker) so I am running only the bare browser as it was downloaded and installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;After all that I switched search engines from Google to Bing (should have done this
 first maybe). When using Chrome browser and Bing search engine it works as it should. When using both&nbsp;Yahoo, and AOL search engines Chrome works and loads as it should. From this I am going to mark this as solved and pursue it further with Google. I will post
 back here if anything changes. Thank you very much Abdul_Malik for your suggestions. After doing a clean install of Windows I0, I have fallen in love with it. It's the best thing to happen to computers since the internet.</div>

            <p>I've had nothing but problems since upgrading to Windows 10. I'm not a techie and had to pay $150 to get my comp back up and running. Maybe you should warn people first. My browser shows a default of Microsoft,com/fwink</p>
<p>Never saw this before. What should it be? Every time I click on a site, I have to reload the page a second time in order for it to load. I can't get Windows Updates, it keeps saying having problems updating no matter what I try. As you can imagine I'm pretty
 upset along with many more people that this has created problems for. Fixes would be nice!</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<div>
<ol>
<li>Download and run the System Update Readiness tool. This tool runs a one-time scan for inconsistencies that may prevent future problems with installing updates or service packs. To download and run the System Update Readiness tool (Checksur.exe), go to the
 following Microsoft website:
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-is-the-System-Update-Readiness-Tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What is the System Update Readiness Tool?</a>
<div>(<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-is-the-System-Update-Readiness-Tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-is-the-System-Update-Readiness-Tool</a>)
</li><li>Install the updates again.</li></ol>
<p><span>If you still cannot install the updates or turn on Windows features, go to Method 2.</span></p>
<p><span>`~`</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><span>If you do not have the latest service pack for your version of Windows installed, go to the Service Pack Center to download and install the latest service pack.</span></div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Click the following link:
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/service-packs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Service Pack Center</a>
<div>(<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/service-packs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/service-packs</a>) &nbsp;</div>
</li><li>Click the service pack download link for your version of Windows.</li><li>Follow the instructions to download, and install the latest service pack.</li><li>Restart your computer.</li><li>Try to install the updates again.</li></ol>
<p><br />
<span>If you still cannot install updates or turn on Windows features, go to Method 3.</span></p>
<p><span>`~`</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><span>To run System File Checker, follow these steps:</span></div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Click <b>Start</b>, type <b>cmd </b>in the <b>Start Search</b> box (Windows Vista) or the
<b>Search programs and files</b> box (Windows 7), and then press Enter.</li><li>Right-click <b>cmd.exe</b>, and then click <b>Run as administrator</b>. Click
<b>Continue</b> if you are the administrator or type the administrator password, and then click
<b>Continue</b>.</li><li>In the command box window, type <b>Sfc /scannow</b>, and then press <b>Enter</b>. Note that there is a space before the forward slash in this command.</li></ol>
<p><span>The scan may take some time, so be patient. Windows will repair any corrupted or missing files that it finds. If information from the installation DVD is needed to repair the problem, you may be prompted to insert your Windows Vista or Windows 7 DVD.</span><br />
<br />
<span>After the scan is complete, try to install the updates again. If you still can't install the updates or turn on Windows features, go to Method 4.</span></p>
<p><span>`~`</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><b>Important </b><span>You should use an in-place upgrade only as the final alternative if the previous methods don't resolve your issue.
</span><br />
<span>Be aware that it takes the same amount of time to do the upgrade as it does to reinstall Windows. Also, some of your customized Windows settings may be lost during this process.</span><br />
<br />
<b>Note </b><span>Performing a repair installation will not damage files and applications that are currently installed on your computer.</span><br />
<br />
<span>To perform an in-place upgrade, follow these steps:</span><br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Close all applications.</li><li>Insert the Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, or Windows Server 2008 R2 DVD in the computer's DVD drive.
</li><li>In the Setup window, click <b>Install Now</b>. <br />
<br />
If Windows does not automatically detect the DVD, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Click <b>Start</b>, and then type <b><i>Drive</i>:\setup.exe</b> in the Start Search box.
<b>Note:</b> The Drive placeholder is the drive letter of the computer's DVD drive.</li><li>In the <b>Programs </b>list, click <b>Setup.exe</b>.</li><li>In the Setup window, click <b>Install Now</b>.</li></ol>
</li><li>Click <b>Go online to obtain the latest updates for installation (recommended).
</b></li><li>Type the product key if you are prompted to do this.</li><li>In the <b>Install Windows </b>screen, select the operating system that you want to
<b>Upgrade </b>or <b>Inplace</b>.</li><li>Click <b>Yes</b> to accept the Microsoft Software License Terms.</li><li>In the <b>Which type of installation do you want?</b> screen, click <b>Upgrade</b>.</li><li>When the installation is complete, restart your computer.<br />

<h2>            Lenovo X1 Tablet Windows 10 Creator ver 1703 Camera issu</h2>
                    <p>Upgraded windows 10 to Creator on lenovo X1 tablet. When opening the camera app now it starts with front camera instead of rear camera as before the update. How do I change it to default to the rear camera when opening the app? I have ran the system updates
 and nothing has changed. We need the app to open the rear camera by default when opening the app.</p>

<p>Hi Calvin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Camera app for Windows 10 doesn't have an option to change whether it will be displayed on rear or front view upon opening the application, yet it should have the button for switching the view. Each brand of devices are different, so it is a good idea
 to check the manufacturer's website for user guides and troubleshooting help. We acknowledge that you have already checked for other system updates. You might still need to check the drivers for the camera manually. We are providing you a link to one of our
 articles in the support site that might help you resolve this issue. Kindly check the link here:

            You need to use your Skype ID not mail ID to login to Skype. Microsoft has been moving all to a single Microsoft Account based services including Skype. Hence, a new Skype ID has been given to you on the basis of your Microsoft Account. Your old Skype ID is also preserved. So you can use either old Skype ID to login (to get into your old account) or Microsoft Account to login.
<br />
<br />You can transfer Skype Credits and Contacts to your other account so that credits are not wasted and contacts are not lost.

<p>
</p><p>I am getting a Windows Update failure on server 2008 R2 'Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 Service Pack1 (KB2528583)' &nbsp;and if fails with the code FB92A9BB. &nbsp;I can't seem to find any way to fix this issue. The summary.txt log showed an error but it didn't seem
 to offer any other clues as to why this is failing. This is an optional update and I am also getting a failure on an 'Important' update which seems to be a Security update for SP1 so it makes sense why that is failing as SP1 fails. Any thoughts are greatly
 appreciated. &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi kennethpaxton,<br />
<br />
The following are the possible reasons why you are encounterring this issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>An oudated version of Movie Maker. </li><li>The files added to the project are not supported by Movie Maker. </li><li>Corrupted codecs. </li><li>Video Card driver&nbsp;is not updated.</li></ul>
<p>As an initial troubleshooting procedure, we recommend that you perform the following:<br />
<br />
1. Ensure you have installed the latest version of Windows Live Movie Maker: <a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker</a>. </p>
<p>The current 2011 version: 15.4.3555.308<br />
· Windows Live Movie Maker is not supported on Windows XP<br />
<br />
2. Check that the files you are using are of a supported format – Some file formats are not supported by Windows Live Movie Maker. A list of supported formats can be found here:
<a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker-file-types-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker-file-types-faq</a></p>
<p>3. Ensure that you have the proper codecs to play your videos and audio files - Audio and Video require codecs to play the file and it’s important to have the right codecs installed or updated in your PC.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Try running the Microsoft FixIt tool for codecs: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/</a> </li><li>Media info will be able to identify any issues with missing or faulty codecs and whether it’s already installed in your computer or not. You can get it at&nbsp;
<a href="http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en</a></li></ul>
<p>Note: If can't find the codec you need you may convert the video to a supported format (eg. wmv) and then add it to your Windows Live Movie Maker project.<br />
<br />
4. Ensure that your video card drivers are up to date - Movie Maker makes extensive use of the video card GPU (graphics processing unit). The display driver affects the reliability, performance, and compatibility of the video card with various software.<br />
<br />
To determine the version and video card driver date, run the DirectX Diagnostic Tool (dxdiag):<br />
<br />
<strong>DirectX Diagnostic Tool</strong><br />
1. Click on Start button and type “dxdiag” in the Search programs and files box and press Enter key on the keyboard.<br />
2. Click on the Display tab and you will see the driver details including the driver version.<br />
3. If your video card driver seems outdated please go to the video card driver manufacturer and see if a newer version is available.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us</a></p>

<p><a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://downloadcenter.intel.com/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case issue persists,&nbsp;please answer the following questions below:<br />
<br />
- Does this error happen after adding media files to your project?<br />
- When does this error started to occur?<br />
- Were there any changes to your computer prior to this error?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
Thanks!</p>

<p><span>Hi coolis,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
There are many steps which we could try lets try the basic step, we will have to place the computer in a clean boot state, to place the computer in a clean boot state follow the steps below:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Step 1: Perform a clean boot<br />
</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Click Start</span><span>, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.
</span><span>&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original&nbsp;Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do
 not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Click OK, and then click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Once you restart check if the issue is resolved in clean boot state.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>If the issue does not occur in a clean boot state, follow the steps below to diagnose the program or startup item which is causing the issue</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 2: Enable half of the service</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.
</span></p>
<p><span>Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.
</span></p>
<p><span>Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.
</span></p>
<p><span>Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.<br />
<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
<br />
If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items</strong>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Perform a clean boot by repeating step 1.
</span></p>
<p><span>Click the Startup tab, and then click to select half of the check boxes in the Startup Item list.
</span></p>
<p><span>Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.<br />
<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 6: Resolve the problem
</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<br />
After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration Utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 7: Reset the computer to start as usual</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:
<br />
</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click Start
</span><span>, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.
</span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.
</span></p>
<p><span>On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.
</span></p>
<p><span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></p>

<h2>            Kit Carregador Controle original ou falso&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Olá amigos, gostaria da ajuda de vocês. Comprei um Kit carregador e bateria para o controle do xbox, veio na caixa original e tal, mas ao abrir a caixa uma surpresa! O selo no produto não era holográfico. O outro adesivo que vem o código de barras no carregador
 é verde clara, fazendo com que eu duvidasse da originalidade do produto . Bom, há algum tempo eu comprei outro kit, mas veio um selo preto e branco no carregador e o selo é holográfico. Pergunta: Alguém aí já passou por isso? Existe algum site que eu possa
 colocar o código de barras e verificar se o produto é original? O vendedor jura de pés juntos que é original? Dá uma força aí galera!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Valeu amigo pelo conselho, mas eu comprei um paralelo na caixa de um original, entende? não tive a intenção de comprar o paralelo não, até porquê eu já tinha um original, e como tenho mais de um controle, queria acabar de vez com as pilhas. Neste momento
 por exemplo, a bateria já descarregou olha que já é a 2ª carga completa hoje... &nbsp;Durou cerca de 3 horas cada carga.

<p>Ta ai uma coisa difícil de saber, original ou não, rs, já comprei uns 3 kits desses e 1 realmente deu problema, mas sinceramente acho que os 3 são falsos, dai o único critério que acho valido para tentar comprar um original é em uma loja do ramo de games
 mesmo, mas uma de nome bem conhecido, pois assim fica mais difícil que trabalhe com similares, rs. Pois aqui no centro de SP, vão até apostar a mãe que o treco é original, mesmo se o selo tiver sido feito a caneta, rs. Abraço</p>

<p>Pois é pessoal, hoje voltei a loja e o vendedor me reembolsou o valor pago. Fica aí a dica, Carregador original tem selo da microsoft holográfico... não dura apenas 3, 4 horas a carga, mas pelo menos uns 2 dias... Um abraço a todos e obrigado aos amigos
 que participaram deste post.</p>

<p>Hi LINDA JAYNE,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jonathan is right.&nbsp; There is also another program that uses the "Delivery Manager" process, called "Kontiki".&nbsp; It's a peer-driven communications sharing tool.&nbsp; To verify whether you're running it or not,&nbsp;right-click on the Taskbar and select the "Task Manager",
 you can check the tabs to see if you are running KService.exe or Khost.exe in the background.&nbsp; If either of those are running, this is most likely the culprit.&nbsp; If you enjoy using the program, I'd check to see if there's an update available, or perhaps trying
 to uninstall/reinstall.&nbsp; If it's there but you don't use it or need it, you can uninstall it from your "Programs and Features" located in your "Control Panel".&nbsp; I hope this helps!<br />
<br />
Dru</p>

<p><span><span>I have Windows 7 and I had trouble installing my Kodak printer. Each time I used the installation disk, I got an error. I phone Kodak (absolutely not help what so ever). But I finally found these instructions on the internet and they worked for
 me. Maybe this will help solve your problem.&nbsp; <br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I first downloaded the printer installation software from the Kodak web site (since my disk would not work). Once it's downloaded to your computer, right click on the setup file of the driver software, click Properties, click Compatibility tab,
 under compatibility mode, check mark “Run this program in compatibility mode for:” and select “Windows Vista (Service Pack 1)” or “Windows XP (Service Pack 2)” from the drop down list. Click Apply and then click Ok.</span></span></p>

<h2>            When I rename a file, how can I get the entire name &#40;with extension&#41; highlighted&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I right-click on a file and select 'Rename', or when I simply hit F2 on the file, the file name (<u>without</u> extension) is highlighted. Is there a way to tell Windows 7 to highlight the entire file name, including the extension when you start a rename
 process?</p>

            <p>Please only ask a question once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the most part, questions are responded to by other users who volunteer their time and expertise.&nbsp; It may take some time -- particularly around the holidays -- for someone to respond.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a few things to try when a file can't be deleted because it's "in use."</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Determine the full path to the file in question by right-clicking on the file, selecting Properties, and looking at the file's "Location."&nbsp; For example, if you're trying to delete BADFILE.TXT from your Desktop and you are logged in as KENNY P, the full
 path would be C:\Users\KENNY P\Desktop\BADFILE.TXT<br />
</li><li>Open a Command Prompt window (click the Start Orb, type cmd.exe and press Enter)</li><li>Leaving the Command Prompt open, open Task Manager (press CTRL+SHIFT+ESC) and select the "Processes" tab</li><li>Click on "explorer.exe" and then click the End Process button; the icons on your Desktop will disappear, as will the Task Bar -- this is OK</li><li>In the Command Prompt type DEL followed by the full path to the file and press Enter.&nbsp; If there are any spaces in the path, surround it with double quote marks (").&nbsp; Using the example from step 1, you should type<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; del "C:\Users\KENNY P\Desktop\BADFILE.TXT"</li><li>To restore the Desktop, go back to the Task Manager window, click File, then click New Task (Run ...), then type explorer.exe in the Open box and click OK</li><li>Close the Command Prompt and Task Manager windows</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the method above didn't work, you can unlock the file using a third-party tool.&nbsp; The easiest tool to use used to be Unlocker, but that tool is now bundled with a "Potentially Unwanted Program" -- a browser toolbar -- that will result in the download being
 blocked by many antivirus programs.&nbsp; You can still download it by temporarily disabling your a/v and then being very careful in the installation process to select the "Custom" installation option and UNcheck the boxes to install the toolbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See this for directions on using Process Explorer (safe) or Unlocker:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/128680/how-to-delete-move-or-rename-locked-files-in-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.howtogeek.com/128680/how-to-delete-move-or-rename-locked-files-in-windows/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to use Unlocker get it from this safe website: <a href="http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/unlocker.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/unlocker.html</a>&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found LockHunter, which appears to do the same job.&nbsp; My a/v didn't complain about it, but you should always pay close attention when installing free software so that you can UNcheck any options to install other, unwanted applications. --&gt;

                    Hello, <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am using <strong>Sony Vaio</strong> VGN-AR51E that has an <strong>OEM Windows Vista Home premium</strong>. My OS got corrupted and recovery got some error half way throught the process. I dont have recovery disc. I have contacted&nbsp;Sony for recovery
 disc, and&nbsp;will take sometime to deliver the&nbsp;discs. &nbsp;So I am planning to put a retail OS till then.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried to put Vista Business (drivers are available only for Vista) and after expanding files one error display occured in "<strong>Installing Updates</strong> " stage.. What should I do for this ? Please help..&nbsp;Should I change any
<strong>settings in BIOS</strong> because it is configured for OEM OS?

"My OS got corrupted and recovery got some error half way throught the process."<br />
<br />
For one thing, we do not know what caused the Recovery corruption 1/2 way through the Recovery Process.<br />
<br />
Recovery processes will reinstall correctly, unless there is another underlying problem.<br />
I suggest that you get that rectified as to why it happened&nbsp;by recontacting&nbsp;Sony.<br />

The Recovery Center will put it back to Factory Settings.<br />
And it is Sony's Recovery Partition on there, not Microsoft's.<br />
Any questions about that Recovery Partition, ask Sony as they&nbsp;should support their Recovery&nbsp;Software/Process.<br />
<br />
And the Recovery disks they will send you&nbsp;will want to put it back to how it was(Factory Settings), NOT how you have set it up.<br />
<br />
And if you have Home Premium installed, reinstall Home Premium.<br />
<br />
</span><br />
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
I ve ordered for <strong>Recovery Discs</strong> from Sony Germany. My recovery center is not working, and am scared that I can recover with the discs when it gets delivered.&nbsp; Is Recovery Center necessary, or I can do recovery with the discs itself ? .

<strong>ANYTHING</strong> to do with the&nbsp;<strong>Recovery Software/Process</strong>&nbsp;in your Computer is for you to discuss with
<strong>SONY</strong>.<br />
<br />
It is SONY'S Recovery Software/Process, NOT Microsoft's.<br />
<br />
Contact SONY for ALL questions re your Recovery Disks and/or Recovery Partition.<br />
<br />
Try the Recovery Disks when you get them.<br />
And if you have any problems&nbsp;using the Recovery Disk/s, Contact SONY.<br />
<br />

            Hi Diane.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Do you have a Support contract with Microsoft?  If so I'd contact them again and ask for a supervisor to insist they correct this now.  If not then the help they're giving is gratis and you'd likely do better having us help you here where we have experts since Support never hires experts except in the MS stores to compete with Apple Genius bar.  
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Here are steps for fixing Windows Hello:
<br />
<br />1) Turn off Fast Startup:  Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt; Change settings that are unavailable &gt; uncheck Fast Startup.  
<br />
<br />2) Reset Facial Recognition and/or Fingerprint Options
<br />
<br />  Go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign In Options
<br />    Locate Fingerprint or Facial Recognition options and click Remove under them.
<br />    After that, click Get Started and follow the on-screen instructions to reset Fingerprint and Facial Recognition.
<br />    Reboot your PC if needed.
<br />
<br />3)  Modify Group Policy Settings  (for Pro version only)
<br />
<br />Creators Update might have modified some of the crucial settings of Group Policy. Therefore, we would recommend to launch the Group Policy Editor and check/edit the settings related to Windows Hello functionality.
<br />
<br />    Pres Windows key, type gpedit, and press Enter.
<br />    Click on Computer Configuration and open Administrative Templates.
<br />    Select Windows Components and open Biometrics.
<br />    Click on Facial Features and right-click on Configure enhanced anti-spoofing option.
<br />    Select Edit and disable the Configure enhanced anti-spoofing feature.
<br />    Reboot your PC.
<br />
<br />4) Update drivers
<br />
<br />If some of the system drivers, most probably webcam and fingerprint reader drivers, were corrupted during the upgrade process, Windows Hello may fail to perform. To fix that, try to update the corresponding drivers:
<br />
<br />    Right-click on Windows key and select Device Manager.
<br />    Locate the Hello, webcam, and fingerprint drivers individually and right-click on each of them.
<br />    Select Remove driver software and wait for the removal to be finished.
<br />    Repeat the removal with all Windows Hello related drivers and then reboot your PC.
<br />    Once done, open Device Manager, click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes.
<br />    The system should automatically detect and reinstall the drivers.
<br />
<br />5) Run Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />6)  If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a> 
<br />
<br />7) If nothing else helps then run a Fresh Start:  <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use-the-fresh-start-feature-in-windows-10-creators-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>They have done all that. Hello webcam does not show up anymore as he removed it. I tried updating and it says I'm up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if I have support as I paid someone 199.00 a couple months ago as I thought someone was helping me and paid them over 500 to work on my computer. When I relied it was spam I called to have someone look at my computer and let me know. 5 minutes
 later they said my computer was fine. I'm all tapped out now and can't pay someone to fix the problem.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            Diane, I would not pay anyone any more money as this money is clearly wasted and likely scammed from you.  ALL of those who call  are scammers - no respectable support would ever call unless you call them first.  I would never pay anyone who calls you for anything, period. Since they now know you are a willing "mark" I'd block them as they come starting now.  
<br />
<br />It seems the problem is now the webcam so let's go over it next:
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Camera app at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Camera &gt; Advanced Options.  
<br />
<br />Did you enable the Privacy setting to allow apps to use your webcam?  
<br /><a href="https://www.top-password.com/blog/enable-disable-camera-or-webcam-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.top-password.com/blog/enable-disabl...</a>
<br /><a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-camera-and-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-...</a>
<br />
<br />Try the Hardware &amp; Devices troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the webcam driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  
<br />
<br />Also compare all other drivers including Chipset, display, sound, etc to make sure you have the latest on the PC maker's Support Downloads web page.  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Webcam device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br /> 
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

    <title>Xbox One won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t turn on&#47;off my Denon receiver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cgm31b  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t turn on&#47;off my Denon receiver</h2>
                    
<p>Guys,</p>
<p>I'm having a hell of a time trying to get my new Xbox one (a Day One Edition, if that is useful) to turn on/off and modulate the volume to my Denon AVR3310CI receiver. &nbsp;I've already been through the setup process for it, but to no avail. &nbsp;On the plus side,
 the Xbox will turn on/off my Panasonic Viera TC-P58V10 with no issues whatsoever when given voice commands of "Xbox On" and "Xbox Turn Off". &nbsp;When I go to TV &amp; OneGuide settings --&gt; Devices, my TV is shown as "Panasonic (remote code T1941)" and my Audio Receiver
 Model is correctly shown as "Denon AVR3310CI", however, unlike my TV, no remote code is shown.</p>
<p>When I go to TV &amp; OneGuide settings --&gt; Troubleshooting --&gt; Enter device remote code --&gt; Enter audio receiver remote code, the code "R2271" is already in the box by default, leading me to assume that this is the code that the Xbox is trying to use to communicate
 with my Denon receiver. &nbsp;Are there any other codes I should try? &nbsp;A quick perusal of the internet yielded nothing, hence my message here.</p>
<p>At first, I thought this could be a simple issue of the receiver not being able to receive the IR signal from the Kinect, so I bought a cheap IR Extender cable (sender) from monoprice.com. &nbsp;As you can already guess, I hooked it up but the problem still remains.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd love to get this problem solved, since I find myself really loving the ability to shout "Xbox On" into my home theater located in my basement to turn everything on while I'm upstairs. &nbsp;If it could turn on/off my receiver along with it, I'd be able to
 basically pack away all of my remotes, to include my Harmony. &nbsp;Any assistance on this issue would be great. &nbsp;Thanks ahead of time!</p>

<p>Exactly what settings would need to be changed on the AVR? &nbsp;It's simply a matter of receiving an IR signal; either it receives it through the IR sensor on the face of the AVR or it doesn't. &nbsp;Since aiming the Kinect sensor at the AVR and using the IR extender
 cable does nothing, I'm assuming that the Xbox is using the wrong remote code for my receiver. &nbsp;Either that, or it isn't sending any sort of signal at all. &nbsp;If you could elucidate on what specific settings I should be digging around in for my Denon, I'd greatly
 appreciate it. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In that case, yes it would be likely the wrong IR code, or the Denon is using RF and not IR. Owners manual here:<a href="http://www.manualslib.com/manual/356906/Denon-Avr-3310ci.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.manualslib.com/.../Denon-Avr-3310ci.html</a>
 may shed some light on that. But, if the Denon does not respond to any signal (or just some like volume up/down, and not on/off), the RF may be likely. I understand what you are looking for cgm31B, I wish I could give you the magic bullet. Thanks for working
 with me all this time, I do appreciate it. Let me know if the RF fix worked. </p>
