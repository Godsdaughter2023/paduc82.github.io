    <title>change region in xbox live app - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            change region in xbox live app</h2>
                    When I started the xbox live app it said my region for windows didn't match the region for the login. &nbsp;I couldn't find anywhere in metro to change the setting so I went into desktop mode to make the change.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have several issues with this. &nbsp;If my windows live login is for 'Canada' why doesn't the computer just use that. &nbsp;Why does the xbox app even care what my windows setting is, it's obviously tied to my user account's region settings. &nbsp;And if they 'must
 match', then just do it for me or ask if I'd like it fixed for me. &nbsp;Particularly with the location services it just seems this location stuff could/should be made automatic by default.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also I'd like to add that after I changed the windows region, the xbox app still wouldn't log in until I closed the app and started it again.</div>
                </div>

<p>Hi Rick,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you may already know, <strong>
Windows Defender</strong> constantly does automatic scans on your <strong>Windows 10</strong> computer to make sure that it is protected. However, since you would like to turn it off, you may check the previously provided
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026132/windows-schedule-a-scan-in-windows-defender-antivirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> on this thread by
<strong>Mayra Aqu</strong>. However, instead of scheduling the scans, you just have to right-click on
<strong>Windows Defender Scheduled Scan</strong> and select <strong>Disable</strong>.</p>

    <title>Uninstall certain apps in Office 16 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harshsyd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Uninstall certain apps in Office 16</h2>
                    <p>Hi there! So recently (well last night) I went and grabbed myself a DVD of Office 2016 Pro Plus from my local store (it's an offline installer). So the thing is with this office...it's not like those usual exe/msi setups...it is however an offline one but
 like the other offices it doesn't ask you on what programs you want to install. It's a click-to-run offline setup and the thing is that it install every single Office 16 app which is useless. I do not want Skype For Business nor OneDrive nor OneNote and some
 other apps. So like in the previous versions of Office's I don't get a choice to customize what I wanted to install. So even after the full installation has been completed, I went to Programs &amp; Features and clicked 'Change' on Office 16 Pro Plus but this time...I
 only got an option to do an Offline or a Online repair. No options to uninstall certain apps like it has been allowed since all of those Office versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I wanted to know that what are the ways I can get rid of apps that I don't need like Skype for Biz and OneDrive and such...these are useless for me and plus they fill up my HDD space. I have an offline version of Office 16 from my DVD but it's a Click-To-Run
 and I wanted to know what ways can i get rid of useless apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>

</span>makes for an almost 1-click installation. While this makes installation easier, it also eliminates some customizations like your desire to install to a drive other than the System drive.

<h2>            Windows Defender says I am part of an organization</h2>
                    I installed the new update, and have had a huge list of issues. One being the fact I cant use my windows defender anymore. For some reason it states that I do not have the right permissions. For example when I try to go perform a scan i get this error
 message. "Your IT administration has limited access to some areas of this app, and the item you tried to access is not available. Contact IT helpdesk for more information." I am on a home PC with no organization that i know of. Is there a way to give my computer
 some kind of Administrator access for this mythical organization? What do I do?

            As an initial recommendation, we suggest that you disable the driver signature enforcement by following these steps:
<br />Click Start.
<br />
<br />Click the Power button.
<br />
<br />Hold the Shift key and click Restart.
<br />
<br />Choose Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options.
<br />
<br />Click Startup Settings.
<br />
<br />Click Restart again.
<br />
<br />Once your computer restarts, press F7 on your keyboard to select Disable driver signature enforcement. Your computer will now restart automatically.
<br />
<br />If the issue persists after disabling the driver signature verification, disable Secure Boot temporarily in your computer's UEFI/BIOS. You can contact your computer's manufacturer or check the device manual for the steps on how to do this.
<br />
<br />Important: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk. 
<br />
<br />If you can't find the toggle to disable Secure Boot, a firmware update for the UEFI/BIOS may be required. This can usually be found in the manufacturer's website.
<br />
<br />After disabling Secure Boot, boot normally into Windows and check if you can install the programs. If you're successful, boot back into the UEFI/BIOS and re-enable Secure Boot since this is an important security feature.

            After clicking restart in the advanced options I am greeted by black. The monitor picks up the display, but shows black. I had to hard reset after waiting some time, to fix this. I then tried the same process again, only to have the same result. I am an
 experienced overclocker, and feel comfortable in the bios. Should I just deactivate safe boot, also once I do, what program am I attempting to install. My issue is just that windows defender is not properly working. Everytime I try to scan or do anything with
 the defender it says to contact my IT helpdesk.&nbsp;

    <title>Latest Skype installation contains a virus -- please advise when fixed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Latest Skype installation contains a virus -- please advise when fixed</h2>
                    <p>Installer: Skype-8.17.0.2.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scanning the installer for viruses finds nothing.&nbsp; However, upon running the installer, installation triggers the following detection from my antivirus program:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Access to "C:\Program Files (x86)\...\electron-ssid.node" containing the virus or unwanted program "TR/Crypt.XPACK.Gen3" was blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installation then fails to complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was not a problem with my previous installation, using&nbsp;Skype-8.16.0.4.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please let me know when the latest installer is virus-free?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<p>No virus should be present if you downloaded the file directly from Skype. I just downloaded that release of Skype. I then scanned that install file along with the exact file mentioned after the installation. It came back clean using 65 different antivirus
 vendors. I highly suggest you uninstall your current version of Skype, then perform a full system scan for malware/viruses. Redownload the latest release directly from Skype (provided below), then reinstall the software. If a detection continues to occur then
 the problem is either a false detection made by your antivirus program or you have an existing issue on your computer that may require a more thorough antivirus or antimalware program.</p>

<p>I am faced to the same problem with "Skype-8.21.0.9" downloaded directly from Skype. Avira Free Antivirus blocks&nbsp;"C:\Program Files (x86)\...\electron-ssid.node" after detection of "TR/Crypt.XPACK.Gen3".

<div>my beloved n82 restarts by itself thrice a week.. sometimes twice a day, and even if a message comes and even sometimes i'm in a middle of replying on a text message. sometimes, even if it is in standby mode, it restarts on his own.:smileysad: It hasn't
 been dropped, put it in a dusty area, leave on a very hot and cold temperature.. and other things how you can take care of your phone, I'm following it. it also runs in v31. i am a gadget freak and a gadget lover and for me, each gadget is like a child and
 must be treated as such... that's why I can't think of anything that will cause that glitch... I've read all the n82 problems in most of this forums but i never saw a problem like this... a 14 month old nokia n82 which restarted itself without doing anything.
 so can anyone of you can give me an answers regarding this problem? thank you so much and God bless us all.</div>

<p>Try a soft or a hard reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Factory settings reset</strong>. In standby, dial *#7780# and the phone's lock code (the Nokia's default lock code is 12345). This reset restores phone's original settings.<br />
<br />
<strong>Soft reset</strong>. In standby dial *#7370# and the phone's lock code.<br />
<u>Warning!Soft reset deletes all your phone's data, so backup your stuff before you do a soft reset!<br />
</u><br />
<strong>Hard reset</strong>. Turn off the phone. Press and hold three keys together, the green key, the '*' key and the number '3'.Then, turn on the phone and don't let the three keys before you see the Nokia hands logo.<br />
For 5800 XM hard reset need different keys. The green key, the red key and the camera button. The process is the same.<u>Warning!Hard reset deletes all your phone's data!</u><br />
And, for N97 go to

<h2>            Stuck in Microsoft Office Accounting 2009 Express Activation Wizard</h2>
                    <p>
I had installed Microsoft Office&nbsp;Accounting&nbsp;2009 Express version, during application launch I clicked on Upgrade button and entered a wrong product key, when I proceeded with the process of activation over internet, however this process failed with following
 error message</p>
<p>
---------------------------</p>
<p>
Activation Error</p>
<p>
---------------------------</p>
<p>
A communication error has occurred, and your request cannot be processed at this time. Check your connection to the Internet. Either try again, or select Cancel, go back, and then select the Telephone option to speak to a customer service representative.</p>
<p>
---------------------------</p>
<p>
Now I am stuck on this step. &nbsp;I have even&nbsp;completely&nbsp;removed "Microsoft Office Accounting 2009 Express" (deleting all folders (program files / documents and setting) , and all registry keys), but on re-installing the application same dialog box (Activation
 and Registration) opens , and it does not ask me for product key and neither I can switch to Express mode.</p>

<p>likewise a contact pointing to a group email in the second domain</p>
<p>
</p><p>it appears that although the GAL is shared the on prem system is limited in adding the new domain to the list, does that mean the list should be abandoned and recreated in the cloud?</p>

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the DG is synced from on premises, we need to change the email address there instead of Office 365.</p>
<p>To do that, first, you need to add UPN suffixes (second domain) to the forest in on premises.
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Adding a UPN Suffix to a Forest</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Open Active Directory Domains and Trusts.</li><li>Right-click <strong>Active Directory Domains and Trusts</strong> in the Tree window pane, and then click Properties.</li><li>On the UPN Suffixes tab, type the new UPN suffix that you would like to add to the forest.</li><li>Click Add, and then click OK.</li></ol>
<p>Now when you can add another email address which use this domain to the distribution group in on premises. Then it will be synced to Office 365.
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span><span>Toby</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Toby</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've added the UPN suffix however that only allows me to set up a login to the suffix, if I put the email address for the account in he Email field and nothing happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The users with the email from the 2nd domain also have an account in the 1st domain to access the on prem sharepoint. These credentials give them a login the primary domain for Sharepoint access and aren't used for email access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been doing a fair bit of testing and found that address lists created in the cloud can be accessed by both groups of users, is it possible it is best practice to create these global lists online instead of on prem?</p>

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder if you ran the <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/nawar/2016/02/25/forcing-synchronization-with-azure-ad-connect-1-1-aad-connect-1-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
force sync</a> after you add the email alias to the DG in on premise. If not, please give it a shot and check if the email address can be synced to Office 365.
</p>
<p>If the issue persists, please upload two screenshots about the affected DG’s emails address, one is from on premise, another one is from Office 365, so we can better understand your situation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>My experience in this matter can only be related in my mind with something close to abuse. (for instance having moderators lightly suggest I'm an idiot and the answer is simple and then providing what the website states - even though I have made it crystal
 clear that the website instructions do not hold. Or probiding drop down options which are highly limited and do not cater to the matter at hand).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A large and powerful Corporation has totally failed to provide me a means of communicating to a human being to explain my concern (clearly shared by many) and failed to properly support the forum (which appears to date to be a convenient means to get rid
 of pesky questions of those who have put down their money to purchase Microsoft products).
</p>
<p>When this laptop dies I will probably move away from Windows; I've already made the shift with my smart phone. In the past I notice that the problem of a jumping cursor was likewise ignored ... my cursor still jumps about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially I am now totally confused about the status of my skype accounts. If I could merge them I would ... but it's the same Catch 22. For the moment I give up ... I just don't have the time or energy to keep trying to find a way to get help. Clearly
 the Corporation is not interested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just not good enough Microsoft!</p>

<p>Dear Readers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is true that once a legacy (old) Skype account is linked to or merged with a Microsoft account, this process can not be reversed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also true that <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA142/how-do-i-close-my-account-for-skype?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
closing a Skype account</a> will also close the Microsoft account associated with the Skype account.&nbsp; We may provide feedback regarding account linking and un-linking by clicking on the "Share your experience!" button in the FAQ article,
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa12060/can-i-unlink-my-skype-and-microsoft-accounts?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
"Can I un-link my Skype and Microsoft accounts?"</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wish to close an old or legacy Skype account that has not yet been linked or merged with an existing
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12059/what-is-a-microsoft-account?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft account</a> that is in use and is still needed, first create a new and completely separate Microsoft account with its own new e-mail address, and
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34657/a-single-sign-in-for-skype-and-your-other-microsoft-services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
use this new account to link with the old Skype account</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Tip: Only one e-mail address is allowed per Microsoft account, and that e-mail address can be used only once for one Microsoft account.&nbsp; In other words, we can not have or create more than one Microsoft account using the same e-mail address.&nbsp; Likewise, we
 can not merge or blend together more than one old Skype account into a single Microsoft account.</p>

<p>Paragraph 3 above deals with an old skype a/c which is "in use and still needed".<br />
Elaine does not address the very first statement of this thread. That is "(1) I wish to delete my original skype account."<br />
<br />
With patience I finally found a way (which I no longer have the steps to) but was foiled as the original a/c has 0.66cents credit and therefore could not be closed.
<br />
<br />
If Ms really wants to provide assistance in this matter (which after all it created by lack of foresight to existing account holders) then it needs to spell out the steps and not merely direct individuals to complex pages.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless I do acknowledge that Elaine is the first proper respondent and regret that it has taken so long to get some sort of response. I urge her to remain on task and provide step by step direction to those who may find such pages as "https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34657/a-single-sign-in-for-skype-and-your-other-microsoft-services"
 confusing because for a start the term "update skype a/c" is not defined. Many like me simple wish to delete the original a/c so we have one Ms - Skype a/c and sign in.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, I agree with you: the Skype account and Microsoft account convergence (merging) can be very confusing and complicated.&nbsp; I hope you provided feedback given the opportunity to do so in the "Can I un-link my accounts" FAQ article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the main point I was trying to make: if your old Skype account is not linked with the Microsoft account you need to keep using, then simply close the old Skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your old Skype account has been linked to the Microsoft account you need to keep using, then obviously you can not close the Microsoft account.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is some good news here: if you realize you made a mistake in closing a Microsoft account you wanted to keep using, simply signing on to the account stops the 60-day account closing clock and the account remains open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that makes better sense and is clearer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Elaine</p>

<p>Hello Elaine,</p>
<p>Problem is I don't know if they're linked. When I sigh in with Ms a/c (the only option offered) then it shows the name of the original a/c in the top right (including this page).
<br />
Does this mean they are linked? I did not link them.<br />
<br />
Also deleting the original a/c is not yet possible (as stated above) as that a/c retains $0.66c credit and it's not possible to delete an a/c with credit.
<br />
<br />
I wish there was a simple way to check if the two are merged. </p>
<p>
</p><p>btw ... I still haven't been able to use Skype with my friends and family even though I'm overseas and would like to use it.

</p><p>On July 3, I wrote,</p>
<p><em>If you wish to close an old or legacy Skype account that has not yet been linked or merged with an existing
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12059/what-is-a-microsoft-account?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>I regret that what I typed was not clearer.&nbsp; What I was trying to explain was how to avoid the exact situation you found yourself in.&nbsp; All legacy Skype accounts were converted to basic Microsoft accounts in September 2016.&nbsp; Closing a Skype account therefore
 closes a Microsoft account. The purpose of creating a new, separate and distinct Microsoft account with its own e-mail address is to provide an account to use, to link a legacy Skype account with, therefore completing the account merge process so the Microsoft
 account with the legacy Skype account attached to it could be closed.</p>

<h2>            Outlook sign-in through Internet Explorer</h2>
                    I am currently unable to log in to my Outlook email through Internet Explorer. &nbsp;The address bar begins flashing and the following message is displayed: &nbsp;"Something went wrong and we can't sign you in right now. Please try again later." &nbsp;This problem has
 begun within the last two weeks and is not experienced when trying to access Outlook through my phone, Windows Live Mail, or Chrome - only IE. &nbsp;I also do not have any trouble logging in to my Microsoft account in IE but when I ask to see my in box the same
 message is delivered. &nbsp;Any suggestions as to what may be causing this.

<h2>            Microsoft word footnotes restarting at one mid section</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having serious problems with one chapter in a multiple chapter book I am editing.&nbsp; I have added section breaks at the start of each chapter so that the footnotes start at 1.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in one of the chapters the footnotes suddenly re-start at 1 and I can't seem to change this. So it is going 1, 2, 3, 1.&nbsp; When I tried to manually change the footnote number to 4 it pushed me into note options from a dialogue box and then a section
 break seemed to appear with the footnote number right in the middle.&nbsp; I was unable to delete it without deleting the footnote.&nbsp; I did later try this and deleted the whole section break footnote combo but when I reinserted a footnote it still came up as 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also experimented by trying to insert a footnote straight after footnote 3 and this still comes up as footnote 1.&nbsp; I have switched off track changes to do all this and I have all hidden characters and formatting marks showing.</p>

<p>Hi Everyone - thank you for all the suggestions.&nbsp; I ended up splitting the document into its 5 sections, reformatting them, and deleting every footnote and reinserting them using the Word system.&nbsp; I think as you said that some footnotes had been put in by
 a different method and my document went into melt down as it was coping with track changes, section changes, strange footnotes, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Deeja87,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you couldn’t login Outlook 2016 desktop client, please kindly try the following methods:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Please check whether there are anti-virus program running on background and try to temporarily disable it. And also check if you have inputted the right username and password, and try to use your user principal name to login.</li><li>Close Outlook client, and go to Start-&gt;type ”Credential” in search box-&gt;when you see the “Windows Credential manager” click it, then clear the relevant credentials or all of them if you like (back up the credentials first if you have any important data).
 Finally restart the Outlook.</li><li>If the issue still exists, it may be caused by poor network connection, to scope this, please change to another network environment to check and see.</li><li>Check the Outlook client version, go to File-&gt;Office account-&gt;Update option-&gt;Update now, for Outlook Windows, the latest version should be: Version 1803 (Build 9126.2152) for Monthly and Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted), &nbsp;Version 1708 (Build 8431.2242) for
 Semi-Annual Channel.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, after you tried the methods above, may I collect some information from you?</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Please provide the screenshot of Outlook client full version number to me so that I can try to reproduce.</li><li>Would you please provide the screenshot of entire error messages (if any generates).</li><li>Are you using Office 365 online service, or hosting Exchange server on-premises, whether you are an pure-online user?</li></ol>

<p>Hi Deeja87, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I couldn’t see the screenshot you provided above, would you please provide them again via Private messages, and have you tried to update the client version (File-&gt;Office account), is the issue still occurs? could you please provide the version number of
 Outlook client for I need it to further scope and analyze the issue, I have sent you a message, please check:
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox</a> .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, since you said you didn’t use Office 365, may I know what type of account you are trying to set up on Outlook client, is it an Microsoft account(like Outlook.com, Hotmail.com )? Since the issue may be caused by credential corruptions, &nbsp;have your&nbsp;
 tried to clear the Windows Credentials?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, if possible, please refer to this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-an-email-account-to-outlook-6e27792a-9267-4aa4-8bb6-c84ef146101b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> and try to set up the account on another PC Outlook client and see whether this issue still exists, this is to scope whether it is caused by the specific client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Anna</p>

<p>Hi Deeja87,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your information, according to the screenshot, the method you set up your account is Exchange type, may I know whether your account is an Exchange on-premises account, and the Outlook Web App you mention refers to
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/</a> or <a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://outlook.live.com/owa/</a> . If you couldn’t tell what the type of account you are using, you may provide the login account custom domain to me via Private Messages:
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox</a> . May I know whether this client can set up other accounts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, please check whether account has enabled two-factor authentication. Generally, when enabled the two-factor authentication, instead of original password, you should input the app password in Outlook client. &nbsp;And also please check whether there
 are any third-party add-ins enabled, some third-party add-ins can affect the Outlook normal operations, you may identify it via
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-windows-pc-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
restart the Outlook in safe mode</a>, and then to see if you can set up your account.</p>

<p>Hi Deeja8,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the private messages, may I re-confirm with you what type of account you are using? There are different ways of configurations and settings for different account types. If it is Office 365 account, in Outlook client, you should choose Office
 365 instead of Exchange, if it is an exchange on-premises account, the method of setting up account should be Exchange, and in most situations, you can just only input the user ID and let the Outlook client do the rest of things for you. For Outlook Web App
 link you provided, it seems most likely your organization have a local Exchange server, generally, for online users they can navigate to outlook.office365.com/owa link, that is also why I have to confirm with you about your account type.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you set up the account as Exchange account, if you didn’t know whether your account is an on-premises account or Office 365 online account, please contact your admin to further check your account type, you may also provide the account domain(user@contoso.com,
 do not provide the password) to me through Private Messages. Meanwhile, please check whether other people inside the organization having the same issue as they also cannot login OWA, or cannot set up account on Outlook client, the client always asking for
 password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To scope whether the issue was caused by Outlook profile corrupt, please try to create a new profile and add your account in this new Outlook profile, you can refer to this article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-an-outlook-profile-f544c1ba-3352-4b3b-be0b-8d42a540459d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-an-outlook-profile-f544c1ba-3352-4b3b-be0b-8d42a540459d</a> .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you couldn’t even reach Outlook Web App, please clear all browsers history and caches, then try to re-login OWA using IE InPrivate mode, meanwhile, please make sure that there isn’t any third-party anti-virus scanner running on backend, to scope whether
 the issue was caused by poor connections or firewall settings, please change another environment, like switch from Home to Network environment to see if you can login OWA. And please provide the error screenshot of OWA to me for troubleshooting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, please check whether you have changed or reset the password recently. And if you still couldn’t set up account on Outlook client, please take a remote connectivity test: open this
<a href="https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a>-&gt;select “Exchange Server” tab-&gt;” Microsoft Office Outlook Connectivity Tests”-&gt;”Outlook Autodiscover”-&gt;click Next, input your account password, verification code and click Perform test-&gt;save the Test
 Details as HTML format and provide it to me via Private Messages.</p>

    <title>Bring back &#34;Make Same Size&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rypowell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bring back &#34;Make Same Size&#34;</h2>
                    <p>A few versions ago in Visio there was a fantastic "Make same size" button that just allowed us to select a bunch of shapes, click it and they all (magically) were made the same size as the primary selection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason that I'll never comprehend that option was removed and we mere mortal were left having to manipulate shape sizes using the "Size and Position" window - a very clunky and horrible interface that takes much more time and many more clicks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please please please can the simple joys of "Make same size" be brought back to Visio and Publisher?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've seen that you can create a e-mail notification for a library. Now I want to create a E-mail notification for a folder within that library.<br />
From what I've seen it's not possible, but maybe someone knows a workaround?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi FerronNijland,</p>
<p>Yes, for the whole library, we can use the “<strong>Alert me</strong>” feature. However, there is not an out-of-box feature to create an e-mail notification for a folder within the library.</p>
<p>For possibly workarounds, we may consider using the<strong> Send an Email</strong> action in the Workflow Designer, we can set up our custom workflow to send e-mail messages to us or to any other specified user or group when a uploading file into a SharePoint
 Team Site folder. Here is an article introducing this feature, for your reference:

<p>Since our forum focuses on Office 365 for Business plan out-of-box related features, for SharePoint workflow customization, I would like to introduce our

<h2>            Build 17017-1400 page_fault_in_nonpaged_area volsnap.sys</h2>
                    <p>I've just been through a somewhat harrowing experience with one of my laptops.&nbsp;&nbsp; Build 17010 downloaded and installed an appeared to be working OK.&nbsp; As is usual, it had switched off System Restore (when will MS stop doing this?) so I turned it on and created
 a restore point.&nbsp; I also remove some ole registry keeys to get rid of 10016 errors.&nbsp; Then I rebooted and that's where the problem started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine crashed almost immediately with page_fault_in_nonpaged_area citing volsnap.sys as the problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I tried starting in many of the modes which are offered on the F8 screen but all of them did the same thing.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Eventually, in sheer desperation I used the Hiren’s mini Windows XP to put the previous volsnap.sys file in System32 from the Windows.old structure and then the system worked.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>I was intending to roll back to the previous build but it tried to do that and failed and then next time I tried it said I couldn’t go back.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>At the moment it appears to be running OK but I am concerned that there may be some other problems waiting to jump out at me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since getting going again I've removed the ole registry data again and the system has rebooted to I do not believe that was the issue.</p>

<p>I restored my system using an image created of 16299.19 before updating to 17017.&nbsp; After updating again to 17017, I then decide to not enable system restore and I have not experienced any further crashes.</p>

<p>I experience the same problems on 2 computers when I installed 17017 and tried to run a backup using Veritas System Restore program.&nbsp; The backup ran for a few second and then I got the error message.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oct. 22 - the problem is a corrupt volsnap.sys file which is located in c:\windows\system32\drivers.&nbsp; The solution is to take ownership of the file and delete it.&nbsp; Copy the same file from c:\windows.old\system32\drivers to the place of the deleted file.&nbsp;
 I have done this in 4 installations and all of them worked fine afterward.</p>

            There are multiple entries in the Feedback Hub as well as this thread and I've seen at least one other thread.&nbsp; Is MS listening?&nbsp; I guess that the only people running insider builds won't have a support contract so are not able to shout very loud.&nbsp; It
 will be interesting to see how long it takes MS to acknowledge there is a bug and how many people will have to re-install to overcome this.&nbsp; Those of us who are able to diagnose these kinds of issues and correct the should count ourselves lucky.<br />

            Oh, and another thought.&nbsp; This seems to be provoked by switching on system restore so MS will likely tell us not to turn it on to avoid the problem.<br />

            Thanks very much for the workaround! Confirmed copying \Windows.old\System32\volsnap.sys over the 17017 version in \Windows\System32 allowed me to boot into Windows again. Previously had alternating BSOD, auto repair, GSOD looping. Trigger here was installing
 ADK insider then rebooting. I see a recovery point listed created by Windows Modules Installer - thinking the ADK install created that. Not sure what will happen next though. WinSxS version is still the 17017:&nbsp;

            Had the same issue.&nbsp; <del>Trigger I believe is turning on system restore.</del>&nbsp; All was well until I shut the system down and later restarted.&nbsp; First startup crash 'Page fault in non-paged area', volsnap.sys.&nbsp; Endless loop of boot failures, GSOD's, Auto
 Repair start<br />
failures, BSOD's.&nbsp; Formatted and started over with 16299, upgraded to 16299.15, applied the KB to 16299.19.&nbsp; Now 17017 has failed to install 5 times, code 0xc1900101.&nbsp; Observing, installation each attempt crashed at 6% with a 'Page fault in a non-paged area'<br />
BSOD, faulting volsnap.sys.&nbsp; Holding now at a perfectly clean and pristine 16299.19 waiting to see what happens.&nbsp; :( &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

I just got mine to install properly.&nbsp; The only things I did differently was prior to allowing the upgrade to 17017 to run was to turn off 'Legacy Components'
 (Direct Play) in "Turn Windows Features On/Off".&nbsp; I also pre-installed the latest OEM driver for my Hauppauge TV tuner, and Cyberlink Power2Go 10.&nbsp; I also turned off System Protection, which oddly enough was on after the upgrade to 17017 by default.&nbsp; I'm gingerly
 poking around right now and about to do the first restart since installation with my fingers crossed.

            I'm not sure anything is going to happen.&nbsp; I keep looking to see if there is any MS acknowledgement of this problem but I can't find any reference to it on any official MS page and I don't know how to report it directly other than the Feedback App - and
 none of the many entries there have anything to indicate that anybody from MS has looked at them.<br />

    <title>Undeletable Playlists - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j mackey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Undeletable Playlists</h2>
                    First of all, let me state this is not a case of user error. I've already had the issue escalated with two different WP8 technical support reps and am waiting to hear back there. But since I am impatient, I'm still attempting to solve this myself.<br />
<br />
I have 3 empty playlists in the WP8 music app that cannot be deleted. Nothing happens when you press Delete in the context menu. If you look at Music/Playlists on the file manager, 3 files are there that have the same name as the playlists. If you delete these,
 they just reappear the next the phone is attached.<br />
<br />
If I do a factory restore and restore from a backup, the 3 files/playlists are there as soon as it finishes. If I do a factory restore and choose to NOT restore the backup, the files/playlists are gone until I sign in with my Microsoft account. If I sign in
 with a Microsoft account during the setup process, the files/playlists are there right away, but if I skip the Microsoft account and do it later, the files/playlists only appear once I sign in.<br />
<br />
This lead me to believe that something in my Microsoft account was responsible but the problem still persists even if the phone is airplane mode. (That is, cannot delete in the app and will reappear after deleting in the file manager.)<br />
<br />
One of the undeletable playlist actually has the same name as one of my normal playlists so in the playlist list, there are two. My normal one can be deleted just fine.<br />
<br />
If I copy an identically named file filled with garbage over the playlist file in the file manager, it will ask to overwrite but after a restart I have two files in there with the same name. (Which isn't possible on a normal filesystem)<br />
<br />
<br />
I am officially stumped. I have corrupted data that cannot be deleted and a factory reset won't get rid of it.<br />
Any advice or ideas is appreciated.<br />
<br />
<br />
Josh<br />

            I have solved this with the help of a MS technical rep.<br />
<br />
As it turns out, playlists in the Windows 8 Music app sync to the cloud and thus my phone was syncing them too. However, there was nothing in the phone's UI to reflect this and as I mentioned, the delete button was in an enabled state but still did nothing.
 Deleting them from the Music app on my PC removed them from the phone.<br />
<br />
I imagine that this playlist syncing works well if you have music bought from the Xbox Music Store that would also sync, however, all my music was ripped from my cds.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Importing Multiple Records from .vcf &#40;vCard&#41; file</h2>
                    
<p>In a&nbsp; nutshell I have about 300 records in a .vcf (vCard) file and those records were exported from a mobile phone and got all in a file name "All_Contacts.vcf" .&nbsp; When I try importing these records in Outlook 2007 Contacts I get only one (the topmost record)
 imported.&nbsp; If I try importing again then the same record (the topmost record) gets imported again.&nbsp; I do not&nbsp; think that this is the limitation of Outlook, but I am not sure because I stumbled upon a program called vCard ImportExport and using that program
 I can import multiple records, but it has a limitation of importing the first 10 records only.&nbsp; Does that mean that this program was made by this company because it figured out a limitation of Outlook 2007 import feature?</p>
<p>Can someone please help me in finding out how to import multiple entries using Outlook 2007 File -&gt; Import and Export command.</p>

            <p>Outlook only imports one contact from a given VCF file there is no way around that using the VCF format in any version of Outlook.</p>
<p>You will need a 3rd party utility for multiple contacts from a single file. Suspect that the limitation you encountered for the program mentioned gets removed upon purchase. There are options available.</p>
<p>Another such program that has excellent reviews comes from the folks at 4Team</p>
