            <p>Hello Elaine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We realize the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Photo Gallery, you can arrange the pictures as per your requirement. I mean to say, you can sort them accordingly. In the concerned folder, go to
<strong>View </strong>tab and click and expand view ribbon. &nbsp;In the View file ribbon, you can go to Arrange list for arranging the pictures as per your requirement. It will give you an option for arranging them by
<strong>Date, Person, Type,&nbsp;Name, Rating&nbsp;</strong>and etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep posted if you require further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>You can go to that folder where the pictures actaully present and you can order and group them accourding to date.<br />
This will show you pictures as they were taken.</p>

<h2>            Systeminfo.exe wrong info about System boot time</h2>
                    <div>Hello everyone,</div>
<div>I am going to discuss about Windows 10 systeminfo.exe after upgrading Windows I am facing that systeminfo.exe not giving correct information about system boot time.<br />
I tried systeminfo.exe in&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;7 and Windows 8 then it gives correct information about System Boot Time.<br />
But Why Windows 10 Systeminfo.exe not giving correct system boot time information properly.<br />
You can see the image given below as you can see that here time is 10:12 PM and Date 15-10-2016<br />
But after checking in Systeminfo.exe it gives result like this<br />
System Boot Time: 03:4 PM , 11-10-2016 </div>
<div>but I boot up my system something 9:05 PM. </div>

            <p>The systeminfo Boot Time seems to be simply based on the timestamp for the c:\pagefile.sys. &nbsp;Not sure if it's stored anywhere else. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>systeminfo | find /i "Boot Time"</p>
<p>System Boot Time: 1/31/2017, 3:04:19 PM</p>
<p>
</p><p>dir /ah /tw c:\pagefile.sys</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>01/31/2017 &nbsp;03:04 PM &nbsp; ...... &nbsp;pagefile.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>However that file's timestamp will only be updated when the system is rebooted, not when it is shutdown and then booted up from scratch. &nbsp;At least on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might be dependent on the amount of memory the computer has. &nbsp;Since the time seems to be correct for most people discussing this, and my time is never correct unless I reboot, I'm guessing it's because I have 32GB of memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a thought.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think i found the solution from this link,&nbsp; after changing the Windows time service into Automatic, I shutdown my system and turn it on back again. Now the system boot time is showing correctly.

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the work around - that might be helpful. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to point out that the setting of "fast startup" cannot be considered a solution, since that startup time should be set every time the system is started up. &nbsp;Funny that disabling "fast startup" works, but rebooting also works. &nbsp;I wouldn't expect
 rebooting to work slower than fast startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Microsoft just needs to make sure that the boot time is set correctly "every" time that Windows boots; fast, slow, reboot, restart, whatever. &nbsp;That time is not being set correctly. &nbsp;Some other Operating System considers that a useful time to know,
 since they can run for years without a restart...</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have not tried this. &nbsp;My Windows Time service is currently set to Manual (Trigger Start). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I have not changed it is because I believe that service is not for managing Boot Time. &nbsp;It's for managing the synchronization of multiple endpoints in a network. &nbsp;Turning it on when not needed would just add additional work for the operating system,
 while it is running. &nbsp;Microsoft just needs to fix the bad Boot Time. &nbsp;It should never depend on a system setting or non standard (standard = required to start up) service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I believe the solution to this problem is not something the User should have to manage. &nbsp;It should be an integral part of the Windows start up process every time Windows starts up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot Time is a critical Metric for operating system management.</p>

<h2>            Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 can no longer be pinned</h2>
                    
<p>The pin was there. Which was fine, but then I went to re-arrange my pins and the box art disappeared.<br />
<br />
So I removed the pin and went to re-pin it and nope, no option exists anymore to re-pin UMvC3.<br />
<br />
Was this dash update even tested? Like at all?</p>

<p>Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 is no longer available for download in the store which would explain the pinning issue you're having. Before you unpinned the game, were you having any issues with that pin?</p>

<p>Trying to access a pin that doesn't exist for a game, gives you a generic blank page, with no option to unpin. Top option is -1. Bottom option is Pin to Home. Both do nothing/give you an error. Trying to access content such as a Movie that no longer exists,
 gives you an error code 200, and you have no option of removing said pin.</p>
<p>This has been an issue since 2012/2013. I've brought it up numerous times on these forums, and no fix has been made to date. Can we get a button on the pins page to remove pins without going to the non existent details page?</p>

<p>No, other pins seem fine (outside the fact that they no longer automatically launch the game, they now go to the details page)</p>
<p>But with Ultimate Marvel, I was re-arranging my pins and the boxart of Marvel disappeared. So I unpinned it in order to hopefully fix the boxart and I found I could no longer pin it.</p>
<p>Last night I tried again and it appears to have pinned but I don't have the boxart. Yet in "Recent" pins the boxart is there!!!!</p>

            <p>Thanks for the info Shpeshal Ed. Glad to hear you were pin it, although the box art issue sounds to be an issue we're currently investigating over here.</p>
<p>Irixion, let's run through a few steps for this pinning issue just to make sure we give everything a try.</p>
<p>First, let's try moving your profile to an external storage device such as a USB drive to make sure we have a backup of it. After you have a your profile backed up, let's clear cache on your Xbox 360 three times. To clear cache visit Settings &gt; System Settings &gt; Storage. On the storage screen select the device with your content and press Y, then select Clear System Cache.</p>
<p>Once you clear cache three times, redownload your profile to your console by pressing the guide button and selecting 'Download Profile'. If the pins are still showing for you, see if you're able to remove your pins now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've already done that. Removing my profile and re-downloading it doesn't solve the issue. The pins are still there and very much make the feature broken for me :S</p>

<h2>            administrator account changed to guest account</h2>
                    <p>Orginial Title: User for Hotmail.com no longer in users and cannot create new one</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a laptop and a desktop, both with the same problem, they are both running windows 8.1 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently lost admin to my Hotmail.com user account, for whatever reason it was changed to a guest account. It was the only user account I had.</p>
<p>Now I have no admin right and cannot do anything in the user section without getting the message 'The requested operation requires elevation'.</p>
<p>I am only making changes to my desktop at this time because my laptop is my primary pc.</p>
<p>I will try and explain what I have done and the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After looking at solutions to this problem, I went into safe mode and created a administrative user account.</p>
<p>When I logged back into windows, only the admin and a guest account were available.</p>
<p>Attempted to re-create my Hotmail user account and get a message 'An account using this Microsoft account already exists on this PC'</p>
<p>I go to user accounts and it's not there, but I can go to 'regedit' and see several references to the Hotmail.com account. Several of them, I know what they are for but several I don't.</p>
<p>I then created a gmail.com user account and it works fine, but I would like to get my Hotmail.com user account back because all my settings are there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way of getting my Hotmail.com to be useable, if not, what Hotmail.com settings do I change in the 'regedit'?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen posts where people have worked on similar problems for hours, well I'm ashamed to say that I've been trying to get my Hotmail.com user account for days. Many of the posts were similar to my problem but unfortunately none of the fixes worked for
 me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any feedback is appreciated.</p>

            <p>Ajay, thanks for the prompt reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did Method 1, and removed my hotmail.com user account.</p>
<p>Restarted the computer, checked netplwiz and the hotmail.com account was gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried creating the hotmail.com user account as per instructions and at the end a quick message comes up 'adding account', then the message 'An account using this Microsoft account already exists on this pc'. Rebooted and tried again with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went to the link you provided for creating user account.Create a Microsoft account</p>
<p>Then clicked on &nbsp;Microsoft accounts troubleshooter at the bottom of page and was told that a message would be sent to my email to confirm that the account was mine. I never received an email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then created a outlook.com account, it appears to work the same as hotmail.com because everything is the same, at least in emails, entered the code from Microsoft that was received in my email and it worked but after a while a pop up titled 'Restore could
 not be completed' with the verbiage 'We weren't able to copy your settings over from OneDrive. Try going to the accounts section of pc settings, disconnect your Microsoft account from pc and then add it again.,</p>
<p>After disconnecting from pc, I was told that I would have to log in as a local user, so I set it up.</p>
<p>A message at the end of the setup said 'We're sorry, but something went wrong. Your Microsoft account wasn't changed to a local account.</p>
<p>Code: 0x80004005'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope my explanation of what I tried is not too confusing and if it is we can go step by step. This problem is driving me nuts.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>Ajay,</p>
<p>Checked methods 1 &amp; 2 and they were both set as required.</p>
<p>Before restart checked Microsoft account and it was already a local account.</p>
<p>Restarted anyway and now logs in but with&nbsp;no updates attempt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it be that OneDrive does not have the required information to update the account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to go astray, my original problem and still my problem is that I cannot create my original Hotmail.com account, because every time I attempt to create I get the message 'An account using this Microsoft account already exists on this PC'.</p>
<p>I've deleted the account as you had requested previously.</p>
<p>Hope to hear from you soon.</p>

I hope that better helps explain the problem so it can be fixed in the next updates if that's possible, or this problem needs to be fixed maybe in the next Xbox one system updates. on a side note, I don't no if that much people know about the forrums on xbox one website here, it seems like these forums don't get that much people looking at them, I don't no if this

 </blockquote> <p>but that doesn't explain why I can't rate my brand new game on its far cry 5 page you used to be able to rate new games that you got, its not allowing me to post it under Rating and Reviews section for this game or post of a review , since I do own the physical version of this game that I just got from GameStop the other day.<br /><br />it reads "You are unable to rate or review as you do not own this product." and also says&nbsp; Below product is installed. You can Play this game for now or buy it to own.<br /><br />Again I do own it as the Physical Disc version of this game, I don't understand why I can't rate my Physical copy of this game, I don't have this problem with my other Physical Xbox games online, just this one copy of far cry 5 disc that I got this week from my local GameStop's store is having this problem.<br /></p>

 </blockquote> <p>ok I need to make a correction this problem seems to be effecting a few games in Microsoft Store , I just checked my physical copy of Assassin's Creed@ Origins, also has it as not owned and has Rating and Reviews disabled, maybe an update to Microsoft store app on the Xbox One system has broken being able to rate and Review Physical copy's of these games, since the problem seems to be with more than just my new Far Cry 5 game, since it seems to be effecting a few new and old Physical games now. Fallout 4 game also has Rating and Reviews disabled too now it seems for my physical copy of that game too. <br /><br />I guess either this is a new system bug or Microsoft disabled rating and review page our Physical copy's of Xbox One games discs since they don't read as owned anymore in Microsoft store app on our Xbox one systems?</p>

 </blockquote> <p>you used to be able to rate and review physical copy's of the Xbox one games in the past, so I think its a new change to their Xbox system I own the black Xbox one system with 500GB size hard drive in it, which is out of warranty already, since I owned it for more than 2 years, I had to get an 3.0 external 4TB drive for all the physical games I have gotten so far, again I think that the Microsoft store updates maybe broke our option to rate &amp; review the physical copy's since they used so show up as owned when installed on our systems in the past, I think that sometime this year that may of changed I think anyway that's what's going on with it, also my final fantasy xv Xbox one physical game is having a bug where its loading the page for the windows edition version instead of linking it to the Xbox one version, but that's another bug that seems to be happening in the last few weeks since they added the windows version of that game to their Microsoft store.</p>

            Yeah this is total <strong>[Mod Removed - Profanity],</strong> i know for 100% sure that i used to be able to rate and review my disc based games because i rate almost all of them but now the crappy ms store wont let you for some reason .its probably a
 way for them to try and get people to buy digital. Its obvious not a technical problem. since weve been able to do it before. MS stop being greedy and bring this feature back, im just as much an owner of my games if not more so than people who buy digital

            <div>I have a Dell I 660 running Windows 8 for less than a year. It's had an update problem for quite some time, both Defender and System updates. I did a Refresh and that was a disaster and shortly thereafter did Reset. Windows update ran once to tell me I
 needed 78 updates and it would do that during regular maintenance. Nothing happened and now when I click on anything to do with updates, the screen locks up. I must go to Task Manager and click on Windows explorer and click restart to close the open window.
 When I run Windows Update Troubleshooter it gets stuck on "Starting Bits service". At the command prompt sfc /scannow says everything is fine. I would like to get 8.1 but understand that I need certain updates to do that. Please Help. Thanks.</div>

            <p>Win7 Update has stopped working on my machine, so now I'm trying to use the diagnostic tool from MS (WindowsUpdateDiagnostic.diagcab for Win7 Home Premium and Enterprise). &nbsp;It appears that next I'll be trying Winston M's suggestions given here, but while
 I'm waiting to see if the tool keeps on seeming to do nothing (can't be sure), let me get some things off my chest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most unrewarding/bottom of the totem/lower rung jobs at MS must be in the Windows Update Department, since it appears that fresh-out-of-college project leaders and coders are perennially put in charge there. &nbsp; Ones just too inexperienced to be involved
 with anything where robustness, integrity, accountability are required. </p>
<p>In fact, you have to have some wise old hands (at least on a part-time basis to straighten things out) &nbsp;who've seen STUFF, in this case the unnecessary hangs, stalls and stuckons, and have the wherewithal to deal with these (satellite processes are the most
 useful solution), and don't just ignore it all as too much hassle. &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh btw, I've been coding since the early eighties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, as I wait, the MS tradition of information-minimal display for user-initiated system tasks like update is galling me as always. &nbsp; Of course it's been this way from the beginning, going back to Win 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Resolving Problems" dot dot dot (with &nbsp;progress bar&nbsp;cycling in marquee mode)</p>
<p>Actually, there is no dot dot dot on this one. &nbsp;But if there was, it would be cycling in a 1, 2, 3 dot loop to no purpose.<br />
</p>
<p>Without some kind of operation feedback loop, surely from some kind of satellite process listening for and pinging custom status messages, WM_IMNOTDEADYET, or along such lines, &nbsp;hooked into and able to detect changes in relevant data within the process being
 monitored, and not just some loop counters which could be changing in a stuck process, how the @$%&amp; can the user judge whether something is indeed stuck, WITHIN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME? &nbsp; At least within the time period where I would be saying, "just give
 it another 30 minutes" And without an updating list of "problems" slated for resolution, how the &amp;^#$ do I know if it actually found ANY problems to begin with, and some clues for what they might be? &nbsp; Just an error/problem code could be useful to have for
 writing down. &nbsp; But still if it all choked before actually getting anywhere, finding something to list, there is no way to know without one or more additional standalone processes (that don't require the update system to be functional for themselves to operate
 as monitors)</p>
<p>If the satellite process(s) just said something like "the main process appears to be hung", and nothing else, that would be useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's looking like I'll be trying Winston M's methods listed here, &nbsp;but in terms of what I've said, if indeed the diagnostic tool can't get said services to operate,&nbsp;why the @$%&amp; can't it do something in the manner I've described at least to give some indication
 of that and not waste my time? &nbsp; &nbsp;Green project heads, green programmers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't buy it? &nbsp;Need proof? &nbsp;Ok, here's another example. &nbsp;Windows local search.</p>
<p>You search for something, and the green progress bar runs over into the stop X</p>
<p>and sits there interminably, never finishing, at least for sometimes an hour or more. &nbsp; I know I'm not the only one to suffer. &nbsp;Meanwhile, I can search the planet on Google in a second or three, DONE. &nbsp;Green people in the Windows Search Dept., been this
 way forever. &nbsp; Maybe they're the ones on that lowest rung I was talking about, &nbsp;sure seems like it. &nbsp; It is still this way in Windows 8.1! &nbsp;I have no doubt it's not fixed in 10. &nbsp;They just can't ever get it right. &nbsp; While Donald Knuth is still alive give him
 a call, maybe he can help. &nbsp;At least read Vol3 Sorting and Searching, which may be a bit old, but still has better computer science than what greenhorns can put together by themselves while infected with not-invented-here syndrome and making a mess of things.
 &nbsp;Oh yes, and a related example. &nbsp;A Windows search completes, and then you decide to re-sort the results on a different column. &nbsp; With a collection of results already in hand that would be satisfactory the vast majority of the time, the re-sorting should be
 instantaneous or nearly so. &nbsp; Simple stuff. &nbsp; Don't bother Knuth on this one.</p>
<p>But no, Winsearch does a fraggin rescan, as if one should expect new files were pouring in so fast that they would be missing from the results. &nbsp;At least give the user an option to not rehash the search, please.</p>

            <p>Amen, Bill!<br />
</p>
<p>Since 3/7/16 (update KB2999226),&nbsp; WU would recognize that updates exist but was unable to download them through the program (Win7 64 Ultimate).<br />
<span><span><span><span>I had to search forums to find out about pkgmgr, DISM and other aspects of Windows I've never had to use before (I've been a user since Win3.1).
</span></span></span></span>I ran SFC and DISM scans and repaired some registry data.
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I ran WindowsUpdateDiagnostic.diagcab and it didn't move past the 'Resolving Problems' phase.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>Yesterday, I decided to download and install a couple updates manually to see if the download problem would be resolved. Since the Standalone Installers stall out like WU and the Troubleshooter, I used pkgmgr, expand and DISM to install these instead:<br />
947821<br />
3102810</p>
<p>3112343<br />
3125574</p>
<p>3138612</p>
<p>
</p><p>The WU download issue is not resolved yet.<br />
<span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
<span>I installed Fix It Center and it can't download the Troubleshooters (which I figured would be built into the software already - isn't that the point?), and tells me to check my internet connection - at which point, I laughed rather hysterically</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>.
 It's suffering from the same issue as Windows Update - no clue where the server is, and no way for the user to do anything about it.
</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span><span><span><span><span>You guys want to actually fix this issue that afflicts waaaaay too many users?</span> Do these:<br />
<span>1. Let users decide the download destination of temp WU files (I've wanted this feature for over a decade).</span><br />
<span>2. Give users the option to direct WU to a LOCAL FOLDER for updates that are already downloaded.</span><br />
<span>3. If WU recognizes files to be downloaded but can't get them, give us a BUTTON to report it and you can REDIRECT US to the CORRECT SERVER ADDRESS!</span><br />
<span>4. If DISM can accomplish what WU can't, incorporate what works into WU! I'm sick of using a command prompt to do something that should be done in a GUI! Shouldn't you want us to stop using cmd?!?</span><br />
</span></span></span></span>5. When you make a tool to fix something, make sure it's fully equipped for the job it's set out to do. Installing a tool that immediately requires internet access to get anything done (and subsequently can't find what it's looking
 for and shrug defeatedly) is a disservice to the user, and an ugly blemish on the development and service wings of the corporation.<br />
<br />
Please don't make me manually download and install each update individually, using a command prompt.</p>

            <p>I despair at the way Microsoft is unable to respond in simple English terms to explain what is happening and why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My situation is this:</p>
<p>Windows 10 upgrade from Windows 7 SP1 was carried out whilst still a free upgrade - all good to that point and had been using Win10 successfully for 4 months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>End of October this year I had a weird error where a reboot froze as the coloured dots spinning logo was indicating that Windows was starting up/loading. I could not get past this point even after multiple reboots, so I bit the bullet and wiped my SSD (120Gb
 for OS and essential services/software only) and proceeded to do a clean Win7 SP1 install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked all okay for 3 days then the exact same freeze re-ocurred, so I again bit the bullet and first replaced my RAM (2x8Gb Corsair XMS3) with another (2x4Gb PNY Anarchy - 10 year guarantee), then I again did a clean Win7 install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked okay, so I created a Win7 recovery boot disk. No issues at this stage.</p>
<p>I wanted to get back to my Win10 system, so I tried to create a Win10.iso DVD using the MS tool, but the disk would not verify after completion. I tried it 3 more times on fresh DVDs, but still the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I started the Windows Update process and have continuously had the same issue as everybody who has already posted or replied to posts - Windows Update caught in a never-ending cycle of (apparently) updating and despite going through all the suggestions
 here I have not resolved the issues. Trying to re-register DLLs gives me error messages that they cannot be located. Stopping services hasn't worked either as I get 'Service is starting or stopping. Please try later.' Thanks Microsoft, that error message is
 suitably unhelpful :/</p>
<p>
</p><p>My income is dependent on me having a workable PC and a fast web connection and I am at my wits end wasting time on these stupid issues. I am sorely tempted to go back to XP, as that served me well for about 10 years with very few issues and those were easily
 and swiftly resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shoot me please. I want to get off this planet and as far away as possible from the idiocy which is named Microsoft.</p>

            <p>The AppData folder is hidden by default for a reason - messing about with its contents without being absolutely certain you know what you're doing can cause no end of trouble. The first instruction on the page you've been referred to advises changing this
 setting in order to allow you to see the files and folders in the Windows Live Mail store folder. Any file operations you conduct in this folder will be invisible to the Windows Live Mail database index, which is bound to get confused as a result. It's possible
 that the program could recover from any corruption caused, but it's not certain, and the risk just isn't worth taking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you weren't about to do this, then I'm sorry to have interrupted. I just found it a bit incongruous that someone who didn't know how to open Explorer should be asking about it in a forum dealing with lost and deleted mail instead of in a Windows forum.

            <p>OK, let's try again - although this doesn't match the title of this thread ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>A&nbsp;quick survey of previous threads you've started or become involved in would suggest that you're using Windows 7. This is a vital piece of information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have readily admitted to not being technically blessed, which leads me to a second conclusion: that you haven't moved your Windows Live Mail store folder from its default location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before doing anything else, I have to ask whether you've checked the contents of the
<em>Deleted items </em>folders, both under your email accounts and under Storage folders. Anything you delete in the ordinary way of things will be moved to the appropriate
<em>Deleted items </em>folder, so you have to try really hard to delete things by accident.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that there was nothing of value in the <em>Deleted items </em>folders and with the other&nbsp;two assumptions in mind, then, here's how to see whether your accidentally-deleted folders and messages can be recovered using the
<em>Previous versions </em>feature:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press Windows
</span>key&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/802498ae-80d0-4a3e-9a12-b385befba1d1" />,<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;then paste or type the following line into the search box and press
<em>Enter</em>:<br />
<br />
<strong>%localappdata%\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail<br />
<br />
</strong>This should open an Explorer window at your store folder. The folder name will be highlighted in the left-hand navigation pane.<br />
&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Right-click on the folder and select
</span><span style="font-style: italic">Restore previous versions</span><span>.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</span></li><li>
<span>If you can locate a previous version of your store folder that predates the accidental deletion, use the button to
</span><span style="font-style: italic">Open
</span><span>it and then locate the missing folders.
<br />
&nbsp;</span></li><li>
<span>Copy&nbsp;the folders&nbsp;into a temporary folder on your desktop.<br />
&nbsp;</span></li><li>
<span>Use the </span><span style="font-style: italic">File &gt; Import messages</span><span> function (Alt-F
 I) in Windows Live Mail to import the temporary folder. Imported folders will be under storage folders.</span></li></ol>
<span>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

            <p>Firstly may I thank you very much for all of the trouble you are taking helping someone who appears to be an absolute idiot. &nbsp;In mitigation I would offer the following: &nbsp;Regrettably my generation of the eighty year olds did not start working on computers
 from a structured syllabus and as a result most of lack the theory one normally requires to understand such matters. &nbsp;I'm a graduate of two universities with three degrees all philosophy based with only logic to help when it fits in with what I'm up to at
 the time. &nbsp;Back to the questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Yes, it is Windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. &nbsp;I have no idea what you mean by moving Windows Live Mail store folder from its default location.</span></p>
<p><span>3. &nbsp;I don’t even know what the
<em>Deleted items </em>folders, both under your email accounts and under Storage folders are although having now read that anything one deletes in the ordinary way of things will be moved to the appropriate
<em>Deleted items </em>folder, </span></p>
<p><span>4. &nbsp;I didn’t really try really hard to delete the Emails.&nbsp; It happened by accident.&nbsp; The Emails were in a bit of a mess as a result of losing them a year or so ago and the list running
 down the left hand side of the desktop was not in alphabetical order so I attempted to move them into that order.&nbsp; Regrettably within the list running down the left side of the desktop contained a number of titles in the form of digits some of which were empty
 and others which offered a collection of titles/folders.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>5. &nbsp;I deleted one of those and the lot disappeared &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now very tired as a result of two much activity yesterday so I will stop here and approach the
<span>
recovered advice using the <em>Previous versions </em>feature in the morning: &nbsp;Yet again, many thanks.</span></p>

<h2>            Invalid Value for Registry when opening a PDF file.</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried opening a PDF file just awhile ago and there's a dialogue box that says 'Invalid Value for Registry'. I was alarmed since I was still able to open a PDF file yesterday. I tried following the steps given in the other threads with the same issues but
 that just won't work with me. I've tried sfc/scannow and it replied that there are issues in my computer but can't be fixed. Moreover, I can't also open the Store and Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a Norton 360 antivirus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone answer my question and help me fix this problem because I'm not really good when it comes to computer issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            <p><strong>Is Windows 10 really free and do I have to pay for it after the first year has passed?</strong></p>
<p>Windows 10 will be free for the first year to all Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Phone 8.1 users. This means, as long you upgrade within the first 12 months (July 29th 2015 to July 29th 2016), you will not have to pay for Windows 10 at all.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Wow, thats cool, but does that mean, I will have to pay for Windows 10 after the first year?</strong></p>
<p>No. Its a promotion to get as many users to upgrade their existing Windows 7 PCs and Windows 8.1 devices to Windows 10.
<strong>Once you upgrade within the first year for free, its yours forever at no additional cost.</strong>&nbsp;As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><em>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device

</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">I heard Microsoft representatives mention they are moving to a servicing model for Windows 10, does that mean Windows 10 is going to require a subscription?</span></strong></p>
<p>No, Windows 10 remains a perpetual license, which means, you can upgrade to Windows 10 and use it forever without it expiring or going into any reduced functional mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Are you saying there will be no more versions of Windows after Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft is moving Windows to a servicing model with Windows 10. The days of major revisions or what are called big bang releases are no more. As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><span>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device

</span><span>–</span><span> in fact, one could reasonably think of Windows in the next couple of years as one of the largest Internet services on the planet.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>And just like any Internet service, the idea of asking "What version are you on?" will cease to make sense
</span><span>–</span><span> which is great news for our Windows developers. </span>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Why is Windows 10 free, is there some catch?</strong></p>
<p>No, its not a catch. We are computing in different times. Windows 10 is free so app developers can standardize on one platform and reduce the fragmented market of different versions and editions of Windows that have been an issue in the past. When everybody
 is on the same platform, it means better quality apps, a healthier ecosystem and more advances in hardware and software innovation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will I have to pay for updates and fixes for Windows 10?</strong><br />
No, updates, fixes, security updates, features all remain free. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">What does lifetime of the device mean?</span></strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;logical conclusion is as long as the machine is operable, Microsoft will continue to support it with updates. So, if the machine still works 5 or 10 years from now, revisions and updates to Windows 10 will be made available to it. Please note that Windows
 10 uses the same life cycle policy of 5 years mainstream support and&nbsp;5 years extended support.</p>

<p><strong>Windows 10 will never expire !!!</strong></p>

<p>How you activate Windows 10 after reinstalling it depends on how Windows 10 was originally installed on your device. If you activated a free upgrade to Windows 10 or bought and activated Windows 10 from the Windows Store, you have a digital entitlement for
 your device. This means you can reinstall the same edition of Windows 10 that your device has a digital entitlement for without entering a product key.<strong> During reinstallation, if you’re asked to enter a product key, select Skip</strong>. Windows 10
 will automatically activate online after the installation is complete. </p>
<p>　</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you previously installed a "Retail" / Boxed version and activated Windows 10 using a product key, you’ll need to enter the product key during reinstallation.
</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><strong>Check Activation Status:</strong>　</p>
<p>Select the Start button icon button, then select Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation. If Windows 10 isn’t activated on your device, see Get help with Windows 10 activation errors for more info.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><strong>One of the most common is a generic key associated with "Digital entitlement / License" computers.</strong> This is a new method of activation in Windows 10 that doesn't require you to enter a product key:

<h2>            Recurring Skype for Business Meetings created i Outlook 2010</h2>
                    Is it possible to schedule recurring skype for business meetings for e.g., the next year and still have the Join Meeting links working. There seems to be an issue since it is the same link that is inserted in all incidences. What is your experience.

Yes, it is possible to schedule recurring Skype for Business meetings in the Outlook client. The series of the meetings will use one same link to join into the Skype meetings.<br />

<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for the updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From my personal experience, the meeting may have expired based on the error message. To troubleshoot the issue, I’d like to confirm the following information:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>If you create a series of new recurring Skype for Business Meetings, can you join in the meeting using the link successfully?</span></li><li><span>Do you use pure Office 365 for Business Online services or have a Skype for Business Hybrid/Exchange Hybrid environment?</span></li><li><span>Your Skype for Business and Outlook detailed versions.

            <span>Hi Kenneth,<br />
<br />
Office 365 is designed to work with the latest versions of Office. Office 2010 may work with Office 365 with reduced functionality. I suggest that you update to Office 2016 to get the complete experiences of Office 365 features. As you said you can download
 Skype for Business client in Office 365 portal (https:// portal.office.com), you may also download the Office 2016 suite there.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

            <span>Hi Kenneth,<br />
<br />
I understand that you can’t upgrade to Office 2016 due to company policy. As I said above, Office 2010 would work with reduced functionality with Office 365 features. That could lead to such error. So I would suggest you try to create such recurring Skype for
 Business Online meeting in Office 365 OWA (<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>) instead of the Outlook 2010 client in the future.<br />
<br />

                    I was trying to find my BIOS settings by using Windows help and support.&nbsp; I ended up in System Information&gt;Software Environment&gt;System Drivers.&nbsp; I noticed in the column named Error Control, I have quite a few marked critical and some say ignore.&nbsp; For example,
 one is the Partition Manager and it is marked critical.&nbsp; Some are running and some are manual and say stopped.&nbsp; I am having problems with my USB Ports suddenly stopping and am wondering if some of these might have something to do with it.&nbsp; Windows 7 Home Premium,

As a matter of fact, you have to access the<br />BIOS before Windows even starts to boot. One common way is to press<br />the Del key when you first power on, but that's not necessarily right<br />for your computer. Watch the screen carefully when you first boot;<br />there's often a message there telling you what to do. If not, check<br />your system documentation or check with your vendor.</p><p>Also look here: <a href="http://michaelstevenstech.com/bios_manufacturer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://michaelstevenstech.com/bios_

            There are three other actions which you can undertake
<br />
<br />1. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br />For 1809 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619</a>
<br />For 1803 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />2. Perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repai...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

            Hi Philip.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Check in Start menu under All Apps for Dell Update to see if it will install all needed driver and other firmware Updates.  If not go to the Dell Drivers downloads page here: <a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/Products/?app=drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/Produ...</a> using the Dell Service Tag on sticker, download and install all newer drivers comparing them to the ones presently in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br /> 
<br />I understand you were trying to reinstall and will provide all options to do this, but first will address the issues you reported by helping you find drivers and follow these Steps for troubleshooting Network adapter:
<br />
<br />Update your network adapter drivers from the Dell Support Downloads web page here <a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/Products/laptop?app=drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/Produ...</a>, using the  Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If you have the latest network driver then try on it's Driver tab also to Roll Back, or Uninstall and then restart PC to reinstall the driver.  Try also all older drivers from Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick list working backwards.
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything else possible to try in order of priority so that hopefully something works: 
<br />
<br />Which network icon is showing in System Tray:  the Wireless waves or Ethernet TV with plug?  Left click to see if any Networks show up to sign into.  
<br />
<br />If not right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>

<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected.

<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17****&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br />  
<br />------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />
<br />Before reinstalling you may want to go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If you still want to reinstall and the Reset will not work try the Fresh Start:  <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use-the-fresh-start-feature-in-windows-10-creators-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use...</a>
<br />Also make sure you're trying the Windows 10 Reset this way and not Dell Factory Reset which requires media you make:  <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-reset-your-pc-completely/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-re...</a>
<br />
<br />If those all fail follow these illustrated steps in this link which compiles the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<h2>            MGS Ground Zeroes achievements not unlocking</h2>
                    
<p>I enjoy this game a lot and have played it through a couple times but I seem to be having trouble getting the achievements and challenges to unlock now. I found all the XOF patches and didn't get the achievement but I still unlocked the last mission. I then
 went and played that mission and also didn't get the achievement for doing all the side missions. I then S ranked the main mission and didn't get that achievement either. I tried making a new save and doing it all over again but that didn't fix it. Any ideas
 how to fix this? Thanks</p>

<p>OK ive noticed something on this its seems related to the conenction t he to the konami servers</p>
<p>I did a side mission and got S rank but it didnt unlock but i noticed a got a message at the end of the mission say cannot connect to server or something like that</p>
<p>So i quit the game and relaunched then did the mission again and it unlocked</p>
<p>I have resumed the game previously so im guessing this may have led to the loss of connection to konami servers, so i think whenever resuming the game make sure it is connected ot the konami servers before it unlocks an achievement</p>

            Well, you chose not to tell us the system make and model or if you have IDE or SATA drives, but I will tell you something about all the files you've mentioned so far...<br />
<br />
If your system has SATA drives, some Recovery Console command will not recognize the drive and the commands will fail - unless you temporarilily change the setting in the system BIOS to something other than SATA, do you work from RC, then change it back when
 you are done.<br />
<br />
Usually, a sign of this issue is that when you boot into RC, you are in the C:\ folder instead of the C:\WINDOWS folder like you are supposed to be after booting into RC.<br />
<br />
Anywho...<br />
<br />
We know that XP keeps copies of critical system files in the following folder:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache<br />
<br />
From the XP Recovery Console prompt enter commands like this to replace missing files:<br />
<br />
copy c:\windows\system32\dllcache\odbc32.dll&nbsp;&nbsp; c:\windows\system32<br />
<br />
Respond in the affirmative if asked to overwrite the existing file and then you should see a message that 1 file(s) was copied.<br />
<br />
If the copy command can't find a copy of the file in the dllcache folder, this command may work depending on how your XP was installed:<br />
<br />
copy c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386\odbc.dll&nbsp;&nbsp; c:\windows\system32<br />
<br />
You would repeat that for each missing file.<br />
<br />
XP keeps backup copies of 3498 files in the dllcache folder and in the event one of them comes up missing, Windows File Protection will try to replace the missing files from the copy in dllcache folder (when XP is running).&nbsp; That is what Windows File Protection
 is supposed to do.<br />
<br />
If so many files seem to be missing, you might be better or to use your new HDD and just start from the scorched earth...&nbsp; If you don't you could miss some files and you may find problems later... and if was me, I would always be wondering if I should have
 just started from scratch in the first place!<br />

<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>
