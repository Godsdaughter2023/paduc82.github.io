<p>It's hard to know if this will be repaired under warranty. You should take it to a Nokia carepoint or the place you bought it from and ask what the would do about it. Most likely they will say that this is your fault and it's not covered by warranty, or
 they would repair it for free. There might be a chance that this screen is faulty since the outside screen is not cracked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would take it to the shop or a nokia carepoint and tell them what you wrote in the post. Hopefully they fix it under warranty!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

    <title>People Actually USE the Microsoft Edge Browser&#63;&#33;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oreveredrist  say:</h3>
<h2>            People Actually USE the Microsoft Edge Browser&#63;&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I apologize in advance for this post since it's darn negative. &nbsp;But, I just finished an Insider quest regarding tabs and the Home button in Microsoft Edge. &nbsp;Other than those quests, I never use it. &nbsp;But, I'm so unimpressed with it that I'm putting my Feedback
 for the quest here (note that the following is my response to Microsoft - thus the pronoun use):</p>
<p>
</p><p>"I don't know why you haven't been hit with a lawsuit yet over this Microsoft Edge browser. &nbsp;While doing this quest, I went to Advanced Settings and tried to change the Search service used. &nbsp;I'm presented with the phrase "Choose one" and three grayed-out,
 inactive "choices:" &nbsp;"Add as default," "Add," and "Remove." &nbsp;IOW, Bing is the only Search service allowed.</p>
<p>But, back to the quest for "new tab" and "home." &nbsp;I told it to "Open with" a "New tab page," "Open new tabs with" "A blank page," and "Show the home button" On. &nbsp;I get the tabs alright, but when I click the Home button, the tab gets populated with "My news
 feed" stuff. &nbsp;I'm guessing that's because in the "Show the home button" box it says "about:start" and that feed is what you've decided is going to be Start regardless of the fact that I said start the browser and any new tabs with a blank page. &nbsp;I don't know,
 and 99% of the people won't know, what to put in the "Show the home button" box to use a blank page instead of the Start page when the home button is clicked. &nbsp;Since I've said "blank page" for everything else, it should default to blank. &nbsp;But, at a minimum,
 there should be a drop down menu for it.<br />
<br />
Also, we can clear things like cookies in the settings. &nbsp;But, where can we actually see what cookies have already been set?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beyond my original quest feedback, I'll also add that "about:blank" is what to replace "about:start" with to get the blank page to come up by default. &nbsp;Also, on that "about:start" page, I tried going into Customize and clearing out the garbage. &nbsp;As far as
 I can see, nothing can be customized. &nbsp;Clicking on the boxes it presents does nothing. &nbsp;There doesn't appear to be any way to add, remove, or change (i.e., "customize") anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't believe Microsoft actually released this browser as a finished product and can't believe anyone actually uses it like this.</p>

            <p>I think this is generally the same response for anyone that tries it, garbage !, good for downloading firefox or chrome, the way MS is trying to FORCE users to 'their way or the highway' is causing a severe lack of trust in MS. I thought google was the anti
 christ until win 10 !.. Now I would rather use the all seeing google products than this 'stuff'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With forced updates, they will gradually slip forced use of everything into the 'OS' / 'Ad Generator'</p>
<p>They already slipped in the 'force defender to always be used' in the rtm or since.</p>
<p>This bing garbage is beyond a joke really. I have removed all metro apps that can be removed by script.</p>
<p>I do not really believe anyone uses the default rubbish, I bet &gt; 95% are using a start menu replacement, a browser replacement, google as search, ANYTHING but outlook for mail, alternative AV (which is a pain due to defender always re - activating even if
 switched off)- (they have kindly put a notice in there now)</p>
<p>Have a look at the firewall rules ! - a Joke ! - and try forcing the firewall to accept ONLY the rules set !.. there are 3 places to try, each is contradictory - again, a joke.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, NO, virtually no-one actually uses it ....</p>
<p>Same with the cortana tart. 5 minute wonder, or in my case, a non minute wonder. Ridiculous thing.</p>
<p>About as useful as unicycle for a one legged man.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This really is BAIT WARE (Win 10) they want to suck all the users in, get them past the 30 day 'go back to original clause' and then stitch the heck out of them. - well, it will build up gradually as the 12 month approaches.. THEN the knife will twist, and
 it will cause severe pain - payware and subscription being directly proportional to how little MS make from this.</p>
<p>Apparently 14 million downloads of win 10 pushed out, however I would estimate only about 6% have actually installed due to 'issues', and a lot of the 6% are now failing to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The EU lawmakers will LOVE Win 10, just as SATNAD wants all users to do, hmmmmm....</p>

            <p>Well, er, my take on Edge. I use Edge for these forums, it works fine Outlook webmail but do not use if for surfing in general. I find it needs to load the entire page (including all ads) before I can scroll, but it displays the page. So I find myself 'pawing'
 at the scrollbar but nothing happens. Anyhows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Start page is what is called the 'Start page' and as far I understand it cannot be changed. Not to be confused with the Home page from the Home button. Two separate things.</p>
<p>You can set the page Edge opens on (not the start page, can we call that open page or initial page?), but the Start page remains the Start page. You can change the Home page (Home button), but this is not the Initial page or the Start page.</p>
<p>Throw in a bug perhaps, the Home button page appears to get confused at time, not working with 'about' pages. Close Edge, swear at the sky, set Home page to a url and back it might start working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the search. <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-10/change-the-default-search-engine-in-microsoft-edge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Change the default search engine in Microsoft Edge</a></p>
<p>Now I hope that clears it up. That is page first in the list if you click learn more when adding, or failing to add a search. If informs us that Edge uses OpenSearch standard, glad we cleared that up. Basically as far as I can tell it remembers what sites
 you visit that offer OpenSearch standard and then says you can add them. An examples, visit;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki</a></p>
<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://duckduckgo.com/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://encrypted.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://encrypted.google.com/</a></p>
<p>and then go back to adding to search. Should offer those. One added to the dropdown list of Search no apparent way to remove them (bar resetting Edge with deleting folders and running PowerShell command to get it working again). If anybody finds any other
 search engines that add do let people know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I hope that has cleared this all up. Simple when you know how.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh and ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/ does work, so if you add ftp to Windows 10, then know the ftp commands you can download a useable browser without going near IE or Edge.</p>

            Thanks for the link to that "change the search engine" article. &nbsp;I guess adding a search engine from its own page is easier to code than maintaining a list of search engines to choose from . &nbsp;Edge is actually pretty nice about giving instructions for adding
 a search engine when you're on an OpenSearch site. &nbsp;I just wish there had been some kind of notification of this method under Advanced Settings.

<p>That is the carrier you currently are connected to. So if you are roaming you can see who you are roaming with. You can't remove that since it is a standard feature of TouchFlo.</p>

</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, we apologize for the delayed response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are unable to change the default mailbox language to English as it keeps on coming back to Thai language. Let me assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based from the screenshot that you have provided, it seems that the your default folders are set to English and only emails from Facebook&nbsp;are stuck in Thai language. Can you please confirm if this issue only happens to a specific email or sender&nbsp;or it happens
 to all of your emails that you received? </p>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>

    <title>Syncing iTunes to Windows Phone 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martinsi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Syncing iTunes to Windows Phone 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just got a Nokia Lumia 635 and I'm having some issues syncing it with my iTunes library. I have about 7000 songs on iTunes. I installed the WP Desktop App on my Windows 7 PC but every time I connect my phone to my PC it opens the web browser and goes to
 the download WP Desktop App page. It's like it doesn't recognize the fact that the app is already installed. Then after I manually open the desktop app and try syncing my iTunes library to the SD card in my phone iTunes opens in the background and the app
 lists all my music and everything looks fine but when I click the sync button the the button grays out and the app says it's syncing but nothing happens. I can wait for hours but it just sort of hangs. One of the main reasons I got a Windows Phone and not
 an Android phone was because I got the impression it would work better with my iTunes library so this is a pretty important issue to me. Any ideas?&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for your contribution to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are having trouble syncing your songs from your Itunes library to your Windows Phone.<br />
</p>
<p>Can you tell which amount of songs you are tying to sync simultaneously?<br />
If you are trying to sync the whole 7000 songs, then I would advise trying to sync smaller portions of your playlist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

<h2>            N80&#58;  Two questions</h2>
                    I can't see the answers to these on the board:<br />
<br />
- I am appearing to get Web: Unsupported content type messages when I try to go to WAP sites eg the National Rail or the BBC News site. Surely that isn't right?<br />
<br />
- Is there a newreader which will work with the N80?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Rachael<br />

PS Any recommendations for good sites for downloading new apps?

            There are 2 or 3 browser versions on the N80 now.<br />
<br />
Firsty open the browser, look at properties and post back your version.<br />
<br />
Also type *#0000# and report your firmware version.

<h2>            Issue with cancellation, and now I am auto-billed AND can&#39;t get a hold of support</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I was trying to cancel my account (thought it had worked). But I guess that it not true because today my card was charged for subscription renewal. I have been trying to get a hold of support - but live chat seems to be the only option. The issue is
 that live chat seems not to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I speak to someone in support to get some billing help? I am sure there is an easy solution to help with this cancellation and refund issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for providing us the message header that was being asked.&nbsp; Upon investigation, Error code 5.7.1 can occur if one or more of the following conditions is true:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sender of the message does not have the privileges that are required to complete delivery.</li><li>You try to relay your mail by using a second server, and the second server does not let you relay mail. The remote server returns a 5.7.1 error code.</li><li>You do not have a recipient policy configured for the domain to which the message is sent.</li><li>The recipient has mailbox delivery restrictions enabled. For example, the recipient's mailbox delivery restriction is configured to receive mail only from a specified list. Other mail is rejected.</li><li>A distribution list is configured to restrict mail delivery to messages from authenticated users. Mail that is sent from an anonymous session is rejected.</li><li>Your Exchange computer is on an unsolicited commercial email list. Your Exchange computer may be listed as an open relay.</li><li>The DNS feature is configured incorrectly. </li><li>Anonymous access to the SMTP virtual servers is disabled. </li></ul>
<p>Make sure that mail exchanger (MX) records point to the correct SMTP virtual server. If the DNS feature is configured incorrectly, incoming SMTP connection attempts may randomly connect to the wrong SMTP virtual server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, for possible resolution, please refer to the link below:</p>

            <p>Hello Eugene,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>your answer why messages to a valid e-mail address bounce back in Outlook.com (Hotmail) and do not bounce in Gmail or Yahoo Mail is absolutely USELESS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's consider them one by one:</p>
<li>The sender of the message does not have the privileges that are required to complete delivery.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<strong>Why do I have privilege when using Gmail and don't have it when using Outlook.com ? How can I as an Outlook user check the privilege or change it ?)</strong></p>
</li><li>You try to relay your mail by using a second server, and the second server does not let you relay mail. The remote server returns a 5.7.1 error code.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>(I don't try it. I just send an e-mail to that address using Outlook. If Outlooks tries, it is its problem. The Outlook is apparently buggy.)</strong></p>
</li><li>You do not have a recipient policy configured for the domain to which the message is sent.
<p>(<strong>Outlook users can only set filters for incoming messages, not outgoing</strong>)</p>
</li><li>The recipient has mailbox delivery restrictions enabled. For example, the recipient's mailbox delivery restriction is configured to receive mail only from a specified list. Other mail is rejected.
<p>(<strong>The recipient mailbox does not have this restrictions. I asked him via Gmail</strong>)</p>
</li><li>A distribution list is configured to restrict mail delivery to messages from authenticated users. Mail that is sent from an anonymous session is rejected.
<p><strong>(No restrictions are configures as I already said</strong>)</p>
</li><li>Your Exchange computer is on an unsolicited commercial email list. Your Exchange computer may be listed as an open relay.
<p><strong>(I don't have any Exchange computer. I use Outlook Web client</strong>)</p>
</li><li>The DNS feature is configured incorrectly.
<p><strong>(Outlook users have no ability to configure DNS features.</strong>)</p>
</li><li>Anonymous access to the SMTP virtual servers is disabled.
<p><strong>(I don't access anonymously. I just send e-mail</strong>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apparently the new Outlook/Hotmail became buggy and has to be fixed by Microsoft.</p>
</li>

 mentioned above, Outlook.com can only block incoming messages and not outgoing. As error code states, “server (which is the receiving end) does not allow you to relay”. For this reason, it would be best to refer this to the server’s receiving end.</font></font></font></p>

            <p>I understand what your saying, in that it's on the receivers end. But ultimately it is still Microsoft's fault.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the error I'm getting, with the email addresses removed:</p>
<p>Reporting-MTA: dns;bay0-omc2-s16.bay0.hotmail.com<br />
Received-From-MTA: dns;BAY176-W27<br />
Arrival-Date: Tue, 21 May 2013 14:29:35 -0700</p>
<p>Final-Recipient: rfc822;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
Action: failed<br />
Status: 5.7.1<br />
Diagnostic-Code: smtp;554 5.7.1 &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;: Relay access denied</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I do an internet search for the Diagnostic code, the search returns 1000's of results.
</p>
<p>From what the different sites are saying, the receiving servers are set up to refuse mail from smtp;554 5.7.1.
</p>
<p>From what I can understand from what I read, Microsoft allowed Hotmail users to run ramped sending spam, so many companies have blocked email coming through this server.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not going to ask the recipients to contact their mail services to unblock your mail. You should have set up different servers for Outlook.com and avoided the SMTP address associated with the old, bad reputation, Hotmail system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like the outlook.com interface, but I'm not going to deal with my emails being rejected because of Hotmail's reputation. What adds insult to injury on this issue, is that I pay for my outlook account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh well, lesson learned. I'll be switching back to gmail. <br />

            <p>I don't even think that the cause of the problem is that companies blocked emails coming from Hotmail server. I think that the problem is caused by bugs in Outlook.com. I used Hotmail for more than a decade and never ever my e-mails bounced back. They started

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately the guys at this forum who are supposed to investigate the problem prefer to blame the users. Why do they request now, after I posted all headers of the mails, to give them access to my account, to give them passwords, etc. Don't they want
 me to give them access to my computer too ?</p>
<p>The guys from Sympatico/Bell requested just that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stop blaming users and search for reasons in their settings. Try to reproduce the problem on your computer. I know it is difficult. It is easier to blame the users and&nbsp;request access to their accounts knowing in advance that nobody would agree to that.</p>

<p>Stop blaming users and search for reasons in their settings. Try to reproduce the problem on your computer. I know it is difficult. It is easier to blame the users and&nbsp;request access to their accounts knowing in advance that nobody would agree to that.</p>

I think you're right. Read your message and got to thinking, If the recipient was set up to block Hotmail, how come some got through.&nbsp; I think I just figured out why. I use Outlook.com and I also use Outlook 2013 desktop. Just tried a test sending an email
 to the rejected recipient from both the Desktop App and from Outlook.com.&nbsp; Guess what. The email from Outlook.com got rejected with the same error, where the email send from Outlook Desk top did not get rejected. And yes the Outlook Desktop is attached to
 the same outlook account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it does seem like there is something that Outlook on the web does that is different from what the desktop does when sending mail. Seems very much to be Microsoft's problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once again, come on Microsoft. you got some bugs you need to fix. </p>

                    <p>I have had this issue in the past and resolved it, but can't remember. I like to copy data from spreadsheets and paste them to a document to keep notes about a portion of a spreadsheet I am referencing. When I paste as an image, it zooms in on&nbsp; a portion
 of the selection copied, and I am unable to resize to see all the data I copied. I generally am only copying 1 - 20 columns of data.

    <title>Error Code 80004005 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davesouth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error Code 80004005</h2>
                    <p>Updated to Mango on my HTC Mozart on Telstra the other day without any problems. But last week one of my two Hotmail email accounts stopped synchronizing. It gives me a “80004005” error code.</p>
<p>But researching that error code it points to a problem with Outlook on an Exchange server.</p>
<p>After basic trouble shooting like removing the battery and SIM card the problem still persists. I was going to delete the account off the phone and recreate it, but from what I have read from the MS site, is that the primary account cannot be deleted, which
 is the account I am having trouble with.</p>
<p>Has anyone else come across this problem since updating to Mango?</p>
<p>It looks like my only option is wiping the device and starting from scratch, which is something I don’t really want to do, but I may be forced to.</p>
<p>Oh, also , it deleted most of my emails as well. I still have ones from March this year but noting since then. Other than that I love how the phone fells now, so much slicker than before :)</p>

    <title>Auto Archiving, Defer Sending, and Message &#47; Conversation Text - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevin_1000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Auto Archiving, Defer Sending, and Message &#47; Conversation Text Formatting is &#91;still&#93; missing.</h2>
                    <p>There are three features that I used in Outlook for Windows that are missing in Outlook for Mac 2016 (and 2011). These are auto archiving, deferring the sending of an email, and formatting the text in the conversation / message list pane.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Auto archiving missing has been around for a long time and the work-arounds found online don't really fill the gap. I've come across SO MANY people asking about this one would think that Microsoft would actually know about this and want to improve their
 customers' experience in this area. Yet the feature continues to be absent release over release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Holding an email in the outbox for a period of time (I used 1 minute) was EXTREMELY useful and saved my back side on many occasions. I spent a lot of time in Rules to see if there's something else that could simulate this but other than the "Work Offline"
 switch or disabling the network connection, I don't see anyway to do this. There doesn't even seem to be an Outbox. Yes, I could save to Drafts and then send later, but that doesn't really meet the need. I click Send and then realize a moment later that I
 forgot something so I catch the message in the Outbox, modify it, and send it again. Very, very useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Formatting the text in the conversation / message list pane was also useful. At the end of the day, I would send myself an email that had specific words in the Subject field. I then created a formatting rule that would be applied in the message list pane
 which would change the color of the subject text and make it large. I used this to know where I left off in processing my emails so I could pick up from there the next day. I receive so much email that these really stood out and helped me be efficient on processing

<h2>            I can&#39;t remove a credit card from my account, or change the one Zune attempts to charge</h2>
                    I had to cancel my credit card, as it was stolen. Naturally, I'd have to update all my subscription services with the new information, one of which is my Zune Pass. So I added the new credit card information, and Zune was still trying to charge the old
 credit card. So I thought that if I remove the old card, it would automatically charge the new card. Nope, I wasn't able to remove the card two weeks ago due to an unknown error. I tried again today and I still got the same error. So then I think to myself,
 if I cancel my Zune Pass subscription and start a new one, there's the possibility that it'll give me the option of picking which credit card I use. The only problem is that I can't cancel my Zune Pass, as this also gives me an error.

<p>Hi Deepak,</p>
<p>As directory synchronization is enabled and source of the authority is in on-premises, most of the attributes cannot be managed from Exchange Online and must be managed from on-premises. If you decommission the last Exchange server, you will lose the ability
 to edit the Exchange attributes of the objects from on-premises. Although you can use ADSIEdit to edit those attributes on premises and then sync to Office 365, it is not supported. It will put you in an unsupported scenario.</p>
<p>Therefore, if DirSync is a requirement, then we strongly recommend you keep at least on Exchange server in on-premises.</p>
<p>If anything is unclear, please feel free to post back and we glad to assist you.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Ran<br />

<p>Hi Ran,</p>
<p>Thanks for quick reply. &nbsp;Apologies if I didn't mention the whole scenario.</p>
<p>Post mailbox migration to the cloud we're planning to do AD domain rename and to facilitate this we &nbsp;will need to remove &nbsp;last exchange do the AD rename and re install Exchange 2013.</p>
<p>We plan to stop Dirsync when Exchange is removed and plan to restart it once Exchange is re installed post AD domain rename.</p>
<p>We're concerned that removal of last Exchange could cause issues with key attributes in on premises AD e.g. Mail, MailNickname, ProxyAddresses, ArchiveGuid etc. and &nbsp;eventually cause issue with Exchange online mailboxes
</p>
<p>Can you please help me understand potential issues we could see with Exchange online mailboxes if we go ahead and remove last on premises Exchange!</p>
<p>Thanks for your help! </p>

<p>Hi Deepak,<br />
<br />
If you plan to deactivate DirSync first, then you don’t need to worry about any potential issue, as long as you’re going to re-activate DirSync someday.<br />
<br />
Once you deactivate your DirSync, all the synchronized objects will get the status “In-Cloud”, and you can simply manage them as if they’re pure cloud objects.<br />
<br />
Additionally, when it comes that you need to re-activate DirSync, what you should do is performing an
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2641663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SMTP matching</a>, which can help you make sure that all the synchronized attributes won’t be lost.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Allen<br />

<p>Hi Allen and Ran,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for the help and followup!</p>
<p>I have followup question:</p>
<p>1) since we will be removing last Exchange while disabling DirSync, will it remove or wipe out user's AD/Exchange attributes in on premises environment which is critical to Office 365 mailbox operations. I'm particularly curious about mail, mailnickname,
 proxyaddresses and ArchiveGuid &nbsp;attributes!!</p>
<p>2) Post Exchange re-installation, what attributes we need to double check before we re enable DirSync so that it doesn't effect cloud mailboxes and its operations!</p>
<p>Thanks again for the help!</p>

<p>Hi Deepak,</p>
<p>Thanks for update.</p>
<p>1. As far as I know, removing Exchange server will also delete Exchange related attributes.
</p>
<p>Anyway, this is strictly related to on-premise Exchange. I suggest you post at our on-premise Exchange server forum below.</p>
<p><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?category=exchangeserver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">social.technet.microsoft.com/.../home</a>
</p>
<p>They are more proficient at on-premise configurations. I appreciate your understanding and efforts.</p>
<p>2. Indeed, no official article has listed the specific attributes for this scenario, as we do not recommend uninstalling the last Exchange server in this situation.</p>
<p>For security purpose, I suggest you check all Exchange related attributes. If possible, you can ask in Exchange server forum: is it possible to backup all Exchange attributes before removing Exchange server.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Young</p>

            I'm guessing you didn't search before posting this, as there are numerous previous threads on the subject. The Windows update somehow corrupted the user profile. Logging in with a different profile is a workaround and sometimes even solves the problem
 with the original profile, but the fix will come in a future update that some Windows 10 users have already received.

    <title>Threats Detected. Do I Have a Virus&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> filecorrupt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Threats Detected.  Do I Have a Virus&#63;</h2>
                    <p>While following directions on U Tube Video on using “Pareto_DR_Setup_RW”, a data recovery program, I got an alert of a Severe Threat from my Computer and chose to “allow”
 it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Bad mistake, I believe.</p>

<p>I was using Security Essentials, Windows 7 Firewall, and Webroot AV at that time.</p>

<p>I am not sure if I have the “Exploit:JS/ShellCode.N” or "Trojan:Win32/Daiboo.A"
<span>&nbsp;</span>malware, or not now. </p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>malware, or not now. </p>

<p>MS Security Essentials stated I allowed “Exploit:JS/Shell Code.N” on 12/27/11 at 10 am.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>

<p>However, I do remember when I allowed this “Severe Threat.”<span>&nbsp;
</span>That was when I downloaded Pareto_DR.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, that was at a later time.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That time was on 12/30/11 at 1:45pm.</p>

<p>I was on Wi-Fi hot spot at a Starbucks.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I had been watching a You Tube Video on how to recover data using Pareto Doctor software.<span>&nbsp;
</span>While downloading I was asked to enter my email address.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I did.<span>&nbsp; </span>Supposedly to get registered.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Later, I got offers to buy Pareto Doctor on E-mail and I did not.</p>

<p>Later, I find a save to my downloads of that program entitled,
<b><i><u>“Pareto_DR_Setup_RW.”</u></i></b></p>

<p>I installed Pareto_DR.<span>&nbsp;
</span>and commanded it to scan my Hard Drive to do data recovery for a corrupted .docx file.<span>&nbsp;
</span>While doing so, the program displayed a beetle icon that turned on and off.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Later, program died, I think, and did not completely scan disk.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I stopped it at least twice, after running it more than once.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Each time the program displayed the beetle icon and stopped during scan.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I commanded it to recover a particular .TMP file it found to my D:\ <span>
&nbsp;</span>Drive.<span>&nbsp; </span>I opened that TMP file and it was binary data, I believe.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Not text.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p>Later, MS Essentials reported that exact file on my D:\ Drive as the one containing “Exploit:JS/Shell.N”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I tried to get MS Essentials to delete file.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exploit:..."
</span>displayed with a preceding “X,”<span>&nbsp; </span>but only on “All History”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If I changed Security Essentials to “Quarantine Items” or “Allowed Items,” I had no entries displayed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If I clicked on “X” and “Exploit…” line, Essentials did not give me the option to remove it.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>Sometime later, I went to D:\ Drive and deleted that TMP file.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Later, I read not to manually try to remove “Exploit:JS/...<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>

<p>However, that was much later.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Those instructions were too late.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p>Also, I got an item&nbsp;my computer&nbsp;that stated I should not use two Anti-Virus Programs at the same time.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So now, I am only using one program.</p>

<p>Later, I had got reports of another threat from Security Essentials.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>That report was for "Trojan:Win32/Daiboo.A" around 1-3-2012.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe I had a Root Kit?&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>Essentials continued to report over and over that “Trojan:.. was identified.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That is Security Essentials reported it, but this time I did not allow it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It was sometimes displayed as removed, but it reported multiple times and was usually reported as quarantined.
</p>

<p>However, If I changed to “Quarantine Items” or “Allowed Items” “Trojan:…” was never listed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It was only listed on “All History”.</p>

<p>I saw unusual behavior afterwards.</p>

<p>I saw the icons on desktop jiggling at random times.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When I duplicated a Drive that had Word Data on it with some Mac documents, Word had opened a “Resource Fork” file on it automatically.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Also, it said that if I destroyed a copy file of the Drive that I would be destroying “System Files” and I thought I only had data files on it.</p>

<p>So, I did an “HP Recovery”, which reinstalls the Windows 7 OS.
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I restored files from a Backup, also.</p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I restored files from a Backup, also.</p>

<p>Sometimes I see unusual things, even still.</p>

<p>As an intrusion check, I recently typed “Bank Account Nr:<span>&nbsp;
</span>678” on a MS Word 2010 document and it seemed as though the computer automatically selected that quote and cut it out.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I don’t think I hit keys by accident, but that is possible.</p>

<p>I have scanned my drives with Security Essentials, Webroot AV, and Microsoft Safety Scanner, all with no infected files found.</p>

<p>Do I have a virus or not?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Should I do anything more?&nbsp; Any comments or suggestions?</p>

    <title>Combined stacked chart with 1 line for the total target - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Combined stacked chart with 1 line for the total target</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to create a pivot graph that shows a stacked bar chart for sales per month per store.</p>
<p>I have columns: month, store, salesamount for this. So far so good, month on the horizontal axix, store on the legend field and salesamount on the values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'd like to add a single line for the target for all stores combined. However, when I add target to the values excel creates a matrix of store in combination with the target. So I get multiple lines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone any advice?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>pivot charts have a few limitations. They cannot do some chart types and they cannot do combination charts with mixed chart types for different series. If you want to build that kind of chart, you will need to create a regular chart based on the data in
 the pivot table. You can create dynamic ranges that grow and shrink with the pivot table and use these ranges as the chart data source. That way you have all the tools of the regular charts at your convenience, while processing data from the pivot table.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your quick reply!</p>
<p>I see what you mean. However, I don't understand how to create such dynamic ranges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it ok if I send you some data so maybe you can make an example of such a range?</p>
<p>
