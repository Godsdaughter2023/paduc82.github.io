            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I encountered the same problem installing Simply Accounting Premium 2010. A couple of weeks ago, I installed the program on a laptop running Windows 10, no issue.</p>
<p>Now trying to do the same on desktop with Windows 10, and no positive result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message shows up when the program is "Preparing to install".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run it in Comatibility mode as suggested, but no result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>windows resume loader frozen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beagles8mypc  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows resume loader frozen</h2>
                    I've read the other two questions and associated answers but people are not realizing that the user cannot get *anything* to happen. I am trying to help my mom fix her Asus EeePC netbook. I have the exact same model. In some computers if there is a loss
 of power while the machine is in hibernate then the resume windows loader freezes and it apparently disables the keyboard so none of the solutions given so far are possible.<br />
<br />
We've tried hitting F8 as soon as she turns it on but we are not getting the menu options you're supposed to get. We need a way to interrupt the boot cycle before it gets to the resume loader segment or we are just plain stuck there.
<br />
<br />
Is there a way to do this? I've searched all over and I've seen mention of some menu within the system that allows you to enable the keyboard again but I have no idea how to find it. I've seen some people mention using a PS2 keyboard externally to deal with
 it but we don't have access to another keyboard. My mom lives in a remote area and I am doing this by phone. I saw someone else do some sort of fancy bypass of the hibernate code but that is way beyond what I can do over the phone with her, unless I have a
 step by step to talk her through.... but even then... none of that helps without having the keyboard back first and if we had that we wouldn't need to deal with the code.<br />
<br />
Is there another key or sequence we can choose to disrupt the boot process and get to some menu options? All we need to do is work around that faulty hibernate issue to get windows to load at all and then we can disable the hibernate feature to prevent this
 from happening again. <br />
<br />
Without a CD drive we can't even boot from an installation disc. :( I also can't just restore to factory settings this way either.<br />
<br />
Please pay attention to the fact that once it hits that resume loader we have no keyboard options. Someone mentioned the windows logo and so on, but it never gets that far. It starts up, does a little bit of the boot process and then hits that resume screen.
 I don't think it is just ASUS that this happens to, not from what I've seen elsewhere online.
<br />
<br />
Please help... my mom can't take this to a repair place because there isn't one there. They are sort of disconnected without this netbook.
<br />
<br />
thanks for any answers, much appreciated<br />

            <p>FOUND THE ANSWER! WOOT!</p>
<p>
</p><p>"There is one more thing some of us could be dealing with – unresponsive keyboard. You may be seeing the resume loader options, but your keyboard may not be active, so you really can’t change anything at this point. If your keyboard and motherboard connections
 are fine (check them anyway), follow the advice below.<br />
There is one pretty simple trick: restart your computer and enter your BIOS settings. (Press Del, F2, F1, F5, F12 or any other key assigned for that purpose by your computer manufacturer).<br />
Once you access BIOS go to Peripherals section, scroll down to “USB keyboard” section and make sure that it is enabled, not disabled. I had the same problem twice (both times power failure) and fixed it by enabling the keyboard. I don’t really know why it’s
 set to disabled every time the power goes out."</p>

<p>Hi I have never heard of accessing system restore from the BIOS.</p>
<p>Here's 3 ways to get to Advanced Startup, where you will find system restore!<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/126016/three-ways-to-access-the-windows-8-boot-options-menu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/126016/three-ways-to-access-the-windows-8-boot-options-menu/</a></p>

            No it cannot. The BIOS is completely separate from the operating system.

    <title>Windows Aero theme disappeared&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> themermaidking  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Aero theme disappeared&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>(I know this has been posted several times before but none of the solutions seem to help my problem.)</p>
<p>So I was using my computer tonight and all of the sudden I noticed my Aero theme was gone.<br />
I tried to set it back but when I click on the Aero theme and OK, it loads it like it should but once it says it's finished, it's still not there. And when I check my settings, it's automatically back to Windows Vista Basic.<br />
This happened to me once before on my old laptop which was a Dell, and I never got it fixed. Now I have the same problem on my Acer. I looked it up and found an Aero troubleshooting page on here but nothing helped. I downloaded the Microsoft Fix It thing it
 told me to and ran through that process but it didn't work.<br />
I've looked through my settings and I seem to have all of the basic requirements for it, and I had it before, but now it's just gone.<br />
If I remember correctly, when this happened to my old laptop, it gave me an error when I selected the Aero theme. This time it just won't load.</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do to get it back? Will I have to redownload it completely?<br />
If so, can someone link me to a safe download?<br />
Or will something like a system restore work? (That doesn't affect my personal files, right?)</p>

<h3> sawyerbegg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost Bluetooth driver after restoring Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I recently tried to upgrade my windows 7 version to Windows 10. &nbsp;The upgrade was not successful and Windows 7 was restored on my hp laptop. &nbsp;Since that attempt to upgrade, I have lost the Ralink Motorola BC4 Bluetooth 3.0+HS adapter (Bluetooth Driver) that
 had previously been on the laptop. </p>
<p>The error message I receive states: </p>
<p>Message file "C:\Program Files\Motorola\Bluetooth\unins000.msg" is missing. &nbsp;Please correct the problem or obtain a new copy of the program.</p>
<p>Can someone tell me the best way to restore the Driver or obtain a safe copy of the program? Thanks<br />
</p>

            Hi Roger, are you doing this from inside your user profile, if so it is probably failing since you don't have admin privileges to run this command.
<br />
<br />Try running the command from the Windows Recovery Environment, hopefully it will complete from there for you . . .
<br />
<br />Start PC, just as the manufacturers logo disappears and Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Then run the command:
<br />net user Administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />Restart your System

                    <p>I am using ACER E1 571 laptop with i3 and 2GB RAM configuration and running Windows7 64 Bit Ultimate&nbsp;edition. Yesterday, I installed free trial of &nbsp;Quick heal antivirus and ran scan for all the four hard drives. After the scan, the system prompted me to
 do a restart. When I restarted my pc, I cant have access to my keyboard and mouse (not working- cant enter password). I am the only administrator and I don't have any second OS running. I have tried accessing to system restore by pressing F8 during boot, I
 find only one restore point, I restored the system to that date but it didn't solve the problem. I don't know what to do. I need the files in my hard drives, its so important that I have all the thesis of my project work in it. Please give me a solution on
 how to deal with.</p>

<p>My mouse and keyboard is not working when the screen prompts for password (i.e after displaying windows) but before booting, I have access to mouse and keyboard, I could open BIOS setting by pressing F2 or open system restore by pressing F8. In system restore
 menu, I notice that my keyboard and mouse works properly but I cant login even in safe mode. The screen gets struck, I cant do anything but using the power button to restart or shut it down.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Edge defaults to last printer used in my Win-10 Build 1511 environment   HELP</h2>
                    <p>I want to be able to set Edge to default to the "devices and printers" selected default printer. I can not find a way to make this happen, as it always defaults to the last printer I print too.&nbsp; ( Example: I have 4 printers set up in our business, I can
 print from word to printer 1, then that's where Edge is going to want to default&nbsp;the next time I print, If I print too printer 2 from Adobe, then printer 2 is now where Edge will default too).....&nbsp;Problem I have is when I print in any program other than Edge
 everything works fine, however Edge then sets itself to the last printer that I printed too within my windows 10 build 1511 environment. I simply just want Edge to always print too the set default printer. I have tried the "AlwaysUseDefaultPrinter"&nbsp; string
 addition to the registry, Which made it worse, as windows then changed my default printer in "devices and printers" after every selection while printing.&nbsp; Microsoft you have an issue here, and please don't tell me to re-install win10 to correct this.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>SOLVED ...&nbsp; go to settings / devices&nbsp;&nbsp; and turn off&nbsp; " let windows manage my default printer"&nbsp;&nbsp; grrrrrrrrrrrr</p>

<h3> mark scott lavin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop stays on in bag .... I think its Windows Update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just had the unpleasant surprise of pulling my laptop out of the bag after 2 hours and it was still running! It was hot to the touch and gratefully, it seems to be working just fine. But this is the third time it's happened since I bought it in January
 and it's pretty concerning. I set the computer to sleep, and most of the time that turns it off, but I think when windows tries to install updates, it doesn't really go to sleep. Then I'm at the next location with a burning laptop. I really don't want to do
 damage to this new machine, so any suggestions how I can ensure it really does go to sleep when I tell it to, Windows Update or not, would be great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h3> datwunfool  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disk Drive Issue</h2>
                    
<p>Tonight I tried to watch some movies (Blu Ray and DVD) but for some reason the disk drive has just stopped working all together. I tried restarting and completely unplugging it too. What I am experiencing is that when I put the disk in to the xbox I hear
 the disk spin (quietly as normal) but then stops and nothing happens. &nbsp;I waited for about 10-15mins to see if it was just taking a while but still, nothing. So I retried with my Battle Field 4 disk and still, nothing happened. No grinding noise what so ever,
 it just seems to work for a split second and then stops. It does not try to eject the disk. anyone else have this problem? &nbsp;also my console is still under warranty how can I go about getting a new one?</p>

<p>DatWunFool I am having the same problems with mine and I have filled out a support request and I am sending it in tmrw morning to be fixed. I wish there was another fix for this but there is not. and u will not qualify for an advanced exchange for this problem.
 all you can do is start a repair and then send it to them. I am hoping it will take no more than 2 weeks to get fixed but at this point it's anyones guess at how long it will take. it will not cost you any money tho unless u choose expedited shipping like
 I did. it is only $11. hope this helps you figure out where to go next.</p>

<p>Update: so I decided to wait a month before sending my console in. I tried some hard resets and my xbox one now will play audio CDs and DVDs just fine. But it still continues to not play BluRays and Xbox One games. &nbsp;Nothing continues to happen when I put
 in a Blu Ray but Now when I put in a Xbox One game (battle field 4) It spins the disk (loudly now) once and then stops. A few moments go by and then it auto ejects the disk(it didnt do that before). &nbsp;This makes be wonder if it is a software issue. &nbsp;So im going
 to wait for the next update and see if that fixes it or not. &nbsp;still im pretty disappointing right now that this $500 console is messing up for me so soon. &nbsp;I expected a little more quality from this gen... If anyone has any solutions or insight to this, please
 feel free to message me at any point. I will keep this question open till I find a solution or send my console back in. &nbsp;Thanks in advance for any advice.</p>

<p>Really sorry you're having this problem, man. As a general rule, this doesn't sound like it falls into the category of problems that can be fixed with hard resets or troubleshooting steps, and it sounds like you've already done all you can. Even with the
 best hardware, issues do happen. I heard at one point in the past, I think if I remember correctly, companies expect something like a 2% failure rate with new systems. No matter what, because of manufacturing variances between manufacturing centers and microscopic
 flaws in the individual hardware components, some devices will fail.</p>
<p>One thing I would suggest checking - this sounds dumb, but are you plugged directly into a wall, or does your Xbox run through a surge protector/power strip. If you're into a power strip, you absolutely want to plug it directly into a wall, because the Xbox
 power supply already has a built-in surge protector. By plugging it into another surge protector, which has the effect of throttling the flow of power, the device essentially has to work twice as hard to pull the necessary amperage during its startup routine,
 which results in various components failing not long into the life of the device. (This was one of the biggest causes of the RRoD on the 360.) You might try plugging into a wall and seeing if that makes a difference in its ability to read the BR/Game discs.</p>
<p>Otherwise, sadly, your best bet is going to be going to <a href="https://myservice.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://myservice.xbox.com/</a> and registering your console, and then starting the repair process. :-(</p>

            Hi Messiah.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />No expert in Forums where we see the most cases (by the tens of thousands) recommends  McAfee, but we do solve problems by having it be uninstalled.
<br />
<br /> I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.   
<br />
<br />If you want the best on-demand scanners install and run Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner free scanners.  
<br />
<br />How exactly did you hide the file?  Do you have a backup?  Any file not backed up is valued as worthless.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

<p>Hey Greg .. thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>So if i uninstall Mcafee will i get back tht file if it was quarantined by McAfee?</p>
<p>And regarding the backup ...i didn't do :-(</p>
<p>I hid the file normally by going into the properties of tht folder and checking the hide option.</p>

            You may not.  Merely installing McAfee will often ruin an install, which is another reason most enthusiasts won't even run a factory install in the first place.  You'd be better off doing the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

<p>Hey...it was one of my assumption after browsing through internet tht those files might be quarantined by McAfee. If its not the case why i can't open those files ...?</p>
<p>Any alternatives to access those files ..as i am sure tht they are thr in tht location ..</p>
<p>And regarding uninstalling and reinstalling Av i searched and got to knw those quarantined files are crypted so tht they dnt do any harm to pc in near future so uninstalling them wont help getting back those files..you can go thru the discussion provided

<p>Your problem might be related to the fact that you seem to have a folder name that begins with a dot (.messiah).&nbsp; The only way that I know of to create a folder name that begins with a dot is via the "md" command in a DOS command prompt.&nbsp; You should right-click
 on the Start button and open an admin command prompt and see if you can see the folder from there.&nbsp; If you can see it, rename it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>But we can't see each other, all I see is myself and a waiting sign next to his avatar on the Video Kinect page. He gets the same thing, we've tried signing in and out plus giving it lots of time to sort itself out. If one of us is supposed to have Kinect
 then I want my Gold subscription cancelled IMMEDIATELY because thats all me and my brother got Gold and 2 Vision camera's for, I moved to Sweden a while ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was told I didn't need Kinect for video chat.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the vision camera is obsolete with the release of Kinect, one would require a Kinect camera to engage in Video Kinect. My apologies for the users on this forum that could have forwarded you the wrong information.</p>

<p>Actually, do not bother with the Kinect, it works even less than the Live Vision Cameras. &nbsp;I never had any problems connecting to friends and family with the so called "obsolete" cameras. &nbsp;My friends and I had crappy connections and got connected all the
 time without any problems. &nbsp;The only problem we ever had was slow, choppy video performance. &nbsp;But at least we could see each other. &nbsp;Since the Kinect came along and our software was updated, we could no longer video chat using those cameras. &nbsp;So we all updated
 and bought the Kinect, and we still could not see each other. &nbsp;So we all started paying more money for faster internet and faster routers and/or switches, because thats all the quote/ un-quote "intelligent" tech support could come up with for a problem. &nbsp;None
 of it made any difference. &nbsp;The software update is the problem, they just do not want to admit they made a mistake, and this NEW, FANCY, EXPENSIVE camera and the software running it is worthless for video chatting. &nbsp;Skype on an old computer with an old camera
 works just fine, in fact, it looks better than my Xbox Live Vision ever did. &nbsp;Myself , my dozens of friends and over 30 family members all have worthless xbox Kinect senors that do not work no matter where they live in the country, or what service provider
 the use. &nbsp;Xbox live Tech support cannot help you to Video Chat with anyone. &nbsp;You are simply LUCKY if it works, and like most of us, UNLUCKY if it does not! &nbsp;"End of Story" &nbsp;Get your money back if you do not play games "Tomarlyn" its all the xbox is good for.</p>

<p>By 'dc,' you mean disconnect, correct? If so, then you're not alone. It seems that others have been having this sort of issue, myself included, though it's not as bad as it used to be. Does your connection happen to have any sort of guest accounts by any
 chance? You won't see them in the console, but if you go to your computer and click on your wireless connections, you may see the network you chose, along with the same one, with the word 'guest' next to it. I know this could be an issue because when I installed
 my new router and connected my console for the first time, it gave me an error about multiple networks with the same name in the area, so you happen to have one, go into your router's settings and disable guest accounts. The way of getting to your settings
 for the router will be different for each one, so if you have the manual, look into it, or if you don't, do some research online. If possible, try to hook up a CAT5 Ethernet cable from the router to the console, ensuring a perfect connection.</p>
<p>Now, this is ensuring that you're actually using a wireless router, which I know a lot of people do, but if you don't and you just use a CAT5 cable, try seeing if the cable is damaged in any way, if it's bent, torn, etc. Try different cables, see if any
 work. It could be because of a faulty piece of wiring in the cable. If all else, it could be any of the networking hardware you have. If so, contact the manufacturers and see if they can help out.</p>
<p>Hope this at least helps you out in some way! :)</p>
<p>PS: Can you provide the name of your router and/or modem? This'll help us out a lot more.</p>

                    I'm trying to access the System Reserved Partition. When I start the disk management console I can see the volume I want but properties is greyed out. I'm on Windows 10 Home Insider preview, build 18351.1. I can access it from Powershell&nbsp; using&nbsp;mountvol
 F: /S. I can also access it from Linux, but that's time consuming. Can I really not access this from partition from its own OS, Microsoft???

            Hi Paul.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There's good reason it is not assigned a drive letter and not easily accessible as we see many cases where when it has been a rogue backup or other programs writes files to it and clogs WIndows from being able to Upgrade, System Restore or other procedures that depends on System Volume Information files which must have the extra space on the partition to expand in order to function.  
<br />
<br />It also can be targeted by hackers and infection if it's easily accessible.  
<br />
<br />You can use a bootable Partition Manager like Easeus to issue it a drive letter so it's accessed in File Explorer.  
<br />
<br />If you'll say what you need to do then I can help you better.   
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Recovery partition as the name suggests is used if your PC fails to boot to access repair options. It is hidden by design so that something does not delete the contents which would make the PC unable to boot.
<br />
<br />Any reason why you want to access it?

<p>Thank you for the quick reply, Greg! As I said, I'm on the Insider fast ring, which means I get updates pretty frequently. This installation seems to have trouble writing files to the EFI partition. I believe that is because that partition is shared with
 a Linux installation. The Windows installation always gives an error, "We couldn't update the system reserved partition" on every update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix the error I delete the extra language folders in the EFI\Microsoft\Boot folder in that partition. I can do that easily through the Linux installation, but it would be even easier to do it through Windows.</p>

            Paul - 
<br />
<br />It seems you're making space on the System Reserved partition to get past the error.  You can also resolve this by extending it a bit using a Partition Manager like free Partition Wizard to Extend.  It has the ability to borrow free space from any other partition on the hard drive even if not adjacent. 
<br />
<br /> See video tutorial here:  
<br /><a href="http://partitionwizard.com/video-help/extend_partition/extend_partition.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://partitionwizard.com/video-help/extend_pa...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to assign a letter first also using the Partition Manager.

There are numerous posting on the internet about this error message from windows XP through Vista, but no clear solutions. Wasn't Windows 7 supposed to fix these problems that occurred in previous operating systems? I am embarrassed every time I see those Apple

<p>Hi killerbunny,</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers.</p>
<p>Do you have shared folders on the hard drive?</p>
<p>This error occurs when your browser is unable to negotiate with removable media. In your case, the hard drive.</p>
<p>Uninstall and reinstall drivers for your hard drive and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Make sure you have the latest drivers installed for your hard drive for Windows 7.You can download the drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</p>
<p>Always use “safely remove hardware” option while unplugging the hard drive.</p>
<p>Disable any security programs temporarily and check if you still get that error.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to enable DMA mode using the Device Manager</p>
<p>1. Go to "My Computer, ""System Tools," "View System Information," then System Properties, "Hardware," Then Open Device Manager</p>
<p>2. Double-click IDE ATA//ATAPI Controllers to display the list of controllers and channels.</p>
<p>3. Right-click the icon for the channel to which your burner is connected and select Properties. Now click the Advanced Settings tab.</p>
<p>4. In the Current Transfer Mode drop-down box, select DMA if available if the current setting says, "PIO Only."</p>
<p>If the drop-down box already says, "DMA if Available" but the current transfer mode is PIO, then the user must "toggle" the settings. That is, change the selection from "DMA if available" to PIO only, and click "OK".</p>
<p>Then repeat the steps above to change the selection to "DMA if available".</p>
