<h2>            Blank Space Below Outlook Bar</h2>
                    I am getting about 8 blank lines between the Outlook.com Bar and the listing of messages.&nbsp; That takes away space from the preview pane and message list.&nbsp; What gives with the empty real estate?

<h2>            Microsoft Corporate Greed</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">Large companies in this country are pretty infamous for leaving their customers feeling trapped and frustrated. For every company like Logitech or Amazon who manage to treat their
 customers well and earn their business, we as consumers are forced to interact with the likes of Verizon, Comcast, or Microsoft where we are treated like cattle by a company that is seemingly of the opinion that they are entitled to our wallets regardless
 of their behavior. Cable companies in particular are guilty of this. In a recent survey, Verizon managed to edge out their competition to garner the highest customer satisfaction rating among their peers at a lofty 70%. That is, by the very slimmest of margins,
 a C- grade. Comcast for comparison earned a 62% and Time Warner Cable a surreal 59% (<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-the-most-hated-company-in-america-2016-06-01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-the-most-hated-company-in-america-2016-06-01</a>).
</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">Customers are not alone in bearing the brunt of this complete disregard for anything other than profit margins – I’m sure many of us reading this article recall the recent debacle
 over the mass strikes Verizon struggled with as their own employees were simply fed up with being nickled and dimed and treated like property – just like us, their customers. A quick internet search reveals hundreds of photos of Verizon employees marching
 in the streets bandying signs contrasting stagnant wages and declining work conditions with soaring executive payouts. Right up there in the annals of experiments with callous disregard with Verizon is the perennial champion of arrogance, Microsoft.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">Just recently, I was speaking with Microsoft Live Chat Support - something I have been finding myself doing quite often ever since Office 2013 came out. Long story short - the activation
 of the recent Microsoft Office products can be quite the pain and it seems as though Microsoft is attempting to steer clients away from the tried and true Product Key method of activation. With that, I have needed Microsoft's assistance on several occasions
 to help in activating products where either the program claims the key is "already in use", or the key is used with a different Microsoft account, or the user has innocently completely forgotten both the username and password to the appropriate Microsoft account.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">Microsoft's Live Chat was a very convenient and helpful service offered by Microsoft. They were always able to find some kind of solution each time and could even remote in and take
 care of the problem for me. However, I have just learned that Microsoft is now charging for this service. When I learned of this from the Microsoft rep, I left the individual with the following link before disconnecting:</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); text-align: center">
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/five-apps/five-alternatives-to-microsoft-office/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/five-apps/five-alternatives-to-microsoft-office/</a></span></strong></p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); text-align: center">
</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">On top of that, I have noticed a&nbsp;<em>significant&nbsp;</em>decline in the quality of their chat support. Aside from their representatives typing in broken English with numerous spelling
 errors, their responses are programmed with little to no thought. Chatting with Microsoft Support is now slightly better than chatting with an AI program created by the world's smartest chimpanzee. It is&nbsp;<em>quite&nbsp;</em>clear that Microsoft has made some cutbacks
 to this department. This, along with their recent removal of the 15GB Camera Roll Bonus from OneDrive, is yet another example of the ubiquitous corporate greed that we customers have very sadly become accustomed to in the tech sector. Indeed, this very behavior
 is why www.MooreITHelp.com will never change. I have never had any desire to see my small business grow into some massive tentacled monstrosity probing for any and all ways into your bank account. I am sure I am not alone in noticing a trend in the relationship
 between the size of a corporation and its lack of customer service and human compassion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">Just recently, I had completed a personal project of scanning in all of my vintage family photos and uploading them to OneDrive in an attempt to allow family members from across the
 globe to add, edit, and make personal copies for their own collection. Apparently for a company that is worth just under 70 BILLION dollars (as of my writing this) this service represents a life or death threat to their bottom line and had to be monetized
 for the good of the shareholder. Now, unless I want to add an additional expense to the ridiculous list of charges for using Microsoft software on a Microsoft OS, I'm either going to have to confuse everyone with a whole new link or cut everyone off.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">My wife and I are really growing tired of the noticeable increase in costs and decrease in quality with seemingly every service we purchase from virtually any corporation. Yelp, for
 example, grew so prominent and popular so quickly that they simply implemented an ad-hoc program intended to take care of fraudulent reviews, rather than hiring specialists for a fraud department - something companies like Thumbtack.com and TripAdvisor.com
 did. This results in many honest reviews being silenced with pretty much no meaningful recourse for the reviewer or the business being reviewed. Without considering their product or their clients, Yelp figured it easier to just contract out a lowest bidder
 to slap together a gaggle of **** algorithms and consider the case closed. I managed to obtain over 100 Yelp email addresses with which to voice my concerns only to repeatedly be recited programmed responses basically boiling down to the reviewer needing to
 write more reviews and be more active on Yelp in order to not be filtered out.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">I just recently had a client whose computer became infected only a week after I had cleaned up his machine. Though no fault of mine, I decided not to charge him for the second service
 to ensure his satisfaction. For me this was not just a business decision to keep a valued customer, but a statement about myself and my small business. At the heart of the matter, I started this business to help people enjoy and safely use their own property
 on what can be, at times, a deceptive and hostile internet. Our tech devices allow us to share meaningful parts of our lives with one another, to conduct business at lightning speeds across the world, and to explore places and ideas we may never have encountered
 without them. I want my customers to be able to take advantage of these possibilities to the fullest – not to be duped and bled dry by the thousand cuts of a cash hungry conglomerate.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">This was not a lone incident to be used as self-advertising either. Recently, a non-profit agency contacted me for assistance with data they had lost. Their previous technician had
 not bothered to properly install a data backup system and after a technical problem the agency found themselves having lost large swathes of integral information for their operations. Naturally ,the agency representatives were distraught and desperate. Instead
 of taking advantage of their precarious situation with “priority fees” or “emergency response charges”, I charged them half of my usual pricing due to the circumstances as they had already spent a good deal of money to accomplish nothing. This non-profit agency
 has since sent me enough work to keep me busy for a month.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">These scenarios are why I started this business in the first place. I am not in this industry to gouge people and pad my coffers with ill-gotten gains. I am here to help people. This
 is what makes me different from my larger competitors. We have all seen prices keep climbing as services remain stagnant or are even repackaged and charged for (yes I am still shocked at Microsoft’s OneDrive policy changes). Hold times on the phone or online
 keep growing, the technical assistance remains the same quality it has been for ages (lackluster to put it mildly), and the employees themselves don’t seem to be the benefactors of these increasing revenues and decreasing expenditures. That money, our money,
 is quite simply funneled to shareholders while we are treated like sheep penned in and waiting to be shorn. If you are as tired as I am of companies acting like they own you and a chunk of your paycheck simply due to the virtue of being the biggest fish in
 the pond, then give me a chance to show you the power of customer service and a passion for technology.</p>

            Are you aware that it is illegal for corporations to put anything other than profit at the top of their priorities? Maybe when that changes so will corporate greed. Pursuit of the dollar is not the highest aim of any individual, business or society. Acting
 like it is has consequences like we see here ever day.

    <title>Quick Access Toolbar &#91;QAT&#93; Icons on Office 365 Word too big - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rafisher1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Quick Access Toolbar &#91;QAT&#93; Icons on Office 365 Word too big</h2>
                    <p>I have Office 365 v1811 on a new Win 10 Pro 1809 computer for a client.&nbsp; I have an extensive set of buttons on my QAT that fit in Word 2010, but not in 365 v1811.&nbsp; After gleaning as many as I can I still need to get 6 more positions on the toolbar.&nbsp;&nbsp; While
 working the Options I noticed this version has a much improved Spelling and Grammar checker now called Grammar &amp; Refinements. As an editor, this piqued my interest.&nbsp; However, since I use the full QAT constantly, not having it all fit on the toolbar is a killer,
 not to mention the icons are so washed out it is hard to see the differences. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So unless I can find a way to get more buttons on the QAT, I will stick with Word 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi, <br />
<br />
You are right. (They are smaller than 2016 in 2013 as well.) Please don't shoot the messenger! I am a fellow user trying to help you use the Word that is rather than the one that should be.&nbsp; A minor workaround is to put Word into Mouse Mode rather than touch
 mode. Here is a <a href="http://addbalance.com/word/QATmodification.htm#ComparisonQATIconSize" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
comparison</a>. AFAIK, it is the same in Word 2016 and 2019.</p>

            Right the first time nothing happened so I cleaned it again and it seems to have gone although I just put it down and it said 'enhancement not supported' which if it's referring to the headset I am glad about as maybe it won't do it agin if it doesn't
 support it...?!<br />
<br />
So well done you good advice I can highly recommend a toothbrush and cotton buds for anyone else with this problem!

            1. The maximum number of audio conferencing is 25 (24 + 1 host)
<br />
<br />2. The maximm number of video conferencing is 25 (24 + 1 host) for new Skype which is v8. For old Skype, limit is 10 (9 + 1 host). Note - a screen share is also counted as a video feed.
<br />
<br />I am not aware about any way to restrict file sharing.

<p>Is there something that needs changed in Set up? If so, where and how would I go about doing this?</p>

<h2>            Excel- Double sided printing</h2>
                    <p>Need help printing from an excel program.&nbsp; I am doing double sided printing, the alignment on both sides of the paper are not matching.
</p>
<p>For example If I am creating a business card in excel and want similar information on the back of the card I select double sided printing, but the&nbsp;images do not align on both sides.

<p>
</p><p>Thank very much for the help, </p>
<p>I followed the steps that you provided and was able to get the results that I was looking for.
</p>
<p>There was only one change that I made to my document; since I was putting together two 4X6&nbsp;double sided&nbsp;cards on one 8X11 sheet, I did not select the vertical option&nbsp;in
<strong>Center on page.</strong></p>
<p>Other than that everything else was great. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Powerpoint Double-tap on Touchpad Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tae junham  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powerpoint Double-tap on Touchpad Issue</h2>
                    <p>I am using Dell XPS13 (9360) which comes with Precision Touchpad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I double click a word in PowerPoint 2016 (w/ Mouse mode), the word should be selected. This works fine when I use TouchScreen on the laptop, external mouse, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I double tap with Touchpad, it briefly selects the word and quickly deselect the word. I played with various different TouchPad settings (sensitivity, disable/enable bunch of options) but didn't fix the behavior.&nbsp; The weird part about that
 is if I double tap at the beginning of a word, it reliably select the word without being deselected as usual.&nbsp; I am wondering if there's known solution for this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THanks&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I'm in a bit of a pickle here.<br />
A few month back I decided to check out the windows 10 insider version on my stationary pc.<br />
Everything worked like a charm, up until update 10162..<br />
Since I updated I haven't been able to open any settings (only the old control panel), not able to personalize nor edit resolution.<br />
When I attempt to open the windows 10 settings panel, the store pops open, and shuts down again&nbsp;emmidiately.<br />
<br />
I can't update like it is right now, anyone able to provide me a solution to this?<br />
<br />
Also, this pops open whenever I attempt to open Personalize or Display settings:<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t open a word 2013 file in word 2016</h2>
                    <p>I cannot open a 90k docx in Word 2016. I originally worked on this novel in Word 2010 then took it with me to Word 2013 and then to Word 2016. For the past two weeks I have been working on this file in both Word 2016 and Word 2013 - going back and forth
 between the two programs on two different computers. Very suddenly on May 1, Word 2016 would no longer open this document. I am not getting any error code that tells me the file is corrupt, it simply crashes Word 2016.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried ALL of the recovery suggestions I can find in this forum and elsewhere to no avail. I can still open this file in Word 2013 on my ASUS 2-in-1, and I can open it in WPS / Kingsoft Writer. This won't be of any use to my publisher, however, if
 the file can't be opened in their more recent versions of Word. (I have also tried opening the file on a brand-spanking-new computer on which I have installed a brand new Office 2016. The program crashes.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of my other files seem to give Word 2016 this problem, but it may arise again when I return to older, unfinished files created in earlier versions of Word. As this is my livelihood, I am seriously unhappy about this. I need a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for the help.</p>

<h2>            Outlook Mobile for Android Sync Settings&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just installed Outlook Mobile for work as my company moved to Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my question, whenever I have previously used Outlook there was a setting option to sync email at specific intervals such as every 5 minutes, every hour, manual sync, etc. I can't find this setting any longer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where did it go? Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Trouble Viewing Excel Documents on Dual Monitors - MAC</h2>
                    I have a user running dual monitors. &nbsp;She is unable to view and manipulate one spreadsheet on each monitor. &nbsp;After making each window full-screen, clicking on a cell of one spreadsheet causes the one on the second monitor to relocate behind the spreadsheet
 on her laptop's monitor. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We have tried changing options under window &gt; arrange, but that does not help.
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I understand there is a similar Windows issue, but this is specific to Mac and Excel 2011.</div>

 across multiple screens or viewing different spreadsheets on multiple screens? Also, what is the latest version of OS X that you're running?</span>

            My user is using an 18-month old Macbook, running OS 10.5.8 (fully patched), and Office 2011 (version 14.1.3).
<div><br />
<div>In addition to her Macbook's LCD monitor, she is connected to a 22" monitor to allow for her to have more desktop space for her spreadsheets.</div>
<div><br />
<div>She is trying to view two spreadsheets-- two different .xls documents-- and have one on each screen. &nbsp;She opens the first document, which initially opens to display on her laptop monitor. &nbsp;She then moves it to the 22" monitor, and fully expands the document
 window. &nbsp;It displays fine. &nbsp;She will then open the second document, which also opens on her laptop monitor. &nbsp;She leaves the document there, but expands the document window.</div>
<div><br />
<div>She now has one document on her laptop monitor, and one on her external monitor, and can compare, or copy/paste information, or whatever.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, as soon as she clicks on one document or the other, the document that is displayed on the 22" external monitor snaps back onto the laptop screen, behind the document that was initially displayed on that screen.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope that explains the problem more thoroughly.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for any help you can provide.</div>

            I see this is a few months old and was never resolved.&nbsp; I too have had this issue since we have been running Office 2011.&nbsp; I am running 10.6.8 and Excel 14.1.4 (both fully patched).&nbsp; This problem has existed as long as I can remember and its incredibly
 annoying when working with multiple spreadsheets, often spread over two screens.&nbsp; Its almost as if Excel is automatically hiding one spreadsheet when you click on the other.&nbsp;

            Please take a few minutes to carefully document the problem in a feedback to Microsoft. Use the Excel Help menu and choose Send Feedback to display the web form to use for this purpose. Be sure to include as many details you can think of that may be relevant.
 Especially include details about your Office update level, Mac OS X update level, and the hardware (type of Mac, brand and model of monitors, cabling hookups, display settings, etc.). Do it as if you were explaining to someone how to exactly replicate your
 setup.

            This problem has existed in all versions of Excel for Mac for years and affects all versions of OS X. &nbsp;I have experienced it with a MBP 2008 and now with a 15 ince MBP 2011 with Excel 14.2.5.
<div><br />
<div>I have two external monitors that I use at home and at work, a Thunderbolt display and a Dell 22 inch external hooked up minidisplay port to dvi. &nbsp;All set to their maximum resolution (1600x1200 for the Dell) It has been reported by others with other display
 configurations. &nbsp;It is somewhat better in newer versions in that in my experience it if you maximize the sheet on the secondary (usually external) display it no longer moves the window back to the primary display and hides it behind the other window but merely
 resizes the window until you click back to it but it is still incredibly annoying, particularly if you are trying to audit two spreadsheets or copy information between spreadsheets.</div>

            That's all well and good, but I don't have all that equipment. Telling other users here in the forum doesn't let Microsoft know about the problem. Use the Send Feedback feature from Excel's Help menu to display the suggestion form where you can send this
 information to Microsoft.

            I did that but don't expect much from it. &nbsp;MS has known about this problem for years and said they were not particularly interested in fixing it because it affected "only a small subset of users." &nbsp;That was in Office 2008 and it is still in 2011 (slightly
 better). &nbsp;I would like to think that they would fix it in a service pack or even in the next version but after over 3 years without a fix I am not holding my breath.

            <p>Experiencing the same problem, is there a solution? And I mean an ACTUAL solution, not some obscure over-engineered set of steps to open a document. I want to work with excel in two screens, and I want the spreadsheets to stay still and take over the whole
 of the two screens. Is that too much to ask from excel and/or mac???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over 4 years and nobody has bothered to fix this? Utterly dissappointing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’m using Outlook 2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>i get a window that pops up when i open Outlook that shows my server as imap.gmail.com and asks for my user name and password. When i correctly enter those, the same screen comes up over and over and over. I’ve tried repeatedly and when I click on OK, the
 same screen comes up over and over. Even if I click on CANCEL, it takes repeated attempts for the screen to go away. Won’t let me log in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This all started when i received an email that said someone has tried to access my gmail account, recommending I change my password. I changed my password and now the access problems on Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am able to access my gmail account on a browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume from the sign in message that i use imap</p>

<h2>            PowerPoint Office 365 - Formatting Issues When Printing Notes - Occurs When Editing Notes Online</h2>
                    We are having formatting issues when printing Notes using PowerPoint 365.&nbsp; We found that if we edit the Notes
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">online</span> in 365, it corrupts the formatting of the notes when printing (Notes are zoomed in and you can't read all them).&nbsp; If we select "Open in PowerPoint" and edit the Notes, save and print, the formatting is correct.&nbsp;
 So the issue occurs only when editing the Notes online.&nbsp;

            Thanks for confirmation of this, we've been suspecting as much. Please file a bug report in PowerPoint by choosing File&gt;Feedback&gt;Send a Frown and describe the problem in detail. If you can include a screen shot of the messed-up Notes Master on a slide,
 you can also include that screenshot when you submit the file.

<p>Hi Alexis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my test of printing a presentation on PowerPoint Online, I couldn't reproduce the same behavior from our side. Here is my process:</p>
<p>1. On PowerPoint Online, go to View &gt; Notes &gt; enter notes;</p>
<p>2. Go to File &gt; Print &gt; select Print Notes Pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use a different process, please tell us your steps so that we may test it for you. If your process is exactly the same as I mentioned above, please try printing from another browser and see if the notes could be printed normally. If this is not related
 to the browser you use, I'd appreciate it if you could capture a screenshot of the print review so that we may better understand this issue and further assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Nathan</p>

<div>Hi John,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for the articles, I used the "Trouble with PowerPoint Notes Page formatting" suggestion to edit the xml for:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>notesSz cx="7543800" cy="9848088"</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I downloaded the presentation from Microsoft PowerPoint Online to my desktop.</p>
<p>2. Renamed the file to .zip</p>
<p>3. Open the "Presentation.xml" file in Wordpad</p>
<p>4, Edited the notesSz cx="7543800" cy="9848088"</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the formatting was corrected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After re-uploading to OneDrive and trying to edit the Notes online, the formatting was corrupted again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least I know how to 'fix' the issue outside of Microsoft PowerPoint Online, but there is still a bug that is messing with formatting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have heard from several people at my office that have encountered this issue, they just stopped using the online version of PowerPoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>

            It's PowerPoint Online that is <em>causing</em> this problem. Once you're finished editing and download it to your computer, edit the XML to fix the Notes Master. As long as you edit on your local hard disk, the Notes Master will stay the correct format.

<p>Hi Alexis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for sharing with us the presentation (I'm sorry I have to mask some parts in the URL because it contains your personal information). I can see the same behavior with the presentation you shared, and I also fixed it by the same process. Then I tried
 upload it to OneDrive again, but this time the style didn't change, as @John suggested, it's unpredictable.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you also mentioned that after you uploaded it to OneDrive again, the same issue reappeared, and this looks not so unpredictable. May I ask if it happens to all of your presentations with notes? If so, this may be related to something in your environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>

    <title>Windows Media Player in WM6.1 saves playlists incorrectly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Media Player in WM6.1 saves playlists incorrectly</h2>
                    I have an HP iPAQ 912c Business Messenger which is powered by Windows Mobile 6.1<br />
<br />
I have a problem with this windows mobile's Windows Media player. This problem didn't exist in my other Pocket PC running Windows Mobile 2003.<br />
<br />
When I make a playlist, at the time I saved it, it seems that the playlist is OK, but when I load the playlist, not all of the paths saved correctly. Sometimes, only one song's path which is saved correctly (all other files show an exclamation mark on the left
 side of the file/music name. When I tried to re-add the files from within WMP, and saved it, the problem reoccurs with random incorrect files.<br />
<br />
The musics files are stored in "Musics" folder inside the storage card, so the path is "\Storage Card\Musics\" and the playlist files are located in "\Storage Card\Playlists" (WMP default)<br />
<br />
So, I tried to open the playlist files using the pocket word.<br />
The correct and playable files shows like this:<br />
<br />
&lt;Entry&gt;<br />
&lt;Title&gt;Music Name&lt;/Title&gt;<br />
&lt;Ref href = "\Storage Card\<b>Musics</b>\Subfolder1\Music1.mp3"/&gt;<br />
&lt;/Entry&gt;<br />
<br />
So, In this case, the files are defined correctly, which is relative to the <b>Musics</b> folder<br />
Interestingly, the unplayable files looks like this<br />
<br />
&lt;Entry&gt;<br />
&lt;Title&gt;Music Name&lt;/Title&gt;<br />
&lt;Ref href = "\Storage Card\<b>Playlists</b>\<b>Musics</b>\Subfolder1\Music2.mp3"/&gt;<br />
&lt;/Entry&gt;<br />
<br />
So, in the second case, the files are defined relative to the <b>Playlist</b> folder.<br />
<br />
How do I solve this problem, beacuse if it continues like this, I have to edit the .asx files using Word Mobile or similar app after each time inputting playlist entries to be able to play the playlist completely.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward of the solution.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Joshia<br />

            Hmm... That sure is weird, eh? I think I will reply again next time I hard-reset my device, because the other programs are working properly as of now.<br />
After hard-reset I can figure out whether it is just an error of the current system, or the error is already present on the device in the first place.<br />
<br />
Thanks, Mr. Jack, for your attention. See you later.

    <title>Windows insider 18290 Server looks issues - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows insider 18290 Server looks issues</h2>
                    I use the Dark mode option for windows, as i find them easier to look at and doesn't kill your eyes when you need to work late at night.(Not a fan of night mode) The problem i'm experiencing is that when you go to a server through either File explorer
 or Run, the text stays black and doesn't switch to white like every other File explorer windows. I'll probably have to live with this till the release in the next month or so but its something that should be fixed in the Public release.&nbsp;

<p>-Sorry if the wording was messed up. I'm using the Desktop OS not the server OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-No i haven't done another update as 18290 is the only OS i have access to from the insider site currently.</p>
<p>-The environment that this is being tested in is as a end user not an admin. I have to navigating to the server through the \\Servername process.</p>

<p>
