    <title>Roll Up Microsoft Project - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Roll Up Microsoft Project</h2>
                    <p>Hi There, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the roll up setting for my subtasks, so when I collapse the main task all the relevant information in relation to the sub tasks is shown within the gantt chart. For example it shows two bars, one tender design and another Design. However, when
 I expand the main task the gantt chart keeps all the sub task information and bars, and does not collapse to a single bar e.g&nbsp;displaying&nbsp;the name and cost of the project. ( When I do expand the main task I can see the main bar behind the sub task bars.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it is possible to expand the main task so it shows different information to what it does when I collapse the main task. I am assuming it is a setting I need to adjust?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to a response </p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards </p>
<p>

</p><p>Hi Rena, </p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see&nbsp;from the top two pictures, when I collapse my main task there are a few&nbsp;bars which represent each individual sub tasks. When I then expand this it goes into one bar displaying the total duration and main task name. On the lower two pictures
 this does not occur and I am not to sure why ? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look forward to your response </p>
<p>

<p>Luke,</p>
<p>Task bar rollup is controlled by a couple different things. First, there is the Rollup and the Hide Bar fields which you can add to the Gantt Chart view. Second, there are the Bar Styles criteria found under Format &gt; Bar Styles group &gt; Format icon &gt; Bar
 Styles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two fields mentioned control what subtask bars are rolled up and display at summary level. The criteria and order in the bar styles list determines how the bar will look on the display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know exactly what you may have set for each of the above items but I suggest you carefully review each item between the two files and pick the setting configuration that meets your needs. Note, bar styles are unique to a view so if the bar styles
 are changed for the default Gantt Chart view, those same changes will not carry over to a separate Gantt Chart view that you may have customized, and of course the formatting applied to the Gantt Chart of one file will not apply to the Gantt Chart view in
 another file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>

<p>Luke,</p>
<p>Looking at your screen shots again, it looks like both scenarios are the same, not different. The reason you see the spaced subtask bars at summary level in the first case is because the subtasks are separated by a lag so that separation shows at summary
 level. In the second case the subtask bars are direct finish-to-start with no lag, so when rolled up it looks like a continuous bar at summary level but in fact the rolled up subtask bars are all "chained" together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

<h2>            Power View in Excel 2013 full screen mode</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm looking for a similar view that the Power View in Sharepoint provides. </p>
<p>(A black background and non-editable charts).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to know if it's possible to use this same Full Screen mode in Excel 2013 while running Power View reports.</p>
<p>I can auto-hide Ribbon tabs and such but it still shows the edit mode for my charts when I'm clicking on the charts.</p>

    <title>Trying to repair office 2003 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Trying to repair office 2003 </h2>
                    Trying to repair office 2003 installation (having outlook issues) but get error message "the installation source for this product is not available. Verify the source exists and you can access it." Doesn't seem to care if I put the CD in the drive. This
 is an upgrade from office 2000. I don't recall having this problem in the past. Has anyone else run into this and found a solution? thanks.

<p>Does it say ‘upgrade’ on top of the CD?</p>
<p>It seems that the Office installation is corrupted. You have to completely remove and reinstall Office 2003 from the CD.</p>
<p>Refer the link to remove Office 2003 from the computer:-</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301</a></p>
<p>Note: remember that you should have a qualifying product to install an upgrade version of Office 2003.</p>

<p>I still think that BuildFeed is likely correct to consider all recent <strong>
rs_prerelease</strong> lab builds as "RS3". Until engineers check in some RS4 code and the build number takes a significant jump, to signify this event, there may not yet be any RS4 code in the Canary rs_prerelease builds to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">As the original announcement stated, "Since this fork just occurred, the builds from the RS_PRERELEASE and RS3_RELEASE branches will be virtually identical. But
</p><p class="contentStandard">This does not imply that anything new added in the "forked" rs_prerelease lab will migrate into the rs3_release lab, nor will it end up in the RS3 Fall Creators Update.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">If BuildFeed is correct, there is simply not yet any new RS4 code in these recent rs_prerelease Canary and Insider builds.</p>

<p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your comments seem very likely to me. The actual difference in installed bits, well, It could a little as a different registry value and the watermark text. I suspect there is a bit more to it, but not that much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it makes sense, until the Fall build is slotted/locked into it's next, nearer release, state, all efforts should be to get it to that state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Stephen</p>

            Naw.&nbsp; The builds are marked rs_prerelease which can only be RS4.&nbsp; Anyway, they have the Current Release box wrong too.&nbsp; It is still 16053.&nbsp; They are messed up.

<p>RS3_release is RS3 (redstone 3) &amp; RS_prerelease is RS4 (redstone 4). <br />
The source code was the same when they forked it but it became two separate branches<br />
which will only meet again with the Fall Creators final build.<br />
<br />
The Buildfeed site is wrong in showing RS4 builds under Redstone 3 headings</p>
<p>and most likely could not be bothered to update the site to display the correct
</p>
<p>RS3 &amp; RS4 builds because in September with "Skip" builds gone it should (with luck)
</p>
<p>display the correct builds again.</p>

<h2>            Aiptek Pocket DV 5100M drivers</h2>
                    <p>I have a Aiptex Pocket DV 5100M video camera. &nbsp;It worked great for Win XP as a web cam, or inexpensive vacation camera in areas where I didn't want to take my more expensive equipment. &nbsp;I would like to use this on my Win 8.1 and Win 10 systems, but can't
 find device drivers (ones without malware anyway).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried installing the software that came with the system, but some of the drivers were "not compatible" and the camera was not recognized as a video device (it was recognized as a microphone though).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know of any device driver that would let me continue to use this equipment?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Kdatech Kyocera,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To get the members of a Dynamic distribution group, we need to use PowerShell. Here are the steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1. </span><span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect to Exchange Online Using Remote PowerShell</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Run the two commands in this article:
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb232019(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb232019(v=exchg.160).aspx</a></span></p>
<p><span>Here is the screenshot of my test result:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/511ee823-613c-4242-afb7-212bc2c27196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/511ee823-613c-4242-afb7-212bc2c27196" /></a></p>
<p><span>Please replace “Shanghai” and “ddg” with your actual filter and the name of the Dynamic distribution group.</span></p>
<p><span>After you get the names of the members, please go to Outlook Web App (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/owa</a>) – People – Directory and add the members to
 your Contacts list.</span></p>
<p><span>If I have misunderstood anything, please tell us your detailed requirements about “I want to add to it the people in the Contacts”, we will do further analysis for you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

</p><p>"((RecipientTypeDetails -eq 'UserMailbox') -and (-not(Name -like 'SystemMailbox{*')) -and (-not(Name -like 'CAS_{*')) -and (-not(RecipientTypeDetailsValue -eq 'MailboxPlan')) -and (-not(RecipientTypeDetailsValue -eq 'DiscoveryMailbox')) -and (-not(RecipientTypeDetailsValue
 -eq 'PublicFolderMailbox')) -and (-not(RecipientTypeDetailsValue -eq 'ArbitrationMailbox')) -and (-not(RecipientTypeDetailsValue -eq 'AuditLogMailbox')))"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so how do I modify the Recipient filter?</p>

            <p>Hi Kdatech Kyocera,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the recipient filter in EAC shows “<em>This dynamic distribution group was created by using the Exchange Management Shell. Use the Shell to change the filter</em>”, you need to set a new filter in PowerShell with the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect to Exchange Online Using Remote PowerShell.</a></li><li>Set a new filter:</li></ol>
<p style="text-align: left"><span>Get-DynamicDistributionGroup
<strong>Group name</strong> | Set-DynamicDistributionGroup -recipientfilter {<strong>filter</strong>}</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Replace
<strong>{filter}</strong> with your <strong>{new filter}</strong>, and replace <strong>
Group name</strong> with your <strong>group</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.Check the filter:
<p>Get-DynamicDistributionGroup <strong>Group name</strong> | fl recipientfilter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Hans</p>

                    <p>I have shared a users email account via the Mailbox permissions on Office 365 Admin centre, but the mailbox dosent appear in the users Outlook, I then tried to add the mail box manually via FILE - ACCOUNT SETTINGS - ACCOUNT SETTINGS - highlight the users
 mailbox and click CHANGE - MORE SETTINGS - ADVANCED tab - Here I added the shared mailbox without any issue, but then when I try to open the mailbox by clicking on the shared mailbox name it displays the following message "the name cannot be matched to a name

<p>Does anyone have any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi Mark Admin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your description, I understand that when you add a shared users account which you have full access permission to your Outlook client and then you get an error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, please try to go to <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Web App</a>&nbsp;(OWA) and check if you can open the shared user mailbox via <strong>
Open another mailbox</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d67efb1b-eef6-4c15-9e8b-aca4a3bfd5c5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d67efb1b-eef6-4c15-9e8b-aca4a3bfd5c5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can access the mailbox via OWA, please check if you can add the account to another client who also have full access permission of the shared user mailbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, as an administrator, you can go to&nbsp;<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Exchange admin center</a>&nbsp;&gt; recipients &gt; mailboxes &gt; double click the shared user mailbox &gt; check if the
<strong>Hide from address lists</strong>&nbsp;option is unselected:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/812fa407-b16b-4372-8fa2-53d676d97347?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/812fa407-b16b-4372-8fa2-53d676d97347?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>If the issue just happens to you, you can try to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/create-an-outlook-profile-f544c1ba-3352-4b3b-be0b-8d42a540459d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
create a new profile</a> to check the outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, I would like to confirm that if the shared user mailbox is an pure cloud mailbox? Or ever migrated from other server?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Iry</p>

<h2>            Thinking about Lumia 710, some questions I have first.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>This is my first post, so I hope it's in the right section.</p>
<p>As the subject line suggests, I am thinking about getting a Lumia 710, but just wanted to ask a few questions aboutreally it before I buy.</p>
<p>I should add that I am not tech-savvy, so a lot of the iOs/ android phrases make no sense to me, and the reason I am considering the 710 is purely because it is available on the cap plan I want, and so I'm just looking into it first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;have several questions, any answers I get are greatly appreciated and I hope this post isn't too long!&nbsp; Also, I'm updating from the Nokia 5800 XM, which after sooooo many faults and glitches, i really want to know I'm getting a phone that will work consistantly!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll also say too that I dont really intend on linking all my email and social networking accounts with my phone, I'm more interesting in txting, calls and the more basic phone functions, while having fun with some of the novelty of using all these apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After scanning the internet, reading many reviews and these forums these are my questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Do you have to link any email accounts to be able to sety up the phone - I am worried about data charges so would prefer not to use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I've read that the only keypad for txt is QWERTY, not alphanumeric, is there a reliable app that I can use to make it alphanumeric?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. If I add any apps/ updates, does this count as changing/ manipulating the device software therefore making the warranty void?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Has anyone had problems with the touch screen not responding, or acting differently to how you have used it - EG - my 5800, I would tap the backspace key once and it would sometimes hold it down and wipe the whole text message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Apparently the battery life isn't very good, as someone who is not likely going to be using email, internet or many ' live apps' (as in ones that automatically say ' the weather is now colder, etc' &nbsp;&nbsp;do you think it would still be an issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. People are saying you cant transfer photos via bluetooth - is there any other free way of sending pictures or would it need to be shared either as MMS or emails/ facebook, etc?&nbsp; Also can you receive files via bluetooth?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Do you neer&nbsp;to sync your phone to the computer to use the Microsoft word/ excell/ powerpoint function?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. What are people talking about when they refer to a ' cloud'&nbsp; - is that what the little square icons on the home menu are called?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.I read in another topic here that people were having trouble ending a call - is this something that has been resolved as a software/ update thing, or was this a batch of faulty phones?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. With thw voice recognition ability to txt and call when the phone screen is locked - does this mean that if my phone is on my desk in front of me and I say out loud ' I might call mum' -&nbsp; will my phone just hear ' call mum'&nbsp; and it start to ring?&nbsp; If
 so can this be disabled?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; If I were to use the email and social networking sites is this something that is safe in as much as I don't want to lose my phone and have my identity stolen.&nbsp; Is there a secure way to use these things, also if I update a status on my phone will that
 send like a foot print thing as to my location when I post it?&nbsp; I am very protective of my privacy but don't want to fear something that doesnt exist and would probably enjoy using these features if I knew they were secure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12. Does anyone have this phone and reccommend / not recommend it or are there any other thigns I should be aware of such as other faults or anything?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you to anyone who answers any questions, After the experience I have had with my last phone, the 5800XM that started out great and turned out to be a nightmare I am wanting to be VERY thorough this time before I commit to anything for another 2 years,
 though i may seem a bit extreme in what I want to know, I just really want to be sure and not fork out a lot of money to be unhappy with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know getting a phone that I have little intenention on using all the features - mostly the online ones may seem silly, but I am hoping to start studying again at the end of the year / start of next, and the use of windows word etc is something I am very
 interested in, I am just hesitant about using the internet with no virus software on the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you to anyone who responds, or even read this massively long post, all help is awesome!</p>
<p>Cheers!:smileyhappy:</p>

<p>Hi my frank suggestion is not to buy this phone....</p>
<p>I have been loyal nokia customer since 2001, but this time</p>
<p>I am repenting for buying this phone its been 40 days since, i have already given it for service 4 time n all 4 time came back with same problem, and these ppl are not even bothered to replace the phone after repeated request.</p>
<p>Support is really poor. &nbsp;</p>

<p>1. yes you do need to setup an email account, but you dont have to sync it all the time if you dont want to. You can set the sync to manual.</p>
<p>2. installing apps in no way means your warranty is void.</p>
<p>3. 5800 had a resistive touchscreen and hence that problem. You will have no such problems with this phone. The touch of this phone is awesome.</p>
<p>4. Some people have made battery life an issue but I easily make it last 2 days with moderate use and with light use i have made it last for 93 hours as well.</p>
<p>5. yes its true you cant transfer pictures using bluetooth.</p>
<p>6. no u absolutely dont need to sync it with a pc. You can create the files on the phone itself.</p>
<p>7. Cloud is like online storage, and since you are not very game on using gprs or 3G its not something that should matter to you.</p>
<p>8. call ending problem has been solved ages ago.</p>
<p>9. voice calling doesn't work unless you keep pressing the home key for long, so thats no problem either.</p>
<p>10. You can securely delete all the data from the phone in the event it gets lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think this solves most of your problems.&nbsp;I have been using this phone for three months now and apart from the call ending bug I had for sometime, I haven't had any other problems. Buying or not buying this phone is upto you but if you want something new
 definitely go for it.</p>

 of Symbian and Android.<br />
<br />
You don't seem keen on using data but in the absence of blue tooth file transfer there is no way of sending or receiving pictures without using data.<br />
<br />
If you want to personalise ringtones then you will have to find out how the cloud works and use it. (Actually one of the few features I like is skydrive which I prefer to Evernote or similar. )If you want to peronalise sms tones-forget it, can't be done.<br />
<br />
All your contacts will be stored in whichever e-mail account you associate with the phone-you will need at least 1 windows live account to save contacts to- you cannot save them only to the phone. I don't think there is any security issues here but I would
 prefer if I am saving information in the cloud that it's my decision, not my phone's.<br />
<br />
I suggest you read through these forums, there's plenty of enthusiasm and plenty of complaints, but I would emphasise if the 710 is anything like the 800 do not expect it to be Symbian with bells and whistles.<br />
<br />

<p>Superb phone, very fast and smooth to use, just bought my son one and he loves it and I've had the 800 for six months and it's been faultless. However if you have worries about data usage, stick to a feature phone, any modern smartphone is utterly and totally
 pointless without a data connection, whatever OS it is running, but if you want to dip your toe in the modern smartphone market, the 710 is fantastic and will give a great experience, but get the data situation sorted first, or stick with what you've got.</p>
<p>Good Luck</p>

<p>If you want to use Word, Excel, Powerpoint on your phone you can also get those apps in ios, Android and Symbian. If you use prepaid SIM, Lumia is not suitable for you as it does not support USSD codes which you need to use to get services from your network.
 You cannot use WP properly without a data connection for your PC and phone as some file tranfers will require making use of data. The Lumia 710 is priced the same as a mid-range Android. Compare properly before you buy.</p>

<p>First... Please do not try to uninstall Internet Explorer. If nothing else&nbsp;works, we will disable it, not uninstall it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next time this happens, open Task Manager from [Ctrl+Alt+Del] or from [Ctrl+Shift+Esc]</p>
<p>On the Processes tab look at Apps and Background Processes for a hint as to what's causing IE to open- another program checking for updates, a website name, anything.</p>

<h2>            Outlook marking emails as read when downloaded from server. I want it to stop</h2>
                    <p>I currently have my PC set up with Outlook and I have it set up via POP3. The problem is that I have my phone set up IMAP so that I can get the benefit of PUSH emails. When I check my email on my phone I see no new messages, when I actually open the folder
 there are plenty of new messages but they are already marked as read therefore not telling me I have new email. The reason seems to be that Outlook marks them as read on the server at the time of download . I would like to know how to change this. I want all
 my emails to go to both places but I want them to drop into my phone as unread as that is where I do most of my work. Thanks in advance for any help you can provide me.</p>

            <p>Hi Ma. Lau</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried this option too: "Mark items as read when the selection changes", but when my Gmail account (which is my backup for outlook) is fetching the new emails via POP3, it also mark them as read. So when I log into&nbsp; my outlook account all my emails are
 marked as read, even though I've never read it.</p>
<p>That was not happening before the update to outlook.com.</p>
Hotmail/Live was much much better and faster and smoother than outlook.com, I don't understand how Microsoft is screwing everything up after an major update.

<p>
</p><p>Yeah I have looked at Geoffrey's post, and all of my settings were already set correctly.&nbsp; Also it is not the reading pane, as I don't use it on outlook.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;And on my outlook 2010 its pop3, so the reading pane doesn't matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my part, nothing has changed.&nbsp; I use outlook 2010 on my pc as a Pop3 to connect to the server and download the messages.&nbsp; I have had it this way for years.&nbsp; I also use my android email app to&nbsp;see my email, which I assume is imapp or something similar
 to connect to the server.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, I have done it this way for years with no problems.&nbsp; The droid app is always in sync with he server.. so if something gets deleted or marked as read on the server, then it shows the same on the droid app, no problems there.&nbsp;
 About a week ago&nbsp;however I noticed that every time&nbsp;I looked at my phone it would show that&nbsp;I had no new emails.&nbsp; However they were there, but just marked as read.&nbsp; I logged into Outlook.com, and they were marked as read there as well.&nbsp; Yesterday&nbsp;I determined
 it was happening when my outlook 2010 was downloading the messages.&nbsp; so&nbsp;I tested it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two monitors set up on my pc, so&nbsp;I opened outlook.com on one monitor, and closed outlook 2010.&nbsp; I then used a different email address to email myself.&nbsp; The new email
 showed up on outlook.com and on my phone, and showed as unread new mail.&nbsp; I waited a bit, and the unread status never changed.&nbsp; Then on the other monitor,&nbsp;I opened outlook 2010 and&nbsp;the moment they downloaded&nbsp;I watched on the other screen and every message
 instantly changed from unread to read mail.&nbsp; I repeated this process a few times, and it happened every time.&nbsp; Again, nothing changed on my outlook 2010,&nbsp; and nothing changed on my phone app.&nbsp; The only thing that&nbsp;I know that did change was outlook.com changed
 to the new version or whatever it is of it.&nbsp; Because when I logged in,&nbsp;I had a popup telling me that my account was now upgraded to the new version.&nbsp; Which is odd, because cased on my web searching trying to figure this out it looks like this upgrade happened
 earlier this year, but mine didn't happen until recently.</p>

            <p>For what it's worth I am experiencing exactly the same issue since the Outlook.com update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My phone connects to 3 separate hotmail accounts via pop3 as I don't want changes on the phone to reflect whats going on in the inboxes of the accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the update to Outlook.com all emails downloaded to my phone via pop3 are marked as read. I have not changed settings on the phone or on my email accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't use anything with my hotmail accounts other than my phone (pop3) and the web interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is clearly a Microsoft bug.</p>

            Yeah, I already tried that.&nbsp; To be honest, it was 4 days of back and forth with two different people that spoke very little to no English.&nbsp; No matter how I tried to explain what was going on, they could never understand what&nbsp;I was telling them.&nbsp; That is
 the literal, truth, they had no clue what I was&nbsp;saying.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They would keep saying, so&nbsp;when ever you read an email on outlook on your computer, it marks it as read on your computer, so that is your reading pane settings.&nbsp; NO!&nbsp; That's not it at all, that&nbsp;is not&nbsp;what
 I am saying at all for the 700th time.&nbsp; I was nice with them, but it was a waste.&nbsp; They could speak ok English, but they couldn't comprehend most English words when spoken to them.&nbsp; I tried the chat support as well, and it was a complete waste of time. &nbsp; Finally
 at the end&nbsp; I gave up on Microsoft's support, it was a horrid experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; My only hope is this forum,&nbsp; hopefully someone

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The same fault was evident in all the VBA-capable MS Office 2007 applications that had been installed &amp; had previously operated correctly - Excel, Access, Outlook, Word &amp; PowerPoint.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I found a note that indicated that I had last opened the Tools, References entry a month ago.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There had been no Registry access error then or at any other time before today.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">No changes of any known significance had been made to the system during the period.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The computer was a Dell Inspiron 1545 running Windows 7 Home Premium x64 &amp; Office 2007.<span>&nbsp;

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The error message had suggested re-installing the host application.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Office Diagnostics found nothing wrong.<span>&nbsp; </span>Users in other threads [see section 3.3 below] reported that re-installing Office had had no effect i.e. the fault survived after re-installation.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It therefore seemed more likely to be a system fault and not an Office fault at all.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The fault happened in a Standard user account.<span>&nbsp;
</span>An existing Admin user account had no error.<span>&nbsp; </span>A new Standard user account &amp; a new Admin account both had the error.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I therefore dismissed any notion that the fault was a symptom of user profile corruption.</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>This all pointed to a Registry access fault as being a probable cause of the error i.e. the fault was exactly what the error message had said it was.<span>&nbsp;

 in 2004.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The fault was the same as that described in the article.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It explained the fault as a symptom of a lack of user access to the Registry key[s] concerned.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The article ascribed the cause of the fault to a specific application installation, an application that I did not have, but I decided that the article was nevertheless relevant because it identified the fault symptom precisely.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The MSKB article suggested checking for any dimmed Registry keys within HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib\{...} &amp; HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I looked at the Registry but found no such dimmed entries.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, I now think that I failed to appreciate the significance of my personal habits in regard to this step.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I always run RegEdit as Admin but I had already established that the Admin account did not exhibit any fault.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Had I opened RegEdit with only the permissions of one of the accounts inflicted by the fault then I might have been able to&nbsp;identify the faulty key straightaway &amp; could then have skipped straight to the recovery procedures at sections 4.1 (9), 4.2 &amp;
 4.3 step 9 below.&nbsp; I have incorporated appropriate checks in this procedure.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The article suggested using SysInternals RegMon as an alternative means of identifying the faulty Registry key[s].<span>&nbsp;
</span>Note that RegMon has since been replaced by ProcMon.<span>&nbsp; </span>Additionally, I subsequently discovered when using ProcMon that other details of the article’s recommended procedure are also out-of-date [the MSKB was nine years old when I found it
 so that’s fair enough].&nbsp; I took account of the necessary changes when developing this procedure.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Step 8<span>&nbsp; </span>Note that you will have to manually find &amp; select the Registry key identified in section 4.3’s Step 8 because the ProcMon utility used there is unable to
<em>Jump to…</em> entries in a System-controlled Registry Editor.<span>&nbsp; You will be referred back to this step to do this when relevant.&nbsp;
</span>To manually find &amp; select a Registry key identified by ProcMon:-</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>In ProcMon, with the appropriate entry still selected in the filtered results,</span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>right-click on that entry &amp; select <em>
Properties…</em> then look at the <em>Path</em> property.<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>Leave that dialog open as you will refer to it again in a moment.</span></span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>In the Registry Editor, select the key HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT &amp; click on the dropdown arrow to its left.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Note that the list of entries is alphabetical but it can be a bit confusing as some entries begin with full stops [for example, .386] whilst others have full stops in the middle [for example, Excel.Sheet].</span></span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>Scroll down to &amp; select <em>TypeLib</em> or
<em>CLSID</em> [as shown at the start of the ProcMon entry’s <em>Properties…</em>,
<em>Path</em></span><span> property],</span></span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>check that the Registry Editor Status bar at the bottom of its window or, for Windows 10 Ver 1703,&nbsp;its address bar at the top, confirms that you are in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID or HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib as intended [and
 have not been side-tracked into a sub-key such as HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Wow6432Node\CLSID\{…..}\Typelib].</span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>Back in ProcMon’s <em>Properties…</em>,
<em>Path</em> property select the whole of the key string in curly brackets [such as { 57A0E746-3863-4D20-A811-950C84F1DB9B}] and press Ctrl-c to copy it [it doesn’t really matter whether you include the curly brackets themselves or not].<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>You can now close that dialog since you will not need to refer to it again.</span></span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>Back in the Registry Editor, press Ctrl-F [or click the Edit menu’s Find entry], clear the checkboxes for Values &amp; Data [leaving just that for Keys], click in the
<em>Find what</em> entry box &amp; press Ctrl-v to paste in the key string &amp; then click
<em>Find next</em></span><span>.</span></span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>Double-check in the Registry status bar / address bar that you are where you think you are.&nbsp; Every letter, digit &amp; full stop in the address is significant.</span></span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>You have now manually selected the Registry key identified in section 4.3’s step 8 so you can now return to that stage of the procedure.</span></span></li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Doing this is called <em>merging </em>rather than <em>running </em>the <em>Reg

<h2>            Copying an A4 PDF into word as an A4 picture</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have printed A4 documents which i have scanned onto my computer as pdfs. The plan was to get these bound but the margins are not fit for purpose according to the printing company. My plan was then to copy the scanned pdfs to word and set the margins correctly.
 However when I copy from adobe to word the scans are not to A4 scale and if I pull them out to fit A4 they appear distorted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Clóideach</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />If you can, adjust your scanner to scan into A4 size and rescan.
<br />Perhaps have your scanner scan to images (.jpg) rather than pdf.
<br />Talk to the printing company.
<br />
<br />If you have Publisher, that may be a better fit for what you are trying to do. Word is not really a page-layout program and Publisher is.
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />Regards

            Find out exactly what margin settings the printing company wants and then make appropriate adjustments to your Word document and then save it as a pdf, rather than printing and scanning etc.

<h2>            Can&#39;t authorize payment method - please help</h2>
                    <p>So I've advertised with bing ads + this card before, but I stopped a few months ago. I realized I forgot my account passwords so i made a new one to get back into bing ads, but every time i put in my card details i get the message "we can't authorize the
 payment method. please make sure the information is correct, or use another payment method"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm 100% positive the information is correct, the card hasn't expired and is able to use online. so what is the reason for this message, something wrong with my account??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions are appreciated, thanks</p>

            <p>Good Morning Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would need to look specifically into you account and card to answer your question. In general we do get this message when the bank can not verify the name or address on the card - Some websites only use a&nbsp;partial information security check on cards, such
 as checking the card number, cvv, expiration and zip code&nbsp;- we do&nbsp; a full check - so the address, name on card and above information is all required to match information with the bank. Please do not paste any personal information in here, but call our support
 line - we might be able to look specifically at the card. The only other thing I can think of is if you used the same card on 5 accounts before. There is a limit on standard accounts of 5 accounts per card, if you are an agency perhaps we can assist in getting
 you a higher number. </p>

            By "condense" are you referring to the <strong>Condensed </strong>property in the
<strong>Font</strong> dialog, or do you mean that the font becomes a smaller size?

            This is pretty mysterious, but I'd start by checking the formatting of any field involved as well as the default font formatting in the document (for example, the formatting of the Normal style).

            Are you using table cells for your fields? In that case, the "Fit text" option in the Cell Options dialog box might be the culprit. That option should be deselected.

<h2>            Include webcam &#40;from presenting computer&#41; live-feed in pptx Presentation</h2>
                    Is there a possibility to include an additional webcam attached via usb on my presenter notebook to show details of a small object within a slide in my presentation?

<p>I don't know of any way to combine live video with a PPT presentation, but perhaps someone else knows of an add-in or other hardware/software that would enable this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One simple alternative would be to use your webcam's software to put the live video on screen and run your PPT presentation at the same time.&nbsp; Of course, only one thing would be visible at a time, but you could cycle back and forth between them as needed
 by pressing ALT+TAB.</p>
