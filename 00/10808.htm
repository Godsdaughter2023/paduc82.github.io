    <title>Converting power point to a video &#40;MOV or MP4&#41; with audio - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cjs2172  say:</h3>
<h2>            Converting power point to a video &#40;MOV or MP4&#41; with audio</h2>
                    <p>I've been trying to figure out how to convert a power point slide show (with audio) to a video (in any format that can be shared).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've followed some of the threads here and see that audio does not work in converting. Is this still the case and, if so, are there suggestions on what else to do since this power point with audio has already been created (over many days and much time)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Meeting Room - Calendar</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>We have recently started using O365 for our school's emails.</p>
<p>I am now looking at setting up the Calendar function, to enable us to book various rooms and resources across school.</p>
<p>We would need for multiple users to be able to update the calendar and have it visible to all users (I think I have worked out how to do this via adding a Calendar, but the events are just shown as 'Busy' without any of the details?).</p>
<p>There is no need for email confirmations to be used.</p>
<p>Can you please provide advice on how this can be set up?</p>
<p>Many thanks,&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>But i also get the crash when pasting code in the VBA windows or even as soon as i press compact repair on a database.&nbsp; Makes me think its not my coding but a patch for Office or Windows.&nbsp;&nbsp; To that end, i have uninstalled office and reinstalled (no patches)
 - still crashes randomly.&nbsp; Cant duplicate it reliably - it really seems random.&nbsp;

    <title>Inbox Rule to flag new items for follow up via Outlook.com on Office - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Inbox Rule to flag new items for follow up via Outlook.com on Office 365</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys, at work we are using Office 365. We each have Outlook on our machines where we can set "client-side" rules including "flag for follow-up". However, on shared mailboxes we have to set all rules "server-side" using OWA otherwise they do not process
 on everyone's view of the shared account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In their infinite wisdom, Microsoft appear to have removed the ability to create a rule for "flag for follow up" in the web application, so there is now no way of enacting this rule server-side, so it's effectively impossible (unless you run Outlook on a
 computer for the shared account permanently).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone devised a solution to this or seen any update from Microsoft as to whether they are eventually removing the flag feature altogether? It's really annoying as it was a good feature for automatically highlighting emails of particular importance!</p>

<p><strong>Hello.</strong></p>
<p>I have a web-based email account, configered to work through Outlook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use Windows 7, MS O 2007, Trend Micro Security Pro, on my PC.</p>
<p>This has been no problem for many months. However one day ago, every time I send email to my Work email address, it come back to me as undelivered, and message:&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>554 5.6.0 Invalid content</span></p>
<p><span>If I send to any other domain but my work address, via Outlook, the mails are received no problem.</span></p>
<p><span>My work it department have not changed any spam/ junk settings. They can "see" my emails on server, but they are not going to recipient.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Strangely, if I close Outlook, and log directly onto my Web based email site, and send messages, they are received no problem!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I have tried the following "fixes":</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>system restore</span></li><li><span>registry repair</span></li><li><span>reload/ repair Outlook account</span></li><li><span>repair MS Office</span></li><li><span>check Anti Virus settings</span></li><li><span>Checked setting on outgoing mail on Outlook.</span></li></ol>

<p>Hello, thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>The bounce is saying Mailmarshall is blocking.</p>
<p>I have turned off my Firewall and Trend to see if any difference, and answer is No.</p>
<p>So if Mail Marshall is blocking, why suddenly, and also why only through emails I send through Outlook? and not through my Web login Account?</p>
<p>Sorry, I no expert, so just trying to see the logical solution to the problem by elimination.</p>
<p>How would IT Mail marshall "unblock" the pathway being created when I use outlook confugured email account?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Group by filter doesn&#39;t show in modern experience lists when the webpart is dropped onto the page.</h2>
                    <p>I have a very simple document library list that contains two custom columns. I want to group by one of those columns. The view works fine until that webpart is displayed onto a webpart page. After placing it onto the page, the correct view is selected (the
 view that contains the group by filter), but when it displays on the page it shows no groupings and simply displays all of the documents in the library. I have changed the view limits on the list to 200 but no luck. I saw this post but there was no way for
 me to reply to it:&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_sharepoint-mso_winother-mso_o365b/sharepoint-online-library-view-show-all-when-list/7b42a5a1-6ed0-4ec1-9a90-405a3148f765.</p>

<p>Hi Ryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thread mentioned in your post is related to an Service Impacted Event and was fixed
<span><span><span>at Friday, February 9, 2018 01:33:00 AM</span></span><span> UTC. As it is already 6 month since the issue was fixed. We could focus on this thread to investigate the issue separately.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To better understand the situation, I have sent you a <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">
private message</a> to collect some screenshots and info:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Capture a full screenshot for the library. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Capture a full screenshot for the web part in the page. </span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>3. URLs of the page, library and site. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Capture a screenshot for your setting of the web part to show the custom view.
</span></span></p>
<p>

<p>Hi Ryan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing with us the screenshots in the private message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the current situation is that the Document Preview web part doesn’t show the selected custom view after adding to a page, even when you manually switch the view in the web part, it just displays all items view.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If my short summary is correct, could you help us narrow down the issue with following tests? It may take you some time to perform these tests.
</p>
<p>1.Add a test library in this site. Create a simple custom group by view. Add this test library web part to the problematic page with the custom view selected. See if it displays properly view. If not, manually switch the view to see if it will change.
</p>
<p>2.Add a test modern page in this site. Add the problematic library web part and the new test web part to this new modern page with custom view.
</p>
<p>3.Add a test site, create a custom group by view in the library of this site. Add it to the home page of the site. See if it can display the selected custom group by view.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to know if the issue is related to a specific library/page/site or tenant level. We can investigate further with your test results.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Ryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your updates. So, the current situations are:</p>
<p>1. For the initial problematic document library and page. The web part doesn't show selected custom view (in web part settings) after clicking Save. Even when you manually switch the view in the web part. It doesn't change.
</p>
<p>2. For new test library in any pages, the web part display well after clicking Save. However, after clicking Publishing, it changes back to All items view.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my short summary is correct, please help us collect some trace logs for these two situations. I have sent you a
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your updates in the private message. If the issue could not be reproduced, we may not able to find the root cause for it from these two log files. We appreciate your effort. You may monitor the status of the document library preview web part.
 If it runs into the same issue again, you could capture another two log files. We can investigate further at that time.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When&nbsp;Microsoft, launched Outlook.com preview,&nbsp;Microsoft shared plans to eventually upgrade all Hotmail customers to Outlook.com. To help ensure a smooth transition, the upgrade will
 be gradual. Your upgrade is part of the process</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hotmail customers who were upgraded automatically to Outlook.com were notified in advance via email.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you were automatically upgraded to Outlook.com, the option to switch back to Hotmail isn't available.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To see if you have the option to switch back, check for the Switch back to Hotmail link in Outlook.com.

    <title>Why can&#39;t I start Outlook 2016 anymore&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marktiede  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I start Outlook 2016 anymore&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After the last Windows update, something got hosed.&nbsp; I started having trouble with the Photos app, then other store apps, then the store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that I can load these apps once (at most) after a reboot, but the next time they launch they just immediately close.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In an effort to try to fix that, I tried various things.&nbsp; I suspect I did something wrong with ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES permissions that screwed more things up.&nbsp; I tried reinstalling windows as a "repair" leaving files in place.&nbsp; Didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now, I was trying to load the Outlook 2016 program.&nbsp; I think it is not a store app and it loaded.&nbsp; But it was constantly prompting me for the passwords on the 3 accounts I use.&nbsp; So I got into the account management and created a new profile.&nbsp; Got all
 three set up and all seemed fine.&nbsp; Then I rebooted and when Outlook started it prompted for the passwords.&nbsp; Despite giving it the right password and telling it to remember it, it keeps prompting me.&nbsp; And now it won't even load outlook and says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Cannot start Microsoft Outlook. Cannot open the Outlook Window.&nbsp; The set of folders cannot be opened.&nbsp; The file "c:\users\[myuser]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook\[myaccount] -test.ost" cannot be accessed.&nbsp; You must connect to Microsoft Exchange at least
 once before you can use your Outlook data file (.ost)."</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Test" was the name of my profile.&nbsp; Of course, I DID access it at least once, when I set it up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made sure my user had complete access to that folder.&nbsp; Doesn't make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm GUESSING that the password is being stored someplace that it can't write to now.&nbsp; So it can't connect using the profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody got any hints?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice to know exactly what permissions are required in what folders for ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES or whatever other users are required for other folders in addition to the outlook folder.</p>

<p>Lovely, after doing that, I can't even configure a profile anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it tries to set up the account, I give it my live mail account.&nbsp; Then it, oddly, prompts for a password for my local machine and what looks like a local user.&nbsp; I give the password, it prompts another time or two the same way, and then gives up and says
 something went wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions?</p>

<p>Can't get back into outlook in order to get what it said back then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now what it is happening is, when I try to open outlook, it says, "Your Outlook data file cannot be configured.&nbsp; [name of file].ost" where [name of file is the user profile name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After pressing Ok on that dialog, then it says, "Cannot start Microsoft Outlook,&nbsp; Cannot open the Outlook window.&nbsp; The set of folders cannot be opened.&nbsp; The file [name of file}.ost cannot be accessed.&nbsp; You must connect to Microsoft Exchange at least once
 before you can use your Outlook data file (.ost)."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, I was in there at least once and even saw my mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that wherever Outlook wants to record its options/email accounts has somehow been corrupted or more likely made read only so that the information can't be written there.</p>

<p>This is becoming frustrating BEYOND belief.&nbsp; I've been doing programming since 1966.&nbsp; I've never seen anything so stupid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've made various combinations of attempts for about 50 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried things like deleting the&nbsp;C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook contents.&nbsp; I made sure my user had full permissions on the folder.&nbsp; I tried creating a prompting profile in control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I think I have an Office 365 account.&nbsp; Which works on the web without problem.&nbsp; So after reading various misleading information on the web, it is unclear to me if I should be creating an Office365, outlook.com, Microsoft exchange, or an Imap account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My user has an outlook.com in it.&nbsp; So it is confusing which one I should be trying.&nbsp; None of them work however.&nbsp; I did ONCE get it connected somehow and saw all the things I should see.&nbsp; And I added another imap account.&nbsp; I had everything the way I wanted
 it.&nbsp; Then I quit outlook and went back in to make sure it could be restarted ok.&nbsp; All was fine.&nbsp; Then I tried rebooting.&nbsp; Now it won't let me into outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried to start the whole process over again.&nbsp; But now I can't create an account for outlook or for my imap account.&nbsp; All that happens is I get error messages that don't help elucidate what the exact problem is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone just list the steps that need to be done because all the web pages I've read and been redirected to didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even the one that seemed pretty close and appeared to work said the mail server was eas.outlook.com and gave me an email that said I needed to redo the account set up.</p>

<p>So to eliminate the whole ambiguity in the Microsoft mail setup, I started fresh and created an imap profile with another mail service.&nbsp; I got it all setup and it was working as expected.&nbsp; Then I rebooted and now I'm back at the following error message when
 outlook 2016 starts:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Your Outlook data file cannot be configured.&nbsp; C:\users\[username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook\[useremail]-test.ost"</p>
<p>
</p><p>after pressing Ok, I get:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Cannot start Microsoft Outlook.&nbsp; Cannot open the Outlook window.&nbsp; The set of folders cannot be opened.&nbsp; The file&nbsp;<span>C:\users\[username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook\[useremail]-test.ost cannot be accessed.&nbsp; You must connect to Microsoft Exchange at
 least once before you can use your Outlook data file (.ost)."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So now what?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noticed that there are a LOT of files that seem to be hidden in that folder even though I told File Explorer to show hidden files.&nbsp; I can supply a search folder that shows a lot of Stream... files.&nbsp; What are those and could that be a problem?</p>

<p>I just tried loading the program with "run as administrator".&nbsp; THAT runs ok.&nbsp; So probably there is some sort of permission problem somewhere.&nbsp; What permissions might be required on what files, folders, or registry entries that might have gotten screwed</p>

<p>
</p><p>AFTER running as administrator, I can stop and start outlook many times and there is no problem, but then after a reboot, it appears broken again until I start it as administrator.</p>

<p>Based on the information that you have provided, there might be corruption with your Windows user profile after the installation of Windows update. 0x80070002 error code is more of a Windows update issue, which occurs when some files in Windows Update are
 missing, even if the download was successfully extracted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are also having issues with other Windows Store apps in addition to Outlook, we recommend to further isolate the issue by creating a new Windows user profile, then set up your email in Outlook. Kindly check if the issue still persist. Also, check
 if Windows Store apps will now open properly.</p>

    <title>Multiple work accounts, Microsoft merged and muddled incompatible - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pippinmichelli  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple work accounts, Microsoft merged and muddled incompatible accounts</h2>
                    <p>This is a "gig economy". I hear it often on the radio, said with such smug satisfaction. I am one of the 60% of the active workforce now forced to work in gigs. OK, so that means I have several "employers", each of which have industriously set up Microsoft
 Office 365 - which, like every other technical improvement actually makes things take hours longer ... but that's for another thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, so the first one went ok, with no issues other than gross inconvenience. The next one was different. I was given a new email address (which I have no capacity to receive messages on, nor do I wish for one, as I already have five email accounts which
 is more than enough). So I try to log on and cannot, because no matter how many times I give it the new email address as user name, it tells me that my other email address does not belong to this account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Partial fix - open in a new private window. Problem: in a private window I cannot save passwords, but ok I'll put a sticky on my machine and thumb my nose to the security freaks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that wasn't the end of it. Suddenly Microsoft informed me that my new Office 365 account (but not the older and still active one) would now be merged with my
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">personal</span> skype account. And then it spent for ever doing that and could not be stopped. In the process I had to set up new logins and passwords, with the knock on effect that .... I could no longer access my own
 computer because it insists I log in with my Microsoft password, of which I now apparently had two, no one, no not that one, the other one ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fought my way round that - and by the way, I AM trying to get work done! And then discovered ... that the other computers on my network could no longer see this one. Every one of them, and the printer, oh and the creative cloud that I am now forced to save
 to but I already had another creative cloud set up (so now what?), also had to be reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this the end of it ... I have no idea! Predictably, I'd say there will now be problems with other applications because I share them between four computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not a tecchy. But I'm pretty good for a non professional tech. But I cannot get work done. I don't know why I am being so calm about this. In fact, I am flaming mad and if I ever meet the arrogant idiots who took these decisions I feel it possible I
 will kick their teeth in. We hope I have more self control than that. I would like also to have control of my computer and and my accounts, and if I want to keep one anonymous (to avoid a stalker), and if I want to keep them all separate (I have multiple "gigs"),
 I expect to do those things. So ... is it even possible to unmerge my personal skype account with one of my gig professional accounts? And if so, how many new problems will that create?&nbsp;

            The simple truth is there are too many types of id, and id's involved in working with Msft products and services. The lengthy responses questions about signing in require are clear evidence of that. Msft's attempts to be "helpful" by storing credentials
 just worsens the chaos all these ids cause. You would think they would build all this with the "gig" economy in mind but they clearly don't listen to their customers and never have.

<p>Yes, it certainly seems that way, and I won't go into detail of the hours of rage and frustration caused by all this - and when I think of the
<em>millions</em> of people in the same boat I cannot understand why none of these companies have not sought to deal with the problem. It's not just Microsoft - I have the same trouble with Google's accounts (and don't try to visit someone else's Google account
 if you have one of your own), and Webroot (for which I now seem to have three accounts, each expiring at a different time, and incapable of being reconciled). Oh, and LinkedIn, which stole my addressbook despite great care to prevent this, and Facebook which
 has reset my privacy options times without number. And my banks - don't even get me started on those!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The poblem is that this is a business "ethic" for which none of them have been held to account. But it is a world of torment we are talking about here!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying!</p>

<p>Yes, you are right about the madness of the double identities and the lack of justification for it. But when you say they are the only tech giant that does this, I can't help thinking you don't bank with - I suppose I shouldn't say the name. Pity. They not
 only have different ids for telephone and internet, but a phone-sized reader for your card. And when you call for help and they ask for your id, they merely tell you it is wrong and therefore they cannot help you. And nine times out of ten, they do not explain
 that you actually have two ids and you were using the wrong one. But when they do ... and you call back because you now have it down ... they say, sorry you have used this system three times today and we cannot help you. Please call back tomorrow!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree, there is no justification for any of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But regarding Microsoft - I am still fighting my network that was working before I got made to change my password. I now have a computer that can
 and that they all belong to the same workgroup. I've set permissions and opened ports all day. Still no good. I need to get work done and I don't think Microsoft or any other tech-tool provider begins to get that. I gather they think we all want shiny new
 toys all the time and never mind the rest. Can't help wondering what planet they are living on.</p>

</p><p>It sounds like some of the automated processes have confused your network/pc as to your identity. Have you tried going to windows credentials and clearing out all stored credentials and rebooting?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes indeed they should, but I couldn't resist bringing in the bank as it is more of the same. My point is that this is a commerce-wide business "ethic" that doesn't bother to think, or doesn't care, or still thinks we are nuclear families with one earner
 with one job, one at home with children who don't have far too many school commitments, evenings and weekends off ... hello 1950s.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the suggestion. I can hardly bear the thought but I'll do it. It'll be the Geek Squad yet ... more time, more expense. When I find out what the problem was, I'll post it here.</p>

            Except for the inconvenience of having to sign in again, I've found removing stored credentials from the windows credentials vault to be "harmless".&nbsp; I'm not hopeful it will untangle the incorrect linking of accounts to apps, but it's a starting point.

<br />This a new feature and you need to connect to LinkedIn, it does not look like it can be removed, but it stays inactive until you will activate it. So if you do not want to use it, than do not.
<br />
<br />If you are unhappy with new option, all I can suggest is to submit your feedback to developers here <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.uservoice.com/</a> so they could make it possible.

            How did the LinkedIn &amp; Microsoft accounts become linked in the first place?&nbsp; I consider LinkedIn to be a malicious app. I very carefully did not tick on the LinkedIn page to allow access to my contact list (I was using Yahoo mail for it, not Outlook/Hotmail).
 Yet there were small indications it did so anyway! If you allow access to your contact list, LinkedIn will send out emails purporting to be from you. If that isn't a virus, I don't know what is.
<br />
When I tried to re-find in LinkedIn where one turns off access (to help friends who had not done this) I could no longer understand what to do.<br />
So I NEVER want LinkedIn connected to ANY of my email accounts. If there is something I should be doing in Windows10 to prevent it from attaching its insidious self, please tell me.

            Thank you for this. I will pass it on. <br />
However, it still leaves unexplained the comment in the first post: "I never gave permission for Linkedin to access my addressbook.&nbsp; I don't want personal contacts accessed. "&nbsp; And it leaves me still thinking that despite my carefully specifying in the&nbsp; LinkedIn
 site NO access to my contact list, that somehow it did get into my [yahoo] mail.
<br />
So&nbsp; our other questions are still unanswered. Is there any way LI could have gained access without our&nbsp; knowingly giving permission, AND, how on earth can they do this even if we say yes? Wouldn't LI need a mail password.
<br />
Anyway, a mystery for another day. <br />

                    <p>My email &nbsp;was recently hacked and sent out a bunch emails to recipients i did not recognized around midnight Saturday. I woke up to find my account had been suspended. I changed the password and verified the account and I thought that was the end of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now i had to send two emails out today and when i tried to do it through my phone, i was told the account was blocked from sending emails and i needed to contact Microsoft support. I did and they told me i could not send emails for 30 DAYS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is unrealistic and unacceptable!!! This is my main email account that i use for everything. How in the heck am I supposed to get by without my email for the next 30 days? I need to get a hold of my professor and doctor today. I am probably going to
 get an F on my assignment thanks to this BS. Microsoft supposedly knows my pain... Pffft!!! Using another email account will not work and it is not the solution. I need access to my main account today????</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>What should I know about the 30-day waiting period?</strong></p>
<p>Even when you choose to delete your out-of-date security info, MS don't fully remove it for 30 days.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also do this via a VLOOKUP().&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Enter FT, PT and CN in B50:B52.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Enter 15, 10 and 0 in C50:C52</p>
<p>3. In cell E2, enter =VlOOKUP(C2,$B$50:$C$52,2,0) and copy down</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C2 has the job status of the first employee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Sharepoint Online API Authentication and Token Issues</h2>
                    <p>When trying to use an API testing program like "Postman", which is what I am using, I am continuing to get errors that seem to indicate a token issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the directions I found in the link below, I created an registered an app in Azure AD, gave it "Have full control of all site collections" permissions to SharePoint Online, created a request in Postman using Oauth2.0, entered the trant type, auth url,
 callback url, access token url, client id, and client secret.&nbsp; Then clicked "Request Token", a token was returned, and I clicked use token, then clicked send, and received the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>{"error_description":"Exception of type 'Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens.AudienceUriValidationFailedException' was thrown."}</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/questions/236286/sharepoint-online-rest-api-authentication-in-postman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/questions/236286/sharepoint-online-rest-api-authentication-in-postman</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Somewhere in the directions in that link, it mentions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"</p>
<p>Click Request Token button. </p>
<p>At this point you should login with an admin user. </p>
<p>"</p>
<p>Is it possible when I click Request Token, at the point where it asks me to login, I ought to be using an admin user, and if so, what permissions ought this admin user have?</p>

<h2>            Non-English users still locked out in local hubs</h2>
                    Until build 14316 it was possible to switch between hubs and to send feedback and upvote in US feedback. It's no longer possible, as non-US users are locked in local hub, therefore their feedback is useless and pointless as devs will not able to read it.
