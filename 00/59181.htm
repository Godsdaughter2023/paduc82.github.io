<h2>            Xbox One Controller is using background functions</h2>
                    <p>I installed my new Xbox One controller and started to play fifa. Since i have an Xbox 360 controller i tried to do a&nbsp;multiplayer session. Both controllers seem to work but in game it sometimes does "auto double button pressing" or when i play some time a keyboard appears suddenly and minimizes the game. Also now both controls seems to be pressing buttons or windows in background or moving stuff. When i move my triggers it also moves the page when i am in browser or RT&nbsp;and LT seem to work as right and left clicks. I don't know what to do.</p><figure><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fimg-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net%3a443%2ftenant%2fxvi%2fentityid%2fRW2ohF.img" /></figure>

 </blockquote> <p>It happens with every game. Actually the problem seems to be that the controller is also working when there is no game running. It also messes up some things in Windows and the Keyboard box also appears when there is no game running.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the clarification anfelab!<br /><br />Can you also specify which version of Windows you're running? If you haven't already, be sure to try removing the controller from your drivers, restart your PC, and then reconnect the controller to see if there's any change with it's performance.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have tried these recommendations. No good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my summary. I have four computers on a wireless homegroup: 1) a windows 10 desktop 2) a windows 10 laptop 3) a Windows Vista Laptop 4) a Windows XP laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have successfully connected all computers wirelessly to the internet via a modem with excellent signal strength for all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a Home Workgroup with the name: WORKGROUP on all computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have enabled network sharing on each computer and set the Sharing and Permissions Properties for each folder I want to share on each computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>RESULT: The XP computer can see the the Windows 10 Desktop and Windows 10 Laptop from "My Network Places" and can access files. It can see the Vista Laptop and Windows 10 Desktop from "View Network Computers" but returns "You don't have permissions..." when
 trying to open the files. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The Vista Laptop can see itself on the network, but none of the other computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 Desktop can see itself and the Windows 10 Laptop and can open files and folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 Laptop can see itself and the Windows 10 desktop and open files and folders. Sometimes it can see the Vista Laptop but returns "You don't have permissions..." when trying to open the files.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Disabling Services often does not have a lasting performance boost and can also create some down<br />
the road issues which can be very difficult to solve. For more information on Service settings see
<br />
BlackViper's site.<br />
<br />

<a href="http://www.blackviper.com/WinVista/servicecfg.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.blackviper.com/WinVista/servicecfg.htm</a><br />
<br />
======================================================<br />
<br />
Be careful as a lot of these programs and services actually need to run and often removing a few<br />
does little to speed the machine while making the&nbsp;machine less friendly to use.<br />

To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right Click<br />
TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick
<br />
reference (if you have a little box on Lower Left - Show for All Users then check that).<br />
<br />
How to Check and Change the Startup Programs in Vista<br />
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/79612-startup-programs-enable-disable.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/79612-startup-programs-enable-disable.html</span></a><br />
<br />
A quick check to see which are loading is Method 2 there - using MSCONFIG then post a list of
<br />
those here.<br />
<br />
Method 1 using Windows Defender will tell you more specific information about each program.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is a little more complex though you might have a few services running you can do without.<br />
<br />
Also some programs add services which might not really need to be starting automatically.<br />
<br />
To see these compare those in Start - type in Search box -&gt; Services&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top Right Click on
<br />
it RUN AS ADMIN to those in the default of Vista as listed here by BlackViper. Ignore and that are
<br />
on Disabled (which do not run)&nbsp;or Manual (which run only on demand)&nbsp;- for any Automatic or
<br />
Automatic Delated Start you can post those in here if you need help deciding if you need to run
<br />
them. A few of those could be set to Stop and Manual so the calling program can run them as<br />
needed. <br />
<br />
BlackViper also makes some tweaks to the default windows services however I would not do those
<br />
unless you really understand the total significance of changing a default service. So use it as a tool
<br />
to compare.<br />

-------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Another thing that help performance is updated drivers - Vista loves updated drivers.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model
<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -
<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party
<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device
<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for
<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after
<br />
each installation. Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are<br />
installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed<br />
(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed
<br />
and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually<br />
by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then
<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

Readyboost can help, more RAM and ReadyBoost is even better and RAM is fairly cheap these days.<br />
<br />
The max readyboost drive supported in Vista is 4 GB - if you get a drive larger than 4 gig you can<br />
use the remainder for storage.<br />
<br />
You need a very fast drive and pay little attention to manufacturers claims they are ReadyBoost<br />
Ready as even some slow drives claim that.<br />
<br />
ReadyBoost does it make a difference<br />

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<div>
<p><span>A great many things influence the speed and performance and available space of your system - mostly the existence of
 various files and what's loaded on the system.&nbsp; There are ways to handle this in Vista (and you should follow all the suggestions) - and of course the amount and type of RAM and the speed of your processor and motherboard (but I'm just going to discuss software
 solutions here - you can go to your computer vendor/manufacturer for hardware solutions if any are available (I, for example, am maxed out at 2GB RAM by my motherboard and there is no better motherboard available for my model of laptop but if your system can
 handle it, Vista 32-bit can use up to 4GB of RAM and the 64-bit verion can use even more).</span></p>
<span>One very important thing to begin – do NOT use any Registry Cleaner or Registry Booster software no matter what it says (scans will tell you you have thousands
 of errors just to get you to download and install the program or worse, buy it) or where you got it (even safe sites sell these products but they are not worth the headaches they can cause).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Most do nothing of value and some can do great harm (to the point where you need to do a clean install to fix the problem – and that’s not even counting the fact that many such programs are actually malware in disguise).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Vista keeps the registry clean on its own quite well and doesn’t need any help.<br />
<br />
To improve your speed, do Disk Cleanup using: </span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html</span></span></a></span><span>.
 Delete as much as you feel comfortable doing – nothing deleted there will harm your system in any way.<br />
<br />
Also do an Optimization: </span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance</span></span></a></span><span>.
 Do all of the options.<br />
<br />
Go to Start / Search options and type in msconfig and enter and then double click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Go to the startup tab and uncheck any program that you don't need starting at startup.&nbsp; That will probably be the majority of items there -
 if not most of them (some are needed like the AV program and Windows Defender but most are there to make opening the source programs faster and make you think they're more efficient).&nbsp; This will free up a lot of RAM and help a lot in making your system faster
 (though perhaps not so much that you'll be able to notice the difference - but maybe depending on how much unnecessary stuff is loading at startup).<span>&nbsp;
</span>When I did this on my system I removed over 90% of the entries and suffered no ill effects – to the contrary, I noticed startup was quicker, reponse times when working were better and I could open more programs at the same time and still have no problems,
 and shutdown was also faster.<span>&nbsp; </span>Better still, download Autoruns<span>&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a> which is much superior to msconfig and click on the Everything tab and do what was suggested above.<br />
<br />
You can accomplish some of these tasks (and more that aren't entirely related) by using
</span><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;(which
 also searches for malware).&nbsp; I do this on a monthly basis just as a part of normal maintenance and I suggest you do the same (except for the registry cleaner – no not even Microsoft’s own product is entirely safe and the product has been removed from the paying
 marked for reasons unknown though it’s still available here for now but probably not for long).&nbsp; Make sure you select a full scan - it will take a few hours (mine can take around 5-6) but can work in the background so start it when it has enough time to complete.<br />
<br />
You also want to have good AV and AS programs on your system (so no malware is operating in the background draining resources).&nbsp; Windows Defender is a good AS program.&nbsp; The new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;is
 an excellent AV/AM program that has one of the least impacts on system performance and resources according to reliable sources and it does the job very well.&nbsp; If you're using MSE, you don't really need Defender (but you would with any other AV program).&nbsp; I
 would also suggest downloading </span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
 running it monthly to catch anything that MSE/Defender might miss.<br />
<br />
If you follow this advice and do it periodically (at least monthly) then I believe you will have as fast a machine as it is capable of going given the hardware.<br />
<br />
Good luck and I hope this helps.</span>

            <pre>Problem 1: Lack of free space.
Press Windows key + R
Type: C:\Windows\Logs\CBS
Hit Enter
Delete any log files found in that folder.
Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage
Under Storage sense, click Free up space now
Wait while it scans for temporary files.
Check any location with large amounts of space.
Click Remove files.
Also see how you can use TreeSize to find and free up space:
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/map-hardrive-usage-find-hidden-files-windows-10-treesize-freeware/
Search through any folders that might be on your desktop that might be taking up space. 
Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

<br />Or if you already have another account on that machine see if that account can save.

<h2>            windows 8 always needs to restart to finish installing updates</h2>
                    i got windows 8 pro about 2 months ago, and ever since, on the lock screen it ALWAYS says it needs &nbsp;to restart to install important updates. after they install, it won't say it needs to, but after a day or 2 it needs to restart. i noticed when it does
 give the notice to restart, my trackpad loses its gesture functionality.

            <p><span><span>Hi Marc,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome and thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </span>
</p>
<p><span><span>I understand that you are having a tough time working on the computer.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I will certainly help you to resolve the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This issue could occur due to corrupted Master Boot Record. A boot sector is a part of hard disk or any storage device which contains machine code. A Boot Sector loads the machine code stored in the storage device.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Master Boot record</strong> is a type of boot sector. Whenever a computer boots, the master Boot record executes.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The usual fix for this is to repair your BCD in Command Prompt by Booting from your Installer and choosing Repair My Computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Let us try to repair the Windows using the ISO file. </span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer to the following link to download Windows 10 ISO file and create installation media.</span></span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Once your media is ready follow the steps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Step 1</span></strong><span>: </span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>After you boot your computer using Windows 10 CD/ DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD". Press any key.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Select the correct time and Keyboard type. </span>
</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on Repair your computer in the lower left corner.</span></p>

</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on Advanced options in Troubleshoot screen.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on Automatic Repair from Advanced Options screen.</span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Windows 10 will look for problems on hard drive(s) and verify that all required files are intact.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong><span>: </span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Insert the Windows X DVD and restart your computer</span></span></li><li><span><span>Boot from the DVD.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Choose your language and click Next.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click Repair Your Computer and then select Command Prompt and try the following commands:<br />

bootrec /fixBoot<br />
bootrec /rebuildBCD</span></span></li><li><span>Restart the computer.</span><span>&nbsp; </span></li></ul>

            <p>Let me first thank you Abdul for your quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few years ago I upgraded my system (first generation i-7 920) with a SSD.</p>
<p>I than transferred my win 7 to the new disk&nbsp;by means of partioning software without moving programs and user data.</p>
<p>Because of the amount of user data and as a sort of backup, I did keep the old install and thus had a (not 100% legal I know) dual boot with two&nbsp;win 7.</p>
<p>The win 7 on SSD is the one I use and the one that was upgraded eventually to win 10 a few months ago.</p>
<p>Everything went fine until I upgraded the firmware for the motherboard.</p>
<p>The first time I booted win 10 started normally but mentioned that there were startup problem that had to be corrected. From than on i got the error while booting win 10 but could continue with win 7 (luckily).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to remedy as per your explanation but is keep getting the message that startup could not be repaired.</p>
<p>The resulting logfile reads as follows :</p>

            <p>Hello Marc,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>run bootrec commands in the command prompt from Windows recovery environment&nbsp;</strong>and check if it helps. Please follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Do one of the following, depending on whether you have installation media (such as a DVD or USB flash drive):</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you have installation media for Windows, start (or boot) your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to "<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>", do
 so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the "<strong>Install Windows</strong>" page, click "<strong>Repair your computer"</strong>
 to start the <strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you don’t have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the
<strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. In the <strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>, on the "<strong>Choose an op</strong>tion" screen, click "<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Click "<strong>Advanced options</strong>" and then click "<strong>command prompt</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>d. In the command prompt, type the following commands one by one and press Enter after each command.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>bootrec /fixmbr</strong><br />
<strong>bootrec /fixboot</strong><br />
<strong>bootrec /rebuildbcd</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may <strong>download the upgrade files, create an installation media and then upgrade to Windows 10.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer this article:<br />

            <p>Many thanks to Abdul and Ratandeep for their quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 4 days of research and trial and error, I finally got back into my win 10 installation.</p>
<p>Looks like after the firmware upgrade of the motherboard, the bootfiles the system uses were nor on my win 7 disk, neither on the win 10 ssd but on the 3 of my 4 disk which is used by Acronis for backup.</p>
<p>I went into recovery prompt mode and on this disk the bootrec /rebuildbcd command found my win 10 installation and added it to the bcd.
</p>
<p>I then made the bcd file on the ssd visible by attrib bcd -h -r -s and copied the correct bcd to the ssd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS&nbsp;One of my Original problems was that I could not boot from DVD. Although I was able to write the dvd, it would not recognize the drive while booting. Changing to another loose sata cable (other port) solved this problem ???</p>
<p>
</p><p>All in all, I am now a happy win 10 user again ! Thanks again guys&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I encountered this error earlier today after resetting my cmos while troubleshooting a ram issue. Bashed my head of the desk for a while, until I remembered about the time-stamp security in NTFS, checked my bios and spotted that I'd set the date 12/4/2016
 not 4/12/2016, corrected that and rebooted.. Voila problem solved, no iso, BCD or repairing needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>;tldr.. Reset bios without correctly setting time and date, Windows 10 presented 0xc0000428c error code, Adjusted bios clock to correct values, Issue resolved.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Cannot connect to the internet using a WI-FI router which is connected - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dragos-adrian calin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot connect to the internet using a WI-FI router which is connected through WISP mode to the main router &#40;Windows 7&#41;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
Here is my situation - I have 2 WI-FI routers at home; the first one, a D-Link DIR 600 is connected directly to the cable modem from my ISP and I can connect to its wireless network and the internet without any problems.<br />
The second WI-FI router is a EDIMAX BR-6228nS and it connects to the first router wirelessly, through WISP mode, and thus offers a much better WI-FI signal and implicitly a better connection to the internet in the other half of the apartment.<br />
<br />
The trouble is that, on my Windows 7 laptop, although I can connect to the second WI-FI network, I can't access the internet through it.
<br />
<br />
I have another laptop which runs on Windows XP SP 3 with which I can connect to the internet without any problems through the second WI-FI network - this tells me that the second router is set up correctly.<br />
<br />
Also, when my Windows 7 laptop is connected to the second WI-FI and I try to ping a host name, it resolves the IP address but does not get a reply:<br />
&gt;ping google.com<br />
<br />
Pinging google.com [173.194.70.139] with 32 bytes of data:<br />

<br />
Under these circumstances, what can be done so that I can access to the internet through my second WI-FI network on my Windows 7 (Professional) laptop?<br />

            I don't know too much about WISP mode, but from what I've seen you need to have the second router configured to use a different subnet than the first one.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Of course, that doesn't explain why XP works and Win 7 doesn't ...<br />
<br />
Perhaps this wiki might offer some useful information (even though you probably aren't using dd-wrt firmware) --&gt;

            The second router (LAN IP: 192.168.2.1) is configured to use a different subnet than the first one (LAN IP: 192.168.0.1).<br />
<br />
Regarding WISP, here is a short description from the EDIMAX BR-6228nS manual:<br />
<i>"WISP (Wireless ISP) is a connection method which establishes Internet connection by wireless network. In this mode, BR-6228nS_nC broadband router will act as a wireless client and connect to another wireless access point to establish Internet connection."<br />
<br />
</i>I am not using <i>dd-wrt firmware </i>on any of the routers.

<p><span>Hi RickWackernagel,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let me clarify on this
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The working voltage on both of these types of rechargeable batteries is 1.2 volts. Normal Alkaline batteries deliver 1.5 volts. Regardless of this voltage difference, they are interchangeable
 because of their different chemistries. Both NiMh and NiCd rechargeable batteries will power all the same devices that Alkaline batteries will, of the same size</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>rechargeable batteries are rated by the mAh (milliampere hours) they deliver. MAh represents the capacity of the battery, therefore, the higher the mAh rating, the longer the battery will
 last once it has been charged. For example, a rechargeable battery that is rated at 2000 mAh, will power your electronic device twice as long as battery that is rated 1000 mAh. That was simple!
</span></p>
<p><span>You will find that higher mAh rated batteries are usually more expensive but this doesn’t mean that higher rated mAh batteries are necessarily better batteries. It simple means they will
 just power your device for a longer period of <font><em>time</em> than lower rated ones.
</font></span></p>
<p><span>NiMH rechargeable batteries are a newer technology than NiCD rechargeables and have become the more popular choice these days. So go for NIMH battery..</span></p>

            <p>Alkaline batteries deliver 1.5 volts while NiCAD and NiMh only supply 1.2 volts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A device that is designed for Alkaline batteries (1.5 volts) will not&nbsp;operate as long if you use the rechargeable&nbsp; NiCAD&nbsp;or NiMh&nbsp; batteries. The chemistry difference does not matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way you can use&nbsp;either type of battery and get the same performance is if the device was designed to use either battery type.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000 requires AAA Alkaline batteries.</p>

            <p>Hi Bruce,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused. I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you, please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Are you trying to capture the&nbsp;images through camera app?</p>
<p>2. Does the image rotates even after its being captured?</p>
<p>3. Is there any setting in the camera settings to rotate the image?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I would suggest you to try updating the camera driver and check if it helps.</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + R</p>
<p>2. Type devmgmt.msc and press enter.</p>
<p>3. Locate the camera driver from the device manager and update the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result. </p>

<h2>            DBT_DEVNODES_CHANGED</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>my laptop suddenly started to repeatedly give me the sound of when a device gets plugged into it. With the plug and play monitor (pnpMon.zip) I found out that every four seconds DBT_DEVNODES_CHANGED happens.
</p>
<p>There is no update available, restarting doesn't help, it started suddenly out of nowhere without me downloading anything. Bluetooth isn't active either and obviously no cable, usb stick or whatever is plugged in. However I spilled a drink over my keyboard.
 Maybe that is what caused it but the sound started about half an hour later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or is something else at fault here and I can actually do something so that it stops?</p>
<p>(I hope I picked the right category etc.)</p>

<p>Thank you for these information and update. Basing on the results of the actions we performed on your computer, it could be possible that this might be more of a hardware or driver related issue but definitely not the spilled drink on the keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, after downloading of the <strong>Plug~N~Play Monitor program/driver</strong> for your computer, did it successfully installed? Because if it does, it could be possible that the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/315539/device-manager-does-not-display-devices-that-are-not-connected" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Device Manager is not recognizing the program/driver</a></strong> for it. You can perform the work
 around and do troubleshooting from the <strong>Device Manager</strong> as stated on the link.

</p>
<p>I could however not find the Plug an Play monitor. </p>
<p>Also I noticed that when I open the device manager, every few seconds all the devices disappear before just reappearing again. It also put me back to the top of my devices. Maybe those problems are somhow connected?</p>

<p>Thank you for keeping us posted. Basing on what you've observed upon performing the troubleshooting that I suggested, it could be possible that there might be some aspects with your hardware that needs to be checked. By design, the device manager would be
 detecting any hardware connected to your computer and is being translated to your computer which is interpreted by the drivers installed on your
<strong>Windows</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, since the detected devices by the device manager are being inconsistent, it could be possible that there might be some connections that needs to be checked to ensure that they are all intact before we can proceed
 with troubleshooting your software. At this point, I suggest to have your computer be checked first just to ensure that your laptop's hardware is intact. From connections within your laptop to the other parts. This is also to be able to check with
<strong>HP</strong> if the <strong>Plug~N~Play driver</strong> you're installing is associated or supported by your hardware as it could also be a possible conflict to the
<strong><a href="https://support.hp.com/ph-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-pavilion-14-ba000-x360-convertible-pc/15551162/model/17046800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">default drivers needed by your computer's hardware</a></strong> that you can check on their

<p>Good to hear that there are no problems detected by your <strong>HP Assistant</strong>. As I've mentioned previously, originally by using a VGA cable or an HDMI to connect a 2nd monitor, by nature computers specially laptops are designed to be 2nd monitor
 ready. Usually what it does it it'll be detecting the device for it just to be identified easily. So in the event that you'll be toggling external monitors (ex.: TV screen to external computer monitor back to TV screen) and cables used, the computer would
 be able to detect it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From this point, at most cases that you'll only needing a program/driver to display what's on your computer to an LED TV/external monitor is if it'll be needed to be casted or if it's connected to a network(eg.: Through WiFi connection) and there are some
 settings that needs to be configured on the TV/monitor itself. That being said, it would be best to contact the manufacturer of the monitor/TV your using if it's not detected and all drivers are installed, up-to-date and working to other monitors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your monitor or TV doesn't require any special program or driver for it to recognize your computer, then it would best to discard the .zip file for
<strong>Plug~N~Play</strong>. Mainly the list of drivers I've provided for you are the only list of firmware, drivers, and program that your manufacturer approved and required by the system. So if you're 2nd monitor didn't prompted it as well or confirmed by
 the manufacturer that it isn't from them or needed, then it would be best to have it discarded.</p>
<p>

<p>The problem is I don't have a second monitor attached and there is also none nearby.</p>
<p>On the device manager I can by the way not look for changed hardware or anything like that. It kind of resets me everytime I click on it. Installing new ones however worked.</p>
<p>I uninstalled the Plug and Play Monitor but nothing changed either.</p>

<p>If that would be the case, we can have this performed while on <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026206/windows-get-to-safe-mode-and-other-startup-settings-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe Mode</a></strong>. This
 way we'd be able to minimize other factors that could cause your computer to restart. Once your on
<strong>Safe Mode</strong>, you access your Device Manager and uninstall any monitors registered on it and leave the only one that's for your computer. To do that, kindly perform the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On your keyboard, press the <strong>Windows button + R</strong> to open the <strong>
Run</strong> box, type <em><strong>devmgmt.msc</strong></em> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>On the Device Manger, expand <strong>Monitors</strong>.</li><li>Locate the external monitors listed. <strong>Right-click </strong>on those entries and click
<strong>Uninstall</strong>.</li><li>If it prompts for the uninstall, make sure to put a tick on the checkbox to <strong>
Delete the driver software for this device</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After this restart your computer and check if these steps resolves your concern.</p>

<h3> blabelguitarman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does Enterprise Require A Subscription To Stay &#34;Genuine&#34; And Keep Receiving Updates And Support&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Long story short I bought a copy of Windows 7 Ultimate from a seller on eBay with a "valid" key.&nbsp; Turned out to be a subscription based developer key instead!&nbsp; After about 3 months of use windows went "not genuine" on me.&nbsp; The seller claims he was unaware
 and has offered to replace the disc and key with, again, "valid" Windows 7 Enterprise software instead.&nbsp; I understand Enterprise and Ultimate are just about twins.</p>
<p>Now, assuming that this new software and key really are genuine, this is my question:</p>
<p>If I am a home user, without any kind of subscriptions to volume liscensing or whatever, will the same thing happen again?&nbsp; Will&nbsp;the key&nbsp;work until a subscription I am unaware of runs out and then stop working again?&nbsp; With Enterprise, will I still recieve
 home user support?&nbsp; And will I continue to recieve automatic Windows Updates?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that is clear.&nbsp; A quick response is REALLY appreciated if possible because I am in the midst of this deal!&nbsp; Thank you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Okay, I called the Windows Genuine Advantage number and asked them to run the Enterprise key that this seller gave me (though I didn't ask for it).&nbsp; The guy on the phone told me that while it WAS a genuine, working key, since it is a volume license it is
 also therefore a subscription based license and needs to be renewed annually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, therefore, I have answered my own questions, and the answer for anybody else with this question is:</p>
<p>As a home user, if you use enterprise (legally), there will come a date when you will need to renew your license, or you will get the "not genuine" message, lose support and updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, many forums and 800 numbers later, I have the info I need to rightfully and knowledgably call the seller out on the bad deal.&nbsp; Please give that WGA hotline guy a bone, make him a moderator, and tell him I love him.</p>

<p>Here is the contents of the entire Enterprise License file.</p>
<p><strong>"MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS<br />
WINDOWS 7 ENTERPRISE<br />
Your use of this software is subject to the terms and conditions of your volume license agreement.&nbsp; You may not use this software if you are not a volume license customer or if you have not acquired a license for the software under your volume license agreement.<br />
EULAID:Win7_RM.0_E_VL_en-us"</strong></p>
<p>Thats it, the entire content of the license, pretty simple compaired to the 5,000 plus words in a retail license.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the person at Microsoft did not provide the full info as I would expect there may be some variation from one corprations Volume License agreement and another companies agreement with Microsoft.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Chatpad Sound Issues</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My Xbox One Chatpad microphone plugin has stopped working. The firmware is updated Version 1.1.7033.0 Manufacturer Microsoft. Plugging my headset directly into the controller and sound works fine. This was purchased from Amazon on January 5th 2016.&nbsp;Everything
 else works fine on it. I do not want to spend&nbsp;$30.00 on a new one&nbsp;and the off brand&nbsp;pads do not have the two buttons for taking screen shots or clips (I use both). Any help would be welcomed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>If you are in the UK, the standard warranty is 1 year, and amazon are amazing with their no quibble replacements in my experience.
</p>
<p>You could also just check the port to see if a bit of fluff or something has gotten in there and is preventing contact with the plug.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 USB1 foot pedal controller - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sfgsea  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 USB1 foot pedal controller</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I purchased an Infinity usb1 foot pedal controller to use with transcription software (Express Scribe). The device installs but is in the unspecified section on the control panel. It does not recognise the manufacturer but does say it is working. It is setup
 up as a HID device. However my software does not see it connected. I have also tried it with Transcription Buddy with the same result.</p>
<p>I do not have a specific driver and can not find one online.</p>
<p>Any ideas.</p>
<p>

<p>1st check is your transcription software&nbsp;supports&nbsp;USB foot pedal controller, basically transcription software supports serial ports device [foot pedal controller].

            Thanks for that, but both transcription programs support USB 1 and 2.0. The Express Scribe program requires it to be the purchased version and I have this.

<h3> aubreyargenti  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 upgrade hanging at &#34;its taking longer than usual, but should be done soon&#34;</h2>
                    <p>so i started the upgrade this morning and it went by in a flash. mostly everything was done in minutes, but once it started working on the apps it got to the point as said in the title and has been there for hours. it doesnt seem like the harddrive flash
 is..well flashing and it seems to be frozen. i really have no way to tell. my computer had windows 7 ultimate, i have a main ssd hard drive which windows 7 u was installed on and the only thing i know about it is that its supposed to be fast, but it processes
 slowly and had 7gbs free before i began the update. i also have an external hard drive brand name corsair. i basically just wanted to know if ill mess things up by resetting my computer. if i cant reset it ill have no choice but to let the computer sit forever
 until it does something unless theres something else to be done?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you.</p>

<h2>            Screen orientation not working properly</h2>
                    I did a clean install of Windows 10 on my IBALL WQ149R tablet. Initially the screen rotation was not working. So I downloaded Kionix G-sensor driver&nbsp;and installed it. Now screen is rotating but orientation is shifted by 270 degrees(ie. when the orientation
 is supposed to be landscape it is in flipped portrait mode). Is there a way to calibrate the sensor. Pls help

<h2>            Delay from controller to tv,</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,<br />
&nbsp;I've just bought a new tv:<br />
55'' RCA<br />
LED<br />
120hz (Although when on it says 60hz)<br />
8ms response time</p>
<p>I purchased it thinking it be good for gaming,<br />
When i play Call of duty (mw3) i notice a delay from when i press a button. and when i try to aim with the right
<br />
joystick it skips the screen and its not a smooth movement, very annoying, if anyone could maybe help explain
<br />
why it does this or how to fix it please let me know.</p>
<p>I had it hooked up through HDMI cables and switched it to the componets cables, (Blue,Green,red) and there
<br />
was no difference.</p>

<p>Does your TV have some sort of game mode? If so, try to adjust the settings. The bigger the TV, the more input lag you generally have. Especially since you have a 8ms response time television.</p>

<p>Had a similar issue with a Philips LCD and MW2. That involved a voice sync setting on the tv. It was delaying the video to keep in sync with the audio. You may need to adjust a similar setting. I've also heard of similar problems with surround/home theatre
 systems. Are you using either of these? Is the Xbox connected directly to the tv or the theatre system? You may want to have the Xbox directly connected to the screen then take the tv output to a sound system. If the tv has an option to scale down to 60 Hz
 you may want to set that even though it says that is what it is running at.</p>

<p>Didnt see any setting the change the tv to 60hz.</p>

<h2>            Microphone sudenly not working right, might have something to do with the Realtek HD Audio</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using my microphone daily for work for some time now and I've had no problems. In fact, the audio quality was really good. However, something must have happened yesterday because now the quality is really really bad. The levels are low, my voice
 gets distorted, sometimes it doesn't even work at all. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've messed around with the levels and microphone boost and everything&nbsp;is the same as before. I used to have my mic&nbsp;set at about 94% without any boost and the quality&nbsp;was very good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I've managed to narrow down the issue to the Realtek HD audio thing, specifically the enhancements. I've got a few options in the effects section; Voice Recognition, Personal Call and&nbsp;Conference. I've tried all of these and while they all sound horribly
 bad, you can hear the difference between these options. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's only when I use the 'Disable all sound effects option' that I get some decent audio. The levels are normal but there's a lot of background noise and ultimately I'm not going to be able to use it like this for work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the Realtek website and I've downloaded their most recent HD Audio Manager. While this seems to be a newer version compared to the one I had before, the problem is still there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone dealt with this kind of thing before? Is there anything I can do? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if I could maybe replace the Realtek Audio Manager altogether. Maybe there are some alternatives out there that I'm not aware of.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot!</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I just&nbsp;plugged in an external USB audio interface that I have. I didn't do this before since I though there's no reason for it not to work perfectly, but I couldn't get decent levels out of it either. I used my phone as a microphone, since I didn't
 have any other option on hand, so this might not be the best test. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I did differently between Friday, when my mic was OK and Monday, when it stopped working was plug in an old USB game controller. That messed up my touch screen, in the sense that it wasn't accepting any input anymore. I just restarted my computer
 and everything was fine, but could it have messed up my audio also? There's no reason for that to happen...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A final note, while an update to Windows 8.1 might solve this issue, it's really not an option for me. I'm a Pro Tools user and from what I can tell, the 8.1 update would put an end to that.
</p>

</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I appreciate if you could answer few questions to narrow down to the issue.
</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>What is the make and model of the computer? </span></span></li><li><span><span>Is the issue specific when playing games? Are you able to use the
<strong>W,A,S,D</strong> keys while typing?</span></span></li><li><span><span>Did you make any changes to the keyboard layout?</span></span></li><li><span>This issue may arise due to driver conflicts or due to change in game settings.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>I suggest you to check if the keyboard supports gaming mode key, if it does, I suggest you to check if the option is turned on.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also check the game settings and game controllers and make sure that the controller keys are not changed.</span></p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I also suggest you to disable and enable the track pad and check if that helps. On most Acer devices, to disable or enable the
<em><strong><span>touchpad</span></strong></em> press and hold the <strong>Fn</strong> key down and press the
<strong>F6</strong> or <strong>F7</strong> key.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If the issue persists, I suggest you to download the latest drivers for the track pad and keyboard from the manufacturer website and check if that helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
