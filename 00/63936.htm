<h2>            Cannot communicate with Primary DNS Server&#40;192.168.0.1&#41;</h2>
                    For about a week and a half now my brother has not been able to access the internet. &nbsp;When we 'diagnose' the network connection it says the above message.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Various searches for that phrase bring up a lot of people with wireless issues on a laptop but this is a desktop with a 100 mb&nbsp;Ethernet&nbsp;connection, which has been &nbsp;working fine for&nbsp;the&nbsp;past 4 years.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>He is running Vista x64.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We managed to fix it briefly by uninstalling the drivers for the network card and rebooting, but now even that isn't working.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Ipconfig /all shows he still has the same IP address he's always had and the NIC has the same DNS server address that my fully-accessible machine has, 192.168.0.1.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have also tried the /flushdns, /release &amp; renew functions to no avail.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have also tried fully replacing the drivers with a fresh download from the Marvell site and still no joy.</div>

            I'm going to guess that you have McAfee installed? There was an issue with it recently. Try uninstalling/reinstalling.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Stalls in Middle of Loading - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peter stockley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Stalls in Middle of Loading</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;One or two weeks ago I took advantage of the free upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10. While using the computer (Laptop) the screen suddenly went dark (not black but a mid tone gray). I tried rebooting, I run a diagnostics check and all was well on my
 system, but it allways stalls when the windows logo appears in the middle of the screen and it says "Please Wait," then the screen goes dark.</p>
<p>&nbsp; On two occassions I was able to get to the "Reset Your Computer" window and tried keeping the files the first time and eliminating the files the sceond time but still it did not solve the problem and hung up at the same place.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I then decided to perform a reinstall of Windows 10 using a USB drive along with the Media Creation Tool. After changing the boot order from Diskette Drive to USB Drive, I perfomed the reinstall and everything worked fine, and then I shut down the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp; However, the next morning I booted up the computer again and went into System/Activation to try and re-activate Windows 10. I began checking updates thinking that might solve the activation problem and while installing updates, the computer went back to
 the same dark screen I was encountering the previous day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Windows 10 had a looping reboot problem on some computers but apparently this was solved with an update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; This problem has me puzzeled. Any ideas anyone?</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi Jenith,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for your help regarding my problem, however I still appear to be having the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Your answer did not clarify what my problem might be, but am I to understand that your suggestion that I refer to the thread regarding activation&nbsp;implies that the consequences of my computer going to the dark screen is what happens after a period of time
 when Windows is not activated? I looked on the internet for an answer to what happens when Windows is not activated, i.e. does it just stop working, perhaps the WiFi will keep stalling, will it lock up, or, does it go to the "Dark screen" as mine does? I could
 not find an answer to this question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Now, an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the process of trying to activate Windows 10, it again returned to the same dark screen. I reloaded Windows 10 and decided to call Microsoft support and ended up speaking to someone who took remore control of my computer to solve the problem of activation.
 (Note: During the session, my WiFi kept timing out every 4 to 5 minutes even though it still said I was connected. My easy fix while in session with Microsoft support was to disconnect then reconnect again and connection was re-established each time).&nbsp;The
 process of activation completed, everything seemed to be working fine, (that is for&nbsp;two days) intill it went back&nbsp;to the same dark screen again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I think at this point I can rule out "None Activation" as being a part of the problem. This problem may or may not be related to Windows 10, but all I know is that while previously using the computer,&nbsp;my wife&nbsp;never encountered&nbsp;a problem, and again, the
 diagnostic check reveals no problems&nbsp;with anything on the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Could this be a bug in Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Peter&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I bought a new computer and imported a number of files from my old computer. I went to open one in file explorer and it did not know how to open an xls file... the only option it gave me was Explorer, and then all my files were changed to default to explorer.
 I went into the setting to change the default app, but my Excel app is no showing up as a choice. I already own it. How do I get Excel to show up as a choice ?&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have Excel installed and it opens other spreadsheet files, xls or xlsx then it should open this file. (unless it is corrupted)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you sure the extension for the problem file is xls. What is you open Excel and then select File Open and navigate to the problem file. Does it open it then.?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Excel is correctly installed it should appear in the list of options to open spreadsheet files. Go to Apps and Features and look in the list of installed programs for excel (or office if you have the office suite) select it and then Advanced. There should
 be the option to Repair.</p>

            <p>The OG Xbox console supported Composite, S-Video and Component video. Any current TV that has any of those connections will work, though component is the most likely to find on current 4K sets. Ebay is about the only source for power cables and controllers. </p>

 </blockquote> <p>No that isn't true at all. The OG Xbox was a 480p 16:9 console and also supported games in 720p and 1080i with the component cables or RGB SCART cable. All launch titles for the Xbox supported 480p. In any case, 4K TVs today have a better scaler in them than you can buy as a stand alone device though I have kept my old DVDO scaler in case.</p>

            <p>You can purchase an original Xbox component cable from anywhere, this will give you the best connection but it all depends what connection are on your TV as a lot of them now don't&nbsp;have component/ scart or s-video</p>

    <title>Created 2 standard user accounts and now admin account is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eyeslikeaflame  say:</h3>
<h2>            Created 2 standard user accounts and now admin account is inaccessible.  How do I access my Administrator account&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have Vista Home Premium Edition.&nbsp; I had the administrator account and one called "daily", both of which were accessible in the welcome screen.&nbsp; I was habitually logging in to the admin account for my daily computer use, but realized this was a bad idea.&nbsp;
 I created a new&nbsp;account, made it an admin account and called it "administration".&nbsp;&nbsp;I then&nbsp;changed the administrator account I had been using thus far to a standard account and named it "daily", making it the account we'd log into for our daily use.&nbsp; Lastly,
 I created a new standard account called "secondary" for my husband to use.</p>
<p>Now, when I turn on the computer, the only accounts I'm able to log into in the welcome screen are "daily" and "secondary".&nbsp; I've been trying to find articles that would already answer my question, but many of the solutions I've seen either don't work or
 aren't fully relevant to my situation.&nbsp; I know the admin account exists, I just don't know how to log into it.&nbsp; How do I access my administrator account now?&nbsp; Things like system restore and cmd / "run as administrator" fail because I don't have admin privileges
 so I can't even begin to perform these tasks.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated!</p>

<p>Hi eyeslikeaflame,</p>
<p>Try the following steps and check the result.<br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong> Check in safe mode<br />
a. <strong>See </strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Start your computer in safe mode</a><br />
b. Check if admin user account is listed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>If there is no admin account, then restore the computer to an earlier time from Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE)<br />
a. Insert the Windows installation disc in the disc drive, and then start the computer.<br />
b. Press a key when you are prompted.<br />
c. Select a language, a time, a currency, a keyboard or an input method, and then click Next.<br />
d. Click Repair your computer.<br />
e. Click the operating system that you want to repair, and then click Next.<br />
f. In the System Recovery Options dialog box, click System Restore.<br />
g. Once system restore completes, check if admin user account is visible.</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />What I would do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by downloading and  installing Media Creation Tool from this link and then choose to Upgrade This PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If Version 1709 causes problems go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If problems persist you can also roll it back within 10 days at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery and block it using the Hide Updates tool or another method here to wait to see if it matures:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br /> But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to Clean Install doing a great install like the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<h2>            the cursed crusade problems...</h2>
                    
<p>i know its a cheap game, so im not expecting perfection, however, i believe theres a game breaking glitch that people should be aware of...</p>
<p>despite some obvious flaws, my main complaint is that it seems save files can become corrupt w/o&nbsp; warning, making the game freeze on a load screen, which equals death as far as ever playing that saved game again.</p>
<p>it happened to me specifically on chapter 4, misson 2.</p>
<p>ive experimented and found that it doesnt matter what storage&nbsp;device, or how many you use, the same thing will happen.</p>
<p>never had a problem on any other chapter, mission up to that point and none of my other games freeze, and i tried returning the game for a new one and the same thing happened. therefore this is why i believe theres a problem with the coding for the game
 or something to that effect.</p>
<p>soo i had to start a new game but now im afraid the same thing will happen again.</p>
<p>ive tried contacting atlus directly, pleading for them to look into the matter.thinking its probably something as simple as a patch that could potentially fix the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;starting to think these&nbsp;games that&nbsp;are developed on newer model xboxes, so they dont notice that there may be issues on older models before they release them.</p>
<p>please tell me im not the only person to notice this???</p>

<p>i appreciate an attempt at a solution. ive have since started a new game, and it appears it was just a bad save. thank you.

    <title>Control panel items freezing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steveinmesa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Control panel items freezing</h2>
                    I just had Windows 7 installed on a custom PC by Fry's electronics, and most things seem to be going smoothly except a couple things.&nbsp; Clicking on certain links/items in control panel such as subcategories like "change display settings" in Display will
 cause the window to freeze, although task manager says it is still running.&nbsp; When I click on change my mouse pointer in Personalization, it does the same thing, as well as numerous other areas.&nbsp; All other applications are running perfect, so I don't understand.&nbsp;
 Any suggestions?&nbsp; I really appreciate any help anyone could provide. :)

<p>Does it only freeze or lock up, or is there an error message? &nbsp;If there is no error, please give this a try to restore system files:</p>
<p>1 - Type <strong>cmd</strong>&nbsp;into your Start menu's search box, then press Ctrl-Shift-Enter. Provide administrator confirmation, then make sure the title of the Command Prompt that opens says<em>Administrator: Command Prompt</em>.</p>
<p>2 - Type <strong>sfc /scannow</strong>&nbsp;into the Command Prompt, then press Enter. &nbsp;This is the System File Checker, and it will make sure all your system files are not corrupted or invalid. &nbsp;It will restore any it can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After it is done, reboot and try again. &nbsp;Let us know the results.</p>

<p><span>Have you looked in Event Viewer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side of the window select Windows Logs and System.
 Place the cursor on System, right click and select Filter Current Log. Check the box before Error and click on OK and you see only Error reports. Click on the Date and Time Header to sort. You may need to click a second time to see the latest Report at the
 top. </span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. Click on the Copy button to place a copy on your Clipboard
 and close Event Viewer. Now start your message and paste into the body of the message. Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</span></p>

<p>Thank you so much for responding. It freezes only the control panel window, and the hand pointer when hovering over the window, yet allows you to do whatever in the background with other programs.</p>
<p>I did everything you said, and when command prompt opened, the title of the window read Administrator:C:\\Windows\system32\cmd.exe</p>
<p>When the scan was complete it had found no integrity violations.</p>
<p>When "Dissed" wrote that comment about them locking me out of changing things it made me wonder if the other things were connected with this.&nbsp; Why do I have to right-click on things and run them as admin when user accounts has me as the admin?&nbsp; I did some
 research and the only solution I found(which feels more like a band-aid) is to go into the properties of the program and check the 'run as admin' box in the compatibility tab.&nbsp; Then it<strong> still</strong> asks me if I want to run the programs after clicking
 on them.&nbsp; Also, every time I boot up it asks me if AVG and my network card can have access to the internet.&nbsp; AND in the bottom right tray, the only icon that does nothing when clicked is the Windows updates that are ready to be installed, lol.&nbsp; I've invested
 3k in this computer and this was the last thing I expected to be going on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Breaking news.&nbsp; 10 minutes later the mouse options pull up after clicking the 'change mouse pointers' in the personalization section of control panel.&nbsp; This computer has 12 gigs of RAM in it.&nbsp; Twilight Zone.&nbsp; Gah!</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>These are the only errors that would be chronologically consistent with the problem(at least during this session)... I'm not sure what to make of all of it.&nbsp; Thanks for the tip, I didn't know this existed!</p>

                    <p>Ok, so yes, no backup prior to upgrade to version 10, BIG mistake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how the heck do we get the files back. This is truely unacceptable for any upgrade process, especially for users that just push buttons.<br />
<br />
We can see the windows.old but can not access it at all for the my documents states Access Denied
<br />
<br />
We really need these files back so what are we to do</p>

<p>
</p><p>HP Envy Phoenix i7, 4Gig Ram, 2T HD</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update proceeded via windows update</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error message or the error is this: NO files located or found that are crucial to business and development of which I stated in the first post. This includes basically all files found in the My Documents folder.<br />
<br />
Second off, let's get something straight. I'm very well versed in software and hardware from a support nature with over 35 years spent in the IT industry and I will be very honest in saying this; the windows 10 upgrade missed a few points crucial to all users,
 especially those that have no clue as to what or how the operating system works and should not have touched any documents no matter what, whether they be photos, pdf or simply any user document on the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most users are just that, users and in this case the user happened to be my wife who we just bought a brand new high performance pc for her to simply work on her documents and files. From what I've read and seen, this is not the only instance of lost or
 scattered files. So the MS upgrade has me sleeping on the couch because she blames me.<br />
<br />
I set her Docs folder to save on another partition unassociated with her default drive, especially for her as this is not the first time she has lost files. So why the hell did this upgrade touch that partion or her files?<br />
<br />
That for me was something that should not have been converted or modified in any form as it was an OS upgrade only. For me, that upgrade was not ready and should not have been shoved down users throats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I won't even touch the upgrade. In fact my system is still on XP and it stays that way. But for my wife, I thought this would not be a big issue and that her files would be safe, I assumed wrongly and should have stopped it or did a physical backup which
 in one way it was done as it was on another drive but this upgrade screwed that up big time.<br />
<br />
Was this a ploy to drive more money in the MS machine because it's got the support lines buzzing, techs running and some heading for the hills!<br />
<br />
Iève got old clients contacting me for help and I refuse, 35 years of the bs was enough.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern on the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description it seems that you might have selected the option Keep nothing while upgrading to Windows 10. If accidently you or else have chosen that option then all of your previous data would have deleted from the system's memory. Sorry,
 to inform you that there is no way to get them back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you will roll back to previous Operating system then also there is very less chance that you will retrieve them. If you still want to get them back then you may use your favorite search engine to find out some application to recover these removed data.</p>
<p>

            Thank you Ambarish, after finally getting my Start menu working, and searching for hours for my files, I used your suggestion above and found them. &nbsp;Hopefully, tho I doubt it, I will not have any more problems. &nbsp;I have told everyone I can - DO NOT UPGRADE
 TO WINDOWS 10!&nbsp;

            Are you doing an in place upgrade from a previous version of Windows or a clean install?<br />
<br />
If possible, try rolling back the installation to that previous version of Windows and try the following:<br />
<br />
1. Disable any security software before attempting to upgrade<br />
2. Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications)<br />
3. Disconnect any external devices before installing.<br />
4. Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click 'Run as Administrator'<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User Account Control permission<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.<br />
<br />
Also run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor:<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/upgrade-advisor.aspx<br />
<br />
Your computer might have hardware or software that is incompatible with Windows 7. If you have this problem, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
Wait about 10 minutes to see if the installation continues. Watch the hard disk indicator (often a small light on your computer that blinks when your hard disk is running) to see if there is any activity. If your hard disk appears to be working, the installation
 should be in progress. If your hard disk does not appear to be working, go to step 2.<br />
<br />
Uninstall all antivirus software, and then restart your computer. Don't forget to enable antivirus software after you install Windows.<br />
<br />
If the installation fails again, there might be a hardware incompatibility problem. For more information, go online to the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor website.<br />
<br />
If you have compatible hardware and your computer still stops responding, disable any unnecessary hardware. Remove universal serial bus (USB) devices; remove or disable network adapters, sound cards, and serial cards; and then restart the installation.<br />
<br />
If the computer still stops responding during installation, contact your computer manufacturer or retailer.<br />
<br />
Installation might stop if the system cannot copy files. Here are some possible causes and solutions for this problem:<br />
<br />
Try cleaning your Windows installation disc. It might be scratched, smudged, or dirty. Clean the disc with a soft cloth, insert it in the CD or DVD drive, and then begin the Windows installation again. If your installation disc is damaged, you might need to
 replace it. For more information, go to How to replace Microsoft software or hardware, order service packs and product upgrades, and replace product manuals on the Microsoft website. (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/326246/en-gb)<br />
<br />
Make sure your CD or DVD drive is working properly. If it isn't, the disc might be vibrating too much for the laser to accurately read the data. For more information about this problem, consult your hardware documentation, or contact the CD or DVD drive manufacturer.<br />
<br />
If your computer has multiple CD or DVD drives, make sure your computer is trying to locate files on the correct drive. If your computer has a feature to disable CD or DVD drives that are not being used, disable the drives that you aren't using. Otherwise,
 try inserting the disc into a different drive, and then start the installation again.<br />
<br />
Check to see whether a virus is on your computer. Run an antivirus program to scan your system and identify needed repairs. Be sure to disable the antivirus program before beginning the installation again.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Minecraft Xbox One Edition&#58; Not offering &#36;4.99 deal</h2>
                    
<p>The game was purchased longer than I can remember but was only played on my old 360 which is now in my sons room.&nbsp; Its the disk version, and was never on wifi.&nbsp; I have connected it to the wifi and played it for a while under my account, but it still will
 not give me the $4.99 deal.</p>

<p>Not true...</p>
<p>*To qualify for the $4.99 USD upgrade offer, players must own the retail disc or digital version of Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition and connect to Xbox Live with their account. For more information, visit xbox.com/en-US/games/minecraft-xbox-one-edition</p>
<p>I have also exported a save to the Xbox One from the 360 as stated in their video, but it didn't flag me either.</p>

<p>The e-mail they are sending out says since you've played minecraft on 360 your eligible for Xbox one 4.99 offer. The price has a star.
</p>
<p>*Upgrade price of $4.99 is available for people who have played Minecraft: Xbox 360 with their Xbox Live account.</p>
<p>no where does it state you have to have bought the game on the account. As long as you own the game on your account, even by means of license transferring, which makes you owner of the game, it's in your account.
</p>
<p>I'm being told I have to have paid for it. No where, I repeat, no where does the offer state you had to have a paid version in your history or purchase history.</p>
<p>I got the game gifted via license transfer. I played it, it's on my account, I've paid for dlc.
</p>
<p>Microsoft is contradicting itself on its offer. The offer states one thing, the company says another thing. This is grounds for reporting to BBB for false advertising. I saved the e-mail, so I have proof.</p>

<p>I brought the game a month after it came out on Xbox 360 paid for the digital version off XBL marketplace. Got the Xbox 1 version Friday afternoon September 5 it had $24.95 crossed out and $7.45 NZ currency I would of been happy to pay $50 but since Mojang/4J
 has millions of peps who play the game, they don't need to charge so much. I'd get in touch with Xbox Support. Although Mojang/4J make the game, Microsoft authorizes it on Xbox since M manages Xbox. Don't go for this
</p>
<p>"licence transfer" stuff I mean who does that?! YOU and your profile have to have paid for the full version of the 360 version and if you got it digitally you should have no problems although if you have the disc version you should still get the discount.
 None of my friends who have the 360 version have had problems getting the discounted version.

<p>^^ &nbsp;Umm, there is no way that they would know it is the same disc. &nbsp; lol.</p>
<p>It seems that some people played the game on the 360 and immediately thought they'd get the discount. &nbsp;I think there has to be some kind of waiting period, like 24-48 hours after you've played the 360 version for the discount to kick in.</p>

<p>I would guess it has something to do with WHEN the game was played...otherwise I could just borrow my friends copy, play it for a minute, and get a discount. Probably a cut off date for older saves/when the game was purchased, to minimize people trying to
 "work" the system.</p>

<p>Cheesyhunter1, people actually do license transfers. Also again I present </p>
<p>*Upgrade price of $4.99 is available for people who have played Minecraft: Xbox 360 with their Xbox Live account.</p>
<p>That's the terms of which to get the price. Where does it state it needs to be present in payment history? No where once so ever.

<h2>            How do I play Rome total war on Windows 8</h2>
                    I used to absolutely adore this game and play it everyday when i was younger, now I would very much like to play it again , I bought the game on steam the other day but I could not play the game, because apparently the game requires a piece of software
 called Direct x 9 to run, it says its incompatible with my laptop when I try to download it or any of its newer versions of Direct X, also trying to use compatibility with older versions of windows leads to a 'catastrophic error'&lt; but I see people all over
 the internet who say they can still play the game on&nbsp; new windows 8 or 10 devices, But I don't understand how, is their any advice on how I might be able to play this game?

<h3> j ckaridis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Readyboost in Windows 8</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a Lenovo Tablet 2 (with Win 8 Pro) with 64GB flash drive. My problem is that the
<b><u>Readyboost</u></b> tab does not appear, neither during auto-play nor in properties of the removable device.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Yes, I have tried the following:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- Many different usb thumb drives, from 4bg to 32gb</div>
<div>- Since there is no Readyboost service, I have Re-started the <b>SuperFetch</b> service, and reset to&nbsp;<u>START - AUTOMATIC</u></div>
<div>- As an administrator, I have already run&nbsp;sfc /scannow</div>
<div>- In the Registry, "<span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\rdyboost</span>"
<u>does</u> exist</div>
<div>- Also in the Registry, "<span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\EMDMgmt</span>" has no sub values</div>
<div>- Re-installing, Re-freshing the tablet <b><u>IS NOT</u></b> an option!</div>
<div><u><br />
</u></div>
<div>I know I could simply create a page file on the thumb drives / SD cards, but I would like to have the
<b><u>Readyboost</u></b>&nbsp;tab appear, pure and simple.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please let me know.</div>
<div>Thanks for any help.</div>
<div>John</div>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Is the SuperFetch running? In Services it should show Running - Automatic.<br />
Something may be preventing it from Starting even though you have it<br />
set to START - Automatic.<br />
<br />
If&nbsp;the USB drives do not pass the speed test when they are plugged in then the<br />
ReadyBoost tab will not appear. Many cheap drives are not fast enough and <br />
that includes a lot that claim they are ReadyBoost compatible.<br />

<br />
Check with Lenovo Support, their on-line documentation and drivers,&nbsp;and ask in<br />
their forums about any known issues. Check for updates to the BIOS, chipset,<br />
and on-board drivers all of which can affect the USB system.<br />

<br />
========================================================<br />
<br />
This is a general performance troubleshooter however the same methods will help to<br />
see if there is something running causing issues with ReadyBoost. And you may need</p>
<p>to do a Refresh or even a Reset (even though you said it was not an option).<br />
<br />
Are you using a 3rd party antivirus/antispyware/security program? If so many of those<br />
can cause startup slow downs.<br />
<br />
Check with the System Maker Support (Motherboard Maker for custom systems), their<br />
on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known issues.<br />
Update the<strong> BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate
<br />
device drivers</strong> (all of those can have a definite impact on boot speed and performance).<br />
<br />
Note&nbsp;using <strong>Win Key + X</strong> and <strong>Win Key + W</strong> (to get to Control Panel, Run, and Settings
<br />
as needed). <strong>Win Key + D</strong> calls the desktop and the using <strong>
Win Key</strong> toggles Desktop and <br />
Start Screen.<br />
<br />
Check&nbsp;Startup Programs.<br />
<br />
Right Click in the lower&nbsp;left hand corner - Task Manager<br />
Or WinKEY + X - Task Manager<br />
Or Right Click the Taskbar - Task Manager<br />
<br />
Check the StartUp tab.<br />

<br />
If needed : (these are not normally needed to correct the above error however may be<br />
if there are other performance issues.)<br />
<br />
Try doing a "Refresh your PC without affecting your files"&nbsp;(or changing your personal<br />

Have redundant backups of files off of the&nbsp;main drive&nbsp;just in&nbsp;case.<br />

            Hey SL322,
<br />
<br />There was an issue with updating to 1803 (which most likely happened) where AVG/Avast would cause issues such as this, as indicated through here: Boot critical file C:\windows\system32\drivers\avgrvrt.sys is corrupt
<br />
<br />Read more here: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/windows-10-april-2018-update-may-boot-to-a-choose/8ff0d933-8819-4945-9f0c-17ac854400e2">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If you do not manage to get to a black screen with the Recycle Bin showing on the desktop, you may have to reinstall Windows (the only upside to this is that you will be able to keep every file, not apps, from your original installation).
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows by using the Media Creation Tool, here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />You will need a flash drive of 8 GB or larger in capacity, and another computer to perform this task on.
<br />
<br />Wishing you luck on this one, please let me know if there's anything else I could do.

            What would I have to do to get to the black screen with the Recycle bin showing on the desktop? I don't have any flash drives to reinstall windows with, however I still have the windows 10 instillation disk and there is an option to reset my PC on the
 menu. Should I try those first?

            SL322,
<br />
<br />You should endeavor on either of these options, yes. To keep your files when resetting, mention explicitly that you should keep your files. You can also keep your files using the Windows installation media by not formatting the drive you want to install Windows on.
<br />
<br />Good luck, let me know how it goes.

<p>Before resetting I tried using safe mode to see if it would make a difference. I still had the same error, however in srttrail.txt, there was a different file causing the problem. This one said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot critical file: C:\efi\microsoft\boot\resources\custom\bootres.dll is courrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case it means anything, I did look at some troubleshooting articles that told me to run a bunch of commands along the lines of bootrec /fixboot. The names seem to be quite similar and I'm worried I ran one of those commands incorrectly causing this to
 happen.</p>

<br />I've found a thread that could be helpful in your case (I'm not sure if you've seen this yet in your search): <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/after-reboot-of-windows-10-1804-update-pc-will-not/44f7dfae-0546-41ed-8b81-15132a1c625e">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />E for Excel's suggestion and arthart's responses go hand-in-hand in resolving this issue. I haven't had this issue personally so it'll be a little more difficult in finding a solution I know that works.
<br />
<br />Keep me posted.

            SL322,
<br />
<br />These things usually don't go well, I'm afraid that the most effective solution here would be to use your Windows 10 installation disk to reinstall Windows, given your failure to reset and System Restore points would be proven ineffective.
<br />
<br />Did you have AVG or Avast installed before the failure? I would suggest that either of them should be avoided in the future.
<br />
<br />Keep me posted.

<p><span><span>Hi ,</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Please let us know which game are you trying to load?</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Check if the game is compatible with Windows 7 or not:</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Default.aspx?type=Software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Default.aspx?type=Software</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Try to run the game in Vista compatibility mode and check.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Most programs written for Windows&nbsp;Vista also work in this version of Windows, but some older programs might run poorly or not at all. If
 a program written for an earlier version of Windows doesn't run correctly, you can try changing the compatibility settings for the program, either manually or by using the Program Compatibility troubleshooter.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the Program Compatibility troubleshooter by clicking the
<strong><span>Start</span></strong> button , and then clicking
<strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong>. In the search box, type
<strong><span>troubleshooter</span></strong>, and then click
<strong><span>Troubleshooting</span></strong>. Under
<strong><span>Programs</span></strong>, click
<strong><span>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</span></strong>.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the instructions in the troubleshooter.</span></span></p>

The product ID for the keyboard is (product ID removed).&nbsp; Can you tell me what pass code I need to enter?

<p>Hi moree007,</p>
<p><br />
A passkey (sometimes called a pass code) is a number that associates your computer with a Bluetooth enabled device. For security reasons, most Bluetooth enabled devices (with some exceptions, such as mice) require you to use a passkey. Using a passkey helps
 ensure that your computer is connecting to the device that you intended and not someone else's device that is nearby.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Using passkeys for Bluetooth enabled devices</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Using-passkeys-for-Bluetooth-enabled-devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Using-passkeys-for-Bluetooth-enabled-devices</a></p>
<p>Most devices let you choose your own passkey or you can use a passkey generated by Windows. To have Windows generate a passkey for you, run the Add Bluetooth Device Wizard; otherwise, contact the device manufacturer. Note that some devices use "0000" or
 "0001" as a passkey.</p>
<p>Try removing and then reinstalling the keyboard or mouse. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Do not use passkey</strong></p>
<p>First, connect a wired keyboard or mouse to your computer. Then, if you have Bluetooth wireless technology installed on your computer, follow these steps:</p>
<p><br />
1.&nbsp;Click the Start button, click Control Panel, click Hardware and Sound, and then click Bluetooth Devices.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Select the keyboard or mouse that's not working, and then click Remove.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Click Add, press the reset button on the bottom of the keyboard or mouse, select the My device is set up and ready to be found check box, and then click Next.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;If the device is not found, repeat the previous step. When the device is found, select it, and then click next.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;If you've tried this step repeatedly and your computer still cannot find the device, check to make sure the device has fresh batteries.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;If the device is a keyboard, exchange passkeys with the keyboard. If the device is a mouse, click “don’t use a passkey”. Follow the rest of the instructions in the wizard.</p>
