                    <p>In the past few days, I cannot see contact status, nor can I send IM on Windows 10 laptop</p>
<p>People can write to me, but they can’t read what I write</p>
<p>I notice that Windows 10, updated Skype to 12.</p>

    <title>Nokia 3710 - issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> _robb_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 3710 - issues</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my wife got a new phone (3710), her previous model was a 6131.</p>
<p>There&nbsp;are &nbsp;issues between differences in the systems:<br />
1) SMS - no possibility to categorize SMS's in folders<br />
2) SMS - no possibility to make/use template SMS<br />
3) Sound - old NOKIA sms signal missing.</p>
<p>4) Transfer between telephones (PC Suite) - this is little screwed up.</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Some old SMS's display information only about date/time instead of sender/receiver (which is able to see in the details)</p>
<p>&nbsp; - old SMS's have all lost there order. They should be organized by receive date, but they are all mixed up in random order.</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Contacts we think went through ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today she told that she has another issue.</p>
<p>After discharging the phone and recharging for the first time (12 hours) yesterday, today it is acting strange at her workplace.</p>
<p>A [3G] icon is appearing and disappearing, and now the phone is saying it is almost discharged again. We can't find out what the [3G] icon means.</p>
<p>After less then 20 hours of usage this is difficult to believe (although we did use the Bluetooth intensively for file transfer yesterday).</p>
<p>--- EDIT ---</p>
<p>Ok so after turning 3G off, it now say's that half here battery is left.</p>
<p>--------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because she is going on a business trip she'd love to switch back to her old phone.</p>
<p>But there is the next problem:</p>
<p>We cannot remove the back cover! It's stuck!</p>
<p>Pressing in different types of ways and places doesn't bring any effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We bought this phone mainly because it was so&nbsp;similar to the old phone.</p>
<p>But the software looks like a complete new rewrite instead of an inprovement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Can't help with other issues, but back removal I do know about. It's very difficult at first, although it gets easier. Put the phone down on a soft surface. Put two fingernails of one hand (you need the right length/strength!!) in the gap at the top and
 pull while pressing down as per the manual with the other hand. Merely pressing down and trying to slide doesn't work at first.</p>

<p>More issues (S40 (6th edition)&nbsp;):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><strong>5) Cannot set in SMS to use only english characters.</strong>
</font>This is a big issue because with local characters(Polish language) in the SMS it usually changes to double SMS which is extra cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6) Cannot multi-select SMS. Example: for mass deletion or other operations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7) Hang and restart after activation of tracking in map application</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>8) We have set the map application to make a request, when starting up, if it should startup a data connection. BUT when we choose NO a [E] (E in square) appears during startup/update of location.</font></p>
<p><font><br />
</font></p>
<p><font>Compared to: Series 40 3rd Edition, Feature Pack 1, <u>this is very disappointing.</u></font></p>

<p>More issues:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9) Cannot change the brightness of the screen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10) Cannot change &nbsp;the delay after which the screen goes dark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11) When using an application (from experience &nbsp;whith Maps application) there should be an option in the application to not make the screen blank during use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12) &nbsp;In the calendar: When setting a reminder (for example yearly special event) after setting a beginng date, it is still necessary to set on which date (day and month) it is to repeat - this should be an option, not mandatory. (This applies also to daily,
 weekly and monthly) It's annoying to have to set this extra settings, when what is needed is already set.</p>

<p>14) <strong>The "End call" (red button) stops reacting. </strong>Which means you can't switch off the phone, "quick" exit applications. End a call or any such thing.<br />
<br />
To fix this we had reset the phone by removing the the battery (since there was a problem with removing the back cover, this was a difficult task. But by using three hands, where one pushed the cover from the direction of the camera and the other two were situated
 according to instruction, it could be done. But our fingers were sore.)<br />
<br />
I'm told the button stopped reacting on earlier occasions without cause (during normal use).<br />
I think this time the button stopped working after we connected and disconnected the phone with the (NOKIA original) CA-101 cable.<br />
<br />
After disconnecting and trying to connect (multiple times) the cable again, the phone was not seen by computer. Only after restarting the phone was it possible to connect to the computer through PC Suite.<br />
<br />
15) The default equalizer settings are too high.<br />
To make the music and sounds, sound normal, the settings of the equalizer have to be brought all the way down - to minimum.<br />
With default settings (in the middle) the sound is overdriven.<br />
<br />

<p><strong>16) </strong>When the keypad is locked, the "end call" button cannot end the call. Same with the "recieve call" button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A phone can be locked during a conversation eg. having "lock phone" assigned to the "up" key, and then a conversation cannot be finished, unless you unlock the phone.&nbsp;Same with the "recieve call" button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>17)</strong> When wanting to begin a call by pressing the "recieve call" &nbsp;button, it has an unusual behaviour (coming from an older version) - it displays all missed, recieved and made calls. In previous versions S40 it was only
<em>made</em> calls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is annoying because usually very few persons are called, but many calls are recieved or missed, and they clutter up this list, which makes this button totally USELESS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To dial to a missed call, the caller is called from &nbsp;missed call which is displayed on screen. So missed calls shouldn't appear on this list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost always when a called is recieved, we don't need to call back the callee, this also clutters up the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There should be an option whereby the user can configure which calls the user wants in this list (recieved/missed/called).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>18)</strong> &nbsp;The screen is configured with <strong>very large</strong> fonts and symbols. Considering that this has a 240x320 screen, much more information can fit on this screen by making the symbols and fonts smaller. But smaller fonsts cannot
 be selected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Contacts</em> has an option to use smaller fonts <strong>BUT</strong> you cannot choose small since it shows an a message that small fonts are unavailable in contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In <em>Configuration Display settings</em>, there is also an option to select font size for the menu&nbsp;<strong>BUT</strong> this option is greyed out and only normal font is selected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>19)</strong> The phone has a quick switch to "Silent profile" option when "#" is pressed for a while.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a good option &nbsp;<strong>BUT </strong>when the "#" is pressed again instead of returning to previously used profile it returns to the "General profile".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should behave in the same way as setting "Timed" for a profile, which returns to previously used profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>20) </strong>Rolling the list up &amp; down behaves very strangely. Because the fonts are very large there is only &nbsp;4 entries usually on the screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When scrolling down - From the first entry (which is a the top of the screen) the selection moves 3 entries (to second last entry) then with each scroll down it moves all the entries up, but the selection spot is still in the same place.</p>
<p>Similar when scrolling up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience is terrible when you're scrolling down and have to scroll up some, then the selection moves up or down only one entry. This is confusing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This type of movement makes sense only when there are more visible entries (&gt;4) in the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>Minor Translation error in Polish version UI - </strong>&nbsp;When a recieved sms is read and you choose Options, in the english version it is
<em>Archive Msg. </em>In polish it is <em>From Archive.</em></p>

<p>I agree entirely with _Robb_ who started this thread - I used to have a 6131 too and relcutantly 'upgraded' to a 3710 in January - See my Exchange with Nokia below - they really don't want to know.&nbsp; I don't know what their interpretation of software testing
 or customer service is, but it 'aint the same as mine.</p>

 another Flip model out of stock (6600 Fold) -&nbsp; the Message Folders feature works, and she offered to 'doorstep exchange it for my 3710 as a gesture.&nbsp; I couldn't remember why I passed up on the 6600 Fold in the first place until I re-read the user-reviews -
 it is a lousy, unreliable phone.&nbsp; I called Ellie and said I&nbsp;hadn't wanted a replacement phone,&nbsp;I wanted some from of acknowledgement from Nokia&nbsp;as to their mistake and for it to be rectified in the next Firmware upgrade.</span></font></font></font></div>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, it seems this thread has become quite long. I would like to inform you that this is a User-to-User support forum, meaning that we who try to help (usually with the names in other colors and with ranks beneath them) are actually not Nokia employees
 and just average Joe's like you. The thing is we have been using Nokia a lot and to some extent we have some slight knowledge of how the phone works and what the problem could be. This means that your posts which in reading seems to be directed at Nokia, would
 fall on deaf ears here as there is a rarity of Nokia employees in this forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sorry I cannot be of further help as I do not have a 3710 any s40v6 phone so I cannot try to recreate your problems to see fixes for it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've directed Nokia to the issues here, and they confirmed that they saw this particular topic when I was on the phone to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why wouldn't they monitor this forum?&nbsp; Crikely, if I were a mobile phone manufacturere I'd want to here what the feedback was.&nbsp; I'd be very surprised if they don't react to this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some other things wrong with what must be the least-tested, thrown together and rushed out software ever to have existed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Try to set 'Date' to show in home screen - you can set it, but it doesn't display.</p>
<p>* Browse to 'Themes' and whichever theme you highlight 'applies' automatically without you selecting 'apply' .</p>
<p>* Try to view the phone's reference&nbsp; video - 'not enough memory'</p>
<p>* Try to view any stored photos - 'no photo to display'</p>
<p>* Try to select the basic phone theme - How?</p>
<p>* Select a music track and it just plays, the player doesn't pop up - you're stuck with the track until it finishes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christ, if Nokia doesn't sort this out, this 3710 will be the last Nokia I ever buy and I've used Nokias exclusively since the 1980s.&nbsp; I've never know a manufacturer with such a good reputation plummet so badly and show utter contempt for it's customers.</p>

<p>Actually, this was designed as a user-to-user forum, and that Nokia Moderators here are the only employees. Their job is to keep the place clean from profanity and all that. Sometimes they do escalate things to other departments, but mostly Nokia Employees
 here are from Ovi Development and hang around in the correct forum for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just curious, your posts was so long that I missed it, do you have the phone on a contract from a provider? And do you have the latest firmware?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Teams - Added planner tab</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>I have created a new team in Microsoft teams and I have added a Planner TAB.</p>
<p>I see this has also created a new plan in tasks.office.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I therefore assumed that these are linked in some way, but it doesn't appear to be the case.</p>
<p>If I create a new bucket or task in Microsoft teams application it does not appear&nbsp; in the plan at tasks.office.com and the same is also true if I create buckets or tasks online they are not showing in the Microsoft teams application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is someone able to tell me if these should be linked or are indeed the same plan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems strange that the Microsoft teams application creates the plan in tasks.office.com but then doesn't update it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Graham</p>

            <p><span>Hi Graham,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Adding the Planner tab to <strong>Microsoft Teams</strong> means we can create new tasks in
<strong>Planner</strong> (tasks.office.com) through <strong>Microsoft Teams</strong>, the planner tab and
<strong>Planner</strong> aren’t the same thing. In other words, add the planner tab means create a new plan in
<strong>Planner</strong>. I’d like to explain how this works as below:</span></p>
<p><span>1. When user A creates a new team in Microsoft Teams, it will create a plan in the
<strong>All plans</strong> section in user A’s <strong>Planner</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. If user A creates a new task in the planner tab and assign it to himself, this task will also be created in user A’s
<strong>Planner </strong>&gt;<strong> My tasks</strong>. But if the task has been assigned to another user such as user B in the team, it will appear in user B’s
<strong>Planner</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. If user A create a new bucket in the planner tab, it won’t be created in user A’s
<strong>Planner </strong>because this isn’t a plan or a task. But tasks created in the new bucket will be created in user A’s
<strong>Planner </strong>&gt;<strong> My tasks</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This also explained why tasks or buckets created in <strong>Planner</strong> won’t be created in the planner tab in
<strong>Microsoft</strong> <strong>Teams</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have created a new task in the planner tab and assigned it to yourself but cannot see it in your
<strong>Planner </strong>&gt;<strong> My tasks</strong>, we need to collect some information to better understand your situation:<br />
1. The detailed steps about how you create the new task in the planner tab.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Will it appears in <strong>Planner</strong> &gt; <strong>My tasks</strong> if you create a brand-new task in the planner tab?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Larry</span></p>

article</a>, we can notice that when the IT admin setting "Allow video in meetings" is set to false, users are unable to join an ongoing meeting from the channel. To resolve it, ask the participants in the meeting to add you as a participant. If the issue persists,
 it should be related to Microsoft Teams client. It is recommended that uninstall the client to see check again and share the client version details.&nbsp;</p>

<p>account and today I had some&nbsp;kind of virus&nbsp;pop up when I opened a message and I quickly got out of</p>

<p>and this was the first time this happened to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the difference between MSE and</p>
<p>Windows Defender.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do I need an online&nbsp;security software besides MSE?&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharon</p>

</p>
<p>What you need to do is disable active content in your email program. If an HTML message includes scripting, it can run code, even if that code simply launches a pop-up.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows Defender is spyware protection. MSE includes that protection and adds protection from viruses, trojans, etc.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The following recommendations should help. No, you should not install additional security, but you can run scans on demand from an online scanner. You can also use Malwarebytes free, if desired, as a second opinion.</p>
<p>Make sure that the Windows Firewall is enabled.</p>
<p>Make sure that all important/critical updates, including service packs for the operating system and programs are installed from Microsoft Update (Windows Update).</p>
<p>Make sure Internet Explorer is at version 8 or 9 and updated with all patches.</p>
<p>In Internet Explorer, use the SmartScreen Filter.</p>
<p>Make sure that IE Internet Security settings are at least set to medium-high (default).</p>
<p>Enable the pop-up blocker in IE.</p>
<p>On Vista and Windows 7 make sure that User Account Control (UAC) ON&nbsp; and not running with elevated privileges.</p>
<p>Make sure that Windows Automatic Updates are set to at least notify, but the preferred setting is to download and install automatically. If you update manually, be sure to update as soon as possible
 after being notified of available updates.</p>
<p>
Make sure that installed applications, especially Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Flash, and Java are at their latest versions. Many vendors are regularly updating and patching for security holes.</p>
<p>Never click through links from unknown sources and use caution even if they are from a "trusted" source.</p>
<p>Never open unsolicited email attachments.</p>
<p>Practice safe web browsing.</p>

Edge cannot be installed on Windows 7, nor will this ever (I suspect) be possible.</p>

A Windows 7 machine probably has the hardware to run Windows 10, but this (free) upgrade may not be trouble-free.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2011 hangs &#40;spinning beach ball&#41; when adding or saving an attachment</h2>
                    <p>Outlook 2011 hangs (spinning beach ball) when I try to add or save an attachment via the Open/Save Dialog Boxes. &nbsp;The list of folders in the left column of the Dialog Box does not populate, then the spinning beach ball pops up. &nbsp;Have to Force Quit and then
 restart. &nbsp;If I add an attachment by dragging from a Finder window in to a draft email, that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No problems with the Open/Save Dialog Boxes in other apps, including Word, Excel, OSX Mail etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run Disk Utility from the OSX Recovery mode, no problems found with the disk.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Arshad, &nbsp;before seeing your response I had already decided to try a complete uninstall / reinstall of Office 2011, per this&nbsp;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768/en-us. &nbsp;Though I didn't do step 10, move the user data to the desktop. &nbsp;After reinstalling,
 problem was still there. &nbsp;Then I saw your response. &nbsp;I tried Steps 2 and 3 from there. &nbsp;Step 3 on your link basically covers the fact that I didn't Step 10 on the uninstall. &nbsp;Problem still there. &nbsp;Then I was away for a couple of hours, but left my computer
 on. &nbsp;When I came back, then the problem had gone away! &nbsp;Aaargghh, frustrating, now I have no clue what the problem was and if it will come back or not. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In parallel I have a problem with my Mac where it intermittently won't startup (hangs at the gray screen with Apple logo and spinning ball), and once or twice rebooted by itself in the past couple of days, which I thought was unrelated, since it does not
 seem to affect any other app once it does boot, but maybe it is related. &nbsp;Ran all kinds of tests for that problem, removed all peripherals, ran Disk Utility Repair Disk from Recovery Mode, reset PRAM and SMC, reinstalled Mavericks, started in Safe Mode etc.
 etc., to no avail. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things are stable right now, touch wood, so I'll continuing working and try not to reboot unless absolutely necessary....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>

<h2>            &#91;Solved&#93; Office 2011 install failure &#47; 14.3.2 update failure on Mountain Lion</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
When installing Office update 14.3.2 on top of Office 2011 SP2 on MacOS, I got the following error from installd:<br />
<br />
Apr 12 03:56:54 galileo installd[588]: ./postinstall: 2013-04-12 03:56:54.284 installd[643:203] *** NSTask: Task create for path '/tmp/PKI<br />

 Office 2011/Office Installer.pkg, PKInstallPackageIdentifier=com.microsoft.office.en.required.pkg.14.2.0, NSLocalizedDescription=An error occurred while running scripts from the package “Office Installer”.} {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NSFilePath = "./postinstall";<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NSLocalizedDescription = "An error occurred while running scripts from the package \U201cOffice Installer\U201d.";<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NSURL = "file://localhost/Volumes/Microsoft%20Office%202011/Office%20Installer.pkg#Office2011_en_required_14.2.0.pkg";<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PKInstallPackageIdentifier = "com.microsoft.office.en.required.pkg.14.2.0";<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />
<br />
I tried all the suggestions in the forums here (another admin user install, safe mode install, uninstall), all with negative result. I did not try the Automator trick, since the error was of different nature than what I was seeing.<br />
<br />
The fresh install following the uninstall yielded a very similar result with error 22 EINVAL (invalid argument) in preinstall.<br />
<br />
Having dug into similar reports on this forum, I noticed that some folks had homebrew installed on their boxes. Once I captured the preinstall script, I noticed that it execs python out of /usr/bin (#!/usr/bin/python) which, some folks, especially those running
 homebrew tend to dink with removing it relying on /usr/local/bin's python.<br />
<br />
Soooo. Long story short: If you have pre/postinstall EINVAL errors during instlall/update of Office 2011 on Mac, make sure you have python installed in /usr/bin or, at the very least, symlink it to somewhere where you got python installed. It
<b>sure</b> would be nice if the installer process would check for existence of python for inst pre/postinstall scripts, or, at least do #!/usr/bin/env python to pick the python out of the exec path.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I've wasted way too much time on this, so I'm writing this up here hoping I'll save somebody a headache.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
<br />
Pawel<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had installation and upgrade problems on OSX 10.10, but from different reason:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cause:</p>
<p>Instead of the original /usr/bin/python, I had an upgrade to python3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installation of office 2011 for mac failed, because of a change between python and python 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re-installation of python 2.7.5 and fix link of /usr/bin/python fixed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before:</span></p>
<p><span>ls -l python</span></p>
<p><span>python -&gt; /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin/python3</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps to fix:</p>
<p>1. Install python 2.7.5</p>
<p>2. sudo mv /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/python3</p>
<p><span>3. ln -s /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/py</span>thon /usr/bin/python</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After:</span></p>
<p><span>ls -l python</span></p>
<p><span>python -&gt; /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue is the same for new installation of office 2011 for mac, as well as almost any update.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Newer installation of office did not show same issues.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Cheers,</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            Advice on doing a Church Directory</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm working on creating my church's records in Access (via the request of my Pastor) and I'm not sure the best way to go about this. Our old directory is set up by family, with a family picture, address, anniversary, each member's name, birthday, and phone.
 Then we have a page that recognizes the staff, a page for the deacons, a page for those who do not have a picture, a page for corrections/new members, a page with the weekly schedule, a page for those who have moved away, and a page for those who have passed
 on. I wanted to add a couple pages for pictures from the previous year's events (we print this every year).&nbsp; I'm not sure if I can do this in Access, or if I should set it up in Word and transfer the information over from Access to Word, or what the best way
 to do this is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your help, and let me know if you need more information.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry if this isn't the right place to put this, I was trying to find a place that had a lot of people that know MS Office.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>While Access or Excel would be a good place to store the records, I would suggest that the creation of the directory would be best done in Word, with at least some of the sections of the directory being created by the use of mail merge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To deal with the different sections of the directory, you would probably need to use a couple of mail merge operations that created separate documents that you would then combine into one and then add the pages of pictures and a covering page, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the Family section of the directory, you might be able to use the Many to One utility on my Merge Tools Add-in.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can download the MergeTools – 20150422.dotm Add-in that I created from the following page of my One Drive:<br />
<br />
</span><span><a href="http://bit.ly/1hduSCB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">http://bit.ly/1hduSCB</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><br />
The MergeTools – 20150309.dotm file needs to be saved in the Word Startup folder.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In Windows Vista and Windows 7, 8 or 8.1, the default location for that folder is<br />
<br />
C:\Users\[User Name]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP<br />
<br />
If you do not see the AppData folder: - <br />
<br />
In Windows 7, - In Windows Explorer, click on the Organize drop down and then on Folder and search options and in the Folder Options dialog, go to the View tab and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to
 uncheck the box of "Hide extensions&nbsp;for known file types".<br />
<br />
In Windows 8 and 8.1, in the File Explorer, click on Options on the View tab of the ribbon and then on the View tab in the dialog that appears and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to uncheck the box of
 "Hide extensions&nbsp;for known file types".<br />
<br />
When that has been done and Word is started\re-started, the tab shown below will be added to the Ribbon:<br />
<br />

<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15379ba1-4772-466c-89ff-95889cff5e92" /><span><span><br />
</span></span><span><span>The requirements for using the system are:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
The mail merge main document must be of the Letter type, though that does not mean that the output cannot be sent as an e-mail message.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
For the Many To One, Merge with Attachments and Merge to Individual Docs utilities, the data source may be either a table or query in an Access database, or in the form of an Excel worksheet and that worksheet must be the first sheet in the Excel workbook.
 If the data is on some other sheet, you can easily move that sheet so that it is the first sheet in the workbook by clicking on the sheet tab and dragging it to the left.
<span>&nbsp;</span>For the Chart Merge utility, download the Mail Merging with Charts document that is also on that page of my OneDrive for additional requirements of the data source for use with that utility</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
For a data source in the form of an Excel worksheet, the field names must be in the first row of the worksheet and there must be a field name in all of the cells in that row that are within the range of columns that contain the data.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
For both types of data source, the field names must contain only alphanumeric characters (No @,#,$,%,&amp;,(,), etc) and the field names must not start with a numeric character (0-9).
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
For a data source in the form of an Excel worksheet, the data must start in the second row of the worksheet and there should be no empty rows within the range of data that is to be processed.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span><span>NOTE: The MergeTools applications cannot handle “Compound” MergeFields such as the «AddressBlock» or «GreetingLine».</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Instead of using those fields, you will need to insert the individual merge fields.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>You may also want to download:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
the Merging with Attachments document that is also on that page which explains how the system is used.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is not actually necessary to have separate attachments as the facility can be used to send just the documents created by the merge itself as attachments, either as the body of the message itself or in the form of Word files or .pdf files.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
the Mail Merging with Charts document that is also on that page.<span>&nbsp; </span>That document explains how you must set up the Excel Data Source and the Mail Merge Main document to be able to execute a merge with a Chart that is unique to each record in the

    <title>business contact manager 2007 set autogrowth on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rebeccabloomquist  say:</h3>
<h2>            business contact manager 2007 set autogrowth on</h2>
                    <p>I am using Outlook with Business Contact Manger on Windows 7. &nbsp;I get the following error message while saving/editing/modifying records in BCM:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dbe4c0fc-1319-4f62-930e-9b5d8d471e26" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read through a couple articles/posts talking about this problem. &nbsp;The size of my database is 3.377GB and another is 25.6MB. &nbsp;It seems that I have 2 of these database files with the *.mdf extensions. &nbsp;I can see them when I use Tools &gt; Account Settings
 &gt; Data Files (tab), but, I can't 'Open File'. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted everything from my 'Deleted Items' section within Outlook, this hasn't made any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded and reviewed my database files with the SQL 2014 Management Studio and both of the *.mdf database files have 'autogrowth' enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with the error message above still persists. &nbsp;I don't know what do to next. &nbsp;This seems to be a somewhat common issue, I just can't find any more information about it. &nbsp;Any/all help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>Thanks for your spotting that I had incorrectly categorized this question. &nbsp;I have moved it to the correct category, I believe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to have solved the problem. &nbsp;It turned out that my root problem was not with Office Outlook or Business Contact Manager. &nbsp;The 'real' problem lies in the version of SQL Server 2005 and the file size limitation(s). &nbsp;I downloaded and installed SQL 2014
 Server Management Studio in effort to be able to manage the database files associated with my BCM. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had read conflicting information about the ability/options for setting the 'autogrowth' features. &nbsp;One search led to setting the autogrowth by 'percentage' and another by MB. &nbsp;In actuality, both the database file and the log files were set with the autogrowth
 'by 10 MB, unlimited' and it cured my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to upgrade the SQL Server version and I'm just not sure I was successful in making that happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe, but I'm not sure, that it was/is important that the autogrowth feature was set for both the database file as well as the log file associated with it with the 'by 10 MB, unlimited' setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been a terribly frustrating situation with cryptic information leading to my successful conclusion.</p>

            Thank you for the reply. I've tried this. I get Outlook offline and then click on one of the emails I want to delete. I get the circular "thinking icon" and no matter how long I wait nothing happens. When I click again I get the white overlay and Outlook
 crashes out. I think it's still trying to get whatever mail was on the server before this happened. Is there a way to stop it from trying to find these emails. I've restarted, rebooted, let it churn for hours...it's just hanging trying to download the emails
 that were on the server when this started. I have mail in my outbox but it won't send because it's still trying to recieve. Thanks-Cliff

<p>However, after having attempted at changing the language settings for both microsoft office and windows 7, the microsoft query popup in excel (under the data tab) is starting to show question marks, making it impossible for me to use the function normally.</p>

<h3> return receipt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bing Browsing history shows up on other computer sharing wireless network</h2>
                    <p>I share a wireless connection in my home office with the rest of the family. Occasionally, web sites I access for my work on my&nbsp;password protected&nbsp;"work" PC, will show up in the Bing history file on the PC used by the rest of the family. These sites have
 not been accessed from the "family' PC. We do share the same wireless connection, but that's all. It's not constant, but does happen. I've never heard of this before and wonder what's up. Both machines are IE10 and Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any light that you all can share.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">Are these systems a part of home networking or domain?</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">Is this issue restricted to Bing or a particular search engine?</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">Are you signed-in on Bing with the same account on both computers?</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">Which security software is installed on the computer?</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">Is there any parental supervision control set on your office computer?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>If you are signed-in on Bing or other search engine (Google, yahoo etc) on both the computers with the same user name, your search engine browsing history can be viewed from both computers, due to the sync functionality.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, if your computer does not have sufficient security, with the help of some hacking software your browsing history can be tracked.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This can also be possible if the systems are on home network and file sharing and remote assistance is enabled.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Browsing history can also be tracked through some parental supervision software.

<p>
</p><p><span>However, if you do not want your browsing history to be shown from other computers, here are some methods we can follow and check if that solves the problem?</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If you are signed-in on Bing or other search engine with the same account on both computers, logout from the other computer and check if issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2</span></span></strong><strong><span>: InPrivate Browsing</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may also use InPrivate Browsing if you do not want </span>to leave a trace of your web browsing activity on your computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>InPrivate Browsing helps prevent your browsing history, temporary Internet files, form data, cookies, and user names and passwords from being retained by the browser. You can start InPrivate Browsing from the Safety menu, by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P, or from
 the New Tab page. Internet&nbsp;Explorer will launch a new browser session that won’t keep any information about webpages you visit or searches you perform. Closing the browser window will end your InPrivate Browsing session.</p>

    <title>Unistall Office Starter 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heloman88  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unistall Office Starter 2010</h2>
                    <p>I foolishly tried to install a copy of Office <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Starter</strong></span></em> 2010 on my windows 10 system before I knew it wasn't compatible. I don't remember exactly now what I did to "uninstall" it or how
 far I got (this was a few years ago), but there didn't seem to be any change or adverse effects on my computer since. I figured since it wasn't compatible, the system didn't allow anything to get written onto the registry as everything seemed to work the same
 as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently some part of it did get written into the registry. I keep getting error messages that windows 10 updates can't install unless I manually remove Office Starter 2010. Following the fix button on the message doesn't work either. I'm guessing some
 trace of it must remain. I have no office products that I can see except One Note, but the app is completely empty and the uninstall button is not active. I tried the uninstall "fix" mentioned here, but after I download it, office isn't one of the apps on
 the list choice to uninstall. Same when I follow the basic app uninstall program on the setting page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>to answer your specific question:&nbsp; There is xl97-2003 format (.xls)&nbsp;and there is the 2007-2010 format (.xlsx and that ilk).&nbsp; Either of those should retain the page orientation layout.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another thought was perhaps you are changing the default printer.&nbsp; Try
 saving the file, then immediately close excel and then open it again and open the file and see if the setting is retained.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but I also did some searching on google and it appears that this is a problem in the trial version of excel.&nbsp; If you are using the trial version of excel apparently retaining settings is limited.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saving in an Excel file format and&nbsp;then not retaining the page orientation is certainly not the normal behavior&nbsp;in a licensed version of Excel.

    <title>How to merge slides and keep formatting consistent&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dave vanable  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to merge slides and keep formatting consistent&#63;</h2>
                    Hi there, I am a very frustrated user of ppt 2010. I cannot find any way to copy slides from one presentation to another one and have the formatting look the same - subtle things do not update, and I can find no logical reason for this.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Examples include:&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; - Positioning of headline text box</div>
<div>&nbsp; - Font size in headline</div>
<div>&nbsp; - Footer info&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've Opened our corporate template and Saved As a new file, and stripped it down to three slides in the deck which result in one Master Template having three layouts. These three layouts - Title Slide, Content Slide, Closing Slide - reflect the only layouts
 I should want to use.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As I try to use this, however, I do not experience the behavior that I want - which is to combine slides from another deck, and have them all take on the layout of the content slide in my Master Deck.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried Copy/Paste, Reuse Slides, and Home/Layout/Content Slide options. Lots of Google, lots of reading, and nada results. I do know that the slides I'm trying to copy/paste into the Master Deck have been changed away from the template in the originating
 deck... that's the issue - I want to "normalize" the layout so the slides all look the same.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be much appreciated!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Dave&nbsp;</div>

            You probably DON'T want to tick "keep source format". If the originating slides do not follow the original master the font will not change. Select the slide and choose RESET on the Home Tab &gt; New Slide may help.<br />
<br />
Footers are pretty broken though. You may be able to go to insert footer and header and change the text and apply to all.<br />

            <span>John, you are correct I do not want to Keep Source Format because the source formatting is inconsistent and that is the problem I am trying to solve.&nbsp;</span>
<div><br />
<div>The RESET<span> </span>on the home tab seems like what I would want to do - and for a slide in the deck already, created new, it does reset any formatting.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>However for a slide that I copy and paste into the new deck, the RESET seems to have no effect.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>How do people combine different decks and have them look crisp, with all the formatting and header positions in alignment? This seems like a very common problem, and I am amazed it is this hard.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>There are two ways of convertions. converting entire template or altering the template to required one. If you give keep source formatting only for elements it will work better I tried it in some of my convertions. I have some few steps which I follow for
 convertion. </p>
<ol>
<li>Check the page setup for both</li><li>Check the version of the source file</li><li>First replace the required font using replace font tool and save it as seperate file</li><li>Start copying entire slide from the font changed file and paste it, then select use destination theme (or as per you requirement)</li><li>If that doen't work good copy the element and paste it as keep source formatting it would be easy.</li></ol>

    <title>OneDrive - Do I really need to save files in the cloud&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taffy087  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive - Do I really need to save files in the cloud&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've created several new threads in the past five or six weeks, all of which have arisen from OneDrive problems. My immediate solution was to renew my Office365 Home Personal subscription a month early - that has produced some good results but I still have
 questions. This is one of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bing'd for the benefits for me in saving files in the Cloud - here are a few that I found:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>If you have an Office 365 subscription and open a document saved in OneDrive, you can collaborate with it in real-time with other people.</em><br />
<em>On the web version, leading social networks can be linked to your OneDrive account.</em><br />
<em>Windows 10 synchronizes your files between OneDrive and your computer, so they're backed up, protected, and available on any device.</em><br />
<em>You can create a file on your computer, and pick up where you left off on your laptop, tablet, or phone without having to save a copy on a USB drive or email the file to yourself. Also, OneDrive makes it easy to share content with other people, and collaborate
 in real-time using its Office 365 integration.</em></p>
<p><em>You're not only able to store files in the cloud, but you can sync and roam Windows settings across all your devices, and store BitLocker recovery keys and other data. Files On-Demand is another great feature that lets you access files without having
 to download them first saving a lot of local storage. </em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't need any of these features. </p>
<p>I understand why someone working 24/7 with computers <span>will need them</span> eg the MVPs and other experts here. But I have two laptops, one brand-new and not fully set up yet, and they never ever leave my house.&nbsp; What I had previously was OneDrive with
 everything stored on my laptop - of course I save important stuff on a USB stick - so
<span>do I really need OneDrive cloud?</span></p>

<p>365 Home is licensed for up to 5 devices, if you use OneDrive as the default doc location then the same files will be available on all devices in which that Office 365 Home account is used. Its also the case that being on OneDrive means the docs are not
 lost if the PC fails.</p>
<p>Whilst OneDrve is the default save location in any Office Component (within the component&gt;File&gt;Options&gt;Save....... is where you can set the defaults) you do not have to use OneDrive, you can opt to save to the local pc</p>

<p>If you don't need OneDrive's features, you can simply store all your documents locally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do the following in each of Word, Excel and PowerPoint:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select File &gt; Options.</li><li>Select Save in the navigation pane on the left.</li><li>Tick the check box "Save to Computer by Default".</li><li>Specify a folder on your hard disk in the "Default local file location" box.

            <p>You really should figure out exactly what program you are talking about. If you are talking about
<strong>Office</strong> then the spreadsheets would be produced by <strong>Excel</strong>. If you are using
<strong>Works</strong> then you are using the spreadsheet module within <strong>Works</strong>. Open whatever program you are using find
<strong>Help</strong> which is usually an option under <strong>File</strong> on the menu. Then typically you are given an option of 'About Works' or 'About Excel', or About whatever program you are using, which you can click to get more information about the
 specific program and version you are using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might go to your printer manufacture site and see if they have a more current printer driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try <em>repairing</em> Works or Office. Do you have the installation media and keycode for the program? Don't try uninstall/reinstall. This is a link that describes how to repair an Office installation so if you have Works just adapt accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Reference: Repair Office 2010 or 2013: </span><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/project-help/repair-or-remove-office-2010-HA010357402.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/project-help/repair-or-remove-office-2010-HA010357402.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also consider rolling back to your previous OS and give MS 6 months or more to work out the bugs with Win10. Unless there is a strong reason why you want to 'upgrade' you might want to stay with your previous OS, especially if it is Win7. Not everything
 that is shiny and new is better...</p>
<p>
</p><div><span>Reference: How to recover / restore your previous version of Windows using the Rollback feature:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/how-to-recover-restore-your-previous-version-of/94368560-9c64-4387-92b9-82a9234216ad">

<div>&nbsp;
<p>If none of these things have helped and you have decided you don't want to roll back to your previous OS, then perhaps download and install a PDF writer and 'print' your spreadsheet to it as an interim step, creating a PDF file and then print/send the PDF
 file with your printer. <a href="http://filehippo.com/download_primopdf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Primopdf</a> is one of my favorites. If you install it read carefully at each step, always choose a custom install vs a default installation and opt out of the optional toolbars and junkware that are typically bundled with freeware such as primopdf.</p>

<p>Hi Parmi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankyou again for your response!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've canceled the security update however i still can't access my inbox to get the code to verify. I think the problem is i only have one alternative security code address that unfortunately is trying to do the same thing and verify, so i can't access either
 email inbox. They both are currently sending the codes back and forth to each other and i can't access either inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess i may have to wait the 30 days...:)</p>
