                    <p>Xbox enforcement team why in the world would you put revoked this accounts communications privileges for 100 what does that mean but I already figure it out that's outrages and also you give me a 30 day console level communication suspension with a 7 day console level service suspension that's freaking stupid its funny that I have a good reputation meaning I rarely talk to people but depending if you play a group game so maybe if you play destiny you would understand you have to communicate so why would I&nbsp;be the bad person that doesnt&nbsp;even make sense how stupid can you be and if you playing a game with the group and they keep shooting you especially when they on your team and you all die so many times you tell me how much more can you take its annoying so even if you leave and join a different game you run into silly people some of them are decent but yet you see me as a bad person by looking at what other people are saying about me which I never cheat in a game and destiny is

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><div><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong>Is there any specific reason for going back to Windows 7 and then upgrade to Windows 10 later?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you have a Windows 7 disc and the product key then you can perform a custom install of Windows 7.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Later on you can either use the Windows Updates channel or use the iso file to upgrade to Windows 10.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Once you have upgraded to Windows 10 on the same pc, then you can perform a clean install of Windows 10 and you do not need a product key for the installation. However you may have to contact the phone activation to get the copy activated.</div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Keep us posted for further assistance, we will be glad to help.</p>

    <title>Distorted segments in some songs when ripping music from a CD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> herezchuckie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Distorted segments in some songs when ripping music from a CD</h2>
                    <div>I have encountered an occasional problem of distortion in the .m4a (Lossless), .mp3 (VBR), and .wav encoded files. I first noticed this problem using iTunes on my Windows 7 Professional/HP Elite HPE computer. The distortion occurs near the end of the file
 and is the same for files ripped using Windows Media Player, and for the same track ripped on an Acer netbook running Win 7 Starter Ed. The CD plays normally (no distortion) on the same computers. I have redone "Nights in White Satin" several times and the
 distortion occurs in the same places (for all three types of files) each time recorded. I ripped the same track on an older laptop computer (2003 Toshiba 5105-S501/ Windows XP w/ an older version of iTunes). The track was ripped to all of the file types without
 the distortion. The same non-distorted files play on the newer computer without distortion (I have played all of the files using both iTunes and Win. Media Player). The common thread for the file distortion is either a malfunction within Windows 7, some inherent
 issue with the Intel processors (HP has an i5 quad processor/Acer netbook has an Atom), or some issue with the motherboards (I don't know who made either of them). There have been only a few other tracks that recorded with distortion and all that I have found
 (I have not listened to every track completely) were re-ripped without distortion. Since the distortion is exactly the same, in exactly the same segments, it could also be the encoding algorithms, that may have been changed (but I'm just guessing). I do not
 think this is an easy fix, but one worth reporting to the various parties. I would be happy to submit the actual files (good and bad) to you, if desired.</div>

            <p>Sandeep V,</p>
<p>Thanks. That worked. What I have done so far is:</p>
<p>1. Uninstalled an old version of Easy CD Creator (Roxio) v.6 and restarted the computer. It did nothing to help.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Uninstalled&nbsp;Media Player (and restarted),&nbsp;and then Repaired&nbsp;iTunes (and restarted).</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Ripped the problem song in 3 different formats and all were clean, with NO problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have not reinstalled Media Player, yet. So, thank you for the help. I assume that it was a corrupted file (or files) that are now back in proper condition.</p>

<div>Hi Vontoria,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) What is the make of the laptop?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>b) Do you remember any changes to your laptop prior to the issue occurring?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>c) Is the volume on your laptop working otherwise?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>d) Are you able to increase or decrease using the hotkey even if it does not display on screen?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You need to install the hotkey drivers. Head over to the manufacturer's website and see if&nbsp;you can find them for your laptop.</div>

<h2>            Task Manager Processes tab completely blank</h2>
                    <p>I've seen other posts of users having this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In minimal view, the task manager shows nothing other than "There are no running apps".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click "More details", I get the full view, but the <strong>Processes</strong> tab shows no processes. All the other tabs are working as expected, the problem is only with the Processes tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I reboot the PC, the task manager works fine at first. But later it becomes blank again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every thread has someone suggesting SFC and DISM to repair Windows image.</p>
<p>I tried all of them. No result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been happening ever since Fall Creators update, on two different computers. One computer is brand new, was clean from factory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Leonel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The blank <strong>Task</strong> <strong>Manager</strong> issue might be due to a software conflict. That being said, we'll need additional information to properly address your concern. Kindly answer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you getting any error messages?</li><li>Aside from running the <strong>DISM</strong> command-line tool and the <strong>
SFC</strong> tool, what other troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li><li>Have you installed the latest updates for Windows 10?</li><li>What is the current <strong>OS Build</strong> of your Windows 10 device? Click the
About your PC</span>, press <span style="font-weight: bold">Enter</span>, and then scroll down to
<p>
</p><p>For now, we recommend performing a <strong>clean</strong> <strong>boot</strong> in order to determine if an installed program is causing the issue.
<span>A <strong>clean</strong> <strong>boot</strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you use your Windows 10 PC. For the steps on how to perform this
 operation, kindly refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="How to perform a clean boot in Windows">support article</a></strong>.</span></p>

            Just want to add that I get this exact same issue as well and am very interested in what the solution ends up being. Windows 10 upgrade from Windows 8 during the free upgrade time, will start out showing information, but after a while will go all blank
 on just the first Processes tab.&nbsp; I do have the Process Explorer from Sysinternals, and that comes up fine.

<p>1: Left-clicking on the windows button does nothing</p>
<p>2: Task Manager Processes tab is empty</p>
<p>3: The Brother printer service icon was blank, and when I try to open it, the context menus are blank until I hover the mouse over them.&nbsp; I ask to open the application and I get an invisible window that I can't interact with, but if I bring other windows
 with graphic images on them (i.e my web browser) the rectangle is visible as a big rectangular 'hole' in the browser.</p>
<p>4. I used Process explorer to close out all of the Printer executables, and the 'invisible rectangle' disappeared.&nbsp; Process Tabs are still blank within the Task Manager (but I still get the percentage values in the header bar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, what other troubleshooting steps should I try?</p>

<p>Hi Joshua,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for posting back the additional information needed. I would like to follow up if you're still experiencing this issue with your Task Manager. If so, I highly suggest to<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 create a test profile</a> as this will help us see a different angle of a corrupted profile.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how it goes </p>

<p>Melowin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System updates required my workstation to reboot, so I currently do not have this issue.&nbsp; When it does appear, I will log on to the local administrator account and see if it has the same issue as well.&nbsp; I won't be transferring all of my files, as there
 are too many&nbsp;for the hard drive size, so I hope that won't interfere with your assistance too much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Took about a month for it to occur the last time.&nbsp; We'll see how long it takes now.</p>

                    <p>When I try to save in My Documents (Here with Word) I get a box saying: Word cannot save or create this file. Make sure the disk you want to save the file on is not full, write-protected or damaged. Or I get: You do not have permission to save in My Documents.
 Would you like to save it in (My Personal file)? I am the only user and Administrator of my laptop. I was able to save in it some time ago but something changed and now I can't save anything in there. Can someone please help me?</p>

    <title>You have been logged on with a temporary profile. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bilhen  say:</h3>
<h2>            You have been logged on with a temporary profile.</h2>
                    Today I installed the latest updates from Windows Update.&nbsp; When done it restarted my computer and it came up with a blank desktop and I got an error in the tray saying "<b>You have been logged on with a temporary profile</b>".&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I tried restarting again and it came up in the temporary profile again.&nbsp; I tried restarting again and it came up in my regular profile.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I uninstalled the updates from Windows Update, but that didn't help.&nbsp; After doing this, it would only start in my regular profile every 3rd or 4th time I restarted the machine.&nbsp; Otherwise, it would start in a temporary profile.<br />
<br />
I restored my system to a restore point from a week ago, but that didn't help either.&nbsp; I still get the temporary profile most of the time when I restart.&nbsp; I still can start in my regular profile once in a while.<br />
<br />
I am on Windows 7, SP1.&nbsp; I only have one account on my computer, my regular account (Bill).&nbsp; Under C:\Users the only things listed are "Bill", "Default", and "Public".&nbsp; The "Default" and "Public" accounts were on the machine when I got it new.<br />
<br />
When I look at the event log after a restart that ends up using a temporary profile I see application errors like this:<br />
<br />
<b>First error:</b><br />
<br />
<i>Windows was unable to load the registry.&nbsp; This problem is often caused by insufficient memory or insufficient security rights.&nbsp; DETAIL - The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.&nbsp; for C:\Users\Bill\ntuser.dat.</i><br />
<br />
<b>Next error:</b><br />
<br />
<i>Windows cannot load the locally stored profile.&nbsp; Possible causes of this error include insufficient security rights or a corrupt local profile.&nbsp; DETAIL - The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.</i><br />
<br />
<b>Next error:</b><br />
<br />
<i>Windows has backed up this user profile.&nbsp; Windows will automatically try to use the backup profile the next time this user logs on.</i><br />
<br />
<b>Next error:</b><br />
<br />
<i>Windows cannot find the local profile and is logging you on with a temporary profile.&nbsp; Changes you make to this profile will be lost when you log off.</i><br />
<br />
I looked around at other people with similar problems here on Answers, but they seemed a little different.&nbsp; My regular profile was not deleted.&nbsp; Also, I can start up in my regular profile every 3rd or 4th time and when I do everything seems fine, so It doesn't
 seem like anything is corrupted in the profile anywhere.<br />
<br />
It seems to indicate that the registry and profile are in use by a different process.&nbsp; I can't figure out what that might be.&nbsp; Nothing has changed on this computer and it has worked fine until today.&nbsp; The only change today was the installation of the Windows
 updates and I restored back to before the updates were applied.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on how to fix this?<br />
<br />
Thanks much!<br />
<br />

Thanks for the reply.<br />

I tried a variety of things, but could not get things to work so I "recovered" my computer to the way it was from the factory and reinstalled everything and now I'm not having the problem anymore.<br />

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I edit any of my photo&#39;s&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I first 'upgraded' to Windows 10 one of the few things that was actually working was the Photo app. I was able to edit photos just as well as with the previous system, Now I can't, and this just happened from one minute to the next! Is this another
 app&nbsp;the functionality of which&nbsp;I have to buy back form Microsoft, like the DVD player? I can't find any way of troubleshooting the app anywhere and Microsoft haven't replied to my query on this subject. It seems my PC is being slowly killed by Windows 10 and
 using it is an ordeal. I don't know what will be gone next! I should like to know if there actually IS a fix for this or whether I am supposed to wait until Microsoft get their act together and stop ruining millions of PC's in this way!
</p>
<p>This isn't, by any means, the only issue I have with '10', Video playback is poor/non existent randomly, downloads won't download AT ALL when using Edge etc., etc.

            <p>Hi to anyone happening upon this.</p>
<p>I have managed to re-activate my Live Gallery via the on-board troubleshooting app. I followed the older programmes path within which I found Live Gallery listed and did a manual trouble shoot, ticking the first three criteria. I then saved the settings
 for editing when prompted.&nbsp;I found the editing options were working once again in Live Gallery, though the new Photo app still doesn't open any files for editing. Only files contained in Photo app collections can be accessed for editing in Live Gallery but
 at least there is a way around the uselessness of the Photo app!</p>
<p>I'm sorry I don't have a key stroke by key stroke menu for you to follow but I was 'flying blind' and not thinking about writing a manual! If you are having the same issues as me with the awful Photo app give this a try, it's actually not that tricky (well,
 I managed it so it can't be!).</p>

            Having 'upgraded' to the latest iteration of Windows 10 Home this afternoon I was hopeful that the Photo app may have been sorted out. Fat chance! NOTHING has changed. Apparently Microsoft either don't KNOW how to fix it or they just don't care! This exercise
 seems to have been an excuse to load 'offline retail demo' files onto my PC! These are apparently impossible to get rid of!

            <p>Hi Yashwanth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really not sure about the method you suggest. The last time I followed advice from Microsoft to remove and then re-install the DVD player I ended up with no DVD player as it wouldn't download! This appears to be back after the aforementioned upgrade
 but I haven't tried it yet. I think Microsoft should be sorting this kind of thing out instead of expecting people to fix issues which are Microsoft's fault! I suppose though that if I am able to get the Photo App off my PC and am then unable to get it back
 (which is what I'm sure will happen!) then it's actually no loss, useless as it is!</p>
<p>Thanks for your suggestion though, although I have been waiting 2 months for an answer to my post which actually was of some use (who knows however, your suggestion may be no better than the one above!).</p>
<p>I suppose I'll find out when I try it!</p>

            I tried this method again just in case I got it wrong first time. I copied and pasted and then hit 'enter' for each one and closed the box,,,, AND NOTHING HAPPENED! And when I go to the store it just says I already have Photos installed! Can ANYBODY tell
 me how to get rid of this **** so I can try re-installing it? Or just how to get rid of it, period? I'm happy to go back to just using Live Gallery so long as I don't have to keep referring to Photos all the time whenever I want to get anything done!

<p>In Windows, the default&nbsp;<em>anything</em> refers to a program that is installed on your computer. So your default email program is the installed email program that is your default for receiving and sending email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft Office is installed on your computer, then Office Outlook could be your default email program because it's actually
<em>installed</em> on your computer. Another well-known example of an installed email program is Mozilla Thunderbird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, Hotmail or Outlook.com or GMail or Yahoo! Mail are not installed on your computer. Rather, they are websites. Since they are not actually installed on your computer, they cannot be your default email program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Makes sense, right? So here is what gets people messed up:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Mail app is&nbsp;<em>not</em> an installed email program. That's right ... it looks like a duck ... and it quacks like a duck ... but it ain't a duck. Mail is merely an
<em>interface</em> for your webmail providers (GMail, Outlook.com, etc.) which are not installed email programs - they are websites.</p>

<p>You'll see that message any time you ask Windows to do something that requires an installed email program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example: When you want to send a document as an attachment, and you right-click on the document and choose Send to -- Mail recipient. You need an email program to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sending an attachment from webmail (e.g., GMail) is real easy:</p>
<p>1. Sign in to your webmail provider and compose the message as you normally would.</p>

<h2>            Can I edit&#47;delete the filters &#40;Video Actors, Genres, etc...&#41; presented to DLNA clients by WMP12</h2>
                    I am using a Sony KDL-40EX520 Bravia TV as a DLNA client to WMP12 (running on Windows 7) and after a bit or work I have managed to get everything functioning well.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I connect to the Video library I am presented with a number of views - 'All Videos',' Video Actors', 'Genres' etc...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I want to reduce the number of views to just 'All Videos' &amp; 'Folders' to make the interface more spouse friendly but have drawn a blank with my research so far.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone know how I might do this?</div>

            Thanks Barb
<div><br />
<div>I am sure this is a (WMP12) server behavior as an identical list of views is presented to all of my DLNA clients - not just the TV</div>
<div><br />
<div>Other DLNA servers (like Serviio) offer the ability to edit this list and I have successfully pruned the list of views in this way, but I need to run WMP12 as my DLNA server - so something like Serviio is not an option.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I will cross post to the Sony forums (thanks for the idea) but this question is most likely going to be answered by someone here</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards</div>

            <div>Dave, Are you using Play To from the host W7 computer to send media to the TV or</div>
<div>are you using the TV to browse content on the W7 computer? I assume the latter,</div>
<div>but wanted to double check. Assuming also that the TV supports Play To, it might</div>
<div>be easier to browser FROM the computer while viewing folders in the Video</div>
<div>Library and select an item and send it to the TV using Play To.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What other DLNA clients are you using? To answer your original question, I do</div>
<div>not believe there is an interface for customizing in the manner you describe.</div>

            Barb,
<div><br />
<div>Your assumption is correct - I am using the TV to browse content on the W7 computer (although the Play To option works just fine)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Other DLNA clients are some iPad Apps (like 8player and MediaConnect) a WiFi radio (music only but it also gets presented with a list of standard views)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tend to concur with your view that this is not available through the default interface as I have poked around extensively..... I guess I just lived in hope of a config file tweak or some such&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Many thanks nonetheless</div>
<div><br />
<div>D</div>
        </p>

            <div>&nbsp;"I do not believe there is an interface for customizing in the manner you describe."&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Its what MS call the "Primary Views" There really ought to be a way to&nbsp;customize&nbsp;and ideally remove those. I have a Samsung TV on a home LAN and accessing the DLNA output from WMP on Windows is like navigating the "7 seas" &nbsp;I get the same views from Windows
 7 and windows 8</div>
<div><br />
<div>It would be so refreshing if Windows Media Player could drop the empty filters and let us get straight to the folders. Currently if anyone in my family wants to access a video stored on my pc shared over DLNA to watch on our TV, they have to effectively
 navigate a mine filled directory of empty paths:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Select Devices/win-pc....</div>
<div>Then click... Videos ( avoiding all other empty filters, Recorded TV, Other media, Playlists )</div>
<div>Then click... Folder ( avoiding All Videos, Actors, Genre, rating, Parental rating )</div>
<div>Then Click... Videos ( avoiding Photos, Music, Playlists &nbsp;)</div>
<div><br />
<div>The paths displayed on the TV are more or less identical to those in Windows Media Player</div>
<div><br />

<p>Anyways, I wanted to say that my ideal Xbox 720 would be more about gameplay experience than just raw power.

<p>Its to big to put here so I have posted my taughts on my website. Also note that this website is from freewebs.com. I just put up my taughts on here. I don't make money or anything off of it.

<h2>            Repeated &#34;Kernel APC pending during exit&#34; BSOD upon signing out or shutdown &#40;since KB3200970 UPDATE&#41;</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">I was really relieved that the persistent Bluetooth related issues (frequent BSODs and Bluetooth driver unloading when resuming from sleep/hibernation) were fixed after a year long wait with the 1607 update.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The latest update KB3200970 seems to have introduced a new persistent bug:
<strong>Kernel APC Pending During Exit</strong>, most likely to do with Bluetooth again. I’ve had the BSOD seven or eight times now. Only happens when I either sign out or shutdown—no issues with sleep/hibernation this time. Tried uninstalling/reinstalling
 Bluetooth and still no luck.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Ran all hardware tests as suggested on other forums. Everything seems to be in order.</p>

</strong></span></div>
<div><strong>Search</strong> Google for the name of the driver, or go to the computer makers site.</div>
<div><span><br />
<strong>Compare</strong> the Google results with what's installed on your system to figure out which device/program it belongs to<br />
<strong>Visit</strong> the web site of the manufacturer of the hardware/program to get the latest drivers (DON'T use Windows Update or the Update driver function of Device Manager).<br />
If there are difficulties in locating them, post back with questions and someone will try and help you locate the appropriate program<br />
<br />

<h2>            How to bypass &#34;Do you want to allow this app from an unknown publisher.&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the business I work in. We have a machine setup at the entrance with the intention of the staff looking at the CCTV, whilst also giving information to customers walking in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the windows 10 home I have a 'admin' (password) account on the machine &amp; a 'Staff' (no password) standard account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the CCTV program on the staff profile, whilst inputting the admin password to obviously install the program. As I had tried it before and got the "Do you want to allow this app". That's why I tried installing it under the user Staff as they are
 the only local account that actually uses the program to load &amp; display the CCTV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work 5 days, however the business is 7 days a week. I am the only trusted person to deal with admin privileges. &nbsp;So the fact that I have to load up the machine downstairs everyday just so I can put in the admin password as I get the "Do you want" prompt
 every time the user tries to run the program. This is will be a nuisance when I get phoned on my day off about a password entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried making a elevated shortcut. However it never saved the password from inputting it in CMD &amp; when I pushed enter after entering the password it never booted the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried a program to create a elevated shortcut with a 3rd party program. It did the same... open a quick cmd box then close, with the program not booting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be great.</p>

            <p>Hi Marv,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let's try to change the application permissions. To change the settings:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Right-click the object on which you want to set advanced or special permissions, click
<strong>Properties</strong>, and then click the <strong>Security </strong>tab.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <strong>Advanced</strong>, and then click <strong>Change Permissions</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On the <strong>Permissions</strong> tab, do one of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Set special permissions for an additional group or user. <br />
<br />
Click <strong>Add</strong>. In <strong>Enter the object name to select (examples)</strong>, type the name of the user or group, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>View or change special permissions for an existing group or user.
<br />
<br />
Click the name of the group or user, and then click <strong>Edit</strong>.</li><li>Remove an existing group or user and its special permissions.
<br />
<br />
Click the name of the group or user, and then click <strong>Remove</strong>. If the
<strong>Remove </strong>button is unavailable, clear the <strong>Include inheritable permissions from this object's parent
</strong>check box, and then click <strong>Remove</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li><li>
<p>In the <strong>Permissions</strong> box, select or clear the appropriate <strong>
Allow </strong>or <strong>Deny </strong>check boxes.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the <strong>Apply onto </strong>box, click the folders or subfolders you want these permissions to be applied to.</p>
</li><li>
<p>To configure security so that the subfolders and files will not inherit these permissions, clear the
<strong>Apply these permissions to objects and/or containers within this container only</strong> check box.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <strong>OK</strong>, and then, in <strong>Advanced Security Settings for &lt;ObjectName&gt;</strong>, click
<strong>OK</strong>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>

<h2>            Receiving &#34;Failed to redirect stdout&#47;stderr to NUL. This indicates a corrupted Windows install&#34; on Win 10, when running a program</h2>
                    <p>I use a Library program called Calibre to hold my various work PDFs etc and today when using this program I received an error message stating&nbsp;"Failed to redirect stdout/stderr to NUL. This indicates a corrupted Windows install" and then referring me to a
 web link at bytes.com. For the record I haven't used my Calibre in about a month and was in the process of updating some work notes today when the dramas started</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed all the notes I can find on the web. Ran a SFC /scannow then a DISM health check repair etc, rebooting, checking the NUL entry in regedit and ran the Computer management in Control Panel tho I was unable to locate the "<span style="color: rgba(32, 32, 32, 1)">Non
 Plug and Play Drivers" (maybe it isn't in Win10 now?)&nbsp;</span>but still nothing allows me to proceed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here I am asking for some assistance, the only thing I can think of left is a windows restore but I am cautious as I do have a lot of data that I am loathe to lose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
We understand that you wanted to use your hard drive now for Windows.<br />
<br />
Have you tried formatting your hard drive from the <strong>File Explorer</strong> by right-clicking the drive and choosing<strong> Format</strong>?<br />
<br />
If it doesn't work, type <strong>diskmgmt.msc</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search field, then press the
<strong>Enter</strong> key from the keyboard to launch <strong>Disk Management</strong>. Click
<strong>Create and manage Disk Partitions</strong>, and see if you can format your external hard drive from there.<br />
<br />
Let us know the result of the above mentioned steps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

<h3> michaeljohnsonukc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista SP2</h2>
                    Had Vista since day 1 and have tried to install SP2 since 2009 with no luck. &nbsp;Tried everything in these support pages several times over. &nbsp;There must be something simple that Microsoft have up their sleeves to fix this. &nbsp;A clean install is not an option
 and is now a matter of principle to fix Vista before moving to Win7. &nbsp;I shall not be beaten...please help?

            <p>vlite integrates SP1 to vista RTM disk but it may remove some components that pervents yo from installing SP2, I used vlite and I was able to install SP2 using the stand alone installer</p>
<p>
</p><p>so you are saying that you installed SP2 after using readiness tool but the updates after that failed?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Warning stop buying xbox one digital games</h2>
                    
<p>Microsoft have removed all my digital games from my xbox account, I am just an innocent buyer that is now out of pocket of money and games. And also Microsoft just confirmed to me that they are wanting more money from people including myself. Microsoft just
 asked me to spend more money on the same games on the xbox games store. Which I am not gonna do.</p>

<p>Going by that other&nbsp;thread the games were removed because you bought a account with the games on which is a violation of the code of conduct.</p>
<p>Don’t engage in fraud or unauthorized transactions. For example, don't:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Lend, transfer, sell, or otherwise provide third parties access to your accounts or Gamertags</span>
</li><li>Access or attempt to access accounts that you do not own </li><li><span>Purchase memberships, games, gift cards, account credit, or content from unauthorized parties</span>
</li><li><span>Attempt to use or share fraudulent methods for getting memberships, games, gift cards, account credit, content, or hardware</span>
</li><li>Use your account to trade services or in-game content for memberships, games, gift cards, account credit, or content
</li><li>Resell or redistribute any part of Xbox Live </li></ul>
<p>If that's the case you were lucky not to get banned.</p>

<p>You do realise that it may not actually be MS taking those games from you, but the person you actually bought those questionable accounts from? &nbsp; If game prices seem too good to be true, it's because it actually is too good to be true and what you're buying
 is the gamertag. &nbsp;When the owner of that gamer tag takes back ownership of that gamertag, you lose everything. &nbsp;It's a well known scam on ebay etc.</p>
<p>The gullibility of some people never ceases to amaze me. &nbsp;The clue's in the price ffs. &nbsp;A brand new AAA game for less than half price the day after it's released?</p>
<p>It's the same when people buy 2nd hand Xbox consoles packed with digital games.&nbsp; you will never own them.&nbsp; When the seller decides to buy a new console (which they usually do after the rip off), you're left with nothing because those purchases are ultimately
 tied to the account.</p>
<p>If MS were taking those games from you, your account would have been banned.</p>

<p>It isn't MS. &nbsp;There's a million and one things you can level at MS, but this sort of issue isn't one of them. &nbsp;Every time I've had an issue, they have sorted it out and when I wasn't receiving my in game crowns from TES online, they refunded me my cash because
 Bethesda/ZoS weren't bothering their hind legs.&nbsp; I have always found MS customer service to be good.&nbsp; Hell, have you ever tried to deal with Sony?&nbsp; They're a complete nightmare.</p>
<p>You were scammed and it's a well known scam. &nbsp;MS owes you nothing in this instance. &nbsp;Take out a grievance with Paypal. &nbsp;Those people you are buying from are scammers regardless of what they tell you via email. &nbsp;I mean, a scammer isn't going to admit he's
 scamming you, he will state he's an official seller etc. &nbsp;No idea why ebay haven't come down hard on these people because they've been doing it since the X1 was released. &nbsp;Both the devs and MS must be losing 100's of thousands through this ruse.</p>
<p>There's even warning pages on ebay relating to these very sellers from people who have been scammed in the past. &nbsp;The only time you will lose legitimately purchased games via MS is if your account gets perma banned.</p>

<p>The games I purchased from ebay sellers with the games on the the xbox one account was working perfectly fine until Microsoft agents told me them games I've bought from a third party selling website like ebay are violating the terms so its Microsoft that
 have scammed me not the sellers because they was working perfectly fine. So I've lost out on money and games. Plus I may not know many people with a playstation4 but I have not eard any issues with Sony apart from the blue light on youtube videos. And the
 xbox 360 is much better than the xbox one less issue's unless your modding or cheating...play Safe</p>

            <p>This is not a reply in the usual sense. However, I have the same problem but the other way around: I see my laptop on my desktop but not my desktop on my laptop. Otherwise the Wi-Fi connection works ok. I can download my Mail, access the Internet etc. Under
 Homegroup, I see even my name with the standard folders etc. So, it is not the Wi-Fi which is the issue. I have tried various paths to find a solution but none helped to resolve a simple issue. And that it seems to be: some simple setting somewhere in Windows
 10. The version is Build 1511. Additionally, I use Homegroup. I tried for instance, leaving the Homegroup for the laptop, restart the laptop, and join the Homegroup again. Also, I checked the Event Viewer whether there is something suspicious in&nbsp;the category
 Critical or Error: nothing there either. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to add that the issue did NOT exist before the "big" Nov. Update.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might also arise due to the firewall intervention from the security software installed in the system. I would suggest you to disable any third party security software (<em>preferably uninstall it temporarily</em>) installed in the system and check
 if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Important Note:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install
 other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know the results.</span></p>

            <p>I do not use third party Antivirus SW. So it cannot be it. The firewall is MS's firewall which is nor problem since I use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile I have an interim solution, which proves that the issue is exclusively with W 10 and&nbsp;- God Knows -&nbsp;which setting. The latter small but with big effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to make this interim solution which made the icon of my desktop available/visible under Network in File Explorer on my laptop. I then moved the icon to Quick Access, and there it stays now and I can get at my desktop from the laptop.</p>

            <p>I added a second laptop to my network. The situation is still the same. The main desktop sees BOTH laptops under the Network folder. However, each laptop does not see or better does not show the icon of the desktop PC and the other laptop.&nbsp; I googled all
 possibilities, and could not find a solution at all.</p>
<p>This is another case of MS unresponsiveness to user problems. Will they ever get it. I think something in the network application programs is massively wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I use an interim solution with File Explorer &gt; This PC: I used the "Add a network location" thereby adding all folders or drives, I want to share. I works ok but is only - as I said - an interim solution. The shares are shown under This PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do hope that some MS employee will pick up the problem, investigate, and come up with a solution.</p>

            I forgot something to add in my previous post. Once a network location is added, you may see under Network the icon of the networked PC with all the folders that are shared. Now right click on the networked PC, and add it Quick Access. This way one has
 the icon ready click in Quick Access and see all the shared folders. The added Network Location can then be deleted.

            <p>Neither method is of any help! I went through this before, and it did not change anything. I believe firmly that the issue sits much deeper with in Windows 10. I say this because before the November update (1511) the issue did not exist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I tried a number of other ways to resolve the issue without any success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And let not forget that the work-around I described above is working very well. So, if that works w/o a hitch, why then is the normal way not working. Oh, one more thing. Once I click on the icon which I put in "Quick Access" it takes a couple of secs.,
 and I see the folders of the other PC. Clicking on one of those folders, and showing their content makes the other PC with all folders&nbsp;suddenly available under "Network". Isn't this a bit strange? To me it points out that it basically works alright but not
 initially.</p>
