<h2>            Xbox Mic Echo</h2>
                    Hello. as of right now, there has been a bunch of problem with Mic Echoing. It's not really from me as far as I know, but it's coming from my friends. I'm on Xbox consoles, so maybe if there's someone who knows how to fix this? Thanks.

<p>Hi there The Iron Tango,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out here in Xbox Forums. I'm sorry to hear about&nbsp;the issue with the Mic echoing in party. I recommend trying the following article:
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/wired-headset-help#8527d3ca7e96409888a3cb1b2d904d8a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox One Chat Headset troubleshooting</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>"The following conditions may cause an echo or noise during gameplay:</p>
<ul>
<li>The microphone detects ambient noises. This includes voice transmission that comes from the earpiece.
</li><li>The headset plug is not fully inserted into the controller. </li><li>You’re using the Xbox One Wireless Controller, and the battery levels in the unit are low.
</li></ul>
<p>If you or other players hear an echo or other noise during gameplay, try the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn the volume down on your TV or stereo. </li><li>Disconnect the headset, and then reconnect it firmly to the controller's expansion port.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
</li><li>Clean the plug on the headset cable with a clean cloth, and then reconnect the headset to the controller.
</li><li>Test the headset by connecting it to a different controller. </li><li>If you're using an Xbox One Wireless Controller, replace the AA batteries or recharge the Xbox One rechargeable battery. "</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. </p>
        </p>

<p>Hi Tango,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try lowering the mix monitoring in audio. This is how sensitive the mic is the farther to the right the more sensitive it is. So try moving the slider to the left, if it your friends have them do the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            it sounds like you are trying to install drivers for hardware that you don't have.
<br />
<br />the best driver for your hardware is the driver supplied by your hardware manufacturer, i.e. if you have an NVIDIA GPU you need the drivers from nvidia, make sure you download the correct one for your model.
<br />
<br />directx diagnostic tool may help you identify the GPU installed
<br />click start and dxdiag
<br />press enter
<br />look on the display tab for details

<p>Windows 10 here as well. Same problem. Ultimate Edition of FH4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I discovered: When I try to "accept" my second "Club Invite", I opened the Developer Console in my browser to check what the server returns to my browser. It's a JSON response with this content:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">{Message: "Authorization with Club Roster Service failed."}</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course I am logged in on the web site, so there's no obvious reason to me why any kind of authorization should fail. Probably somewhere in the communication between the various servers/services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Might help a developer in narrowing down the cause of our problem...</p>

<h2>            How do I transfer disk space from the D drive to the C drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a dell laptop running windows 7 that I bought from a big box store several years ago.&nbsp; It is not my primary computer, so I guess it get's neglected.&nbsp; I was using it yesterday and got a message saying my disk space was critically low, and I took the
 recommended steps to correct the problem.&nbsp; This didn't help, so I looked at the properties on the drives on the computer.&nbsp; Long story short, this PC was partitioned off with 2 drives, C: (Operating system) and D:.&nbsp; The C: drive has only 60 GB and is completely
 full.&nbsp; The D: drive has 400 GB and is relatively empty.&nbsp; How do I transfer disk space from the D drive to the C drive?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Are you able to see the device is windows explorer?</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this problem. AutoPlay might be restricted by Group Policy, it could be canceled by a program that is running, or the service that AutoPlay needs to start might not be running.</p>
<p>Follow these steps:<br />
1. Click the Start button , click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator.&nbsp; If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you can do clean installation of Windows 7. You need to backup the data and you need to re-install all the programs as you will lose the data if you downgrade to Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For reference:</p>

            <p>Your best option is to purchase Windows 7 preinstalled on the laptop in the first place. You are taking on a major challenge in case you don't like Windows 10 and decide you want to downgrade to Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will first need to go to the manufacturers website for your model computer and first find out if there are Windows 7 native drivers available. A lot of computers that come preloaded with Windows 10 do not have native driver support for Windows 7 by the
 manufacturer. If there are no native drivers, you will have to consider returning the machine and purchasing a machine preloaded with Windows 10 Pro with downgrade rights to Windows 7 Professional. Or look through the manufacturers catalogue for systems already
 preloaded with Windows 7, usually the business line will have these options. </p>

            Hi Bailie.  I I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />First see the various troubleshooting steps here:   <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/troubleshooting-log-in-issues-in-windows-10/e7f397aa-417c-4479-80cb-d69d20ef18cc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

<br /> 
<br />Next try enabling the Hidden Administrator account to log into and set up a new Local Administrative Account to sign-into, move files over and set up, using whatever method given here that works:  <a href="http://www.top-password.com/blog/4-ways-to-enable-built-in-administrator-account-on-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.top-password.com/blog/4-ways-to-enab...</a>

<br />
<br />To do this you'll need to access a Command Prompt in repair mode by one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  If you don't have the password this may be limited to using the booted media.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can  create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options for Command Prompt.  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the Troubleshoot Options try a Reset, saving files.
<br />
<br />If this fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<h2>            Some advice for those new to Magic.</h2>
                    
<p>I'm sure 75% of the community here already knows better but for those who don't know... the first rule of DotP12 (and Magic in general) is to&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><b>keep it at sixty cards!&nbsp;</b></span>Literally, 1/3 of the players I get matched against
 play with too many cards. Unlock a new card? Go back and take a card out. Magic is a game of strategy and luck. What better way to strategize with the cards you want
<i>and</i> improve your luck by playing with just the minimum cards available. The top players in this game (and in real life) use sixty cards. Can't tell you how many times I've beaten someone who has asked me for help where the first thing I've told them
 was ... cut their deck to <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><b>sixty cards. No more no less.

<p>I disagree. &nbsp;It depends on what deck you are using. &nbsp;I wouldn't advise having a "small" deck if you are using the blue and green deck...you could end up running yourself out of cards. &nbsp;Sure, if you have a full deck you could encounter mana runs but it isn't
 always so. &nbsp;You never know what card you will be drawing next. &nbsp;Sometimes, the best way to play is to run your opponent out of cards. &nbsp;That can be a risky game if your deck is small. &nbsp;Some decks I keep heavy and others I keep small. &nbsp;I don't think it's good
 advise overall to keep your deck at 60 cards in either MTG game. &nbsp;I do wish that we could set the mana ratio though. &nbsp;That could make a very big difference with some decks.</p>

<p>Ninja is absolutely right. &nbsp;If you are not playing 60 cards you are not playing the "Best" version of the deck -period. &nbsp;This is the general consensus of all the pro-level players. It is mentioned in a countless number of articles. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I will occasionally run 61 cards, for spice but I realize it's not the "best" version of the deck statistically.</p>
<p>I do think it's funny that after EVERYONE cried about the deck editing last game, people aren't really utilizing it correctly.</p>

<p>When I first started playing Magic I had a friend that always preached time after time keep it at sixty-five cards. Then I got to thinking I have so many good cards why must I limit myself to the same mundane predictable strategy for every game. I showed
 up a week later with an eighty-something card deck and smashed him three or four games in a row. The way I see it; as long as the mana to spell ratio is right it shouldn't matter how many cards are in the deck. The only real threat is the mana run, and that's
 a threat no matter how many cards are in your deck. I don't think it's right to tell everyone to play the same way, different things work for different people. It's like a racing game, you simply cannot win them all.</p>

<p>Not telling anyone how to play, &nbsp;If eighty something card decks is what you like, then by all means. &nbsp; But that deck will not be as good as a 60 card deck! &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Because of Math. &nbsp; Every deck has a Best Card, a 2nd best card, third best card, and so on.
 &nbsp; The less cards you play, they higher the chances of getting your "Best" cards. &nbsp;It doesn't matter if you have more than 60 good cards. &nbsp;Your 61st &nbsp;card is always a lot worst than your best card. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not just the opinion of some players, &nbsp;This is a proven mathematical principal and is something that EVERY Pro Magic player agrees on. All you have to do is Google the results of ANY major Magic tournament, and look at the decklists. &nbsp;Try to find
 one list in ANY top8 &nbsp;that has more than 60 cards. Then ask yourself why that is, especially when decks run odd numbers of certain cards. &nbsp;</p>

<p>All top decks run a certain "win condition".</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>This could be a combo, control, burn, creature, deck, or even a combination.</p>
<p>Each top deck utilises its win cards and accounts for other decks by adding cards that will slow, stop them.</p>
<p>Best way to win is to increase your chance of getting the win and sopping your opponent.</p>
<p>Although there are indeed 1,000's of great magic cards, no one plays more than 60 in PRO TOURS.</p>
<p>Just one more card over the minimum ruins your chances of drawing the prefered card at the right time.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Different formats of magic run different cards, but for the most part all run 60.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Singletons (100 single cards no rares) is one format that differs.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Poo is right maths speaks volumes. </p>
<p>Take a pack of playing cards and presume ace is the best.</p>
<p>You have 4 chances in 52 of drawing one.</p>
<p>Now add the jokers (not as good as an ace in this instance) and all of a sudden you chance of drawing that ace is 4 in 54.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>All cards are important in the right situation, but the need to maximise your chances of "luck" is most important.</p>
<p>Of course not makng mistakes when you play is paramount, but all players need to understand and accept the 60 card start rule for better play.</p>

<p>Definitely one of the biggest factors that will make you win more. Also, I would add to make sure you take out the cards such as Dragon's Claw, Golem's Heart, etc.</p>
<p>I have to respectfully disagree with EvilRon on both accounts. Any experienced MtG player will tell you to always keep your decks at 60 cards. You absolutely need to run 60 cards in the UG deck. What would you rather draw, Ulamog, or one of those 3 Living
 Destiny you should have taken out? Trying to mill your opponent with the UG deck is also a bad idea. To be frank, if hoping your opponent will run out of cards before you is EVER your strategy when using that deck (or any other deck in this game.. Hell, even
 the mill deck in the first game was terrible at it and that's what it was made to do), you're not playing it right.</p>

<p>i just played 5 games straight, different deck every time and defeated all of them. &nbsp;they were playing 60+ card decks and i was playing 60 cards. &nbsp;skill and luck has something to do with it but make your deck 60 cards and your "luck" is optimized. &nbsp;</p>
<p>btw, i am currently playing steam only and it doesn't show the deck the opponent is playing. &nbsp;silly xbox</p>

<p>I never said to have all the cards in the deck (some cards are deffinately disposable). &nbsp;Don't take my words out of context. &nbsp;I'm not playing right? &nbsp;Wow. &nbsp;I don't seem to have any problem winning matches. &nbsp;Some of you people here are very arrogant. &nbsp;I could
 think of alot of things to tell newbies that would be much better advice than keeping your deck at 60 cards. &nbsp;Keeping your deck at 60 cards is a matter of preference and opinion that many of you have based on stats and not real facts. &nbsp;Like any card game,
 you are at the mercy of a random deal and random draws. &nbsp;The cards that you select and put into your deck is more important than the number of cards in it. &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do know alot of pro players (I live 4 blocks from a card shop that fills the parking lot
 every Friday night for magic players). &nbsp;Many of them agree with me that the number of cards in you deck depends on the type of deck you are using. &nbsp;To speak for all "pro magic players", as many of you have done, is pretty arrogant.</p>

<p>"Like any card game, you are at the mercy of a random deal and random draws."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right, but having fewer cards means statistcally less randomness. &nbsp;If you have one copy of your best card, 1 out of 60 is a higher percentage of drawing it that 1 out of (anything larger than 60). &nbsp;As a former tournament player, this really is good advice.
 &nbsp;That is not to say playing with more than 60 is "wrong" - it is just not the mathematically best way to insure you are drawing the best possible cards each turn.</p>

    <title>How to configure the sound and color system of analog channels in - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to configure the sound and color system of analog channels in WMC7&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am using an ATI TV Wonder 650 PCI tuner under Windows 7 and WMC. It is a hybrid analog/DVB-T tunner. My cable operator delivers 63 analog channels.</p>
<p>After I perform the scan in WMC using the Analog tuner, I get all 63 channels. But most of them occur with noise (instead of sound) and the image quality is poor. Only 1 channel is OK.</p>
<p>Meanwhile if I connect the same coaxial cable into a 42" plasma TV, the quality of audio and video is perfect. So we cannot talk about a poor TV signal. But when I use the TV set I had first to go manually and change the tv system (color and sound system)
 of every channel except the one, which is also viewable in WMC. So I suspect that I have to do something similiar with WMC. Could you help me pls?</p>

            You'll want to make sure your drivers are all up to date you can update them easily by going to your Device Managers and right clicking on each driver (Such as your ATI TV WONDER) and selecting Update Driver, than automatically search for updates. Most
 case&nbsp;scenarios&nbsp;is just out of date drivers which usually aren't supported by Seven yet. By updating them they typically fix the problem cause the updated versions will have Windows 7 supported properly.<br />
If this doesn't work I'll do a deeper investigation for you.

            OK, thank you for the quick hint. I will try this immediately when I am back at my PC and post the results.<br />
<br />
But I was thinking that WMC should offer the possibility to choose the color and sound system fo the analog channels. My TV offers me the following choices:<br />
<br />
sound system: SC1, SC2, SC3 and F<br />
color system: AUTO, PAL, SECAM, NTSC<br />
<br />
I checked that most of my channels are PAL/SC1. But if I change them to something else, then I get the same effect as on WMC (noise and bad video quality).

            So I checked at ATI's web site and it turned out that ATI TV Wonder 650 PCI&nbsp;still does not support Win7. So I installed my previous version of Windows Vista, but I had exactly the same effect as on Windows 7.<br />
<br />
So I made a further research with my cable provider. For some countries the sound and video could not work correctly because the TV Cable providers don't use the official country Video Standard for the channels that they provide. For example my cable provider
 broadcasts in both PAL DK and PAL BG. So that's why I see one or two channels correctly and the rest - NOT.<br />
<br />
I think that the only solution is to manually set the audio and video system for each channel. Is this possible?

            OK, I made further progress here ;-)<br />
<br />
I live in Bulgaria, so initially I set up my country to be Bulgaria prior to scanning channels. But it turns out that WMC is using a very old channel table:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://forums.sagetv.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-644.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.sagetv.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-644.html</a><br />
<br />
According to this mapping, it turns out that Bulgaria's tv system is SECAM_D, which is not true at all. Evenmore - different cable analog operators deliver different channels in a different tv system. Most are PAL-B, but there are a few, which are PAL-D.<br />
<br />
As a next step I setup Slovakia as my country in WMC. And I got 61 channels with perfect quality and&nbsp;2 are still bad. My cable operator delivers 63 in total. It turned out that those 2 are&nbsp;broadcasted in are PAL-D, while the remaining 61 - in PAL-B.<br />
<br />
Is there a way that I setup WMC (via registry or some other way) a different tv system to those 2 channels? Is there a way to use more than one country settings in WMC when scanning? I thought to scan once with Slovakia (PAL-B)&nbsp;and then the 2nd time with Romania
 (PAL-D), but everytime you change the country you lose your previous channels. There must be a solution for this problem.

            Mine just started to do this too.&nbsp; It would allow me to bring up the home menu, but won't let me scroll down to choose anything.&nbsp; It wasn't doing this earlier today. I did figure out that it only does this when I have it connected to the Internet. When
 I unplugged the internet cable from the consol and rebooted it, it worked, until I plugged the internet cable back in.&nbsp; The games still run in the background while the home screen menu is up.&nbsp; You might get a black screen if it is an online game.&nbsp; I can still
 play my offline games if I load then while not connected to internet.

<p>After a day of troubleshooting, a seemingly unrelated solution seemes to have solved both my mobile hotspot issues, but also the high CPU issues related to the ICS and BFE service processes that I was also having issues with along with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't figure this out--just been hunting around and found an answer that I wanted to get back here as it looks like the same thing.&nbsp; See this thread for details: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance-winpc/after-update-to-version-1709-internet-connection/ab68fb4c-a1b8-4ec3-aa18-32a104e21172?auth=1<br />
</p>
<p>The basic summary is that resetting the Windows Defender Firewall to the default settings resolved the issue.<br />
To do this open<br />
Settings -&gt; Update and Security -&gt; Windows Defender -&gt; Open Windows Defender Security Center -&gt; Firewall and Network Protection -&gt; Restore Firewall default settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps and works for someone else...&nbsp; Seems like a fairly widespread issue.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Money 2006</h2>
                    I had Microsoft Money 2006 on my previous laptop. The laptop motherboard was damaged last June and I replaced it with a new laptop and thought all of my info &amp; downloads were saved to my new computer from the undamaged hard drive from my old computer.
 However, I can't find it nor find it on the web. I called Microsoft and they sent my to this chat page. Both operating systems on my new and old laptop were the same...Windows 7...because my company's software does not support Microsoft 8 or 10. How can I
 get Microsoft Money 2006 on my new laptop...I cannot locate anything from my purchase of the product 10 years ago?

<p><span>Hi Jiju Joseph,</span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does
 the device manager show any yellow icons for unknown devices? Have you installed all drivers?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have
 you tried connecting your Flash drive into another USB port of your laptop?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have
 any USB or external drives worked on your computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>First, Run the Fixit</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span>Hardware devices are not working or are not detected in Windows</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/</span></span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Run the hardware troubleshooter and check what happens.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</span></span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>Next, as all the hardware devices have drivers associated similarly USB devices also have it. Sometimes proper drivers do not get detected after the initial installation
 so reinstallation of the drivers helps resolve the issues.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>You may check after uninstalling and reinstalling the USB drivers if you are able to connect. You may disconnect
 all USB devices and then perform the following steps:</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click Start, and then click Control Panel.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click System and Maintenance, click System, and then click Device Manager.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Note:</strong> If Control Panel is in Classic View, double-click System, and then click Device Manager.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>3.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In Device Manager, double click to expand "Universal Serial Bus controllers",
 right click on the Host Controller, click "Uninstall" and click "OK".</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check if at all there is an exclamation mark along the driver, it suggests issues with the driver installed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Repeat the step 2 to uninstall all items under "Universal Serial Bus controllers".</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then, restart your computer and Windows 7 will reinstall all USB controllers automatically.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If you still face the same issue then you may check for the updated USB device drivers using windows update. Refer to the below
 link for assistance–</span></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue sill persists I would request you to check for chipset driver updates which you can get at the manufacturer website. The chipset drivers normally incorporate
 USB controller drivers as well.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Hope this helps!</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Thanks and Regards,</span></span></span></span><span><span><strong><span><br />

            it might be worth taking your usb drive to a friends or family member and just checking it on another computer to see if works on their computers. If it doesnt work on other machines it could be the drive enclosure or drive itself that&nbsp;has become faulty.

    <title>Touchscreen not working after waking up from sleep mode USB - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Touchscreen not working after waking up from sleep mode USB</h2>
                    Hi everyone,
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have discovered an issue on my Sony VAIO Duo 11 regarding the touch screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have something plugged into a USB port on the machine and it goes to sleep,&nbsp;then I remove the device from the USB port (while still&nbsp;asleep),&nbsp;then turn the machine back on (wake it up) the touchscreen stops working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even under system information, it says under Pen and Touch, "No pen or touch input hardware detected" (something along those lines).<br />
Usually it says "Full Windows touch support" etc...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restarting the computer sometimes fixes the problem, or other times it needs to be powered down and powered on after a period of time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Checking device manager when it is not working shows no errors.</p>
<p>I checked with Sony and they told me it is likely a software issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone else experienced the same issue?</p>
