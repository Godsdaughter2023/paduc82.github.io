            <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>
Thank you very much for your replies.
</p><p>This issue has been resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that it was a isolated case, where it only to a meeting invitation sent by a certain sender.</p>
<p>I believe the sender copied it directly from an Excel spreadsheet or something like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue was fixed by selecting the whole text of the mail content and set them to align left.</p>
<p>Thanks again to all.</p>
<p />

<h2>            I clicked forget this phone. how do I get recognized again&#63;</h2>
                    I foolishly clicked forget this phone. Now Zune won't say I'm even connected. I plug in my phone and Zune comes up, but doesn't say i'm connected to the phone. This pc is the first one I connected to, so now I'm a guest on my laptop. What can I do to restore
 my phone?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your post regarding the issue you're having with syncing your phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You mentioned that it is saying you are a guest.&nbsp; Right below where it says Guest, there should be a button that says
<strong>Change Sync Relationship</strong>.&nbsp; This will take you through steps to link the phone back to your account again through the Zune software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't see that option, go to <strong>Settings -&gt; Phone -&gt; Sync Options</strong> in the Zune software,&nbsp;and click on<strong> Forget this Phone</strong> again.&nbsp; Then, unplug your phone and restart it by holding the Power button for 10 seconds.&nbsp; Once
 it's back on, plug it in again and it should lead you through setting up the sync relationship from scratch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if you continue to run into problems with this!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Kevin J S</p>

                    <p>When trying to change the security information of my outlook account I'm running into the issue that the email they use to confirm that it's me has been hacked so I have no other way of changing any security information.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is saying that someone has initiated a security change to the account, but the only way to get to that information is through the other email which I cannot access.

    <title>Caution sign flashes when opening Office Outlook from task bar. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> judesman46  say:</h3>
<h2>            Caution sign flashes when opening Office Outlook from task bar.</h2>
                    This morning when opening Office 2016 Outlook from the Outlook icon in the task bar the yellow triangle and exclamation mark flashed a few times whilst Outlook opened. There doesn't seem to be a problem with Outlook so I am not sure what this caution is
 trying to tell me. I have not seen this before today. I have three email addresses in Outlook two use IMAP and my outlook.com address uses Microsoft Exchange. Any thoughts please?

            If you see a caution sign (yellow triangle with an exclamation point) on your Outlook icon, this normally means that the program is not authenticating with the Exchange server and have possibly lost connection.&nbsp; You check on a couple of things:<br />
<br />
1. Check that you have a network or internet connection.<br />
2. If you are, then you may need to check your Outlook settings to ensure that the authentication setup has not cleared itself. This may involve putting the user and password.<br />
<br />
We recommend that you send a test email to check if gets sent and received by your recipient.<br />
<br />

            <p>Many thanks.&nbsp; My internet connection is fine and there does not appear to be anything wrong with my outlook.com settings but are these the same as the authentication set up? I have sent three emails to my btinternet email address and one to my wife's email
 address and all have been received.&nbsp; I continue to get the caution sign when I open Outlook from the taskbar.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed one thing.&nbsp; When Outlook is opening there is a message in the bottom right corner of the screen that says "Updating folders" . This is replaced by "All folders up to date". It may be that I have never noticed this before, it is in very small
 print.&nbsp;There is also another message that says "Trying to connect" and then "Connected to Microsoft Exchange".</p>

            <p>Hi Judesman46,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are still encountering the yellow triangle with exclamation point, we suggest that you try to disable your antivirus program if you have one. We also suggest that you run your Outlook in safe mode as it will help in identifying an add-in or extension
 that may be causing a problem. Kindly refer to the link below on how you can run Outlook in safe mode.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply. The problem is that the caution sign flashes for a couple of seconds when opening Outlook then it opens without a problem. I am not a tech expert but my tech people have looked at this and decided that for some reason there is a
 &nbsp;very slight delay in connecting with Microsoft Exchange and that is when the caution appears. I have never seen this before and do not have any new add-ins. I think I will just have to accept this.</p>

                    <p>Our business Brisbane Catholic Education is currently looking at creating a completely digital onboarding (new hire or internal transfers) experience. As a part of this process we were envisioning individual schools to have a brief unique video or Sway (default
 design/style) that provides a basic introduction and background to new employees. Due to currency being a factor when creating digital presentations we were hoping to automate the updating of this Sway based on a database (API).</p>

<h2>            Clear contents only of labels merge to reuse</h2>
                    I created labels from excel data into Word with not alot of difficulty. Now I need to do the same thing with updated excel data. Can I clear the contents of the saved old labels and keep the formatting so I can do a new merge without doing the label design
 over again?

            <p>The "merge document" that contains the merge fields should not have any of the Excel data in it, but it should have all the formatting you applied before. The
<em>result </em>of the merge is a separate document, which you can save, print, or discard now that it's no longer current.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you made the updates in the same Excel workbook, then open the merge document in Word -- it will still be attached to the Excel file -- and use the Preview to verify that it shows the new data with the same formatting. Then complete the merge to create
 a new set of labels.</p>

<h2>            Music in my presentation has an echo of the song in the background when the presentation starts a 2nd time.</h2>
                    I have a presentation that is 4 minutes and 7 seconds long. &nbsp;I have a song that is 3 minutes and 44 seconds long. &nbsp;I have placed the song to start in slide number 1 and have under Audio Options selected Play Across Slides for the start. &nbsp;Under Playback
 Options, I have selected Loop Until Stopped. When I play the presentation the song plays through slide 14 and starts over for the remainder of the slides but the song starts a 2nd time when it starts slide number 1, thus there is an echo effect that has the
 song playing similar to singing a song in rounds. &nbsp;2 times at once but not synced.&nbsp;

<div>How do I get the song to play through, start again through the rest of the slides but not restart on slide 1 again?</div>

                    NOKIA 6110 NAVIGATOR ACROSS EUROPE - 8000 KM LATER<br />
<br />
<br />
INTRODUCTION:<br />
<br />
I postponed this document for almost 4 month.<br />
The reason for this was, that I found it a bit unfair to publish this mini-review without giving some time to Route66 and Nokia for updates and corrections.<br />
Not that I agree with this release fobia of being the first to launch this or that product, but mostly because I understand that some bugs and inconsistencies may happen...<br />
Now, after all the waiting, I feel the time has come to post it - Both companies had enough time, in my opinion, to update both firmware and sofware.<br />
Please don't take any conclusion before reading it till the end.<br />
Don't forget that this is also my personal opinion. Yours may differ.<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
<br />
MINI REVIEW / MY PERSONAL THOUGHTS:<br />
<br />
I bought this phone in the begining of July, and reported several problems in a post called:<br />
Nokia 6110 Navigator - Design, Firmware &amp; Software Inconsistencies - Final Report (28-07-2007)<br />
<br />
<br />
For three weeks (15/08 till 03/09), during my holyday, I used it across Europe intensely for navigational purposes.<br />
Afterall and accordingly to its name - Navigator - this phone is supposed to help and guide you from one place to another, and in my opinion, this feature is the main reason for the purchase.<br />
So if you consider buying it for its gadjets features, which include the routing facilities, please don't read any further...<br />
If instead you need its route guidance, maybe you should be aware of what you will be getting...<br />
<br />
Now the facts:<br />
Phone: Nokia 6110 Navigator<br />
Firmware: Version 3.51<br />
Software: Route 66<br />
Maps: World map, Iberia 2006 Q4 (included with the phone)<br />
France 2006 Q4, Italy 2006 Q4 (bought for this trip, €49,99 each)<br />
User: Me, a experienced navigator (I navigate for more than 30 years (sailing) and use GPS systems since their appearence, 1988-89 if I remember correctly...)<br />
I have used other GPS gear (mainly Garmin), when sailing, diving or driving<br />
Trip: 8000 Km by car (ferry distance not included)<br />
Lisbon-Barcelona<br />
Barcelona-Genova<br />
Genova-Rome<br />
Rome-Naples<br />
Naples-Matera<br />
Matera-Catania<br />
Catania-Palermo<br />
Palermo-Gavoi<br />
Gavoi-Castelsardo<br />
Castelsardo-Piana<br />
Piana-Florence<br />
Florence-Marseille<br />
Marseille-Salamanca<br />
Salamanca-Lisbon<br />
Requirements: Nokia Charger DC-4<br />
...and lots of calm for not going insane, most of the time!<br />
<br />
I - First a small note about prices...<br />
<br />
Is the phone well priced?<br />
Well... The answer is yes and no...<br />
If you are using it only in your country (with the maps included with the phone), I think it can be considered a bargain, feature wise considered.<br />
Now if you begin buying maps, lets say 3, you already paid more than Route 66 maps of Western Europe (9 countries) ... In fact, if you do your calculations correctly you are paying more a less four times more for the same maps!<br />
So if you need several maps, this phone will be 2, 3 times more expensive than a PDA (or Symbian Phone) with for instance, TomTom software and all European maps (the same goes for Route66 similar software). Have this in mind before buying...<br />
<br />
<br />
II - Planning a Trip...<br />
<br />
The problem begins...<br />
First, you have to run the Navigator Application, which was perfectly normal if you weren't in doors... because the program will try to make a fix (get your position) with no sattelites in view, draining the phone's battery and there is no way to stop it!<br />
Second, as only one map can be active at time, the Navigator Application can not calculate a route from one country to another, for instance, it's impossible to set a trip from Marseille (France) to Salamanca (Spain).<br />
To overcome this you need to have a map (a paper one), choose the road and then discover it on your phone's display, zoom in and save a "Landmark" in the position where the road finishes (at the border, between countries); This will be the "Destination" of
 "Trip 1a".<br />
Then switch maps, discover the beginning of the same road in the other map (country), again saving this "Landmark" as the "Departure" of "Trip 1b".<br />
With this work around you will navigate, but you don't have distance, time of arrival, etc.; besides when passing the border you have to switch from one map to the other, choose the new trip, for instance, "Trip 1b" which is quite unfriendly and dangerous while
 driving...<br />
The menus won't help either, as the most used functions are somewhere at the end, so you need to scroll and scroll again...<br />
<br />
Even with practice it takes several hours (8-10) to plan a trip like this one and be sure to have (fisical) maps, paper, pencil, a lot of patience and the calm not to through your phone into the garbadge bag or smash it against the nearest wall of your room...<br />
Yes, it's that hard, and in my opinion this is caused by bad software engeneering designed by people that don't have a clue, in practice, how to navigate, plan a trip, etc..<br />
I even doubt that this navigation mess was tested by competent users!<br />
<br />
To give you an idea of this mess, let's plan a simple trip in map [XXX] from point [A --&gt; B --&gt; C]:<br />
<br />
From practice the best way to begin with is to define these 3 points as "Landmarks":<br />
01) Open the [Navigator Application]<br />
02) Goto [Options]<br />
03) [Search]<br />
04) Choose [Address], first option fron the 6 available<br />
05) Type the search text followed by and highlight your option<br />
06) Goto [Options]<br />
07) Move the highlighted option 3 times down to [Save] and make<br />
08) Save as "landmark"<br />
09) Type a name/number for this "landmark" and save<br />
<br />
Now repeat this procedure for the other 2 points and you already entered 34 imputs of keyboard<br />
<br />
<br />
10) Goto [Options]<br />
11) Move the highlighted option 4 times up the menu and enter [Trips)<br />
12) Move the highlighted option 1 time up the menu and enter [Plan new route)<br />
13) Enter name of route and save<br />
14) The highlighted line is positioned in [Departure]<br />
15) Enter this option and you are asked again to set [Set departure]<br />
16) Choose one option from the 6 available, for instance [My Landmarks], the fifth, so move the highlighted option 4 times down; choose A and [enter]<br />
17) The highlighted line is positioned in [Destination]<br />
18) Enter this option and you are asked again to set [Set destination]<br />
19) Choose one option from the 6 available, for instance [My Landmarks], the fifth, so move the highlighted option 4 times down; choose C and [enter]<br />
20) The highlighted line is positioned in [Destination]; choose<br />
21) Move the highlighted option 2 times down the menu and enter [Add waypoint)<br />
22) Choose one option from the 6 available, for instance [My Landmarks], the fifth, so move the highlighted option 4 times down; choose B and [enter]<br />
<br />
Now you already entered 75 imput of keyboard (obviously I'm not counting the typed text for save, search, etc.).<br />
This is too much for a 3 point trip! Try this simple exercise with 3 known places in your home town and see the time you spend!<br />
In conclusion and just to name a few problems, the order of the menus is baddly disposed, no copy paste of text available, the phone doesn't remember the last typed text, etc., etc., which translates itself in a very unfriendly use.<br />
<br />
III - Lets move on and see what you will face after these preliminary steps, at least from my experience with Firmware 3.51:<br />
<br />
01-The phone will freeze 1-2 times a day for aparently no reason.<br />
Solution: Most of the time remove the battery and restart the phone, the Navigator Application, activate your trip, etc., etc..<br />
02-At two times though, the Navigator Application started but ended immediately afterwards; all the other functions of the phone aparently ran without problems.<br />
Solution: Shutdown the phone, remove the battery, remove the memory card, turn the phone on without memory card, open and close the Navigator Application, shutdown the phone again and remount the memory card, turn on the phone again and restart the Navigator
 Application again, choose the same trip, etc..<br />
<br />
Both are a good test to your patience and to one's temper, especially in the havy traffic of Napoli or Rome!<br />
Believe me, I know...<br />
<br />
03-The phone will give wrong directions after you come out to clear sky from a more than one kilometer long tunnel, like "Turm around when possible", or indicates a "Now make a U turn" in a highway, or even will instruct you to "Take the next exit" + "Turn
 Left" + "Follow the road" + "At the roundabout take the 3rd exit" and put you 500 meters after in the same highway you were before!<br />
Sometimes it will only stop the navigation, and or change the display setings.<br />
In a word, a very temperamental navigator!<br />
<br />
04-In Corsica and during some time (and more than 30 kilometers distance) gave wrong route indications to the point we lost an hour (and almost the ferry schedule) with the error.<br />
It could not get a fix in clear sky conditions; be aware that the small compass will be kept frozen in one direction, so look at the sun (or moon, or stars) and figure out in what direction you are travelling...<br />
<br />
05-Sometimes it takes you out of the main road and puts you in second/third class roads, aparently with no reason at all...<br />
<br />
06-Other times it doesn't provide clear information about which way to go, so you end up not knowing which side of the road to place yourself - bare right or left would be useful in this situations...<br />
<br />
07-It's also quite common to come out of a tunnel that has 2/3 exits and not having any indication of what road to take...<br />
<br />
08-Many times you just take the most complicated and longest way to arrive to your destination; if you zoom out you clearly see it on the display, where strangely both ways are showned...<br />
<br />
09-When moving towards a waypoint, the display will also show other routes to other waypoints (if they are close enough or cross the the same zone), what turs the visual indication very confusing, to say the least!<br />
<br />
10-Sometimes you turn the Navigator Application on and achieve a fix in 30 seconds - other times it takes 4/5 minutes - and we are talking about clear sky for both cases, so no problems with sattelite reception.<br />
This was confirmed by another GPS I took with me, a 4 years old Garmin...<br />
<br />
11-If a road is blocked or you cannot make that parte of the route by any other reason, it doesn't offer you an alternative way most of the time, and continues again and again driving you to the same point or blocked road; you have to stop navigation, drive
 a little further and reinitiate the trip again!<br />
<br />
12-No low battery (or recharge) indication while navigating... The phone simple turn off without warning, when the battery becomes exausted - No time to connect the recharger!<br />
<br />
13-Doesn't provide any information (distance, ETA (estimated time of arrival), for intermediate waypoints...<br />
<br />
<br />
CONCLUSION:<br />
<br />
When everything works as supposed, very handy indeed.<br />
It's like if you were young again and your parents took you by hand to all those nice places.<br />
No concerns, no need to read the road exits, numbers, indications, etc.<br />
You just hear the indications, concentrate on the road, the landscape and your holyday is like heaven.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately (too) many times it was hell!<br />
Not because there were some map or road choice inconsistency, but mostly for feeling deceived by the unfriendlyness of data entering, trip planning and a lot of details wrongly placed or missing.<br />
I really would like to watch the engeneer's software team planning a trip like this, or driving in heavy traffic in cities like Rome or Naples and resolving all the situations I encountered with this scrappy «Route66» software!<br />
Nokia should have better (beta) tested the phone prior to release.<br />
The 1-2 crashes per day are inadmissible!<br />
This navigation software needs urgently a redesign or advice from people that know how to navigate...<br />
<br />
So, would I buy this phone again?<br />
Working this way and with this Navigation Software, with concern!<br />
<br />
<br />
CONCLUSION / UPDATE AFTER FIRMWARE 3.58 INSTALLATION:<br />
<br />
After installing Nokia Firmware update 3.58, everything changed from night to day regarding "crashes".<br />
In fact, untill today I only had one single crash - happened while navigating - what makes me think that Nokia has solved the problem.<br />
Thank you Nokia. (of course, I would prefer to say that I didn't had one single crash since then... But maybe with a new Firmware release, it will be fixed for good - I sincerely hope so.)<br />
Regarding Route66 I still haven't seen any improvement, and here lies my main concern, as it plays a major role in this phone usefullness - The Navigator!<br />
This is, in my humble opinion, the main reason for buying this phone, and from a user and marketing point of view, this function alone should be irreproachable!<br />
It isn't, and until Route66 can prove I'm wrong, I will continue to consider other choices the market has to offer. Even their update policy - you have to buy again and again the whole package or maps everytime you want to keep up to date - points in that direction.<br />
I hope Version 8 - which I expect and presume to be launched soon - can make me change my mind.<br />
Time will tell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Best Regards to all of you,<br />

            Dear "telele",<br />
<br />
Thanks for the excellent review. I thought I was going mad until I read your review.<br />
<br />
Guess, it's time to sell my phone and "Navigate" to something else.<br />

            Dear Alan,<br />
Thank you very much for your kind comments about my mini review/post. It's good to know that at least one person amongst almost 800, found it useful. :-))<br />
Since then I have been testing two more navigational software packages - Nokia Maps 2.0 (beta version) and Garmin Mobile XT - and hope to post my conclusion/report at the end of March / beginning of April.<br />
I can, however, antecipate that neither one or the other meet my expectations... The more I look at all these new programs the more I think these programers/software engineers don't use (or care to use) what they design...<br />
Maybe the sign of (the present) time!

            I've just joined the forum and would like to make some comments regarding you're observations.<br />
<br />
An interesting comment about the prices, but I don't know of any navigation system that provides maps for every place in the world for one price. That said, I don't know how things go in Europe, so possibly with the likes of Tom Tom, you get all of Europe in
 the one unit. One thing that I really love about the 6110, as far as Australia is concerned, is that it contains every single road and track in the country. No other navigator has that level of detail, unless they are using the Navteq (Route 66) maps.<br />
<br />
I agree with your comments regarding some of the navigation errors, but that's really more to do with the navigation software than the phone itself, and being able to keep up with road changes. I've had exactly the same issues with my Mio navigator and know
 from a number of friends using the likes of Tom Tom and others that it's not just a Nokia/Navteq/Route 66 issue.<br />
<br />
Being in Australia, I don't have the problems of inter-country travel, so everything works seamlessly. But we have a very large country to navigate and I agree that the entry system is a pain. I don't know why Nokia doesn't provide you with the ability to access
 the 6110 maps from a PC, for route planning etc. It would certainly help these older eyes and ham fisted hands.<br />
<br />
I've also never had any crashes with the 6110, even though I got mine nearly a year ago, but I have kept the phone up to date all the time.<br />
<br />
I've read a number of reviews about the 6110 and many reviewers have complained about the small screen size, but I simply don't understand that complaint. My Mio has a 4" screen and the readability and detail is well below that of the smaller 2.2" of the 6110.
 I've had a number of friends look at the 6110 and comment on how clear, detailed and legible everything appears. Additionally, the voice guidance is clear and precise, so there is no real reason to be looking at the screen in any case.<br />
<br />
Basically, for me, the 6110 is the best navigation device that I have ever owned (including dedicated GPS units) and the Assisted GPS functionality makes it the fastest and most accurate GPS I've ever used, even within buildings and tunnels.

            Hello ozray.<br />
As you read, my experience came from using Nokia's 6110 phone bundled with Route66 Navigator software across Europe for about 8000Km, and as you can imagine this gave me quite an experience with this combo, which I gathered in that personal review - Thus I
 cannot comment about its accuracy and usefulness for the Australian continent, where I never used it.<br />
On the other hand, most of the Map's Data is available from independent companies, although the majors GPS/Navigator Software Houses are trying to buy or being their own providers... (Route66 uses «Navteq» maps/data, for instance)<br />
As you also know from the reading of that personal review, I complained mostly about its scrappy interface in what concern the navigator software (specially the Route66 routing facilities), although the phone itself is certainly not an example of a well thought
 design in terms of friendly use...<br />
As for the time being and after almost half a year of intense/dayly use, I still stand for what I've said, and in opposition to your findings, confirm Route66 as the worst navigator I ever used!<br />
In fact I don't use it anymore, even though I have 3 (and quite expensive) maps licenced.<br />
If you are interested, I will soon publish another review - and this time - comparing it against some competion coming from Nokia, Garmin and TomTom.<br />
Stay tuned!<br />
<br />
Kind Regards, telele

            I appreciate your views, as with most things, people prefer different products for different reasons; what works for one may not work for another. I find the practicality of the 6110 outstanding, as I travel a lot and having both the phone and navigator
 in one is extremely convenient. And no matter where I've gone (different cities or country areas), the 6110 has been able to get me to my destination, though not always via the shortest route.<br />
<br />
The UI is certainly rubbish and if only Nokia allowed one to route plan on a PC, I would be very happy. That said, the 6110 is primarily a mobile phone (and a relatively compact one), so the key layout is not the best for navigation setting via the handset;
 it's a compromise that one needs to accept. It's also the very first of its type, and at a reasonable price, so I guess there's still a lot to learn. Voice setting of destinations would be interesting.<br />
<br />
The other thing that I forgot to mention is that I really like what Nokia provides via its Beta Labs; having people create some very useful free applications is great. I've even been able to download, through a third party, every red light and speed camera
 location in Australia and can add/correct these any time I want. I can't do that on my Mio.<br />
<br />
I guess it's a matter of horses for courses, for me, the 6110 is no nag.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

            As an Australia user of the 6110Nav. i'm 9/10 happy with the phone.<br />
Some valid points given and raised , good review.<br />
Route66 sure beats TomTom hands down, I can say that !<br />
<br />
I recently did an Easter Holiday from Sydney to Surfers Paradise in QLD with a few small side trips.<br />
Peace of mind and on screen assurances of motels and petrol stations just up the road, or all around you when stopped and the abilty to call them up with a press of DIAL is fantastic I must say.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see the upgrade from 2006 Q2 navteq maps to 2007 Q2, as I have noticed a lot of things missing... but those little upgrades are a hell of a whack to your pocket ! So get real Route66.<br />
<br />
I think the Pedestrian option is one so very underused. I'd really like to see a Data-Logger on Route66 for Bush Walkers, and a PC Map Trip Planner would be awsome too.

            A data logger is available through Nokia Beta Labs, called Sportstracker. It works really well.

            G'day fellow aussie. Perhaps you can help me. I have a 6110. In navigator mode how do I cancel "default" and hw can I increase the frequency of verbal directions in navigator mode? At the moment they're few and far between.
        </p>

            I'm not quite sure what you mean by 'default', but if you mean how to adjust for your own desired settings; go to navigation mode, choose Options and then Settings and from there you can adjust a number of navigation variables for travel mode.<br />
<br />
I don't think that there is a way to increase the frequency of verbal directions, as they appear to be pre-set, depending on speed and distance from turning point. Personally, I'd like to reduce the frequency of verbal notification in some circumstances (I
 don't need to be told four times to take the first exit at a roundabout).<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough, I also have Copilot Laptop 10 (Route 66 and Navteq) and it allows for greater adjustments, but as I don't generally use this for navigation, I haven't played with the settings.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
<br />
Ray

<h2>            Lumia 822 Bug-Ridden</h2>
                    
<p>I bought this device for myself and my wife just under a month ago and am astonished at the number of issues. I had so mnay issues in my first two weeks that I returned my phone thinking a had a bad device. I didn't - my second handset has all the same problems.
 I tried taking it back to Verizon but they said these are all 'software issues' and I am outside the return window now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise how to fix the following</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Bluetooth
<ul>
<li>Crashes phone if turned on shortly after phone has been shut off without music being selected. Have to remove the battery while phone is on.</li><li>Stops operating if the phone lock screen is opened.</li><li>When connected music doesn't play immediately, you sometimes have to hit the pause/play button multiple times.</li><li>Takes multiple attempts to connect.</li></ul>
</li><li>WMA files that are ripped from WMP (vs. downloaded from Zune) don't play correctly and 'skip'</li><li>Many files downloaded through Zune, and playable via Zune (desktop and WP7 handset), will not play on phone, period.</li><li>The keyboard freezes while typing and misses letters or even entire words, mostly when texting, though also in emails, web, etc..</li><li>Emails sometimes won't come in when connected to LTE or even wi-fi. Have to shut down the phone and sometimes remove the battery.</li><li>Messaging
<ul>
<li>Sometimes texts come in and the phone crashes during receipt, then when the phone turns back on the texts are gone (I've confirmed they were sent by looking at the other person's phone).</li><li>Pictures sent by text often can't be opened at the other end.</li></ul>
</li><li>NFC doesn't work in many instances where the receiving phone is proximate.</li><li>xBox Music links to Store often don't work.</li></ul>
<p>Thesea re just the ones I can think of off-hand. This is way too much wrong with one phone.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 &#40;GPU&#41; crashes when searching in Excel 365</h2>
                    Ever since I've had the SP4 (11/2015), the Excel application would tend to crash the graphics driver and recover. Today, it caused a bluescreen. I don't know if this is at all related to all of my MS apps going dark (blank tiles, no Store, cannot recover
 any of them with PowerShell, can't reset the store cache). Anyone else having this problem?

<h2>            How to return date format in a string of 3 index-indirect-match functions</h2>
                    <p>I am tyring to string together three different index-indirect-match formulas but am running into a problem as my 3rd formula contains dates and I am getting the text value. I tried using the text function but somehow I am unable to get the formula to stick-compute.
 Here is what I have. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=INDEX(INDIRECT("'" &amp; $I$2 &amp; "'!$b$5:$b$2000"),MATCH($A3,INDIRECT("'" &amp; $I$2 &amp; "'!$a$5:$a$2000"),0))&amp;"&nbsp; "&amp;INDEX(INDIRECT("'" &amp; $I$2 &amp; "'!$g$5:$g$2000"),MATCH($A3,INDIRECT("'" &amp; $I$2 &amp; "'!$a$5:$a$2000"),0))&nbsp; - this works fine but when I add my third string
 with the text function it does not caclulate </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=INDEX(INDIRECT("'" &amp; $I$2 &amp; "'!$b$5:$b$2000"),MATCH($A3,INDIRECT("'" &amp; $I$2 &amp; "'!$a$5:$a$2000"),0))&amp;"&nbsp; "&amp;INDEX(INDIRECT("'" &amp; $I$2 &amp; "'!$g$5:$g$2000"),MATCH($A3,INDIRECT("'" &amp; $I$2 &amp; "'!$a$5:$a$2000"),0))&amp;"&nbsp; "&amp;text(INDEX(INDIRECT("'" &amp; $I$2 &amp; "'!$e$5:$e$2000"),MATCH($A3,INDIRECT("'"
 &amp; $I$2 &amp; "'!$a$5:$a$2000"),0)),m/dd/yyyy)&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone assist me with the last part of the formula starting at &amp;text so my last string returns a date?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 run just fine, this is on a&nbsp;Dell OptiPlex 780 with a E8400 CPU with 8Gig of memory, I have done a disc check and it is okay, I have also remove the drive and replaced it with another 500Gig and the same thing happens.&nbsp;

<h2>            OneDrive storage without office 365 installation</h2>
                    <p>So, I just bought Office 365 and it says I get 1 terrabyte of storage for up to 5 devices. My wife has an ipad and I would like to have that backed up. She doesn't use it for any word processing or types of usage that office 365 offers, so I see no reason
 to take up space on the device by installing office 365. However, I would like to be able to use the 1 terrabyte of backup storage that is offered with the plan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can she access the 1 terrabyte of storage without installing office 365?&nbsp; If not, is there a way to install office 365 on the ipad that takes very little space?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Thanks.&nbsp; Actually I'm not sure what version I'm using. Didn't know there was a difference. I got the $99 one - I think it told me I could use it on up to 5 computers.&nbsp; How can I check what version I have?&nbsp; Oh, OK, I have office home version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, according to your answer, my wife should be able to access the 1 terrabyte of storage even if she doesn't have office 365 home installed on her ipad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll give it a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it an app that she has to download or does she access it through the internet?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have an active Office 365 Home subscription, you will receive an additional 1 TB of OneDrive storage per user, for up to 5 users. Each additional user must have their own Microsoft account. You need to add your wife’s Microsoft account in
<strong><a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=831178" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft account site</a></strong> to be able to use the additional storage.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your wife can access OneDrive in iPad by either using OneDrive app or signing in from a web browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Office 365 Archive Email Not Found</h2>
                    
<p>I am having issues finding email. I originally had a folder called 'archive' I set up which I moved all old mail to. Yesterday I enabled archive for the shared box and entered the name of archive folder as 'Archive'. It is using the default MRM policy which
 says it should auto archive emails older than 2 years and never delete.</p>

<p>If I view archive usage, it shows I am using some of the archive space, so it seems to be doing something at least. I logged in this morning, and it looks like any email older than 2 years is no longer visibile in my 'archive' folder. I don't know where
 they went, but it's years of mail.</p>

<p>Looking around online I see stuff about a folder called 'Online Archive - &lt;name&gt;' should be visible for an online archive, but I don't see any folders for my account. All I see is the original 'archive' folder I had manually created. In in-place archive
 settings, the status says 'Local archive created' which I don't understand. I don't have a local archive on my computer. My local view of mailbox is the same as in OWA, with all mail in last 2 years visible and nothing older than that.</p>

<p>Can someone help clarify if by enabling archive on the shared mailbox I should have on online archive, not local (there was no option in in-place archive settings to change location) and if so how I can get my mail out of it?</p>

<p>Hi Russell,</p>
<p>The items of Online Archive mailbox are stored in cloud instead of local. Users can drag and move messages from primary mailbox into the archive mailbox manually and vice versa. Users can also do it automatically, using Archive Retention Polices that you
 mentioned before.</p>
<p>After the archive mailbox is enabled, messages in a person's primary mailbox that are older than two years are automatically moved to the archive mailbox by the default retention policy that's assigned to every new mailbox created in your organization. You
 also can change the retention policy, then your mailbox’s items will not be moved to there.</p>
<p>In this case, I’d like to know:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Are those emails which are older than 2 years are auto-moved to Online Archive mailbox.<br />
2. How did you enable archive for the mailbox? Some detailed steps are appreciated.<br />
3. For “the status says 'Local archive created'”, where did you see this, could you upload a screenshot, so I can better understand your situation?<br />
4. In Outlook, go to <strong>FILE</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced</strong> &gt;
<strong>AutoArchive</strong>, check whether archive is enabled.</p>
<p>To upload screenshots, select <b>Use rich formatting</b>, and then click insert /Edit.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Toby</p>

<h2>            Word 2016 unable to assign a keyboard shortcut to a macro</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>In Word 2010 I had created a number of macros, and assigned shortcut keys to them. I would assign the shortcut key at the point I created the Macro, ensuring they were not a shortcut key assigned to anything else.</p>
<p>I have recently been upgraded to Word 2016. When creating a new macro and assigning a shortcut key I do the following:</p>
<p>Record new macro</p>
<p>Assign shortcut key (ensuring not already assigned)</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>I then need to pause the recording to select objects on the page</p>
<p>Resume recording</p>
<p>Format tab</p>
<p>Group drop down</p>
<p>Group</p>
<p>End recording.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to utilise the shortcut key later, when I have selected objects on the screen, it does not work. In addition, when viewing the macro in Edit mode, nothing has been recorded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone able to provide some insight to this issue? And advise on just how I go about creating a macro with a shortcut key assigned in Word 2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance</p>

            Hello
<br />
<br />I was doing the steps indicated by the documentation on how to create and execute a macro in Word 2016 and how to record a macro with an abbreviated keyboard method and achieve the expected result.
<br />
<br />Remind him to first record the macro and then execute it by clicking on a button on the quick access toolbar or by pressing a key combination.
<br />
<br />Below I share the information with all the steps.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was starting with them already selected, however once the Macro starts recording they were deselected, so I had to pause to select, then start re-recording.
</p>
<p>I want a macro and subsequently a shortcut key to group multiple objects together on a page (Such as boxes, arrows, text boxes etc).</p>
<p>We had this for Microsoft 2010 and we are now used to having it! Speeds up our work quite a lot.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Thanks Doug. We managed to create macros and shortcut keys for Group and Ungroup by opening an older 2003 document, creating them there and adding to the Normal.dot. They were then available when opening 2016.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know if it is possible to have a macro /shortcut for Regroup? I can do this in 2003, but it doesn't work in 2016 and it appears that regroup isn't an option in 2016 at all. ?

<h2>            Linked fields not updating properly</h2>
                    Hi all --
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm building a staff directory database and I'm in the process of refining the input/update form for the staff info. I've run into an odd problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There are a couple places on the form where there are pieces of data that should not be allowed to be changed independently -- that is, value in Field A determines value in Field B.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In the first location, I have displayed two pieces of info: The staff member's department, and the building where the staff member works. &nbsp;These are linked because departments are stuck in specific buildings. What I did was lock the "Building" control
 such that it cannot be edited directly; however, editing the department automatically changes the building if necessary. This works fine. So if I have a staff member working in the Music Library in Dalton Center, I can switch her to the Archives in East Hall,
 and when I update the department, the building automatically changes. The building name can't be changed directly. This is all well and good. Also, when I enter a new (fake) employee's department, the building field automatically displays the right location.
 Again, this is correct.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, in another place in the form I am displaying several pieces of info related to the staff member's status, and although this SHOULD work the same way, it's not doing it. &nbsp;Here's what's going on. Each of our Faculty members has an alphanumeric faculty
 rank (I 10, I 20, I 30) and a corresponding text-only title (Professor, Associate Professor, Assistant Professor) &nbsp;I want to lock down the text-only title so that only the alphanumeric field can be changed, and the text-only field will automatically update
 with the right text title. &nbsp;I also want to be able to enter the right alphanumeric rank and have the right text title pop up. In other words, I want them to work just like the Department/Building linked fields. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Unfortunately they aren't doing it, and I don't know why, because I thought I built these paired fields the same way. &nbsp;The data for the form is being hauled up from a large query I did which pulls all sorts of info from a bunch of related tables. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyone have any idea why this is working right for Department/Building but not for Text Title/Alphanumeric? &nbsp;I'm really confused.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
<div>TwinOwl</div>

            <p>You are making this much harder on yourself by breaking normalization rules. No field should be dependent on another field in the same table.
</p>
<p>If you put the departments and buildings in a separate table all you would have to present to the user is a combo or list box so they could pick the department. Storing the building in your table would no longer be necessary. You would just have to join
 the new table to the main table on the department.</p>
<p>The same goes for all related fields.</p>

            Bill, I think I have done it that way, I'm just not calling the data to the controls properly for some reason. &nbsp;I don't believe I've flaunted normalization.
<div><br />
<div>Department name is called from the Employee Info table, then the Building is called (via a query) from the Locations table, matched through the Departments field.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>In the case of the Faculty Info, the correlation (i.e. I 20 = Associate Professor) is stored in the "Professors" table, and only the alphanumeric is stored on the Employee Info table. &nbsp;Displaying both the text title ("Associate Professor") and the alphanumeric
 (" I 20") is intended to make the form easier for casual users who haven't got the salary ranks memorized and might be going "Wait, which one was I 30 again??" &nbsp; &nbsp;The alphanumeric is selected via lookup in the Employee Data table, then a query built on multiple
 tables (including the Professors table) pulls up the fact that I 20 = Associate Professor and displays both pieces of info (ideally).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>What I'm trying hard to avoid here is someone decoupling the pay code (the alphanumeric) from the text title. I don't want someone entering "I 20" for a full professor because that's just wrong. &nbsp;This is working fine with Departments/Buildlings (you can't
 manually change the building; you have to select a new Department and then the right Building pops up) but not with the Professors.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>So I haven't broken normalization (I don't think.) I suspect the problem is somehow in the way I've structured my query.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Ideas?</div>

            Going along with Gina and your new post, I think she's right. If you use a combo box to select and then a textbox to display the one you are locking you can get what you need. That would keep the locked control dependent solely on what is selected in the

<h3> abbylicious powerpivotbeginner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Power Pivot Data Model is Waaaaaaaaay Too Slow...HELP&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A backdrop of my Model:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. 30 External Tables</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Of which 15 are Facts and Dimension files while 15 are empty</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The 15 empty tables are where I store my measures (I do this to group my measures. e.g. All bond measures are associated with the table called M_Bonds and all Equity measures are associated with the table called M_Equity) The Measure Tables do not need
 to be refreshed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I have 20 sheets in my model that contains about 25 pivot tables</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. It takes roughly 7 - 20 minutes to refresh each external table</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. It takes about 5 - 15 minutes to refresh a pivot table</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. It takes 30-75 minutes to access the power pivot manage section (this is where I establish relationships, add calculated columns and insert pivot tables)</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. I have roughly 15 calculated columns</p>
<p>
</p><p>9.&nbsp;I have one&nbsp;slicer which is to select a fund</p>
<p>
</p><p>10. A lot of my calculated columns is a function&nbsp;of report date which the client will enter in as a measure (choosing report&nbsp;date initially as a slicer took FOREVER. First it was selected&nbsp;(month, day and year),&nbsp;cube functioned, then concatenated&nbsp;into a date,
 then loaded back into the model as a&nbsp;table with a single entry..though&nbsp;more aesthetically than entering it has a measure, it was way too slow)</p>
<p>
</p><p>11. When I enter a new measure or alter a previous measure, it takes&nbsp; 5-10 minutes to process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>12. I have rebuilt this model roughly 40 times over the last 6 months</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am tired and frustrated. How do I make it faster? What am I doing wrong? All of the external connections are plugged into a SQL server. Please feel free to ask me any questions as to aid in figuring out the issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

 stopped.&nbsp; I couldn't get it to continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened Task&nbsp;Manager.&nbsp; Kaspersky was using huge disk and CPU...how I don't know it was still disabled.&nbsp; So I reinstalled&nbsp; Kaspersky.&nbsp; (I tried to contact support ..but they really don't have&nbsp;support).&nbsp; I restarted my computer...but Windows Defender will
 only scan a few files and stop.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue that you face could possibly be due to a internal software corruption. Hence, we ask you to perform a clean boot and then start the windows defender and then check if the issue persists.</p>

            <p>the answer is NO... *IF* your "string" is a value result from a formula, i.e.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>="An initial deposit in the amount of "&amp;TEXT(&lt;any cell reference&gt;,"#,##0.00")&amp;" will be due upon acceptance of this proposal."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you cannot mid-format the result of formulae</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- you can convert to value and use a&nbsp;vba procedure&nbsp;(as proposed by Barb)</p>
<p>- you can format the whole text in the cell</p>
