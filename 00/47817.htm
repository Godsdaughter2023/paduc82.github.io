    <title>Live Gold Trial - how to cancel&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Live Gold Trial - how to cancel&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I signed up for a 14 day trial on Live Gold with my new XBOX One S. 
The code was accepted and it says it expires on Feb 9th, as expected.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>
</p>

<p>My
 issue is that this trial is not showing up as a subscription in my 
Microsoft Account so there's no way for me to cancel it. Under Services 
and Subscriptions it still shows Live Gold as an option to sign up for.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p>

<p><br /></p><p>I
 had hoped the trial would allow me to get the current bonus Gold games 
but it appears not as it wants to charge me for them when I try to 
download. My concern is that its now going to auto renew my trial and charge my PayPal account at the end of the trial and I don’t have any way to cancel it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p>

<p><br /></p><p>The help link for "Manage My Subscription" on the xbox.com site takes me to the Services and Subscriptions page I mentioned above.</p>

<p><br />I tried online support on chat and the guy I got was hopeless.<br /></p><p>

            <p>A Microsoft rep posted in another conversation that you can do that by disabling the wireless autoconfig service inside Computer Management.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can reach the Services control panel a few ways, but here's one quick option:</p>
<p>1) Press Windows+R to show the Run box</p>
<p>2) Type <em>services.msc</em> and click OK.</p>
<p>3) Find the wireless autoconfig service in the list and right-click/properties.</p>
<p>4) Stop the service and set the startup type to "manual" or "disabled"</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can always turn this back on, so it's a safe operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you do this, you should be able to manually create a WiFi network basically the same way you would in Windows Vista or 7.</p>

<h2>            How long should the &#34;Go back to the previous build&#34; process take&#63; &#40;OR, &#34;Don&#39;t rely on Microsoft&#39;s Windows 10 compatibility check&#34;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Profound thanks in advance for any guidance.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Last month, I installed Windows 10 on my laptop, upgrading from Windows 7 professional, which was installed by the manufacturer. My machine is a 4 year old Lenovo w520 with 16 of ram, which I've always updated right away with system and driver updates.<br />
<br />
For the most part, other than a few minor performance hiccups, remedied either by a restart or downloading updates/drivers, my Windows 10 experience was pretty good. Until this morning.<br />
<br />
I fired up my laptop, logged in like normal. Then everything went south. Programs pinned to the taskbar didn't populate, nor did normal system tray items like Norton appear. When I went to click on the start button, I found I couldn't click on it, while my
 cursor turned into the blue "waiting" donut.<br />
<br />
I tried to jump to the task manager, but there was no response. Then I received a blue screen advising me of a "critical_process_died" error (I never had even one blue screen error in almost 4 years with Windows 7). The system restarted, but the same problem
 occurred over and over. In the course of subsequent attempts, other errors appeared:<br />
"0xc000021a"<br />
"WerFault.exe - The instruction at 0x00007FFFC5E24350 referenced memory at &nbsp;0x00007FFFC5E24350. The required data wasn't placed into memory because of an I/O error status of 0xc000000e"<br />
"Critical Error. Start menu and Cortana aren't working."<br />
<br />
Only after several searches did I find out that I could access the troubleshooting tools by shift + clicking on "restart" at the login screen. So I first tried booting into "safe mode", but it generated the same "critical_process_died" error. I also attempted
 to repair the start up sequence, but the process failed. No restore points were available. Only two options remained. Reinstall Windows 10 clean, which I decided I'd leave as a final resort, or "Go back to a previous build", which is where I am now.<br />
<br />
I went through the prompts and initiated the process. Almost three hours have passed since then. I don't think it took half this long to install Windows 10 in the first place. The screen has read "restarting" since the beginning but I don't see activity in
 the HD indicator light.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have no idea what to expect now, nor do I have steps to take if my system continues like this. Do I wait? Power off?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My system had been stable for years, now it's totally crippled, I have no explanation why, and my livelihood is at stake.</p>

            <p>Hello Karthicka,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, let me summarize the aftermath of my rollback experience. Hopefully this will provide you with enough information to sort out my problems more efficiently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After my final post last Thursday,&nbsp;<strong>the file system check completed</strong>, and my workstation restarted into Windows 7. After logging in,&nbsp;<strong>I installed over 40 Windows 7 updates</strong>&nbsp;that had piled up in the time since I installed Windows
 10. Once that was finished, I ran some basic diagnostics, using Lenovo ThinkVantage Toolbox. All tests passed, with the huge exception of&nbsp;<strong>my hard drive, which failed the SMART short read test</strong>. It has subsequently failed a second test, so it's
 evidently in its final days. This being the case, I immediately went to backup my hard drive and in turn, encountered the next problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I went to Back Up and Restore, after connecting my external drive, I found that&nbsp;<strong>the backup tool was corrupted in some way</strong>&nbsp;(I didn't capture the error message). A few searches yielded a suggestion that I open the task scheduler to reset
 the backup related tasks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon opening the task scheduler, dozens of individual error messages appeared one after the other. Each was a variation on&nbsp;<strong>"{task name}: The task image is corrupt or has been tampered with"</strong>. So I went back into search to see if anyone had
 similar experiences. The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/performance-maintenance/378917-54-task-scheduler-corrupt-tampered-tasks-best-way-fix.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">most helpful thread</a>&nbsp;was from www.sevenforums.com , where another Windows
 10 user had a similar experience after rolling back to Windows 7. Down-thread, someone posted&nbsp;<a href="https://repairtasks.codeplex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">a link to a repair tool</a>&nbsp;that promised to help. After verifying the legitimacy of
 the tool to the extent possible, I downloaded and ran it.&nbsp;<strong>It revealed over 70 corrupt tasks, and repaired all but 7</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I returned to Back Up and Restore, and found that the normal options had returned. Unfortunately,&nbsp;<strong>when I tried to run back up, it failed</strong>. Additional attempts with multiple hard drives likewise failed. I tried to back up through ThinkVantage,
 but this didn't produce a better result. Eventually, I managed to save a system image. At least no errors or warnings appeared during the process and it seemed to complete successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue that appeared is that,&nbsp;<strong>Chrome will not allow me to update</strong>&nbsp;to to "An error occurred while checking for updates: Update check failed to start (error code 3: 0x80040154)." I tried to uninstall Chrome in order to reinstall it,
 but it doesn't even appear in my program list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the story until today. Moving ahead, I am going to purchase a replacement hard drive today or tomorrow. Once I have though, I'm not positive of my next steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now,<strong>&nbsp;I don't know what state Windows 7 is in</strong>. Is it irretrievably corrupted, meaning it is advisable to do a clean installation before I install the new hard drive? Or should I get the new hard drive, clone my current drive onto it,
 install it and then assess how my system functions afterward?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In either case, my system came with Windows 7 preinstalled, so&nbsp;<strong>I'm not certain what steps to take in if I need to do a clean install</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any actionable advice on these matters would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>
</p><p>One week with no advice or even a response. So basically, <strong><em>not really</em></strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I checked my computer's diagnostic records and discovered that my hard drive failed a test on the day after I installed Windows 10. Coincidence? It had NEVER failed one before. Of course I didn't realize it because I was too busy contending with reorganization
 of my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, I found out that Intel decided not to support Sandy Bridge chipsets for Windows 10. In turn, Lenovo has apparently decided to not support systems with Sandy Bridge for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, despite the fact that these decisions probably affect, at minimum, hundreds-of-thousands of users, neither company nor Microsoft saw fit to push a notice to users who have invested in their products with a simple, clear message:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">"<strong>Do NOT install Windows 10 for your system.</strong>
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
 to think that it is massively more efficient for a few companies to assess compatibility and then communicate with users all at once rather than to rely on millions of individual users to, 1) think of effective search terms to find out for themselves, 2) sift
 through and evaluate the results and, 3) act on the directions? </p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Even then, one is likely to find -</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">...both of which seem to trust that Microsoft's test is sufficient.
</p>
</p><p>The reality is better encapsulated here:</p>

    <title>Search for files on my external hard drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> unknownwizard54  say:</h3>
<h2>            Search for files on my external hard drive</h2>
                    I had created a manual backup files on my external hard drive by creating a folder with my computer name and moving the files to that folder.&nbsp; Yesterday I decided to create a backup of my computer using the windows backup feature so it created a backupfolder
 on my external hard drive using the name of my computer. I'm guessing the backup software merged with the preexisting folder since they both were named the same thing. Now the folder that I manually backed up my files to is no longer accesible. I can't search
 for files or use the explorer window to look for files in it. It is treated as a backup folder. Although I have no way of accessing my files,&nbsp;I know that they were not deleted on my external hard drive because the backup of my pc was 50gb large. My computer
 says that the external hard drive has 771gb of free space meaning the windows backup software did not overwrite the preexisting folder. My&nbsp;manual backup is still taking up space on the external hard drive.&nbs

            I"m soo happy!!! I got my files back! I copied the folder where my items were backed up to and pasted it. I was able to browse and easily access my data like as if it were items in a normal file. I can't believe all this time the solution was soo simple.
 So now I still have my itunes purchases , other videos, and ect! Thankyou "trekdozer" for taking the time to try to help though.

<p>Hi Kewl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The actual location of the default lock screen pictures is<strong> C:\Windows\Web\Screen</strong>. For us to isolate your concern with the Microsoft stock photo from lock screen, we would like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When you say<span> "C:\Windows\Web\Screen can't be found<span>", do you mean there is no picture/photo on your screen folder or you cant locate the "</span></span><span>C:\Windows\Web\Screen"?</span></li><li><span>Send us a screenshot of your </span>"C:\Windows\Web<span>" only.</span></li></ul>
<p><span><br />
We look forward to your response.</span></p>

<p><span>Method 1:<br />
</span><span>If you have installed any security software on the computer, then I would suggest you to try
disabling it <span>temporary</span><span> and check if the same issue occurs.
Make sure you enable back the security software once the troubleshooting is done to prevent the computer from virus attack.</span></span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span><br />
Try performing clean boot and check if it helps:<br />

<p><span>NOTE: After you have finished troubleshooting, make sure you reset the computer to normal startup mode as suggested
 in step7 from the above KB article.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b><span><br />
Try running system file checker and see if it helps:<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 wont auto detect i plug in front audio jack while game or other programs are running</h2>
                    So as the title says, win 10 wont detect i plug in my headphones while i have games/programs running. But if i close all applications It may sometimes detect if i pull it out and plug it in again, sometimes it doesnt and i have to restart my pc. Why is
 this happening? I have tried uninstalling all audio drivers and reinstalled new ones from my mobos homepage.

<h2>            windows 8 dns server error</h2>
                    I am continually getting the DNS server error on my windows 8. &nbsp;Using either Chrome or IE browsers. &nbsp;Usually happens when I'm on facebook and attempt to go to an app within facebook BUT it happens when I try to switch web pages, too. &nbsp; My Internet providers
 says it's not in my settings, it is a Microsoft issue. &nbsp;I am &nbsp;not happy about this. &nbsp; I access my browsers from the desktop instead of the "app screen". &nbsp;This also happens on my own website, gmail, upon start up, etc. &nbsp; &nbsp; It very, very frustrating. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here is what I get: &nbsp;</div>

<span>This webpage is not available</span>
<span>This webpage is not available</span>
<div><span>The server at&nbsp;<strong>imabigfanof.criminalcasegame.com</strong>&nbsp;can't be found, because the DNS lookup failed. DNS is the network service that translates a website's name to its Internet address. This
 error is most often caused by having no connection to the Internet or a misconfigured network. It can also be caused by an unresponsive DNS server or a firewall preventing&nbsp;<span>Google Chrome</span>&nbsp;from accessing the network.</span></div>

            <p>Try changing your DNS servers, both IPV4 and IPV6 to either OpenDNS or Google's Public DNS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why am I suggesting this? After installing Windows 8.1 I began having all kinds of internet connection issues. I was constantly on the phone with my ISP and eventually replaced my modem, router, had the cable company run a new drop, and finally, replaced
 my PC ( the last one was unrelated to the internet issues). Yet, I still had issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically, I would have issues visiting sites I had already visited. For instance, Bing.com was set as my homepage in all my browsers. So, whenever I would open a browser, it would appear as though my internet was down. However, if I tried visiting&nbsp;a
 site that I had not visited before (or at least in a long while); just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After many hours googling the night away, I stumbled across a forum where someone suggested flushing my DNS cache. It worked. So, I made a BAT file to ease the process when things went crazy.</p>
<p>
</p><div>ECHO OFF</div>
<div>ipconfig /flushdns</div>
<div>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 60px">Echo</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, that solved the problem topically, but there was still a problem underneath. After more searching, I came across either a forum or knowledgebase article that described my problem exactly (I cannot find it again). Anyway, if I recall it correctly (and
 I don't), with Windows 8.1 they dropped support for something (what that something is, I can't remember). This something caused problems in older routers or new routers that still relied on that something. The fix suggested was to switch to either OpenDNS
 or Google Public DNS. Why? I can't remember the technical explanation, but I tried it, and it worked.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p>So, the easiest way to tell if this will fix it for you is, next time it happens, open the Command Prompt and type "ipconfig /flushdns" Then return to your browser and click refresh. If the page loads, try switching DNS servers. You can do it to just one
 machine (I did this when I only had one Win 8.1 PC) or to your router if you have more than one Win 8.1 PC. Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Standby&#47;CACHE RAM Limitation setting or program for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I Need to figure out how to change a setting in windows to set a Maximum Standby Memory or Cached memory to a limit of my choosing. I know people already say Windows 10 requires more cached ram so the operating system is "Faster". But i don't want Windows
 hogging 4GB of RAM when it could be used for something else. I've looked at other posts about C++ being an option but i am not a programmer. Is there a good trustworthy freeware or Command line code i don't know about that can permanently change this setting?</p>

    <title>MANY BUGS in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rspprodinc  say:</h3>
<h2>            MANY BUGS in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Installed the update on a BRAND NEW laptop running Windows 8.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrade went well, but when I opened a document in Word a message came up saying Office was not activated.&nbsp; I put in the key I had PURCHASED and it would not activate over the internet.&nbsp; Tried
 by phone and was told the product identification was bad and it wasn't a "recognized version of Office 2013."&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a legit copy purchased from Microsoft, downloaded from their site, and key purchased from MS.&nbsp; I tried installing it again and despite many
 reboots a message kept saying there was another install active and kept shutting down the REAL install.&nbsp; No other program was being installed at the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrading from Windows 7 Professional, also a legit copy, around 90 percent of my programs would not function, I would right click on the desktop to get to display options to get my two monitors to work, and could not.&nbsp; I tried the Control Panel, and it
 would not come up at all.&nbsp; Office also was not active, and I kept receiving error after error from 1Drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; Quickbooks also would not come up with a message saying, "file location non existent."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank goodness for Acronis.&nbsp; I imaged both of my computers before the upgrade and I'm extremely glad I did.&nbsp; Windows 10 sucks right out of the gate.&nbsp; I'm sure better to wait about a year before all the bugs are out.. if that's even possible.</p>

<p>and when I try to load more programs, which needs more memory, it display message, I don't have enough memory to load the program.</p>
<p>I had 6GB RAM and added USB flash drive of 8GB and fully allocated to Ready Boost.</p>

<p>any body have an idea why I don't see the memory increment in Windows 7?</p>

<p>It doesn't work that way. Put simply your system uses the USB flash drive as an additional swap file.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 can&#39;t detect Micorsoft Bluetooth Mouse 3600</h2>
                    <p>Hi I installed Windows 10 and my bluetooth wasn't recognized so I downloaded a new driver (http://support.lenovo.com/ca/en/downloads/ds031759) but still my computer can't find my mouse (Microsoft Bluetooth 3600).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I doing wrong/How can I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every other thread I come across has solutions for other versions of Windows or a different type of mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hello Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Are you able to connect other Bluetooth devices to your Computer?</li><li>Did you check connecting Mouse with other Computer?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>First shutdown you PC completely. Then restart it back after a while. Now once you reach desktop, go to
<strong>Start &gt; Settings &gt; Device &gt; Bluetooth. </strong>Now turn on the Mouse<strong>.
</strong>Refresh the windows and see if the Mouse appears there<strong>. </strong>
If yes, click on it and select <strong>Pair.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't appear, then try to check connecting other Bluetooth devices to your Computer to see if they pair correctly. Also check connecting the Mouse with other Computer to see if it works correctly there. This both actions will gives the clue on the
 root cause of the issue. Meanwhile try to install legacy Bluetooth drivers (Windows 8.1 or Windows 7) to see if they make any difference in situation. Also try installing Mouse and Keyboard Center 2.7 64-bit

            <p>Hi there thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It took me a couple of days but I finally found another bluetooth device to try to connect to my computer and another computer to try to connect with my mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer recognized the other bluetooth device right away.</p>
<p>Also, the mouse was recognized by the other computer right away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried installing legacy drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also tried installing Mouse and Keyboard Center 2.7 64-bit but it won't do anything because it says I have no supported devices.</p>

            <p>Thank you all for replying to my question. After trying so many things for so long, I ended up just buying a different mouse that some other forums said they had no problems with, and sure enough it worked fine. I sold my Microsoft mouse for almost as much
 as I bought it for and that person had no problem with it. So, I guess I'll never truly know what the problem was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW the mouse I bought was the Logitech M557 bluetooth.</p>

            <p>Hey, Mike.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did something very similar to what you suggested:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start &gt; "Device Manager" &gt; Device Manager &gt; Bluetooth &gt; Right clicked on "Intel Wireless Bluetooth" &gt; Update Driver Software... &gt; Search automatically for updated driver software (I'm connected to the network).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It found an update, installed it, and my Microsoft Designer Mouse magically appeared in my bluetooth list (Start &gt; "Settings" &gt; Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Bluetooth).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers, Mike! Great idea!</p>

</p><p>This morning, I can connect via bluetooth but it doesn't show as a mouse, but as an "other." The mouse is unresponsive. So it's gone from perfect to useless overnight.</p>

<p>I just faced this problem with by MX Anywhare 2 and Surface Pro 2 this morning and finally fixed after a few hours testing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The root cause might be the Bluetooth driver not working fine with Microsoft Bluetooth LE Enumerator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Uninstall the paired Bluetooth mouse which act as "Other Device"</p>
<p>- Open Device manager, select Bluetooth, right click and uninstall the Bluetooth Device (In my SP2 is Marvell AVASTAR Bluetooth Radio Adapter)<br />
- Wait for a while for the uninstall - It may take up to a few minutes</p>
<p>- The system will prompt you for restart after the uninstall complete - restart right the way</p>
<p>- After system restart, the Bluetooth device should coming back automatically&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Pair the Bluetooth mouse again and work as normal</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this could solve your problem</p>

<p>Hello Vicky, and thanks for your interest in Game DVR. I work on the Game DVR team, and we recently announced support for 60 fps recording. I noticed you are an Insider :) If you install build 14342 or after, you have access to this feature. Currently, the
 only way to enable it is to log in to the Xbox app with your Microsoft Account, go to settings, click on the Game DVR tab, scroll all the way down to the Video Encoding section, and change the Video Quality dropdown to select "Very High".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your feedback about overlays, FPS counter, etc. is noted. We are always looking to make Game DVR more useful for our customers so please keep the feedback coming. Use the Feedback Hub app to log suggestions for Game DVR, you can find us under the "Apps &amp;
 Games" category. We use this feedback to prioritize our work for the next release, so your voice definitely matters!</p>

            Thanks Rohan for giving me update on GAME DVR, I already know about the insider build.. I used it myself, still I would like to inform you that 60fps / very high have bugs.. it records with variable frame rates each time, I tried it blackops 3, withcer
 3, league of legends at 60FPS capped or uncapped, even with Vsync on or off, its the same, DVR doesn't capture at 60fps at all.. somewhere around 38-45.. I'm Using AMD Radeon R9 270X for test bench alongside Nvidia GTX 980.. Please have a look.. thank you.

            <p>I'm saddened to hear that you are getting 38-45 fps when requesting 60. Can you verify that you are achieving 60 fps&nbsp;before trying to record? Both those cards are reasonably powered so you should not have any trouble getting 60 fps&nbsp;without recording, assuming
 your RAM, CPU,&nbsp;etc. are on par.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you mind logging a bug for us in the Feedback Hub? I'd like to dig in further. Let's focus on just one game of your choice, VSYNC off. Use a tool like Fraps or OBS to ensure that you are actually seeing 60+fps before recording. Here are the steps to
 file the bug.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From Start, launch dxdiag.exe and save all information to&nbsp;dxdiag.txt</li><li>Launch Xbox app, and set Game DVR Video Encoding setting to Very High (60fps)</li><li>Launch the Feedback Hub, go to the Apps &amp; Games category, Game DVR subcategory.</li><li>Add new feedback, mark it as a Problem (important).</li><li>Attach the dxdiag file.</li><li>Launch your game.</li><li>Click the "Begin monitoring" button &amp; try to record&nbsp; a video. After some time, stop recording.</li><li>Click the "Stop monitoring" button.</li><li>In the notes, please mention what the actual FPS was. If it's a short video, go ahead and attach it to the bug.</li><li>Click the "Submit" button to send the bug to us.</li></ol>
<p>Thanks for helping us narrow the issue down, Vicky.</p>

            Any updates on this? It's now December 29, 2016, and I found this page as I was searching for why my game DVR isn't recording in 60 fps. Even though I set the settings to record in 60 fps, my captures are 25 fps. Considering in the game I'm attempting
 to record, I'm at 70 fps.

<p>Actually I did have something to say, the out put has a audio sync problem. That is probably because of frame rate variations in the video recording. I want to know if there is a fix to this that maybe I'm just not seing. Because I use the game recorder
 to record some gameplay for my YouTube channel and all the clips were in usable because the audio was screwed up. Thanks</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know its a long time, but I had the same problem with Windows 10 Creator Update, and game dvr : I've only Intel chipset (HD 620), recorded in 1080x60p in high quality, on the old game Re-Volt running with Vsync ON 60fps, fan-ported and running actually
 on OpenGL. The final recording lack some frames, with a average of 53fps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I experimented different settings, and found a great alternative to recover some fps, before you try to lower your settings for the recorder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just disabled the sync in game, but if I record with sync off, the result is awful like 4 fps or 40fps with Game Mode off (probably because it prioritize more the game than the recording).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I capped my game in 60fps sync off with Rivatuner statistics server. And bingo, I recovered some perfs, enough to reach the stable 60fps in recording.<br />
<br />
So, you can try this:&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Vsync off</p>
<p>- Cap 60fps in your graphics settings (if you can), or with a tierce software like Rivatuner Statistic Server.</p>
<p>- If you don't reach enough, consider to lower the capping to 50 maybe, for a stable 50fps recording, or disable settings in your game, like antialising (which is very demanding in ressources).<br />
<br />
Have fun.<br />
