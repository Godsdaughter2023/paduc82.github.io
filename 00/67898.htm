<h2>            DCOM98 and Windows 7</h2>
                    I have a program that requires dcom98 to be installed to run.&nbsp; When I try to install DCOM98, running it as Windows 98 compatible it says there is another version of dcom98 that must first be removed.&nbsp; What to do?&nbsp;

            Hi DonHoSIGI,<br />
<br />
Enable DCOM and see if that makes any difference.<br />
<br />
<strong>To enable or disable DCOM </strong>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open Component Services.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the console tree, click the <strong>Computers</strong> folder, right-click the computer for which you want to enable or disable DCOM, and then click
<strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the <strong>Default Properties</strong> tab.</p>
</li><li>
<p>To enable DCOM, select the <strong>Enable Distributed COM on this computer</strong> check box. To disable DCOM, clear this check box.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
</li></ol>
Additional considerations
<div>
<ul>
<li>Component Services is no longer in Administrative Tools. To open Component Services, click
<strong>Start</strong>. In the search box, type <strong>dcomcnfg</strong>, and then press ENTER<strong>.</strong><br />
</li><li>When you enable the DCOM service, you also have to configure the firewall on both the computer running the component as well as the computer running Component Services. For details about configuring the firewall for DCOM, see Using Distributed COM with
 Firewalls (<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=38001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=38001</strong></span></a>).<br />
</li><li>If you disable DCOM on a remote computer, you cannot remotely access that computer to enable DCOM again. To enable DCOM again, you must have physical access to that computer.
</li></ul>
<p>Refer the link below for more on the above information;<br />

            Hello DonHoSIGI,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forums.<br />
<br />
You might look at the following KB article but it applies to Windows 98 and I'm not sure it has any relevance. But I would check the version of DCOM98 that you have installed in the registry. Click on the KB article number to view the article.<br />
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/236354" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB Article ID: 236354</a> - Err Msg: A Newer Version of DCOM98 Has Been Installed...<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Restore default your desktop appearance and sounds. Click on "Desktop" under the "Personalization" menu. Click in the check box next to each of the display settings that you wish to return to default settings. Click "Customize" once you have selected all of the settings and click "Restore Default.
<br />

<br />A quick would be:

<br />Open the Settings App

<br />Go to Personalization - Themes

<br />Choose the Windows Default Theme, that will put everything back as it was initially . . .

            <p>I did a clean boot on both a&nbsp;Microsoft Windows logon and local to no avail. I also attempted to add accounts for Yahoo, MS and Gmail. I had a feeling that was not&nbsp;a conflict or compatibility issue because I run a tight&nbsp;selective start.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas as to what to do to fix this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.<br />
I just noticed the OneNote is not working as well and it appears to have to do something with the account as well. I assume it is related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found that Cortana's "Hey Cortana" feature&nbsp;is not working as intended (it does not stay live and activate with the phrase).&nbsp;It looks like I am having all kinds of issues with the upgrade. I am not really worried about OneNote and Cortana though. I
 am however concerned that I am unable to create an account for mail and calendars but thought I would include the additional information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>12:48 PM 8/5/2015</p>
<p>Strange, "Hey Cortana" started working today.</p>

            <p>I thought I would hit the forum one more time. I have been unable to find a solution for the problem so far. If anyone has any suggestions to resolve this issue please let me know. Even information as to the cause with no resolution&nbsp;would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been seeing reports of people having similar issues if not exactly the same issue. I also have a couple of friends working in the field of "IT" that are experiencing this issue as well. They have subscribed to Office365 I order to work around this
 issue.&nbsp;This is something that I need to have a resolution for in order to move forward on migrating people to Windows 10 so any help would be greatly appreciated. I currently have put all my client upgrades to&nbsp;Windows 10 on hold until I have found a resolution
 or more information as to the cause.</p>
<p>

            <p>Yeah, it is looking pretty bleak as for support options. I ended up resolving the issue on my PC by doing a clean installation of Windows 10. I will not install Windows 10 on any of the business clients that I do "IT" for. I have held them off from upgrading
 to Windows 10 until I feel the bugs, errors and misc. issues are resolved or addressed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did however find a method for removing the native Windows 10 RT apps. uninstalling the mail and Calendar may be a fix but I was unable to try it. Here is the post I created on removing the RT apps from Windows 10.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I feel that the integration of RT apps into the Windows 10 desktop OS was a big mistake and the down fall of an otherwise great OS.</p>

<h2>            MS Wireless Display Adapter Won&#39;t Work</h2>
                    <p>My Microsoft Wireless Display adapter no longer connects since I updated to Windows 10. My computer recognizes it when you hit Win+P, connects, then never gets off the black screen and drops the connection within 10 seconds.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched for updated display drivers, and they are up to date. I tried to update the firmware on the Adapter, but you have to be connected to it for that to work, and it won't connect.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The display adapter worked just fine when using Windows 8.1, but now with 10 it is a useless $60 piece of plastic.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In my case, I can connect to the WDA and project, however, I cannot run the control software app downloaded from MS Store. The app reports that I am NOT CONNECTED to my WDA while I am staring it on my TV screen. As a result, I am unable to check for WDA
 firmware updates and I am unable to resize the screen.</p>

<h2>            What causes Windows to freeze for no apparent reason&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a Samsung laptop with Windows 10 Home installed, upgraded from Win 8, 64 bit, 8GB RAM. Basically everything functions normally and all available Windows Updates &amp; drivers, as well as for other software are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/57bc9dbf-4d87-42d3-8fb0-88c1b65e3bfc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/57bc9dbf-4d87-42d3-8fb0-88c1b65e3bfc?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the last 2 years, for diverse reasons, I have made clean installations now &amp; then. I need to add, that Samsung stopped making notebooks shortly after I bought mine, but even if they provided no drivers &amp; software for Win 10, which came out after this,
 all has functioned well under the new OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once in a while, like yesterday and ALWAYS out of the blue the notebook suddenly freezes and does not react to anything [i.e. both the USB mouse &amp; touchpad do not respond to anything, sound/video ceases, etc], unless I press the power button long enough
 to shut it down and then turn it on again. After that, it starts &amp; works perfectly normally, as if nothing has happened, often for weeks with no incident.<br />
<br />
This is NOT connected to any recent changes, at least that I notice, which is the reason I cannot connect it to any single action and it seems to come out of the blue, unless may be streaming video comes into question.<br />
I mostly have some streaming video site running most of the time I'm online. I do not remember, though whether it has come up exclusively when streaming video is on.</p>
<p>There's no issue with overheating, (with temperatures mostly between 50°C &amp; 69°C, though now &amp; then depending on running task up to the 80s, but not for long) or anything similar or overuse of any resource at such times. Everything is at the time running
 normally one second, only the next second, no reaction.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90b927c2-d480-48f4-a700-b5b8995a0db8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90b927c2-d480-48f4-a700-b5b8995a0db8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, with temps at around 59°C, I have many tasks running, including streaming video in Chrome, Photofiltre image editor used to edit above images, Firefox with multiple add-ons running .. 6 tabs open, a download manager, etc.&nbsp; These are typical processes,
 though they are not always simultaneously running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's rather annoying, though if it happens, because you cannot save anything, and have to force a shut down and start it again, which in such cases takes a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My question: what could be behind this sudden freezing?</strong><br />
</p>
<p>There's no current plan for a Windows fresh installation as I have over the last 2 years had several &amp; there's no guarantee it'd help.</p>
<p><em><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></em> finds no integrity violation and in any case, whatever I would do now, there's no way to say whether it has helped, because ... well as said, sometimes, nothing happens for weeks on end, ...</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Anyway, what could be behind this, with the status quo mentioned above?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards</span></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When the freezing happens, do any error message come up? I'd like to recommend to run your device in Safe Mode with Networking. This way, if the issue doesn't happen there, we can say that it is most probably caused by your used app. Here's how you can go
 to this mode:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press Windows logo key Windows logo key<span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;+<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>I</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>on your keyboard to open Settings. If that doesn't work, select the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;button
 in the lower-left corner of your screen, then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Settings&nbsp;</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Update &amp; security</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Recovery&nbsp;</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Under<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Advanced startup</strong>, select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Restart now</strong>.</span></li><li><span>After your PC restarts to the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Choose an option</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>screen, select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Troubleshoot<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Advanced options</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Startup
 Settings</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Restart</strong>.</span></li><li><span>After your PC restarts, you'll see a list of options. Select 5 or F5 for<span>
</span><strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'll be waiting for your updates.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thank you for the quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>When the freezing happens, do any error message come up? </em><br />
The answer is no. As I said, the PC completely freezes, meaning no error can be shown on the screen.<br />
After a forced shut down + power up as I mentioned, it starts and functions normally as if nothing happened before. There's no Windows error notification, also after.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I'd like to recommend to run your device in Safe Mode with Networking. This way, if the issue doesn't happen there, we can say that it is most probably caused by your used app.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also here, the response is repeatedly implied above, for example in this:<br />
<strong><em>After that (a forced shut down &amp; subsequent power up), it starts &amp; works perfectly normally, as if nothing has happened, often for weeks with no incident. ...<br />
...</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>there's no way to say whether it has helped, because ... well as said, sometimes, nothing happens for weeks on end, ...</em></strong></p>
<p>The problem comes randomly and after the necessary shut down + subsequent turn on, I have never had the problem come up again after a short time. So it'd be impossible to say whether starting in safe mode has helped at all.<br />
If it froze several times every few days, that would be a different case. I think this happened at most after a week, otherwise considerably longer and at random, as fully explained above.<br />
</p>
<p>It'd also be a bit difficult to run the notebook exclusively under safe mode for many days or weeks on end, before I conclude this particular measure has helped, as I use it many hours of each day for work and other functions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That would be the dilemma.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response. The Samsung notebook specifics are here in screenshot form, the motherboard model being (also) the device model name.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b07657b3-2836-44f0-be43-e91742864554?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b07657b3-2836-44f0-be43-e91742864554?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure whether the shown 105°C CPU temp. retrieved by Speccy is what other utilities show. Another program, Wise Care 365 currently shows 54°C as CPU temp., which feels more like it, as the notebook is not hot at all.
</p>
<p>

<p>There was previously an issue with AMD processors on build 16299.214 and after confirming that you're on the latest one, seems that everything is good. Please try to observe on the apps you're running before the freezing starts. It may be possible that there
 is a software or app causing the issue. </p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>So after waiting and hoping all was OK, just before sending this message, as usual out of the blue the notebook froze.<br />
<br />
I have been using it for over 10 hours, with almost same programs running all the time, including MS Word, Firefox, Chrome (a tab with streaming video), Audials (passive mode), Avira Phantom VPN. MediathekView (passive mode).</p>
<p>At the time it suddenly froze, I had started no new program for hours.</p>
<p>Apart from MediathekView, which I use every few days to download some videos, the other programs are on most of the time, Avira now &amp; then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed no new program today, last Windows Updates installed on 14th March. All software is up-to-date, according to iObit Driver Booster &amp; Glary Utilities Software Updator Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The notebook was certainly not too hot. The few times it's gotten too hot with CPU temps over 85°C, none has ever led to the PC restarting or freezing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's nothing I can reasonably pin this to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's quite annoying to have to force a shutdown with subsequent power up, scan of drive, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No Windows or other notification ... everything just functions normally after, probably for the coming 4, 5, 6 weeks ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What to do or what could be behind this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>

<p>Hi xprt007,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Performance issues such as random freezes are usually caused by running apps, out-of-date drivers, memory usage, or settings that we sometimes overlook. Kindly check the power plan that the PC is using by going to
<strong>Control </strong><strong>Panel </strong>&gt; <strong>Power Options</strong>. If it's high, I suggest using
<strong>Balanced</strong>. Additionally, see the suggestions in this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4002019/windows-10-improve-pc-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> on how to improve PC performance
 in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thank you for responding.</p>
<p>I have been using one whose exact name somehow disappeared from the options after coming to the Control Settings, saw &amp; selected Samsung Optimized ( ... for balancing performance &amp; power consumption on Samsung computers), which I thought I had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, after that I no longer have the option which was selected before, whose name I had not noted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Balanced" is there, though. <br />
You say: <em>"If it's high, I suggest using <strong>Balanced</strong>."</em><br />
Would you consider it better than this Samsung Optimized Option? I had assumed this uses less consumption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the recommended suggestions in this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4002019/windows-10-improve-pc-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> I can say I basically have them already fulfilled where
 possible.</p>
<ol>
<li>I repeatedly mention above ALL current <em>Windows Updates, drivers &amp; installed programs</em> are up-to-date &amp; updates are constantly installed as soon as they are available (iObit Driver Booster &amp; Glary Utilities Software Updator Pro ... do a good job).
 For Windows Updates, I do check every other day.<br />
</li><li><em>Restart your PC and open only the apps you need</em>: I have no reason to believe this is an issue, esp. considering the programs mostly in use all the time are Firefox, Chrome, MS Word, Audials, etc, which I have always had. The few others in use at
 the time of freezing, are used frequently, though not necessarily at the same time.<br />
</li><li><em>With the 8GB RAM</em>, the couple of times I have had the freezing, no reason to believe it has been an issue. Currently, with Firefox with several tabs open, with Chrome (streaming video, etc) around 46% - 51% and fluctuating at most to 65% in last
 hour for a few moments &amp; if so, certainly NOT at the time of freezing. I have never had freezing even when using Pinnacle Studio 18 Ultimate or any other video or graphic editor or when converting video, although the memory use goes up, but it never gets critical
 enough. If I notice that in that case, especially with video rendering/conversion, I have closed video streaming or some one or so processes. None of those process was running though, the times it has frozen.</li><li><em>Disk space</em> not an issue with 60GB free on system disk</li><li><em>Restoration point:</em> if I knew some recent change was responsible, it would make sense. Each time freezing has come up, it seems to be out of the blue. If I force a shutdown &amp; then power up, the notebook functions 100% normally for the next&nbsp; 4, 5,
 6 weeks as if nothing happened before, no Windows error notification, etc ... until it freezes again out of the blue. If it's caused by some process/program I had on at the time, it would freeze again within days, because I use most of those program like those
 running last time all the time or at most every few days</li><li><em>Disabling unnecessary start-up programs</em>: this has always been religiously enforced. Currently, only Emsisoft antivirus, Javascript Update scheduler, Realtek camera &amp; Windows Defender (set to occasionally scan) enabled, 10 others disabled.</li><li><em>Check for and remove viruses and malware:</em> according to Emsisoft AV, Malwarebytes free, Windows Defender, machine clean, according to recent scans</li><li><em>Check for corrupted Windows system files:</em> Just run DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth, result:
<em>No component store corruption detected.</em> <br />
I assume I do not have to run RestoreHealth ...<br />
The last time mentioned above I run&nbsp;<em><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></em> ... it found nothing bad, running it again the last hour, ... result:
<em>"Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."</em></li><li><em>Adjust the appearance and performance of Windows:</em> I will consider this, but I think with the 8GB RAM it's not an issue, especially the time I remember it freezing, memory use was probably not too high based on the programs running at the time,
 unless there was a sudden &amp; inexplicable memory surge I did not notice, immediately followed by freezing.</li><li><em>One Drive:</em> is one thing I always have disabled or at least never use, never configured it.</li><li>Reset PC: I think either shortly before the first freezing reported in original post or some time after, I had for some unconnected reason reset the PC.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>In any case, whatever changes I make, it's hard to say whether they have helped unless it does not freeze in the same way after 2, 3 months or probably more to be sure. The couple of times it has frozen, as repeatedly mentioned has happened after many weeks
 apart.</p>

<p>I appreciate all the details you provided. As previously suggested by<strong> Ian Ser</strong>, starting your PC in safe mode is something you can try to further isolate the issue. I do agree with you that it is not possible to use your PC in safe mode while
 doing what you usually do on your PC, however, I still suggest that you give it a try every now and then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also check the application event log for any errors, as well as the system log. Below are TechNet articles for your reference:</p>

<p><span>I really appreciate your time and suggestions.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>Regarding checking <strong>application </strong>&amp;<strong> system logs</strong>, I did that for the 24<sup>th</sup> March and made a short screen video here:
</span><a href="https://youtu.be/Moh4JVxTDv0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://youtu.be/Moh4JVxTDv0</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/Moh4JVxTDv0?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/Moh4JVxTDv0?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div> (full screen best).</p>
<ul>
<li>Application Event Log for Errors: Since in the article they mention looking for error messages, I quickly scroll through ... no error for the whole of that day.</li><li>System Log: Here there are a number of warnings and errors. Of interest is the time around 18:00 hours as the freezing came shortly after that I suspect.<br />
In the video I scroll slowly so you can hopefully view some of the messages towards this time and some time after.<br />
From around 16:00, it seems the warnings are associated with DNS, or connection issues, ... or not?<br />
<br />
<strong>Error</strong> at 18:44:49 - <em>"The previous system shutdown at 6:09:37 PM on ‎3/‎24/‎2018 was unexpected."</em> ... Could that be referring to the forced shutdown after freezing, shortly before that?<br />
<br />
<strong>Critical</strong> at 18:44:12 - <em>"The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly."</em><br />
<br />
May be you can understand &amp; interpret some of the messages after that ... I got the impression most had nothing to do with the freezing/forced shutdown.</li></ul>
<p>I hope you can help decipher something out of that, or which time range can I review again?</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>I do agree with you that it is not possible to use your PC in safe mode while doing what you usually do on your PC, however, I still suggest that you give it a try every now and then.<br />
</span></em></p>
<p>I guess I have to somehow find a way, but ...</p>
<p><span>Just in case I just haven't thought of it, how do you think I could do this? As said, the freezing comes seemingly out of the blue, after weeks, for example on 23rd Feb. Next time was on 24th March, when I reported again, to which you responded. I
 was working normally like I had been for many hours that day, typing something when the mouse ceased moving ... Then I noticed everything else had ceased to work.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>The commonest programs I have running are almost always Firefox, Chrome, Audials in passive mode, if there's a video stream running, very likely, Mozilla Thunderbird, MS Word. Other typical programs frequently used include Media Player Classic. Typical
 processes include Windows explorer, Portable apps, others on now &amp; then MediathekView (every few days), Avira Phantom VPN (about 2, 3 hours a day, then in passive mode). Those are the programs I use 90% of the time. Could one of these go crazy at some random
 times and be behind this?</span></p>
<p><span>The freezing has never come after having started some program, etc. or it'd have been possible to have something, other than those commonly used programs above to suspect. So that's why it'd even be hard to determine when it would make sense to try
 Safe Mode, because the freezing occurrences are weeks apart ...</span></p>
<p><span>Do I run it in safe mode without Firefox, Chrome ... (I assume, they run ... etc?)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks &amp; kind regards</p>

<p>I assume you are using Windows 7 and trying to connect to network wirelessly?&nbsp;There are numerous threads on here for precisely this issue and some not very unhelpful answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you tried to manually add the wireless network and selected connect automatically?&nbsp;&nbsp;
 This appears to have solved my problems.</p>
<p>1. Open Network and Sharing Centre (Click Start - Control Panel - Network and Sharing Centre)</p>
<p>2. Click on Manage Wireless Networks on left hand side and a new window opens - Manage wireless networks that use (Wireless Connections)</p>
<p>3. Click on Add</p>
<p>4. Click on Manually Add a Network Profile</p>
<p>5. Enter Network Name - Security Type and Security Key (this info should have been provided by your internet provider)</p>
<p>6. Tick box which says "Connect automatically when this network is in range" and click Next button</p>
<p>7. Click Close button on next window that opens (or you can have a look at the settings if you like and then click on Close)</p>

    <title>GDI &#43; Window message when restarting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gmopro  say:</h3>
<h2>            GDI &#43; Window message when restarting</h2>
                    <p>So i had this issue and someone from MSFT helped me fix it by running scans and installing something and checking the registry. He then had me restart and asked me to let him know when the pc was back up. &nbsp;The call got disconnected during reboot and the
 chat session never came back. &nbsp;He never called me back which was troubling. &nbsp;I would think he would call me back after all that. &nbsp;SO i called in to MS and there was no way to get back in touch with him. I wasnt given a case number and i dont think he ever
 took my cell number. &nbsp;I guess that is why he didnt call back. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>They should always provide a case number and get your phone number. Lesson learned ..i will always ask for a case number. &nbsp;i am not sure &nbsp;if he was finished , but the problem seems to be gone now. &nbsp; This person was knowledgeable , but you still need to do
 your job properly and get the information logged. &nbsp;Hard to believe there is no way to get back in touch as i did have his name from the chat. &nbsp; &nbsp;Need the case number though and never got it. &nbsp; So get a case number and give them your phone number and say, call
 me back if we are disconnected. &nbsp; I guess not everyone is trained to do that. Has anyone else run into this problem???</p>

            <p>As I said above, I think the problem is gone, but I am not sure. &nbsp;It hasnt shown that message in 2 restarts so I think it is gone. &nbsp; i will try to figure out how to submit feedback on this. &nbsp;It caused a lot of frustration and stress. &nbsp;Each phone support
 person should give us a case number and get our phone number. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Where do i get this contact support app? &nbsp;Can you provide more information on that??&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I think this issue may have been due to malware. &nbsp;It may have come through with MS Edge, but i am not sure. &nbsp;I have Norton Security paid subscription, but i dont think it protects Edge, only IE and Google Chrome. &nbsp;I dont use Edge for that reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Day later: no issue with restart. &nbsp;The msft tech supp person never called back. MSFT said he would, but he never did. &nbsp;oh well, case is closed. &nbsp;in future, i will always giv phone number and get that case number up front!! &nbsp;Management...train the tech people
 properly. THnk you!</p>

<p>I need to get to know my pc. &nbsp;Still really new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So anyway, is this GDI + Window thing really a big deal or just a nuisance?</p>
<p>I no longer see it when restarting,.. only when shutting down. &nbsp;It doesnt really hold up the shut down either. Machine shuts down rapidly.. &nbsp;good machine..new machine. &nbsp;So should i worry about a briefly visible GDI + window message on the screen? or just
 let this go? &nbsp;Can it cause any issues in the future? &nbsp;I seem to spend lots of time troubleshooting Win10 issues and i just want to use my pc to do productive things, not fix contant issues. My time is valuable.</p>

    <title>Unexpected Kernel Mode Trap - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unexpected Kernel Mode Trap</h2>
                    <div>
<p><font>Hello All</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've done some research on here already but I can't see any answers to not being able to see the mini dump files. So yesterday everything was fine - I've downloaded some web template PSD files from Themeforest - everything ok. Was using them in
 adobe and dragging to my web software. No problem. I had the google APP installed on my PC but it was pretty rubbish so when my web software kept on going to that to review my site I decided to uninstall. Went to the home screen, right clicked, uninstalled.
 After that I got the blue screen- several times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I've looked in the mini dump file which is empty - I have windows 8 pro from historical XP so could only purchase XP pro - therefore I have to go in as administrator for some things. In administrator this is also empty.&nbsp; I've used the diagnostics
 tools in windows 8 - no memory problems, no issues found that security or updates will help - I've done a system health check which has highlighted some failures which I don't understand - and I get the windows action centre - clearly an issue but the problem
 is I have no filestore called MEMORY.DMP in either administrator or my profile - so where is it saving these dumps? I've got hidden files viewed.&nbsp; Apart from restoring my pc to before yesterday I can't find any way to fix this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sorry about the rubbish font but I can't seem to change it.&nbsp; I've also got the health check file saved online if that would help. Any assistance greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi TeamZigZag</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks for the reply. below is the link to the dump files - thanks for the instructions on getting the file to write! I've also included in the folder the sys32 file.&nbsp; The dump file was actually really small so not sure if it will have anything useful. I
 also downloaded the windows SDK to read the .dmp file but it comes out as gobbled gook so hopefully you can read it.</p>

            Hi
<div><br />
<div>Well I have to say I am very surprised at that and a little concerned. I moved my computer on Sunday 31 March from upstairs to downstairs so the whole thing was unplugged, disconnected and moved - that was just 5 days ago. The PC is also switched off at
 the plug every night without fail. &nbsp;I even watch it shut itself down as my screen goes black before the pc light goes off so I wait to make sure its off. I did leave it on by mistake wednesday night this week but that was just one night.
<div><br />
<div>Ok so have run the SFC and it says Microsoft resource protection did not find any integrity violations.
<div><br />
<div>Thanks very much again</div>
<div><br />
<div>Mina</div>

            <p>Well short of the shutdown function in windows 8 not actually meaning shutdown, and the light on the pc going off meaning its still running or the plug on the wall actually not switching off it sounds to me like my pc is having an issue with writing the
 correct information to its system. I'm also guessing that nothing in the log file actually gave any indication to a failing application or file?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>short of any suggested reason from&nbsp;anyone else&nbsp;as why it might think its still on when its not it sounds like a system restore might be in order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for looking anyway.</p>

            HI,<br />
<br />
Does it have an Optical drive? The Flex 2-15 and Flex 2-15D have one and the others<br />
have a dummy port.<br />
<br />
Check in File Explorer - if shown Right Click on it EJECT.<br />
<br />
Check with Lenovo Support, their on-line documentation, and ask in their forums about<br />
any known issues.<br />

                    There's a temporary problem with the service. Please try again. If you continue to get this message, try again later when trying to get a code for password reset. I've chatted with an agent and he told me that the website engineer is fixing the issue but
 the problem is still there. I have tried everything including switching browsers, device, etc. but does not work. Please help me, thanks. I would like to get back to my Skype account with a code.

            <p>Hi Shams, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have any issues related to workflow engine? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A workflow engine is a software application that manages and executes modeled computer processes. It is a key component in workflow technology and typically makes use of a database server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A workflow engine interprets events, such as documents submitted to a server or due dates expiring, and acts on them according to defined computer processes. The actions may be anything from saving the document in a document management system to issuing
 new work by sending an e-mail to users or escalating overdue work items to management. A workflow engine facilitates the flow of information, tasks, and events. Workflow engines may also be referred to as a Workflow Orchestration Engines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have more questions regarding Workflow engine, you may post the question in msdn forum forums more information.

    <title>This version of Windows is no longer supported by the Windows Store - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> justinwearne  say:</h3>
<h2>            This version of Windows is no longer supported by the Windows Store</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
Two days ago I went to the Windows store to upgrade to Windows 8.1 from Windows 8 Pro. It took a while but the upgrade appears to have worked. But, now when I go to the Windows Store it states that "This version of Windows is no longer supported by the Windows
 Store".<br />
<br />
It recommends I get the newest version of Windows which ultimately leads back to the store with the above error message.<br />
<br />
Have I successfully upgraded or not? How can I get the Windows Store working if it has been successful?<br />
<br />
Any advice here would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
I had Windows 8 Pro before the upgrade and I have never downloaded the Windows 8.1 Preview.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue could be related to corrupt Store settings. This might also occur if Windows 8.1 update is not installed properly.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you having the same issue while using any other apps apart from Store?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check for the current version of Windows using the following steps:</p>
<p>a) Press <strong>Windows and X</strong> key together and select<strong> System</strong>.</p>
<p>b) Check for the version of Windows showing up under <strong>System Properties</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>You can follow the steps to reset Windows Store cache memory and check if it resolves the issue:</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000">a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the desktop screen, press
<strong>Windows and R</strong> key to open run box.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000">b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Type <strong>WSReset.exe</strong> and hit

            <p>Hi Pinaki,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It seems to be working now.&nbsp; The only thing that appeared to not be working was the Windows Store though I won't say I went through every app installed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Initially I had checked those properties and it was saying Windows 8.1 Pro. I had also reset the Store using WSReset.exe and had no luck.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have logged in this morning however, and it just works now. I do not believe a restart has changed anything because I did that a lot after I initially got the issue and tried the WSReset.exe.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I can't be certain but I note that I got an automated update around the time I raised the forum post and had turned my computer off shortly after. Is it possible that fixed it?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Anyway, glad it appears to be working now. Thanks for your help.</p>
<p><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, the KB2895219 is&nbsp;related to&nbsp;Runtimebroker.exe process crashes on a Windows 8.1-based computer. Additionally, after the Runtimebroker.exe process crashes, you receive an error message that states that you are not connected to the Windows Store.</p>

    <title>Limitations on Windows 7 ReadyBoost&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Limitations on Windows 7 ReadyBoost&#63;</h2>
                    After reading that Windows 7 ReadyBoost will handle up to 256GB across eight devices, I purchased a 16GB Sandisk Cruzer USB flash stick, which claimed it was enhanced for ReadyBoost usage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when I instruct Windows 7 (64-bit Ultimate) to use
 the flash stick solely for ReadyBoost, it states it can only use up to 4GB of the 16GB.&nbsp;&nbsp; (I do have 8GB of RAM installed, but I assume that won't limit me on the ReadyBoost.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sandisk support claims this is a Windows 7 limitation.&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing some research,
 I found that Vista also had ReadyBoost, but was limited to 4GB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this device was designed for Vista and will not take advantage of the higher limitations of Win 7?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am disappointed and baffled.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any input would be appreciated.

            I'm trying to remember, but I think the file format limits you. If you have a FAT16 or 32&nbsp;format then it limits to 4gig, but if you use NTFS or exFAT (consider using exFAT if you don't need to use the stick in older OSs) it should use the whole thing.
 I'm using an exFAT 8gig stick and the whole thing is accepted for Readyboost.

            The problem is not that they don't open its that they don't print and give you no option but to save as&nbsp;then it wont save to a document folder it wants only to save under the user folder. There is also no cancel once the document is opened the only way
 to get out is to close edge.

</p><p>I'm also having trouble with Microsoft Print to PDF. Using the Edge browser I select Print to PDF. A box appears and says PDF saved to Documents folder. However I don't see the PDF in my docs folder. Does not give me an&nbsp;option as to&nbsp;where to save the PDF.</p>

            <p>I don't get a box telling me it has been saved but thanks for the reference to the Documents folder where I can now find a long list of PDF documents that I thought hadn't printed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be VERY helpful to be given a Save To option rather than just dump them in the Documents folder.</p>

            <p>thanks for your suggestion, but sorry, does not work - </p>
<p>I am in the MAIL or EDGE application in WIN10 - and hit Ctrl. P (or use PRINT) - for normal documents no problem to print in PDF. (with Microsoft Print to PDF as a printer)
</p>
<p>There is something happening, (the little activity circle turns) - but then I cannot find where the PDF was saved. I checked the download folder, but the file is not there.
</p>
<p>can the path where the PDF saved be specified?</p>
<p />
