<h2>            Can I use office online if I don&#39;t want to use OneDrive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Google Drive and have a Chromebook. So when I click "open document" on my office online web app I want it to also display me the options every other app offers me. To open a locally saved file and (and this is in this case nearly the same) a Google
 Drive saved file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is this possible?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open local documents with Office Online would be enough already. How do I do it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best</p>
<p>Marcel</p>

Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.<br />
<br />
As of now it is not possible to directly open the documents saved on local drive&nbsp;in Office Online.&nbsp;You first&nbsp;need to upload the Office application file to OneDrive and then can access the same through Office Online applications.<br />
<br />
Hope the above information helps. </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you have any other queries related to Office products, feel free to reply and I'll be happy to further assist you.<br />

Thank you.</span>

            Send it via Freepost to Thetford or take to a local Nokia repair centre. Sounds like it needs a firmware update. If under warranty will be repaired for free :)

                    How do I insert page numbers within my header? I also see no area to insert citations or references. I have checked every button on the tool bar with no success. I downloaded and paid for Microsoft office for my I pad for doing schoolwork on the go. Do
 I need a different program or are these functions hidden?

<p>
</p><p>My school are currently using Sway for profiling and a few of the teachers have noticed that they have reached their picture limit and can no longer add additional photos. &nbsp;Is there anyway they can increase their limit by buying a licence or is the limit
 capped at 300 images for each? &nbsp;Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>300 is the per-Sway limit for images.&nbsp; Please see this article:&nbsp; <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-more-content-to-your-sways-with-office-365-87392bc1-7a34-46b3-bfd1-74fdb3af50c4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>One thing they could consider doing is making multiple Sways and then embedding them in another master Sway.&nbsp; Content in embedded Sways does not count against the content limit for any Sway it is embedded in.</p>

            <p>Since this is the Word forum, I'll answer only for Word: go to File | Options | Proofing | AutoCorrect Options | AutoFormat As You Type and clear the check box for "Internet and network paths with hyperlinks."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for Excel, the solution I have found is to type them in the formula bar rather than in the cell itself, but it appears that there is a similar AutoFormat As You Type setting in Excel.</p>

            <p>Hello Scott:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issues you are having signing into the Zune software.&nbsp; I have seen several reports of this error with a few different causes.&nbsp; This can be an indication of connection issues, temporary service outages, issues
 with specific accounts or issues on the computer being used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a few things I would like you to try to see if the issue can be narrowed down.&nbsp; The first being, to try and sign into the Zune software on a different computer on a different network.&nbsp; Additionally, if you have access to another account or can
 have someone try to sign into your Zune software with their account this will also be helpful.&nbsp; We would like to determine if this might be account or service related.&nbsp; Please let us know what happens with these tests as it may help us determine where to focus
 future troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next. I would like you to verify you can successfully sign into other locations with this account.&nbsp; Please try signing into
<a href="http://xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.com</a> , <a href="http://music.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://music.xbox.com</a> and
<a href="http://video.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://video.xbox.com</a> .&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I would suggest you do a long power cycle of your network.&nbsp; We suggest you disconnect the router and modem for at least 5 minutes and then reconnect and power up.&nbsp; Once the system has fully rebooted, try signing in again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I would suggest you try uninstalling and reinstalling the Zune software to your computer.&nbsp; Use the following tool as a guide to fully uninstall,
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/zune/software/remove-and-reinstall-zune" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/zune/software/remove-and-reinstall-zune</a> .&nbsp; When you are ready to re-install, do so from here,

<h2>            disable powerpoint web app toolbar.</h2>
                    We use office web app integrated with Sharepoint 2010. I can embed powerpoint web app with Page Viewer web part and can also open presentation in the browser. However, I want user to only see the slides. We do not want to allow them to open the presentation
 in the PowerPoint. Ideally disabling all toolbar buttons of powerpoint web app along with File menu. Is that possible?

                    <p>Hello.&nbsp; Wednesday night I had all my emails in my Inbox, Thursday morning they all had disappeared from my InBox.&nbsp; This had to of been something that the outlook team did in an overnight process.&nbsp; How can these be put back in my Inbox (they are not recoverable
 from the deleted folder because I never deleted them.&nbsp; I've had my Hotmail.com email since 1996 and had lots of emails that I need to get back.</p>

</p><p>Same problem here but I had the S3 before the Ativ S and that did exactly the same.</p>
<p>This morning I was lying there awake waiting for the alarm to go&nbsp;off, nothing, &nbsp;no sound at all. Really annoying.

    <title>Rule - Move Email to Folder &#38; Show in Inbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nickvee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rule - Move Email to Folder &#38; Show in Inbox</h2>
                    <p>I have a rule created to move a message to a specific folder bases on who sent it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue with the rule that the new messages do not show up in the 'Inbox'.&nbsp; I have to click view each folder to see the new message within them.&nbsp; The only indication of a new email is a number next to the folder.
<br />
<br />
I am not used to not seeing new messages in the inbox, is there a way to show the message in the inbox even though it's moved to a folder?&nbsp; I see the option for Move a copy to a specific folder, but I don't really want duplicates of messages.&nbsp; A rule called
 "Apply" message to specific folder would be best.<br />
<br />
I thought this would be a given, but I suppose move literally means move out of inbox.&nbsp; Not exactly optimal for me.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for the help!</p>

            There are lots of ways to do this. One simple way is to create a custom show within your larger presentation. You can simply choose the slides you want in the custom show and go to Slide Show &gt; Set Up Show to only view the custom show and change it back
 when you want to view the whole thing. You could also go to the File menu and choose Save As to make a copy of your original under a different name. Now, delete the extra slides from that copy. You will have two presentations, one with all the slides and one
 with the smaller subset. Finally, you could start a new presentation and go to the Insert menu and choose Slide From &gt; Other Presentation.<br />

    <title>Adjusting the location of a hyperlink screen tip. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gregoryness  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adjusting the location of a hyperlink screen tip.</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to create a situation where I can use hyperlinks within the same worksheet to create a hover over effect to provide definition of a metric. I've used this before with success where I hyperlink to A1 in the same worksheet and the screen tip text
 pops up right next to where the hyperlink is located. In a recent worksheet, I've got the hyperlink in row 18 but when I hover over, the screen tip pops up way up in the A1 location basically in the row of column letters. Pretty far away from the link. Is
 there any way to adjust where that text of the screen tip pops up. The link is in I 18 and I'd want the tip to pop up close to that when I hover on it. Any help would be great!</p>
<p>

 How can I do that? For example: If cell F 2 has "3/10 or 4/10" , then the formula above =MIN(SUM(A2:B2),10) applied, if it doesnt show 3/10 or 4/10 then it will just show the value in cell A2. Please help!</p>

            Well, a year later we're still having the same issue with our IMAP email accounts hosted at Google. Using Outlook 2011 for Mac, when a message has been replied to already by some other mail app (on my iPhone, iPad, or in Apple Mail), Outlook 2011 for Mac
 does not indicate a "replied to" icon next to the message. It *should* indicate this with a purple arrow, but it doesn't.
<div><br />
<div>We've been testing Apple Mail alongside Outlook for a week now, and Apple Mail correctly indicates a message when it has been replied to - regardless of which device or mail app was used to reply to the message. This is a very obvious bug/oversight in
 Outlook's programming, and has forced us to discontinue use of Outlook as our primary email app. If anyone has an update to the issue, or a workaround, we'd be happy to follow through on it and return to using Outlook if it's a legitimate fix.</div>

            We've reproduced it on all our Macs - on 4 separate installations/machines. We also noticed that on a recent new Mac that had its Microsoft User Data re-imported, Outlook lost the history of all emails that had been responded to as well. This was infuriating.
<div><br />
<div>Given that Microsoft has updated Outlook maybe a couple times a year since it's release, I'd assume there aren't many updates forthcoming for Outlook 2011. Especially since a new version is already out on the market. Apple's Mail app has many shortcomings,
 but it knows when you've already replied to an email from some other app/device/web mail, etc. It seems like Email 101, but what do I know.</div>

            <div>I haven't seen that myself, but it is true indeed that IMAP and </div>

            Thanks for offering your assistance. Our accounts are IMAP, hosted at Google. As I'd mentioned earlier in the thread, Apple's Mail knows when an email has already been replied to. Additionally, going all the way back to the first email it downloaded from
 my account when we started testing it, it knew which emails I'd already replied and it indicated as such in the email list view. We've been using Mail alongside Outlook all week for testing, and Outlook simply doesn't indicate it all.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>On the one Mac that was new and had Outlook user data imported into it, that one also had its identity rebuilt - I followed your recommendation from March 19 and it didn't help (see reply from March 19). We're cutting our losses with Outlook at this point.
 Perhaps we'll return to it in the future.</div>

            <p>I have just had to reinstall Outlook 2011 on my iMac after reformatting the hard disk. &nbsp;To my total astonishment I have found that all the "replied to" flags have been lost. Hence I have found this old thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I simply CANNOT BELIEVE that after 5 years this problem has not been fixed by Microsoft!!!!! This IS AN UTTER DERELICTION OF DUTY OF CARE by a so-called professional vendor of software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been regular updates to this software issued - I am using 14.1.0 (110310). &nbsp;No further updates are available. WHY DO I HAVE TO SUFFER THIS PAIN AS A RESULT OF MICROSOFT'S INEFFICIENCY? &nbsp;I am now going to have to either downgrade to Entourage 2008
 or, I suppose, buy the 2016 version. &nbsp;I wonder if it has been fixed in that version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>WILL SOMEONE FROM MICROSOFT PLEASE REPLY TO ME WITH ADVICE - IF THEY DARE?</p>

            <p>OK, so now I have installed Office 2016 obtained by professional membership of the BizSpark programme. I was not prepared to pay for Office 2016 until I was sure that this issue was fixed. I could not get an answer from Microsoft as to whether it had or
 had not been fixed, despite calls to their Office for Mac "specialists".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's the great news! &nbsp;The issue is NOT FIXED! &nbsp;In Outlook 2016 the Reply-To flags for IMAP4 messages that have previously been replied to are NOT DISPLAYED. &nbsp;Only messages that are replied to from the current installed copy of Outlook are displayed
 correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am therefore going to have to revert to using Entourage 2008, which is the only Mac version of "Outlook" that works properly. Either that or use Thunderbird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THIS IS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF PATHETIC PERFORMANCE BY MICROSOFT!</p>

<h2>            Ignore conversation feature not working in Outlook</h2>
                    <p>I receive several emails daily from all kinds of email addresses that aren't valid.&nbsp; I am trying to stop them from coming to my inbox but when I try using the "ignore conversation" option, this does not work.&nbsp; I keep getting the same emails with the same
 subject line in them.</p>
<p>How does the ignore conversation option work?&nbsp; Let's say I get 2 emails with the same subject line, but from 2 different email addresses (this is what is happening in my case).&nbsp; Does this option just stop emails from that one specific email address or is
 it supposed to stop all emails with that same subject line?</p>
<p>What else can I do to stop these emails?</p>

<p>Hello Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Ignore Conversation</strong> option works when there is a thread in the email. For example when you send a message to someone and then they reply a Conversation results. In many Conversations, there might be many replies back and forth, or even multiple
 people all replying to parts of the Conversation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ignore Conversation removes all messages related to the conversation that you select, and moves future messages in the conversation directly to your Deleted Items folder.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the description that you've shared, it seems that you're getting spam emails. You may receive these kind of emails when using your Microsoft account to a non-related Microsoft site that are unsafe/suspicious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Blocking the sender will not work for this situation since as you've mentioned, you're receiving emails with same subject but
<strong>different domains</strong>. I would suggest that you use instead the Safe Senders list. See the articles below on how to filter Junk Email and to know more about Safe Senders list:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/overview-of-the-junk-email-filter-5ae3ea8e-cf41-4fa0-b02a-3b96e21de089" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Overview of the Junk Email Filter</a></li><li><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change-the-level-of-protection-in-the-junk-email-filter-e89c12d8-9d61-4320-8c57-d982c8d52f6b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Change the level of protection in the Junk Email Filter</a></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I recommend that you use the <strong>Report Message</strong> add-in. Here's a

<p>Our Internal Support team have been receiving reports about this activities and they’re always able to manage resolving the issue. However, overtime, some malicious senders have also managed to figure out a way to push thru the Email Filtering Protocol of
 Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a user’s end, I recommend that you keep on blocking the sender. Refer to this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-a-mail-sender-b29fd867-cac9-40d8-aed1-659e06a706e4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> on how to block a mail sender. After blocking the mail sender, it will help our Support Engineers generate a report out of it and will be able to investigate on how to get rid of these senders. This way, you can eliminate on receiving an email from
 the sender. If the Junk/Spam emails received are landing on Junk folder, you don’t have to worry about it as it is created by design which means that the Junk filtering protocol is working.</p>

            Hi Alexandrrr1
<br />
<br />Whether you can see a contact or not does not indicate you have been blocked
<br />
<br />If you can see them as online or last seen up to 6 hours ago, you are not blobked
<br />
<br />If that suddenly jumps to last seen X Days ago, most likely they have blocked you . . .

            Hi Alexanderrr1<br /><br />Try sending a message. If you see an exclamation mark next to the message it’s possible your contact blocked you. You also can see the exclamation mark if the other person has not yet added you but there is not a way to make sure your contact blocked you.

<h3> miztaziggy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with OVI online status</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone<br />
<br />
My girlfriend and I recently both got the N900 and created ovi accounts. We could use it for instant messaging between phones and the contact on the desktop showed a little green dot next to the name to show if the other was online. If not there was a little
 white 'x'.<br />
<br />
For some reason today the little green dot has gone and we can no longer see if the other is online or not. The location status message and status messages have also disappeared from the contact card (these used to show up beneath her picture).<br />
<br />
I can still send the IM's to her and there is still the green dot next to her name on the list of IM's, but not on the contact on the desktop now, nor next to her name in the contact list.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else had this problem or know of a setting that might have accidentally been changed?<br />
All I can think of is that the authorisation thing that we had to send/accept when we first set it up has somehow come undone....but trying to send authorisation request again does nothing.<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you checked the status window for any changes? If you pres the availability radio button it will display your status, you should be able to change the status,status message and location settings from there too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a play and let me know how you get on.</p>

    <title>Error 0x8004FC12 activating Office 365 after having to reset Windows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Error 0x8004FC12 activating Office 365 after having to reset Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I had to resort to resetting Windows 10 today after experiencing a "black screen of death" (black screen before login, no cursor, no safe modes would work, nor would VGA mode).&nbsp;&nbsp; After restoring Windows, I reinstalled Office 365 (home user)&nbsp;from the online
 portal.&nbsp; Now getting the error "We're sorry, something went wrong and we can't do this for you right now".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried the following:</p>
<p>1) Online repair of Office 365</p>
<p>2) Uninstalling Office 365, rebooting and reinstalling</p>
<p>3) cscript ospp.vbs /dstatus (which tells me the product key does not match the product key for the license.)</p>
<p>4) deleted product key using ospp.vbs /unpkey: and then trying to reactivate.</p>
<p>5) deleting activation from account in office.microsoft.com</p>
<p>6) run system file checker with no issues found</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not want to do another reset of Windows 10 unless someone @Microsoft can assure me this will solve the problem (and even then, there ought to be a better solution like calling in for activation or entering a product key).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas for resolving this issue with Office 365 activation?</p>

<p><span>In order to resolve this issue you may try the following steps:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When uninstalling and re-installing Office 365 did you follow the complete manual un-installation steps?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>In not, then follow these steps. Since
</span><span>most of the standard steps tried to resolve this issue does not work, I suggest you to manually uninstall Office 365 and re-install it again. Try the following steps:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Manually uninstall Office 365 following the steps mentioned in the following Microsoft Article:

            <p>Yes, I had already tried the manual method.&nbsp; It was also a big fat failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just finished doing&nbsp;a(nother) reset of Windows, this time deleting all files and erasing my C: drive to see if that works.&nbsp; If not, I will give up on Windows 10 and Office and install another OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not understand why it is not possible to make a phone call to activate Office or provide a key under my Office account that would allow me to activate without going through a lot of iterations that are ultimately fruitless.&nbsp; This is a horrible way to
 do business if this is how the licensing scheme is going to operate.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are hundreds of web pages with people complaining about the same thing -- this cryptic error that tells you nothing except&nbsp;"something went wrong".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fix the activation system to that manually mucking through the registry is not the only thing you can offer a paid subscriber.</p>

    <title>E90 Blank Screen &#40;inner&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mai0805  say:</h3>
<h2>            E90 Blank Screen &#40;inner&#41;</h2>
                    Hi... I'm a new E90 user... it's the first E-Series/Communicator I ever bought... Hence, I do not know much about it...<br />
<br />
I have been using it for 4 days now and the only problem I come across was a blank inner screen. My inner screen went blank for a few seconds while I was typing my email this morning. It eventually came back on...and went blank for a few seconds again.<br />
And it keeps doing that...<br />
<br />
Anybody experience the same problem? Does it leads to bigger issues later? Should I be worry about it?<br />
<br />
Take the following into consideration:<br />
- my firmware is the latest version (v07.40.1.2).<br />
- it only happened this morning, I was typing another email on the way home tonight and it was fine.<br />
<br />
FYI, other than that..I am very happy with my E90. I used to be an O2 users and I have to admit that my E90 (so far) is much more stable and reliable than all my previous WM-based devices. Hence, I would like to continue my relationship with E90.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any suggestion, please kindly let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks!

            oh..by the way...<br />
When I was typing my first email (screen problem occurred)...the battery was running low.<br />
<br />
Then I charged my E90 during the day so when I was typing my email on the way home (no screen problem)...the battery was fully charged.<br />
<br />
Don't know if it has anything to do with it...

            Hi. I am having a similar problem. Mine happens whenever I try to place a call. First it was when sending/receiving sms. EAch time the sms came and I was using the keyboard, the screen would go blank. I re-installed the update firmware 210.34.75 and now
 it happens if I make/receive a CALL from the inner keyboard.<br />
<br />
If using the outer keypad, everything works fine.

            Given that it is new, and if a well charged battery is not the answer then it sounds like a fault so take it back to the dealer for an exchange.

<h2>            Outlook 2013&#47;Office 365&#59; Shared mailbox not working &#34;Cannot open set of folders&#34;, New profile failing on password.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>The users of the charity I support reported the following issue on Friday. They are unable to view any Shared Mailboxes from Outlook 2013. They use these almost exclusively to conduct their business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They can access these mailboxes from OWA, and they are currently functioning like this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>They can access their own mailboxes without a problem from Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, when I tried to create new profiles for myself and one other user, the system refused to accept our passwords.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 and Office 2013 are set to autoupdate. The manager advised me of a Windows update, which she suspects. However the records indicate this was Wednesday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen a solution with Powershell and automapping online, happy to try this if advised, but I don't have quick access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Steve</p>

<h2>            Microsoft games on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I've not really had a good response to my problem (that Microsoft Mahjong and Microsoft Solitaire keep cutting out), except that it might be a widespread problem.</p>
<p>It seems to have something to do with logging into my Xbox account, as I also have Microsoft Jigsaw, Microsoft Minesweeper, and Microsoft Sudoku, all of which work alright.&nbsp;But I think that this is because I have no games statistics saved in my Xbox account.</p>
<p>Has there been other people with the same problem, have they had a response and/or has Microsoft been notified?</p>

            <p>Thank you yes.</p>
<p>I am playing these on my computer. It's only Microsoft Solitaire and Microsoft Mahjong after all.</p>
<p>However it might be linked with the Xbox account because I also have Microsoft Jigsaw, Minesweeper and Sudoku, but I have no trouble with these but that might be because I have no games statistics saved.</p>

            <p>interesting , MS games must do something different than the other&nbsp; free games. I have five different Mahjong games. Only one has strange hic-up. that is the MS version. Sometimes it will start OK, &nbsp;sometimes it will suddenly stop and disappear from desktop,&nbsp;
 other times it will just stop and automaticity restart in about 8 seconds. </p>
<p>
</p><p>While using this game I get an display error called. &nbsp;Display driver &nbsp;has failed Windows HD 8 and has recovered. I do not have windows 8 and never have so maybe that error comes from Mahjong &nbsp;is build for Windows 8 and not fully adapted to win10 as yet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a complete clean install of windows 10 hoping to clear any files corrupted, Nope~ that did not work.
</p>
<p>I have removed and re-install MS Mahjong several times to see if that helps , NOT!</p>
<p>I have reallocated &nbsp;memory that did not work either.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Re installed display drivers, that did not work either</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Took computer over to Office Max for their &nbsp;free computer analyze check they found no problem.&nbsp; Then as a last try I took computer over to Best Buy&nbsp; the tech there found no problem and said all drivers are up to date.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1-I tried archiving on several PC ( all with Office2013 and Win7), with diffents emails accounts. The accounts were configured as exchange account ( no pop no imap) and the first account =3GB, the second ( mine) = 0,6GB</p>
<p>2-I tried a manual&nbsp; and automatic... it's the same thing...the folders were created but no mails moved. I try to enable the&nbsp;options&nbsp;<font color="#000000"> ‘Include items with ‘Do not archive’ checked’ but no mails were moved.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">I think it was a&nbsp;microsoft Bug... on Outlook 2010 the archiving was ok!</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Is it possible to try&nbsp; on your computer ?</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">The office'updates were ok</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">thanks to try help me...</font></p>
