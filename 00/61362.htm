<p>Whenever I try to play a video file through the Xbox One Media Player, about 10 seconds into playing the file I get a gray colored box popup that has the error message:</p>
<p><span><strong>Try a different folder</strong></span></p>
<p><span>It took a long time to gather all your media for playback.&nbsp; Please try a different folder.</span></p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>I don't have any problems streaming these video files to the Xbox 360.&nbsp; Any help is appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<h2>            random disconnects , a few ideas that may help</h2>
                    
<p>It seems alot of people are having random disconnect issues using wireless , i have a few ideas that although are not definate fixes have worked for me and a few friends , these fixes i have come across myself by trial and error and a little knowlage ;)</p>
<p>First thing assign a fixed IP address to your XBOX via your router , there are alot of differant routers out there so i have to be a bit vague . Your looking for a list of connected devices in your router so your looking for a heading with something like
 "home network" or "connected devices" as a title. Next you need to find your XBox in that list it will most likely be listed as a mac address looking something like "unknown 64-68-0c etc" . Next&nbsp; select the device usually by a double click and your looking
 for a heading looking something like "Always use this ip address" or "use fixed ip address"</p>
<p>Next manually set yourt wireless channel most likely found in the wireless section (no sh!t sherlock) if wireless channel is set to "automatic" change it to channel 11 then apply and save etc</p>
<p>one more thing the xbox doesnt seem to like is wireless N , disabling this can sometimes help , yor looking for something like "wireless interface type" its most likely set to automatic or 802.11 b/g/n , it wants to be set to 802.11 b/g effectively disabling
 N , this will decrease your wireless range (you most likely wont notice) and it will decrease you file transfer speed between pc's (once again you you'll probably never notice) but it may help your disconnects</p>

<h2>            Hover-to-select is changing my file names as I go to save them</h2>
                    In Windows 8, while saving a new file in a number of different programs, such as Excel, if my mouse is hovering over a previously saved file, it automatically chooses the existing file name for my new file as I save it. Is there a way to turn off that
 option?

<h2>            Error 0x80070079&#58; The semaphore timeout period has expired</h2>
                    <p>This is a new issue with my Windows 10 64bit system. While trying to access the C$ admin share across my network I get the warning that Windows can not access the \\IP_Address\c$ Error 0x80070079, the semaphore time period has expired. I have updated the
 system BIOS, the network card drivers and the wireless card drivers. Problem still exists. I have run check disk on the hard drive and no errors were reported. This issue just started after this past tuesday's updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any insight would be very helpful.</p>
<p>The base networking has not changed and other systems on the same network segment are not effected. This is the only Windows 10 system currently in use, everyone else is on Windows 7.</p>
<p>Thank you...</p>

<p>Hi Eric</p>
<p>Thank you for the information, I followed your suggestions to remedy the issue. I used the SFC and the DISM utilties as outlined in the Wiki article above. All results were the system had no file corruption or other correctable items.</p>
<p>I used system restore to go back to a restore point prior to the last update. That fixed the issue and now I am able to access the C$ share on multipule machines.</p>
<p>I will need to use the tool outlined in the last step to block that update.</p>
<p>Thank you kindly!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Bob</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 OS freezes, but only when plugged in to power source</h2>
                    I seem to have come across a problem with Windows 10 on my laptop. It seems to run fine as long as my laptop is not plugged in to a power source. As soon as I plug it in though, nothing responds. If I have a browser open I can continue to use, but I can
 not open anything new, access the start menu, ask cortana, or power down in a normal way. I have to force a shut down. It only recently started doing this. When I first got 10, it seemed to work fine. Any ideas? Can post specs if needed. Thanks so much for
 any help!

    <title>Color Management - broken on my machine. Does it ever work&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jrsubs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Color Management - broken on my machine.  Does it ever work&#63;  Windows 10 pro 1709</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a screen calibrator to better match my two screens. After using it my system is now crippled color management-wise.&nbsp; Apps show images differently, old well-known images look awful, in some apps they look completely different on each screen.
 . .&nbsp; I am used to Color management and have used it mostly for a decade or more.&nbsp; I've used the same images on four different systems, three of them calibrated and profiled displays.&nbsp; Images are now completely different from any other time, including other
 people's images and the internet.&nbsp; This is definitely broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the screen calibration software may be confused by Windows and/or profiles are being applied twice and/or wrong profiles are being assigned ... or something similar.&nbsp; To start, if I right click on desktop and select display settings, it shows the
 left display as #1, and the right as #2.&nbsp; But if I call up Color Management using Identify Monitors it shows the opposite.&nbsp; What hope does 3rd party software have of correctly dealing if Windows doesn't know which monitor it is dealing with?&nbsp; In use, the calibration
 software was constantly assigning profiles to the wrong display or moving itself to the wrong display and is obviously confused, just like Windows. (If I selected the BenQ display it would move itself to the Dell; if I said "Apply profile" after profiling
 the Dell it would assign it to the Benq (the Benq colours would change) etc.&nbsp; I then used Windows Color Management to 'correctly' assign them, but who knows what it means in terms of how the profiles are actually being used?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can apply any profiles I like and the display appearance changes but nothing is as reasonable as it was before this attempt at calibration.&nbsp; The monitors are both good quality (both are sold as "calibrated" with calibration certificates.&nbsp; This doesn't
 mean a lot but does mean they should be reasonably close to well set up.&nbsp; Indeed before calibration attempt I was pretty happy with the default appearance).&nbsp; As a photographer I wanted to calibrate to tweak it even better, but everything is now a mess and
 images look appalling.&nbsp; There is absolutely no match between any printed image and the screens, or previous appearance and the screens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Displays look 'best' now when on linear.icc i.e. essentially uncalibrated/unprofiled, but the system is still messed up - obviously some profiles are conflicting or duplicated or whatever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I set up both displays to use their 'correct' profiles determined using the new i1Display, the displays are not matched i.e. same image or window spread across two screens looks completely different (more different than before calibration).&nbsp; Further before
 calibration the same image viewed in all 6 of my image applications looked the same.&nbsp; Now they look different depending on which app and which screen.&nbsp; Sometimes if dragged to the other screen they look even worse, and then later this behaviour stops.&nbsp; This
 is not a result of some apps being color managed and some not because I've used the same apps before in a colour managed environment and they all looked the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone understand Windows Calibration (I see others completely frustrated with it) and know how to get it to perform correctly?&nbsp; Does anyone even know which display is which?&nbsp; Is assigning a profile via desktop/right click/Display setting/Color Profile
 the same as doing it via Control Panel/Color Management?&nbsp; It seems the latter is overriden by the former when they are open at the same time.&nbsp; How can I fix my system so it can be correctly calibrated/profiled?</p>

<p>Thanks for the help but probably I have not communicated clearly my situation.&nbsp; Shorter response - see questions at the bottom.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long answer -&nbsp; I am comfortable understanding color calibration and setting brightness and so on.&nbsp; The screens I have (BenQ2700 and Dell U2415) are both capable of being accurately calibrated and profiled.&nbsp; I want to profile them better than available from
 straight out of the box (they both come calibrated as I said, which mainly goes to prove that they are capable of being accurately profiled and have a reasonable color gamut).&nbsp; Certainly I'm looking for better than the settings from Windows "Color Calibration".&nbsp;
 (Note when I follow your suggested means of 'calibrating', Windows says quite rightly "This display uses a wide-gamut color profile. The Display Color Calibration will create a color profile with a conventional gamut, which may be a poor fit for this display
 and result in distorted color appearance.&nbsp; Do you want to continue anyway?".&nbsp; Answer, no.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I tried the i1Display Pro calibrator, things were OK, fair enough, though the two screens were not fantastically well matched for color and display to print calibration/profiling was not so good.&nbsp; But at least colors were close enough for rough work,
 and at least all apps showed the same color appearance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do want to establish proper profiles for both monitors to address the above.&nbsp; The Xrite i1 Display Pro is well reviewed and better than my old calibrator and is (should be) capable of doing what I want.&nbsp; But results are disastrous, unlike the previous
 times in Windows 7 when I was able to profile predictably and accurately with less capable calibrator. XRite say it is a Windows problem, which is why I am here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do know how to change brightness and all other screen adjustments including color and gamma on both displays, this is not the point and not what I am trying to do.&nbsp; I am trying to get use of the extended colour spaces and match screen to print and to each
 other.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows is renowned for being difficult to understand the screen calibration/profiling workflow and how to apply profiles correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My specific questions and observations:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Why is Windows Color Management unable to identify my monitors properly, calling them both only Generic PnP monitors?&nbsp; I ask because I think this may be at the heart of the problem - there is some difficulty with communication between ICM and the machine
 and the displays.&nbsp; The XRite software has no problem getting this information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Why does Windows Color Management identify screen 1 and 2 oppositely from Desktop/rt click/Display Settings&nbsp; ... AT TIMES?&nbsp; Why does this only happen at some times and not others?&nbsp; I ask because I think this has something to do with the problem, there
 is confusion in 'which screen is which' that is evident at several points in the calibration process.&nbsp; Likely/possible that profiles are being applied in the wrong places, or profiles are being generated based on incorrect information).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Are there any profiles applied by Windows separately or in different places from profiles applied by calibration software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) There is some mention on the net of difficulties with color mgmt in recent versions of Win 10.&nbsp; Are some recent Windows versions broken so that they do not deal with Color Management correctly?&nbsp; If so which versions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Now that my system is thoroughly broken re ICM (nothing displays as it should, no matter what profiles I select or deselect, apps now display differently from each other and from before and in an ugly way, no matter what profiles I select or deselect)
 --&nbsp; how do I reset the entire color management on this machine and then what workflow should I follow to get ICM to work correctly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Julian</p>

<p>Right.&nbsp; Answers to your dot point questions:<br />
</p>
<p>1) I want to calibrate my fairly high quality displays so that they correctly show my images.&nbsp; The two screens should then match in appearance.&nbsp; They don't.&nbsp; I want color managed software to correctly display my images.&nbsp; They don't.&nbsp; I want my screen appearance
 to closely match calibrated and profiled printer output.&nbsp; It doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I am unable to use my colour calibration software and hardware to calibrate these displays.&nbsp; It says it works but the results are wrong - displays don't match, images appear differently on each display and differently in different software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Summarise - get display calibration using Xrite software and hardware to work.&nbsp; Get windows to correctly identify which screen is which.&nbsp; Get windows to correctly assign color profiles.&nbsp; Get displays to show images correctly. Get Windows to talk properly
 to Xrite software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4)&nbsp; I can, but then I can't profile/calibrate my displays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Yes, Xrite software is supposed to apply a the cleverly determined color profile to each monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that help?</p>

<p>No - no resolution as yet.&nbsp; I had given up with Microsoft support in all areas, but prompted by you have tried again. See above.&nbsp; In the meantime I've reset my displays to use the manufacturers' profiles, though I not sure the right one is actually being
 applied to the right screen.&nbsp; The two displays show completely different colours and one of them is obviously wrong in some software, much too dark.&nbsp; It was not like that before I tried calibrating and profiling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open the same test image in Photoshop, Windows 10 Photos, and Windows Photo Viewer on the same screen, they all look different. Having just found the insert image button here, I'll have a go at doing that to demonstrate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I discovered which Microsoft could have usefully told me instead of telling me my issue was too long for them to read, is that the reason the names of my displays are not showing in WIndows Display settings (generic PnP) is a reflection of the
 fact I was using generic drivers.&nbsp; This was a result of advice that the manufacturer's drivers are not necessary and introduce other issues that may complicate setup.&nbsp; Now that I've installed manufacturer's drivers Windows picks up correct display names.&nbsp;
 This doesn't explain why XRite software out of the box was able to pick up the model numbers, and it hasn't helped other problems.<br />

 (NOT Windows 'calibration' but proper profiling and calibrating).<br />

<p>Wow, that is a huge difference. I'm curious if you assigned a profile (sRGB, Adobe RGB?) to this photo when exported it from the PS or is it untagged? I need to do the same test to see the difference on my end.&nbsp;<br />
Right now, I'm trying to understand how come when switching&nbsp;between different profiles in Color Management app I don't see any changes in color... I tried it on my laptop that has a clean Windows 10 and the same thing - no changes.&nbsp;</p>

                    I have backed up my computer and I bought it used. I don't have a warranty on my laptop it's running Windows 7 a window pops up saying Windows detected &nbsp;a hard disk problem...
<div>Immediate steps&nbsp;</div>
<div>because a disk failure will cause you to lose all programs, files and documents on the disk, you should back up your important information immediately. (I did that). Try not to use your computer until you have replaced the hard drive. (I write and blog
 and work on my computer and HAVE to use my laptop constantly Please tell me I can fix this without having to replace the hard drive)&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Which disk is failing?</div>
<div>The following hard disks are reporting failure:</div>
<div>Disk Name: WDC WD3200BEVT-75ZCT2 ATA Device</div>
<div>Volume: C:\;D:\</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help at all please</div>

            <p>You probably have one hard drive with two partitions (C:\ and D:\), so <strong>when</strong> (not if) the drive fails, you will lose everything on both partitions. What make and model laptop do you have? Does it have the capability of having more than one HDD?</p><p>Do you have an external drive large enough to store an image of your current drive before it fails?</p><p>I would advise doing something very, very soon. You can run CHKDSK /R to mark any bad sectors on the drive, and hopefully it'll be able to move any data out of those sectors before the drive fails, and give you a little more time.<br />Since you have to drives/partitions, you'll have to run it against both. Run CHKDSK D: /R first, then after it completes, run CHKDSK C: /R .</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;SC Tom</p>

            The inbuilt diagnostics are warning you the disk is failing. It is a sealed unit that requires a clean room environment to open. Your only option is to replace the drive. Which is better leave it to die altogether or replace it while you can?

<p>===================================<br />
If you are saying you&nbsp;see icond instead of&nbsp;thumbnails...<br />
maybe the following steps would be worth a try:</p>
<p>Go to...Start orb / Control Panel / Folder Options / View <br />
tab / Files and Folders / Uncheck 'Always show icons, <br />
never thumbnails' / Apply / OK.</p>

<h2>            My Lexmark printer wouldn&#39;t printer after updating to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>My family is unavailable to help me today.&nbsp; It's my birthday and I wanted to print some coupons to use today.&nbsp; So, I've been trying to get info online with very confusing info.</p>
<p>A month ago I updated to Windows 10 from Windows 7.&nbsp; I love it, it's faster but my printer didn't get updated I assume.</p>
<p>The printer wasn't communicating with the computer.</p>
<p>I had been messing around with it.&nbsp; After pressing start, I went to printer.&nbsp; My Lexmark 1400 series printer was pictured but not defaulted.&nbsp; It would not highlight or click on default, the only option was to remove it.&nbsp; So now it's removed and not pictured
 and something else is defaulted-something like Windows writer, which I assume is not a printer(LOL)&nbsp; I am not a technical person so I am more likely to mess things up more.&nbsp; It's after Christmas so I can't afford to pay anyone to help me.</p>
<p>Does someone have any simple answers or directions for a "computer dummy"?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Error creating DFS replication on Windows Server 2016 Data center</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
Hi</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
We had encounter error "Value does not fall within the expected range" when I created dfs replication group in our windows 2016 data center. When we try to add Replication Group Members during the wizard getting an error message "Value does not fall within
 the expected range" and unable to primary/member server. Both servers have the DFS Namespace and Replication roles installed, and I've tried creating the Replication Group from both servers. Same error whichever I use.<br />
<br />
we removed the patch KB3186568 on both servers then the issue has resolved last month but after applying July 2017 month patch same error arrived on Servers.<br />
<br />
Please help to resolve this issue and we couldn't able reach Microsoft directly. If anybody can please bring to their vision about this issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</p>

    <title>Windows Vista SP2 is taking a long time to recover from the photos - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Vista SP2 is taking a long time to recover from the photos screen saver.</h2>
                    I m using Windows Vista SP2 home premium with all of the latest updates. If I am using the photos screensaver, then when I move the mouse or press a key to deactivate the screensaver, the screen goes black and I have to wait about twenty to thirty seconds
 for the desktop to reappear. I looked around and microsoft says the problem was fixed with SP2, but apparently it hasn't. I am using an acer aspire 5735-4624 laptop(Pentium T3200 2.0 GHz processor, two gigabytes of ram).

            <p>This is a SP4 that hasn't been used for a while, since late last year, so I started fresh by installing 1511 (I downloaded the ISO from Microsoft) and then I applied the standard windows update, I never got the ask to install all the drivers that were released
 last week, but for some unknown reasons, some of them are already installed, the only thing I have on my Windows Update history is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based systems (KB3140741)</p>
<p>- A Windows Defender and a Adobe Flash player update</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing else.</p>

            <p>What you may have to do is download the 2/22/16 drivers and firmware and install them manually.&nbsp; They can be downloaded
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/performance-and-maintenance/install-software-updates-for-surface?os=windows-10#surfacepro3W10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HERE!</a>&nbsp; Once they are installed you should try Update in Settings and perhaps the 4/17 updates will be available.&nbsp; Otherwise u will have to wait until MS makes them available for manual download.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

            <p>Found this procedure for people having problems with the 4/17 update.&nbsp; You may be able to use it to identify and correct failed driver installs and reinstall them using pnputil.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Open the setupapi.dev.log log file from c:\windows\inf.</li><li>Find the error "Failed to install device instance".</li><li>Above this error it will say which inf file caused the issue.

<h2>            After Windows 10 upgrade my network card do not work for Wireless and Wired Network.</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>I Have Dell Inspiron 15R N5010 laptop 15 inch with Wireless Card installed "DW1501 Wireless-N WLAN Half-Mini Card" during upgrade Windows 10 did not gave any error that this card is not compatible. After upgrade everything worked fine for 2 days after that
 my Wireless and Wired network stopped working in Windows 10. My system become useless without network. I tried find new&nbsp;driver for this Wireless card&nbsp;but no luck anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is why windows 10&nbsp;do not have any driver for this card, also&nbsp;it should not allow me for upgrade if that is not&nbsp;compatible. I was force to revert back everything. Will there is any driver compatible to this card&nbsp;be available in future.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            A wireless connection to a printer over Wifi would "qualify" this as a network connection.&nbsp; You might want to check any / all firewall software / Internet security software and allow the Epson drivers to pass through it.
