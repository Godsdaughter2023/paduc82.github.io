<p>Ok i have found a way to fix but painful that i have to do this. &nbsp;And if you fix in word you still have to complete outlook independently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need office store &nbsp;add in for emojis keyboard, you &nbsp;have to obtain it in word by going to the store search emojis. Store shows on insert menu on ribbon in the add in group tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First step change the bottom of emoji keyboard to &nbsp;'text' not icons by sizes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will still get pictures in colour but they are smaller and designed for text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you insert a pic in word highlight &nbsp;to select it, open autotext and redefine in autotext under file/options/proofing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens is when you get to autotext and you have done the right steps the little smila should be sitting on the right side and you enter the :-) symbols on the &nbsp;left then click replace.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This doesn't carry to outlook so copy your little fella then off to outlook new message. Paste to new email then Re-highlight then file/options/mail/ autocorrect then redefine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have my smile back in full blushing colour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The normal icons in sizes do not work they act as images.</p>

    <title>Email deliverability issue for large company sending 30-40k messages - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> konrad korf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Email deliverability issue for large company sending 30-40k messages daily to outlook domain family.</h2>
                    <p>We are serving an online shop that sends huge amount of messages daily. We have just found out we have a deliverability problem when sending emails to hotmail/live/outlook/msn email accounts - our emails are landing in the spam folder.<br />
<br />
Our domain has a good reputation, our email complaint rate is &lt; 0.1%, spam trap hits is close to 0. We're enrolled in SNDS and JMRP. We have reverse DNS, DKIM,SPF, SSL in place in our email server.<br />
<br />
We are a responsible company, and have mechanisms in place to deliver emails with good judgment. E.g.: Unsubscribe link in every email sent, we add alt tags for the pictures, plain text version of email.<br />
<br />
There are about 110 000 outlook/msn/live/hotmail customers that want to receive email notifications from us and are unable to do so, because suddenly our emails are going to spam.<br />
</p>
<p>We've gone through submitting a ticket at https://support.microsoft.com/</p>
<p>But it was of no use, becase 1st line of support will simply copy paste the Recommended Guidelines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can we reach someone more qualified to look into this?</p>

<p>Hi Konrad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have checked your current issue with Outlook and it seems that it is too complex than what is normally posted here in the Community. We suggest that you post your query in our
<strong><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-us/newthread" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TechNet forums</a></strong> where we have support professionals who are more knowledgeable with these kinds of issues.</p>
<p>

<p>Likely you, or your mail server(s) have been blacklisted by Microsoft.</p>
<p>You can try to and get off Microsoft's blacklist by filling out this form (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/getsupport?oaspworkflow=start_1.0.0.0&amp;wfname=capsub&amp;productkey=edfsmsbl3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/getsupport?oaspworkflow=start_1.0.0.0&amp;wfname=capsub&amp;productkey=edfsmsbl3</a>)
</p>
<p>When submitting if you get an error that means there's too much info in one of the text fields. Correct that and then submit.</p>
Then wait for an answer.

            That's exactly where it all had started. Complaints were successful, but the answer why we are blacklisted never came to us. We have been using this form multiple times and even got contacted by 1st line of support that always gave us generic (copy/paste)
 answers, like check your DKIM settings, etc.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To quote what we get is:<br />
<p><span>"Email filtering is based on many factors, but primarily it's due to mail content and recipient interaction with that mail.&nbsp; Because of the proprietary nature of
 SmartScreen® and because SmartScreen® Filter technology is always adapting and learning more about what is and isn't unwanted mail, it is not possible for us to offer specific advice about improving your mail content. However, in general SmartScreen® Filter
 evaluates specific words or characteristics from each e-mail message and weights them, based on their likelihood to indicate that a message is unwanted or legitimate mail.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, after reviewing the information you provided and in compliance with our mail policies, we are unable to offer immediate mitigation for your deliverability
 issue. However, we have some specific recommendations for you to consider that can help you to improve deliverability over time.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are some specific recommendations for you to consider:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Brand your mail</span></p>
<p><span>Ensure mails are cleanly formatted and clearly identifiable as originating from your service.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow content and formatting best practices</span></p>
<p><span>There are numerous Internet resources which offer advice and best practices, we recommend you refer to these resources for assistance creating well formatted and
 more deliverable email. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Highlight Opt In</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Clearly mark your emails so that Windows Live Outlook.com customers are able to identify that they requested or subscribed to emails from your service.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Ensure your email lists are up to date</span></p>
<p><span>Remove those who do not want to receive the emails and consider making the unsubscribe process more visible to ensure you are only delivering mail to interested recipients.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Join the Junk Mail Reporting Program (JMRP)</span></p>
<p><span>We believe that your recipients are the best indicator that the email you are sending is wanted.&nbsp; The JMRP program allows you to see which of your emails Outlook.com
 users have marked as junk or unwanted mail.&nbsp; Reviewing the results in JMRP will provide to the most direct information on what characteristics of your email, customers, and ultimately SmartScreen®, consider to be unwanted. This helpful feedback mechanism allows
 you to ensure that mails being sent from your IP are not resulting in negative feedback that could impact your sending reputation. Being vigilant about users who mark your e-mail as unwanted or the types of messages that are being marked as unwanted can help
 you keep mailing lists updated with only interested users and modify future campaigns. In addition, monitoring user complaints can help you identify unintended mail traffic or detect a potentially compromised account sending unwanted mail to your customers.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Join the Smart Network Data Services program (SNDS)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The SNDS program provides data about traffic seen originating from your registered IP, such as mail volume and complaint rates. The data is built from the log files
 of the inbound mail machines and other servers at Outlook.com and Microsoft and represents factual information about the traffic from your mail servers to Outlook.com users. For more information about this free program refer to

 It's not uncommon for that step in the enrollment process to be missed.)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;We encourage you to take an active role in managing your email practices and infrastructure. The SmartScreen® filter is not static and it is possible to improve
 deliverability over time.&nbsp; Implementing and maintaining email best practices such as those described above can help.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We also encourage you to download and apply the industry best practices found in our Outlook.com Enhanced Deliverability white paper.

<p>There's no one to talk to as it is an automated system. So if filling out the form I indicated is of no help then my suggestion is to change your mail server's IP addresses. It's no guarantee that it will get you off the black list, but it might.</p>

            I don't think changing IPs will do anything as we are using same class of IPs for that client and outlook\hotmail is the only domain family causing problems. We comply with all the requirements to send quality emails yet got blocked. Please give some specific
 reasons as for why it happens?<br />

<p>Hi, I have exactly the same issue as RikUchet above. But your advice does not work because my Microsoft account (which I just signed up for today) IS DIFFERENT from my skype account (which I've been using for 15 years without any problems until now). I can
 never get past a page that says something like "Oops, skype is not working now, try again later".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please kindly tell me how I can recover my skype account, which has all my contact information, as well as credit to which I am entitled. Thanks.</p>

<p>I have been reading discussions in these skype forums and it looks like skype/microsoft is not following through customer requests in these forums. It just stop responding and do nothing to help. There is no real solutions provided to customers
 to solve their account/technical problems created by&nbsp;skype/microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I like to point out and share with others a serious matter based on my experience:</span></p>
<p>skype/microsoft continue to deduct auto payments for paid subscriptions from credit cards of existing customers based on their existing skype accounts which are unlawfully BLOCKED access by skype/microsoft. So the same customers not just are prevented
 from using their existing skype accounts but also can't stop&nbsp;skype/microsoft from charging them subscriptions fees!<br />
</p>
<p>I hope participants in these forums take actions against the above serious contractual and ethical problems posed by&nbsp;skype/microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should&nbsp;skype/microsoft censor any of these legitimate, serious discussions, including this one, other customers who suffer the same fate should voice out and demand appropriate response from skype/microsoft.</p>

            Customer and user experience are non existent. Typical, Microsoft. They lock you out, but don't offer support. I've been locked out for two full days already and it's impossible to do my work now. I hope they don't withdraw money from my bank account!
 I've given them enough money over the years.&nbsp;

            <p>You can add a CallLog table and relate it back to the Customer or Contact:</p>
<p>
</p><p>tCallLog</p>
<p>-----------------</p>
<p>CallLogID</p>
<p>CustomerID</p>
<p>CallDate</p>
<p>CallDetails</p>
<p>etc etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create a small form based on that table, and either (a) embed it in the Customer form as a Subform or (b) open it on a Button click as needed. If you use the button click method, be sure to pass in the CustomerID to that form so the record can be properly
 associated with the Customer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, you can get MUCH more complex with this, but those would be the basics.</p>

            <p>It depends on what YOU mean by a "call log". It can mean different things to different people. Scott McD gave you a basic outline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you determine what information you need to capture about each call. Obviously the customer making the call and the date/time of the call. Then you would have things like the reason for call, notes about the call, maybe the employee who took the
 call and/or the employee assigned to resolve the call. There may be more things depending on your needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some more on a reason for the call. You might want a lookup table of reasons so you can later report on calls by reason. You might also need track the date the call was resolved and an explanation of how it was resolved. You might also want a followup history
 of the call. So you can track what actions were taken on the call by who.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you see its not a simple answer. It depends on YOUR needs. It may involve a single additional table or multiple tables.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need more help then you need to provide specifics about your needs.</p>

<p>This morning I found that all my "last week" inbox emails are missing. I have current day emails, yesterday emails, and then it goes to "Two Weeks ago" emails and so on. I had a hundred or so emails from just last week that are gone. I've looked at both

<h3> stevebepko  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2010 locks up on formatting commands and others</h2>
                    Running Excel 2010 and Word 2010 on a Win 7 Premium x64 laptop. &nbsp;When I select certain functions the program will lock up, not recover any new information, and force a program restart. &nbsp;Functions that appear to cause the lockup are most formatting commands-
 &lt;right click&gt; format cells, underline are frequent culprits, there may be others. &nbsp;Old spreadsheets (that previously worked fine) and new spreadsheets (blank content) are effected. &nbsp;Any other open spreadsheets are also affected, i.e. they are locked up.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have repaired the installation a few times and that seems to temporarily work. &nbsp;I have also uninstalled and reinstalled the H&amp;S 2010 suite several times, and once again this appears to solve the problem a little while, but then it reappears. &nbsp;Once the
 lockup occurs on a function it will from then on always occur.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have also had this type of lockup occur in Word 2010, but cannot remember the specific functions other than they were formatting commands. &nbsp;Again, after a clean reinstall (not just a repair), the problem goes away for a little while (days?) but invariably
 returns.</div>

            (1) No error message is reported, the "busy" icon just continues to spin until I attempt to c lose the program. &nbsp;I then get the "non-responsive" message, it will eventually close.
<div><br />
<div>(2) Will try SAFE mode if and when the problem occurs, right now (after the last repair), it is working fine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>(3) I do not have Outlook installed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>(4)The default printer change sounds the most promising, since I have had some issues in the past where attempting to print to my (ethernet connected) printer has caused the lockup described earlier. &nbsp;I have had this printer connected as described for
 about 3 years and have never had a problem, but it is something to try.</div>

            <p>Yes, the printer was it. &nbsp;I had a network printer installed that I could not get to when on the VPN for some reason and when I changed the default printer to the Microsoft PDF Writer I could then highlight a whole column and right click and do Format Cells
 with no problem. &nbsp;Go figure Microsoft......I guess the way you can format cells depends on what type of printer you have installed in some circumstances ?</p>
<p>

<h2>            pdf adds lines to corners of images from publisher 2007</h2>
                    I have an annoying problem.&nbsp; There is not supposed to be any kind of border around this image. I have several images for an instruction manual i am working on and i get these weird lines on the ones that I resized. The ones that I kept the original size
 do not have any lines.&nbsp; These images are .PNGs by the way (in case that matters)<br />
<br />
I have to save it as a .pdf because the file is too big to email unless i do. Also, if i print from publisher the transparent areas of the document do not print transparent.
<br />
So right now if i make it a .pdf, i get ugly corners. and if i keep it a .pub, I get ugly boxes. What are my options to fix this?<br />

            <p>I am not totally clear on what you are saying.</p>
<p>How did you produce the PNG files? Did you scan a page of an instruction manual and create the png files that way? Are you then inserting the png files into a Publsher page and resizing the picture box...is that what you mean by resized? What are you saving
 as a pdf file...png files or publisher files...maybe I am extra dense today, but would you try explaining your problem again using different words please?</p>
<p>Also are you using the Office 2007 PDF add-in to create your pdf files? If so try

    <title>How to let access autocomplete values in a combobox that contains - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lionelspratt  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to let access autocomplete values in a combobox that contains values from a table&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys. What I'm a trying to do in Microsoft Access should be simple, but I can't get it done.<br />
I have a table called "Countries". This table consists of Fieldname ID and a fieldname Country. The fieldname "Country" contains a bunch of countries. I have another table (called "Mutationtable" that contains a lot of fields, but I have a particular field
 called "Country". For this field I want a combobox where the list should be taken from the fieldname Country in the table "Countries". So far so good.<br />
I have it done. It works perfectly. My only problem is, when I open the table, to fill on values for the fields, I don't want to open the dropbox to keep scrolling through the list. I should be able to type for example "United States" and Access should Autocomplete
 this for me. But it doesn't do it. I noticed it does autocomplete for the comboboxes where I have a "Valuelist". But for this particular Combobox, I have the Row Source Type set to "Table/Query", and the row source says the following:<br />
SELECT [Countries].[Country] FROM Countries; <br />
<br />
What can I do to let access autocomplete this for me? (I haven't created a form yet,&nbsp; I thought it should work before creating the form because all my comboboxes that as a Valuelist as Row Source Type works with autocomplete just fine.<br />
<br />
How can I achieve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(PS, I did read other threads, but their solution did not work for me....which is why I decided to ask my own question)</p>

            Setting a combo box's AutoExpand property to True (Yes) will cause the control to progressively go to the first match as each character is entered.&nbsp; You'll find an example in DatabaseBasics.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link, copy the link (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
In this little demo file the section on 'entering data via a form/subforms' includes, amongst other things, a combo box to select a country, which exhibits the behaviour.&nbsp; Try going to an empty new record in the form and entering F.<br />
<br />
Normally a referencing table would store a numeric foreign key value referencing the numeric primary key of the referenced table, as in my demo.&nbsp; If you really need to store the text Country value in the referencing table, be sure that the Country column in
 Countries is indexed uniquely.<br />

<p>First off, most of us really dislike the "Lookup Field" datatype. It sounds like you're wanting to use a Combo Box in a Table - this is very limited and often confusing. See&nbsp;<a href="http://mvps.access.com/lookupfields.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">The
 Access Web</a>&nbsp;for a critique. Your Country field in mutationtable should NOT be a Lookup Field; instead it should be a Number, Long Integer field matching the ID of the Countries table. In a Form you can thus store the ID (keeping the computer happy) while
 displaying the country name (keeping the user happy).</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Combo Box will autocomplete if its autocomplete property is turned on, and the field (Country name in this case) is the first visible column. It works well if you have the combo box's Row Source query sorted by the name field (so it will find Algeria before
 Azerbaijan for example).</p>
<p>

<h2>            Changing the Import Preferences for Images &#40;300 DPI or higher&#41; in Microsoft Word 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    <p>I would like to change the dpi in microsoft&nbsp;word for mac to "high fidelity" as can be seen here&nbsp;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change-the-default-resolution-for-inserting-pictures-in-office-2016-f4aca5b4-6332-48c6-9488-bf5e0094a7d2 in the windows
 version. To this point - I have been unable to find the option to do so on the mac version. Is the program in mac incapable of doing this?</p>

<p>Yes, although it fails to mention it, that article pertains only to Office 2016
<em>for Windows</em>. There is no comparable preference in Office 2016 <em>for Mac</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when using the .docx file type Mac Word does not arbitrarily compress images in the first place... A .tif image @ 360 ppi, for example, is stored as such in the document. Some get the wrong impression because the program
<em>displays</em> images at a lower resolution in order to avoid drastically bogging things down while editing the document. However, the full res image is used for printing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to compress images in Mac Word the user needs to explicitly use the <strong>
File&gt; Reduce File Size</strong> command. This feature also contributes to the misconception because the
<strong>Picture Quality</strong> setting in that dialog defaults to 220 ppi, but the compression isn't applied unless the OK button is executed - IOW, the value shown in that dialog is not the current res of the image (unless the image just happens to have
 been inserted at that res or has had compression applied).</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW: Not to be pedantic :-) but pixels per inch (ppi) is the measurement system used for images. Dots per inch (dpi) is a
<em>printing device</em> specification. Although the 2 often are used interchangeably there are significant differences.</p>

<p>I deleted MS Download Manager so that i could download it myself and when I did, it ran and installed, no problem.</p>
<p>MS Download manager is worthless at downloading and installing their own files this point.</p>

    <title>Custom Irregular Plurals in Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian kaufman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Custom Irregular Plurals in Word</h2>
                    <p>Is there any way to add custom plural forms to Microsoft Word?&nbsp; There is a certain word where I use the same form as the singular and plural, and Word always generates a warning if I use it as the plural form (Word wants me to add an S).&nbsp; I am going to have
 to totally remove all plural/singular checks to stop Word from bothering me.&nbsp; I'd rather just tell Word that I want that considered as plural if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not tell me to just change the form of the word I am using.&nbsp; I am not going to change and that is not why I am here.&nbsp; I am not going to reveal the word because I don't want this to devolve into a grammar lesson.&nbsp; I just want to know if this is
 in any way configurable before I disable all checking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also not acceptable for me to click "ignore once" every time.&nbsp; I use this word many times in almost every document I deal with on a daily basis.&nbsp; Again, I can live with totally disabling singular/plural checking, but it is just not ideal.&nbsp; I just want
 to know if this is configurable in Word or if there is another way to get the warning to disappear permanently.</p>

<p>I suggest you check the proofing language, please go to
Language</span> group, click <span style="font-weight: bold">Language &gt; Set Proofing Language</span>, check whether you have set English (United States) as the default proofing language.</p>

<p>The word is not indicated as misspelled.&nbsp; It is just shown as a grammatical error.&nbsp; I'm not going to do a style to turn off proofing.&nbsp; I don't want to turn off proofing totally that is way more extreme than the solution I already have which is to just turn
 off plural/singular checking.&nbsp; I also don't want to have to apply the style to this word each time I use it.&nbsp; That is going to be a lot of work, and I could already solve this by doing work every time I type the word by just right clicking and selecting ignore
 once.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just wondering if there is a better solution than disabling singular/plural checking.&nbsp; The only thing I can think of, which would make me really happy, would be if Word had some sort of plural dictionary that allowed you to set spellings as valid plural
 forms.&nbsp; If that doesn't exist, or maybe could be accomplished through a VBA script, then I'll just turn off plural checking.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be helpful if you would tell us what this problematic plural form is and give an example of a sentence in which it is being marked as an error.

<p>If you have a solution that depends on what the word is let me know, but I would be pretty surprised.&nbsp; There are three plural forms for the word in question, but MS Word only recognizes one.&nbsp; I was wondering if there was a way to add alternative plural forms
 for purpose of grammar checking in Word, but apparently there is not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wasn't sure what exactly was being suggested on the disabling of proofing.&nbsp; That is why I responded both to the suggestion that I totally disable proofing and separately responded to the suggestion that I only disable proofing for the word.&nbsp; With disabling
 of proofing for the specific word, can the proofing rule be applied automatically when I type the word, or would I have to always set the style every time I type the word?&nbsp; I would assume that the style would have to be applied by me manually every time I
 type the word, but if you have a recommendation to disable proofing on a specific word automatically every time it is typed that would be interesting to me as a potential solution.</p>

<h2>            Chat notifications</h2>
                    Hi.<br />
I have a question about chat notifications.<br />
I was used to a blinking orange button on my toolbar when someone send me a chat message.<br />
That was with my other laptop.<br />
Now I have a new one with Windows10.<br />
When someone sends me a chat message now, I get a pop up at the right bottom of my screen.<br />
Very annoying. The Skype button on my toolbar isn't blinking orange this time. Just black with a 1 next to it. (or a 2 when tere are 2 chats).<br />
<br />
Is it possible to turn of the pop ups and get the orange blinking button back?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Greetz, Astrid&nbsp;

<p>Hi Astrid,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Skype Classic before, the app used to show the orange blinking bar that represents the chat notification. On Skype for Windows 10, it has a different app experience just like with what you stated above. Since the&nbsp;Skype Classic is no longer supported,&nbsp;I
 suggest you to use the Skype 8 wherein the notification will appear a number&nbsp;on the Skype app icon&nbsp;as in indication of chat notification messages. Here is the direct link where you can download the Skype 8:

<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
As far as I know, I already have Skype 8.<br />
But I will look at it and see what happens :-)&nbsp;<br />

</p><p>Since we were forced to upgrade to Microsoft Skype, there are no longer numbers on the icon in the tray to let us know there are messages waiting.&nbsp; This is so frustrating as I have missed time-senstive messages for work countless times. I see that you are
 staying Skype 8 will bring this feature back. I thought I had skype 8, how do I tell and do I uninstall then click this link to reinstall?&nbsp; Why would this feature not be on EVERY version as it seems to be a basic thing! I am active and all notifications are

            <span>Hi LimaFZ,<br />
<br />
To address your concern, I suggest that you&nbsp;set your account's&nbsp;POP settings to <strong>
<span>Do what my other program says-if it says to delete messages, then delete them.</span></strong> You may refer to these steps:<br />
<br />
1. Sign in to your account&nbsp;then go to your mailbox.<br />
<br />
2. If you are using the Hotmail interface, then select <strong><span>Options</span></strong> then click
<strong><span>More options.</span></strong> But if you are on the Outlook interface,<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong>then click the gear/cog icon&nbsp;found on the top right corner
 of the page&nbsp;then choose <strong><span>More mail settings</span></strong> then follow steps 3 and 4.<br />
<br />
3. Under <strong><span>POP and deleting downloaded messages</span></strong>, select the option
<strong><span>Do what my other program says-if it says to delete messages, then delete them.</span></strong><b><br />
<br />
</b>4. Click <span>
<strong>Save.<br />
<br />
</strong>Once done, remove then re-add your account on your Mac app and iPhone to resync the changes made.</span><br />
<br />
Thanks!</span>

            <p>The Mail app on&nbsp;the Mac and in&nbsp;the iPhone 5 use pop3 protocol to access the outlook.com server.</p>
<p>To receive emails in both places, messages have to be left on the server after downloading so the emails can be received on both devices.</p>
<p>If you login to the server and delete emails that have already been downloaded to both devices, the emails will still be on both devices.&nbsp; There is no syncing with the server or the device.</p>

            Thank you. I went to the Hotmail interface and made the changes but it is still not working. I still have to delete emails on all devices. Should I set the email account as IMAP instead of POP?

<p>Since after setting up the option <span><strong>Do what my other program says-if it says to delete messages, then delete them.</strong>, and the issue still persists, I advise that you reconfigure your account from your device for the changes to take effect.</span></p>

            <p>The problem with outlook.com not deleting emails that are deleted on Iphone goes both ways. Once I have deleted an email from outlook.com, that has been pulled to my phone, it is still on my phone. It does not update the deletion. In other words, to delete
 outlook emails, they must be deleted both by logging into outlook.com and on the Iphone. That is not convenient.
</p>
<p>Here is the solution that worked for me:</p>
<p>1. In outlook.com, click on the gear&gt; More Mail Settings &gt; Connect devices and apps with POP &gt; Do what the device or app says-if it’s set to delete messages, delete them. &nbsp;make sure the box is already checked &gt;Save</p>
<p>2. remove the outlook.com account from your iphone or mac devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. reboot your device</p>
<p>4. re add the email account.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emails are really hard to delete on the Iphone, you cannot select them all and delete them all at the same time. It needs to be done one by one (yes Apple is not very good at this issue). Therefore I tend to delete my emails so not to accumulate 400 or 500

<h2>            This copy of Microsoft office is not activated. You have 28 days left&#33; Or else&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013, which I purchased with my computer from Best Buy June of 2013. I am suddenly getting a pop up that says, "This copy of Microsoft office is not activated 2013. You have 28 days left to activate. Ensure you are
 connected to your corporate network," (and so on). I have read some threads on the same issue, but I have not seen one resolved. Can you help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could using my company's Office 365 (only through a website) or Sharepoint have something to do with it? Office 365 has, though, been around for 4 months. This pop up has been happening for two days. Any ideas? Yes, I do remember that I had an activation
 code because the code peeled off, thus I could not read it. I returned to Best Buy to get a 2nd activation code, which worked. No problems for a year and a half until now. Should I ignore this message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks :)</p>

            Here's another irony - in what seems to be a 'random pop up message' after 19 months of normal MS Office operation. I recently started using Microsoft One Drive. Could this have an effect on it? I would say it's been around 30 days since I have been using
 OneDrive.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your contribution to the forum!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can cancel your 14 day trial when you sign in on zune.net and go to
<strong><span>account</span></strong> -&gt;
<strong><span>settings</span></strong>. When you cancel it there you can use your 14 day trial and after it is expired, it won't renew and charge your credit card.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you want to cancel it immediately, you will need to contact the technical support direct on chat, they have tools to resolve the issue on the spot.</span></p>

            Hi RH_SAT,<br />
<br />
<br />
I have tested this issue from my side and I cannot reproduce your problem.<br />
I import data from web link and there are more than 100 rows.<br />
Please refresh the query to see if the data shows completely: Data&gt; connection&gt; select the query&gt; refresh.<br />
<br />
To better understand your situation, please confirm the information below:<br />
1. Please provide the steps you create the web query to us, if necessary, provide screenshots to us.<br />
2. Try to import data from another web link. Provide the Google sheets file to us.<br />
3. Capture a screenshot of your Office product name and version via this article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/about-office-what-version-of-office-am-i-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19#ID0EBCAAA=Mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
What version of Office am I using?</a><br />

            Hi RH_SAT,<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your update.<br />
We create a web query in Excel 2016 for Mac and get data from the link you provided and the result is the same as you: Only import the first 100 rows into the excel file.<br />
Also, when we create a new worksheet in Google Drive and import the data into query, the result is the same.<br />
<br />
The method we using to create a web query: Copy the link to a word document&gt; Save as plain text&gt; MS-DOS&gt; Save to desktop&gt; Right click the file&gt; Get info&gt; Change the file extension to .iqy&gt; Close and Use .iqy&gt; In Excel Data menu bar&gt; Get external data&gt; Run web
 query…&gt; Choose the iqy file and press get data.<br />
<br />
It may be a problem which is related with Google document because when I create a web query which links to some other links, all the rows more than 100 return in Excel correctly.<br />
For example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Featured_content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Featured_content</a><br />
We can import data from this link more than 100 rows.<br />

<p>@ Gloria - Welcome to the support forum for Excel. I see that you are working for Microsoft and are a Moderator. Because you are new to the forum, please allow me to explain something about the expectations that I and other volunteers have regarding your
 activity here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You did an excellent job describing what might be the issue, and that is good. Your reply is likely to answer RH's question. Step-by-step instructions with screen shots would have been better, but at least your answer is technically correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you did not notice that this is a question posted to the general release forum about an Insider build of Excel. You should have moved this question to the Insider forum immediately after RH's indication of the build being used. This is a sore spot
 for us volunteers, who take a dim view of employees who rely on us to do the work you are being paid to do. Some of the other employees are now viewed as lazy or incompetent because they leave tasks they should perform for other moderators. Please don't allow
 yourself to get tagged with a bad reputation that way. Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Word 2011 for Mac</h2>
                    I see there have been some questions about this from others and my apologies if mine has been answered elsewhere. I am running Word 2011 v. 14.7.3 on Sierra 10.12.6. Word crashes when the computer is left for a short while. Documents are recovered and
 seem to be intact when Word is reopened - but it is annoying. Advice welcome. Thank you

<p>Hi Jedwards1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create the list of folders by yourself. For example: Go to ~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft, check if there’s Office folder under it. If not, just create it. Then check if there’s a folder named “User Templates” under ~/Library/Application
 Support/Microsoft/Office/, if not, just create it. Then you can put all things back to this folder.</p>
<p>For your scenario, some computer steps are not easy for you. What’s your Office 365 product? Do you have an Office 365 subscription or do you use One-time purchase? If you have Office 365 subscription, we suggest you upgrade to Office 2016 for Mac, this
 will be free for you to do the update. You can download Office 2016 for Mac to see the result. If you use One-time purchase version, please let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rena</p>

    <title>Beware of &#34;fake&#34; Malwaretips site - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jsssssssss  say:</h3>
<h2>            Beware of &#34;fake&#34; Malwaretips site</h2>
                    <p>Just meant as an info:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I happened to stumble over a "Virus removal" site called: malwaretips.<strong>org</strong><br />
This is clearly yet another one of the "millions" of EnigmaSoftware sponsored/owned sites - pushing Spyhunter.<br />
I'm surprised that I never before saw that one.<br />
<br />
A lot of people (me included) often answer when asked: "Yes yes Malwaretips is a known, reliable site".<br />
That's why I thought it's okay to post this "warning".<br />
<br />
Real: malwaretips.<strong>com</strong><br />
"Fake": malwaretips.<strong>org</strong><br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
J</p>

            <p>Yes...when searching for malware removal assistance (and removal guides) on the Internet,
<strong>it is not unusual to find numerous hits from untrustworthy and scam sites which mis-classify detections or provide misleading information</strong>. This is deliberately done more as a
<strong>scam</strong> to entice folks into buying an advertised fix or using a questionable removal tool.
<strong>SpyHunter</strong> (SpyHunter-Installer.exe), an ineffective program from Enigma Software Group (ESG) with a history of employing aggressive and deceptive advertising is one of the most common "so-called" removal tools pushed by these sites.</p>

            <p>McAfee will not flag Binkiland (aka Vosteran) as a virus because it is apparently not a virus (lol). Depending on your level of infection it is either a totally unwanted adware-ridden version of Google Chrome which has installed as your default browser,
 or an infected existing copy of Google Chrome which is now ridden with adware.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If I find a fault in the MalwareTips.com instructions, I tell them. The Virus/Malware authors release multiple versions to try to fool the Anti-Virus and Anti-Malware software. The MalwareTips instructions are NOT always the same. I do keep "Hitman Pro"
 in reserve because it is only one-time free I find that the people who get one infection usually get another one until they learn common sense.</p>

</p><p>EnigmaSoftware does not create legitimate products and the malwaretips.org website is trying to piggyback on the success of malwaretips.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, malwaretips.com has had trouble with malware in the past. Back in the day they were blacklisted by Google and the site was inaccessible on Chrome because of it. Google is not going to lie about what websites contain malware and trojans.
 The fact that malwaretips.com contains malware now is alarming, but nothing new. I just wouldn't go there or take them seriously as an internet security blog and forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree that the articles on malwaretips.com are garbage compared to other security blogs. They are copied and pasted. The name of the alleged infection are the only things they replace. This to me is very concerning as many pieces of adware and
 unwanted programs are different so they should contain different analysis and instructions. I do find that this causes them to publish a lot of false information and that's not good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the "fake" social media accounts. I have noticed that too and don't think that any realistic website would ever pull such a blackhat move.</p>

 is not the case. In these instances the detection is a "<a href="http://antivirus.about.com/library/glossary/bldef-false.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">false positive</span></a>" and can be ignored.<br />
<br />
Most of the well known specialized tools we use as malware fighters are written by experts/Security Colleagues at various security forums like Bleeping Computer, TechSupport, GeeksToGo, SypwareInfo and other similar sites so
<strong>they can be trusted</strong>...this includes any program hosted by BC for download. Unfortunately, many of these tools (or their embedded files) are repeatedly falsely detected by various anti-virus programs from time to time. This sometimes results
 in an inaccurate site rating/warning of potentially dangerous software.<br />
<br />
Many site rating vendors (i.e. McAfee SiteAdvisor, WOT) use a system of volunteer testers that continually patrol the Internet to browse sites, download files, and enter information on sign-up forms. All the results are documented and supplemented with feedback
 from users, Web site owners, and analysis from their own employees. The advising site vendor then summarizes the results sometimes into a color-coded red, yellow and green ratings scale to help inform Web users as to the safety of each tested site. While these
 tools are useful, they are not foolproof and sometimes may provide misleading ratings. Just because you visit a risky site does not automatically mean the site is bad or that your system has been infected by going there. Thus,
<strong>the use of such rating sites does not always guarantee an accurate rating of the results they provide</strong>. Bleeping Computer has been incorrectly rated from time to time....see this
<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/525478/mcafee-site-advisor-bleepingcomputer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<br />
Rest assured our Security Colleagues are trustworthy and all the programs hosted for downloading at BleepingComputer are malware-free and perfectly safe to use.<br />
<br />
<strong>The problem is really with the anti-virus vendors who keep targeting these specialized tools/programs for various reasons and NOT with the tools themselves</strong>. We can inform the developers but they have encountered this issue many times before
 and in most cases there isn't much they can do about it. Once the detection is reported to the anti-virus vendor, they are usually quick to fix it by releasing an updated definition database.

<h2>            office 365 added product keys to wrong account</h2>
                    We are a MS partner and we accidentely added product keys to the wrong Office 365 customer account. How can we disconnect the product keys from one account and re-assign them on to the correct Office 365 account?<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Excel not allowing for paste special between sheets</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">On Excel on iPad, if you try to copy formulas, for example, from one sheet, and open another sheet in a different file on the Excel app, it won't give the full paste special options e.g. formulas, formats, values. It only displays
 "picture". Paste special works fine within the same sheet, just not across sheets. Any advice? Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>Hi Vijay!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Excel version number is 2.21 (190109), and I'm using it on an iPad Pro, with the latest iOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To replicate the problem:</p>
<p>1. Open an Excel file #1</p>
<p>2. Copy a few cells with formulas</p>
<p>3. Open an Excel file #2</p>
<p>4. Paste special, and you will only see "Picture"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to have the options to paste values, formulas or formats. And as I say, it works fine copy and paste special within the same file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Leo</p>
