<h2>            Create installation media for Windows</h2>
                    I'm trying to download the installation media tool for Windows 8.1 but each time I go to the download page it's Blank. I've tried it in multiple browsers and disabled adblock, but still all i get is a blank white page. Do I need to connect my User to the
 Microsoft account in order for it to work, because right now it's on the local account?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s great to know that you are using Windows 8 and thank you for providing us an opportunity to assist you with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have mentioned that you get an error message: “There's a problem with this drive. Scan the drive and fix it now” when you connect your iPod Classic with the Windows 8 computer. I would like to ask you a few questions first, to get a clear picture of
 the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Does this happen with all the USB devices that you connect to the computer? Or is this issue specific to the iPod device?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Did you try running the scan for checking the disk errors?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Have you made any recent change on the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Did you check the issue by connecting the iPod on a different USB port?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This error message is usually displayed when there is an error within the USB drive that you connect with the computer. These errors could be due to some corrupted files. You will also get this message if you remove the USB drive abruptly without clicking
 “safely remove this device” from taskbar. I would suggest you to try these steps and check the status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1: Run the Hardware Troubleshooter</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hardware Troubleshooter is an automated tool which will check the hardware connected to the computer for any known issues with it and provides the details and on how to fix them. Follow these steps and run the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press “Windows Logo” + “W” keys from the keyboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Type “Troubleshooting” in the search bar and press “Enter”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>In the “Troubleshooting” window, click on “View All” on the left pane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click on “Hardware and Devices”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on “Advanced” and then click on “Run as Administrator”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click “Next” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2: Disk Error Checking</b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>I would suggest you to perform a complete scan on iPod drive to check if there is any errors and check. Refer to these steps:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Right click on the iPod drive from the Windows Explorer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on “Properties” and then click on the “Tools” tab from the properties window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click the check button under “Error Checking” to scan errors in the drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note: Data available on bad sectors in the disk might be lost when windows tries to repair your disc.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this did not help, then I would also suggest you to uninstall the USB driver and restart the computer so that Windows 8 will automatically detect and install the suitable driver files once again. Try this and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3: Uninstalling and reinstalling the USB drivers. </b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to uninstall the USB driver and restart the computer so that Windows will automatically detect and install the driver files once again. Refer these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Disconnect the iPod device from the computer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press “Windows Logo” + “X” keys on the keyboard and select “Device Manager” from the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Locate USB controllers and expand it to find the USB ports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Right click and select “Uninstall”, repeat the same for all ports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Now, restart the computer and connect the iPod back, for Windows 8 to detect and re-install the suitable drivers.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we’d be happy to help you further.</p>

 Please advise specifically for ipod.

    <title>Is there a way to view a Windows7 theme BEFORE I download it&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rachellini  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a way to view a Windows7 theme BEFORE I download it&#63; &#40;this is the site I&#39;m referring to  http&#58;&#47;&#47;windows.microsoft.com&#47;en-CA&#47;windows&#47;downloads&#47;personalize&#63;T1&#61;desktopgadgets&#41;   </h2>
                    
<p>I would rather not have them ALL in my computer just to see if I like the pictures.&nbsp; AND if I don't have the option to view the pictures first, once I download a theme then is there a way to PERMANANTLY DELETE them from my computer after viewing them?&nbsp; (I
 have downloaded Australia Theme in hopes to view the pictures first, but I had to select the theme in order for it to show me its pictures)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would rather NOT have unnecessary pictures/themes etc in my computer if I'm not going to ever look at them or use them (makes sense, right?&nbsp; Why bog up your computer with stuff you're never going to use or need?).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried going into c:/ to find out where they are stored to delete the entire file but had no luck finding out how to get to where they are saved .... ie. from my&nbsp; Desktop Background page is says they are here (C:\Users\Rachel\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Themes\Australia\DesktopBackground)
 but when I try to find the "AppData" folder it is no where to be found??? How am I not able to access or find it?</p>
<p>Any help would be wonderful.&nbsp; Thanx.&nbsp; BTW, I have Windows7 Ultimate (not sure if that's important, but it wasn't specifically on the list when I typed in this question)</p>

            <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">OMG, I totally found out a solution to my situation!!!</span></strong>&nbsp; Yay, me!&nbsp;&nbsp;But still,&nbsp;&nbsp;*sigh* &nbsp;2+ hours of my life wasted on silly knowledge.&nbsp; Anyways, here's what I did:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li><span>right-clicked on the theme (from the website listed in my original Question)</span>
</li><li><span>selected “save target as”</span>
</li><li><span>chose the folder&nbsp;I wanted to save it in</span>
</li><li><span>went to&nbsp;that folder</span>
</li><li><span>dbl-clicked the folder (it opened&nbsp;into the “My Themes” section of Control Panel’s Personalization folder -- I freaked out a bit at this point, thinking I was back to square
 one, but then I found out what I could do.)</span> </li><li><span>dbl-clicked “Desktop Background Slide Show” icon at the bottom of that page (all pics&nbsp;displayed in&nbsp;a new page)</span>
</li><li><span><span>right-clicked&nbsp;a pic &amp; chose “Open with”&nbsp;my picture viewer&nbsp;of choice.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>I&nbsp;chose my ACDSee viewer, so once I selected “open with ACDSee” I&nbsp;could edit &amp; DELETE individual pics from there!!<span>&nbsp;
</span>And when I deleted a pic from ACDSee it is also deleted from my desktop themes page!&nbsp;
<strong>BUT,</strong> when I deleted all&nbsp;pics&nbsp;from ACDSee (thinking they’re all gone) they showed up when I went&nbsp;back&nbsp;and did #5 again (as a "test" to see if anything would open).<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Sooooo I discovered that
<strong>right-click</strong> the folder</span>, chose “delete”, and VOILA! It asks if I want to send it to the recycle bin.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Happy times.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Now, this only worked because I was able to find the main folder of the theme pack … but&nbsp;if I had no idea where Windows7 sent my download to then I obviously
 cannot delete the folder (or individual files).<span>&nbsp; Duh, right? But sometimes you
<em>just don't know</em> where Windows keeps your stuff.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Anyways, if this helps out someone else out there then I'm happy and if&nbsp;I helped&nbsp;no one I'm still&nbsp;happy.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp;&nbsp; Small victory for most ppl, but it was drivin' me nuts!
<br />
<br />
Take care, all.&nbsp; Windows7 seems pretty good so far ... I've only had it for a couple days, so there's much to discover and explore and get happy with and get frustrated with.&nbsp; I'll probably be back to this forum some day.&nbsp;

<p><b><span>Unfortunately there is no way for you to reset the gamerscore, however if the achievements were earnt illegitimately then you may find it will be reset by the Policy Enforcement
 Team. In which case all the achievements will be reset, including the ones you unlocked before your account became compromised. It may be a better idea to start a new profile.

<h2>            No Audio Output Device is Installed</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a red x over my volume icon in the taskbar that says "No audio output device is installed"; it randomly showed up a few days ago. In control panel &gt; sound, there are no playback or recording devices listed and it says "no audio devices are installed"
 (there usually are a bunch of entries).&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there are 3 sound drivers that show up (Realtek High Definition Audio, HTO Striker 7.1, ATI HDMI Audio) in device manager and all are listed as working properly. I have tried uninstalling, restarting the computer, and reinstalling drivers from the
 manufacturers and nothing seems to help. I checked and onboard audio is enabled in the BIOS. It seems very odd that "sound" thinks there is no audio installed, but device manager says that everything is fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Windows 7 64-bit running on a machine I built myself, here is my hardware:</p>
<p>motherboard: Gigabyte GA-EP45T-UD3LR (Realtek ALC888 onboard audio)</p>
<p>processor: Intel E8500 Core 2 Duo 3.16 GHz</p>
<p>sound card: HT Omega Striker 7.1</p>
<p>video card: Sapphire ATI Radeon HD 5770</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated, I use this computer for music and tv/movies so it hurts not having any sound, thanks!</p>

<br />
Also update or re-install the driver.</p>
<p>Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High<br />
Definition Audio&nbsp;(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version.<br />
Now Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers.<br />
Then RIGHT CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on<br />
and RUN AS ADMIN (This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the<br />
reboot to see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot<br />
until it is. It can take several tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<h3> aos_matt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Enter network credentials box disappears</h2>
                    <p>My organization has systems setup for testing purposes that are not connected to our active directory, but we still access software installations from a network share.&nbsp; The test systems in question are setup to be signed in with a local standard user account
 with a local admin account also active on the system to run things that required admin privileges (i.e. software installations).&nbsp; It appears there must have been a windows update released in the last few weeks that has broken this setup.&nbsp; What normally would
 happen is when you browsed to the network share, it would ask for the network credentials.&nbsp; When you ran a file on the share that required admin permissions, the UAC prompt would ask you for the admin's password.&nbsp; After putting in that password, you would
 get another prompt to enter the network credentials since the process is now being run by the admin account.&nbsp;

</p><p>In the last week or so, when we get that second box to enter the credentials, none of the fields are in focus and when you click on the window it disappears and locks the system.&nbsp; The only way to get around the lock is to do a ctrl + alt + delete and then
 click cancel on the screen that asks if you want to change your password, start task manager, etc.&nbsp; I am able to work around this by copying the files down locally to the system and then running the installation, but this is not an ideal solution.&nbsp; Has anyone
 else seen this issue?&nbsp; Is this something Microsoft knows about and will address in the next batch of Windows Updates?&nbsp; We are currently running Windows 10 (build 1607).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

            I was having this same issue and resolved it by mapping the UNC path to a drive and using the /savecred switch when mapping, saving my domain credentials that the UNC required.

<h2>             How do I copy vista to a new hard drive</h2>
                    I want to upgrade to Windows 7 and have pruchased the disk. Before I do that I want to install a new 1TB hard drive. How to I copy Vista from the old drive to the new drive?

<p>You need to re-install Vista on the new drive ( a clean installation) and then activate it and then upgrade it to Windows7 and activate that.&nbsp; First backup your data - that's pretty much all you're going to be able to save.&nbsp; You're going to need to reinstall
 all your programs and reset all your settings - they cannot be copied over to the new drive.&nbsp; It just doesn't work that way.&nbsp; One option that may allow you to transfer a bit more than just data (but still not the programs) is to use EasyTransfer:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928635" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928635</a>.&nbsp;Review the process and see if you can make it work in your situation.</p>
<p>Sorry there isn't a simpler solution that preserves everything on the original drive, but even if you did a complete image backup and restored it to the new drive, the device driver for the hard drive would be wrong and it&nbsp;may not be possible to change it
 with the limited access you will have to the system without being able to boot to the hard drive.&nbsp; If you can find a way to install the hard drive driver after the restore using only disk access (which may be possible depending on what you were provided by
 the hard drive manufacurer - it would need to be a bootable disk that can install device drivers even if the hard drive can't be accessed), then this becomes a viable option - but I'm not sure how to do that or if any manufacturer provides such a disk.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>It sounds like your machine never completes a boot-up operation.&nbsp; Probably a bad driver on the disk.</p>
<p>If I were in this situation, I'd boot from a CD boot disk, back up my files, and reinstall Windows.&nbsp; In the long run, it would be quicker than trying to find the problem and fix it.</p>

<h2>            Dual monitor setup - only one monitor displays login screen, 2nd monitor is black</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I've searched hi and low and am starting to believe this just isn't possible from other people's posts.&nbsp; But since the last time this question was posted was in 2011, I'm hoping there has been a resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get my secondary monitor to show an image (any image would be great) while my computer is locked or just starting up and reaches the login screen.&nbsp; Currently my secondary monitor just shows a black screen.&nbsp; I do not wish to set my display to extend
 all the way across two monitors (mosaic on nvidia video card) because when I do, my task bar also extend across the entire length of both screens.&nbsp; I like to use it to click one-time on my programs rather than cluttering my desktop with icons and having it
 sit vertically between both monitors. I am unable to do it any other way.&nbsp; Please let me know if anyone knows how to do this.&nbsp; Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the mentioned steps and see if it helps:</p>
<p>
<strong>Method 1:</strong>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Duplicate the display settings and check if you can view the Screensaver in the extended monitor as well.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To change your display settings to extended</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Open Screen Resolution by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, and then, under Appearance and Personalization, clicking Adjust screen resolution.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click the drop-down list next to multiple displays, click Duplicate these display, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Multiple displays option appears only when Windows detects more than one monitor connected to your PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If you don't see an option named Multiple displays in your display settings, then Windows isn't detecting a second monitor plugged into your desktop computer. Or, it is not detecting an external monitor plugged into your laptop. When
 Windows detects this monitor, it will appear in the drop-down list next to Display. If you don't see it listed there, try clicking Detect.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Make sure the monitor you want to extend your desktop to is turned on and plugged into the correct video port on your computer. You might also need to select the correct source labeled on your monitor's controls to ensure the monitor
 is using the correct video port. For more information, check the manual for your monitor or go to the manufacturer's website.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following link for more information:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check the display resolution set for both monitors. Make sure the screen resolution is the same on each display.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

Put the batch file command in your startup folder. It will run when you start Windows and delete the specified files.<br />

<h2>            Using a Panasonic DV Camera with Firewire &#47; IEEE 1394 to import video - why do I need to use legacy drivers on Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I was only able to to import video from my DV camerea once I loaded the legacy drivers for my 1394 OHCI Host Controller. I found this solution on various forums.</p>
<p>What I don't understand is why the default driver does not work in Windows 7? Vista was fine without problems. Does this imply this will not work on future versions of Windows?</p>
<p>The main reason for me to use a Firewire interface was to reduce the likelyhood / dependency of driver issues.</p>
<p>Does anyone know why the standard driver does not work?</p>

<p>It is possible that your device is not compatible with windows 7 and hence legacy drivers are working and not the current one.<br />
<br />
check the compatibility of your device<br />

<h3> jgar70  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to sort by file size in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So i know you can use the bar towards the top in File explorer but if I have a file that within it has a lot of other files its just blank?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to delete games from my steam library which is spread across 4 different drives. So I open the common folder in file explorer and see all of the game names but because they are a folder with lots of files within them it shows nothing for the size.
 Other than right clicking and looking into the properties or hovering over each file is there a way to just organize them all?</p>

            Hi jgar70, Windows has never been able to show folder sizes, it is a feature that has sadly been lacking for years

<br />Click the link below to download a great small free utility called Treesize.

<h2>            Temporary profile - unable to create new user profile</h2>
                    My parent's computer has 2 profiles. The one set up as a standard user keeps loading with a temporary profile. I've tried all the fixes shown on the other threads and tried to create a new user profile to copy the folders to. I've tried using the admin
 account and the built in admin account and neither will let me add any other users. Any ideas what I can do?

</p><blockquote>
<p>So I did some investigation, and I believe these errors are harmless&nbsp;(but please, MS, get rid of the errors if they're harmless!)&nbsp; If you're having issues with your apps, these errors may be totally unrelated as you can get them even when nothing's actually&nbsp;wrong.&nbsp;
 Keep reading if you want to know if they're actually causing you a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways.&nbsp; What I did was go to the Event Viewer, and find Applications and Services -&gt; Microsoft -&gt; Windows -&gt; Appmodel-Runtime -&gt; Admin.&nbsp; That's the log these errors are coming from.&nbsp; Reading it will be MUCH easier if you create a custom view based on it,
 then "Filter Current Custom View", and where it says "&lt;All Event IDs&gt;", type in -39,-40,-41.&nbsp; That will filter out a ton of useless messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's left after you do that is interesting.&nbsp; For every one of these "error" events, there are two accompanying "Information" events that basically contradict the error message.&nbsp; All 3 will usually happen in the same second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's an example of a set of these 3 events from my log.&nbsp; Since all 3 occur in the same second,&nbsp;they&nbsp;aren't properly sorted by time.&nbsp; There's no reason to think they actually happen in the order they're displayed in the log.&nbsp; I'd guess the real order is
 most likely the middle Error happens first, then the bottom "Information" that sets the status successfully, then the top "package successfully updated" event.&nbsp; In fact, I'll paste them here in that order:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Event 1 - the error of failing to&nbsp;set the&nbsp;status to it's proper "finished" status:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d3776cb3-4b2e-48c5-a0e2-befec43bf2ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d3776cb3-4b2e-48c5-a0e2-befec43bf2ad" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Event 2 - the instantly successful retry&nbsp;which sets the status to the desired value:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9b0f51c6-b364-426e-a785-3b4f2f9bcbe8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9b0f51c6-b364-426e-a785-3b4f2f9bcbe8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Event 3 - and finally the app updated successfully event:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b521a2c6-9390-4ecc-bc32-9565841e182b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b521a2c6-9390-4ecc-bc32-9565841e182b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Looking through my log, every single time I get this error, I also get the successful retry and completion of the update within 1 second (EDIT:&nbsp; Oops, not quite, see the EDIT at the bottom of this post).&nbsp; If you're actually having trouble using your apps,
 you can check your own log as described above to see if these errors are actually related (i.e. the status *doesn't* get fixed a fraction of a second later) to your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if you're only trying to get rid of these errors in the log, and don't actually have any problems with your apps, I'd stop trying all the "AppManifest" solutions that have been posted.&nbsp; You're more likely to break something than to fix anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, I doubt there's anything at all we can do to get rid of the errors.&nbsp; I think only Microsoft can fix these false error messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;they can't fix what's causing the status to fail to update on the first try,&nbsp;they could easily&nbsp;(and IMHO should as
 a matter of good programming practice) inject a bit of exception handling code that will always retry the status change a couple of times before&nbsp;actually throwing an error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, consider this my official request to Microsoft that they do that very thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unnecessary error messages like&nbsp;this are very distracting to the purpose of the Event log in tracking down REAL problems, as evidenced by *every single previous poster
 in this thread* who has real problems with their apps that thinks this harmless error is pointing to the root cause, when it quite probably lies elsewhere..</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you're the original poster and are satisfied by this explanation, please mark it as the Answer!&nbsp; Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:&nbsp; Oops.&nbsp; I did just find two consecutive instances of this error that did not result in a successful retry.&nbsp; The package update&nbsp;that doesn't get fixed is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft.NET.Native.Runtime.1.4_1.4.24201.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe </p>
<p>
</p><p>That's worrisome.&nbsp; Those two errors happened about 18 hours ago and it hasn't tried to redo them yet.&nbsp; I'm going to check for it again over the next few days and sees what happens if/when it tries to update it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, this is all on a clean install of the Windows 10 Anniversary Update that I created about 40 hours ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks man you solved my problem and saved me a massive wild goose chase and the trouble of re-writing windows as others have done/are doing to fix it as it is the recommended solution, I bet many who did the recommended solution never has a problem.</p>
<p>I certainly was not going to try it as it jsut sounded mental.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was not even a real world problem for me anyway just the entry in the log.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not that I do not great real world problems such as boot failures periodically but that is I think a different matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the **** is going on with all this crap anyway?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is modifying stuff that works, and breaking it???? </p>
<p>
</p><p>**** mental!</p>
<p>AS you point out most of these error get cleared automatically, both mind didn't so I am happy, I didn't have an unlcear one as you discoverd you had.</p>

If you can't do the work yourself (and there is no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea), take the machine to a professional computer repair shop (not your local equivalent of BigComputerStore/GeekSquad).&nbsp;Please be aware that not all local shops are
 skilled at removing malware and even if they are, your computer may be so infested that Windows will need to be clean-installed. If possible, have all your data backed up before you take the machine into a shop.

    <title>Need for Continuing Support for Microsoft LifeCam Cinema Installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> henryg.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need for Continuing Support for Microsoft LifeCam Cinema Installation</h2>
                    <p>Please be informed that Microsoft partners are still selling this webcam product for Windows 7 operation.</p>
<p>The often repeated 2009 posting regarding the inability to start-up the webcam has not yet been addressed to the point that a definitive corrective procedure has been posted.</p>
<p>I just bought my 2nd LifeCam, having been convinced that my first webcam had developed a short, "or some other mechanical defect".</p>
<p>The replacement webcam has much the same problem...something is causing the camera (its blue light) to shut off a second or two after the plug is inserted into a USB port.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to correct this problem?</p>

<p><strong><span>The MS LifeCam Cinema webcam (model 1393) works fine on Windows 7.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>But;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In my experience, installation requires one to download the LifeCam 3.60 driver from the Microsoft Support website.</span></p>
<p><span><span>I think this Download
<strong>only works for a Windows 10 computer</strong></span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span>I also think the camera is specifically sold for Windows 7 (although the webcam MAY also work on Windows 10).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>My own problem seems to have been that
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>I could download the MS driver using a Windows 10 computer; but,
</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>select that the driver would be Windows 7 compatible</span></span></strong><span> (so that the webcam would operate on my Windows 7 computer).</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I also had to<strong> transfer the downloaded LifeCam driver from the Windows 10 computer to a Thumb Drive</strong></span><span>, so that I could install it
 in the Windows 7 computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>It happens that my
<strong>laptop</strong></span><span> operates with a simple, (single-bootable) Windows 7 (64-bit) Pro system.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When I moved the LifeCam (Win 7) driver from my Thumb Drive to the laptop, I could
</span><strong><span>then install the LifeCam Cinema on the
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>I did not investigation trying to install and operate the webcam using a Windows 10 computer because I had used Windows 10 to download ONLY the
<strong>Windows 7 compatible driver</strong></span><span>.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>(The Windows 7 compatible driver <strong>would not open</strong> on a Windows 10 computer!)</span></li><li>
<span>(I did not try to download a Windows 10 compatible driver because I was already ‘caught up in my underwear’ trying to get the webcam working with Skype on my Windows 7 computer.)</span></li><li>
<span>(If you are still reading, you might be interested that my desktop computer is actually Dual Bootable…Windows 7 or 10…and
<span>I plan to ask my IT tech to try to fix the issue on the dual-bootable desktop. He set it up for me.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In conclusion; I recommend that you not continue to sell this product (at least without an appropriate warning, if you could draft such a thing).</span></p>
