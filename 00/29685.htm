            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your response.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to follow the steps below and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Boot computer in <strong>Safe mode</strong> and check if issue persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly or that might prevent Windows from starting correctly. Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer below link on how to boot computer in Safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2809468?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2809468?wa=wsignin1.0</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> &nbsp;To exit from Safe mode, restart your computer and let the Windows start normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If the computer works fine in safe mode, <strong><span>perform a Clean boot</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting".</span></p>
<p>

<p>I too have a problem of "no sound after upgrade". </p>
<p>Every solution suggestion advises one to make sure that the speakers are enabled. My problem is that the in-built speakers and microphone are permanently disabled. From 'manage sound devices' I can manually disable and enable the devices, but the 'disabled'
 indication still appears below the speakers' icon'. When manually disabled, the indications moves to above the icons. The volume signal floats according to the level that should be coming out of the speakers. I have updated the driver several times, changing
 from the Realtek to the Microsoft. The only sound that I hear is a soft 'pop' when the drivers are changing whilst restarting the computer. Two Microsoft technicians from the support group have tried, remotely, to fix the problem, unsuccessfully. They took
 control of my computer and tested and changed the drivers themselves. Both were stuck on the idea that the driver is responsible for the fault. I believe that the 'clue' that 'disabled' is always on, must point to something else that is holding the items disabled.
 The last technician was sure that the problem would be fixed after installing a driver from Dynabook, and asking me to restart. in fact, he signed off the chat. In fact the driver was not the correct one, and the computer did not change anything. I have since
 installed the suggested driver from Toshiba, with no success.</p>
<p>The laptop is a Satellite P50t-B-113, which originally had windows 8.1. It has been on Window 10 for years, wwith the speakers working until last month, when I had to reinstall Windows from a dvd with Windows 10 downloaded from Microsoft last October.</p>
<p>Another problem seen recenly was that the driver for the RADEON R9 M265X is not installed, and cannot be installed. The first Microsoft technician noticed this and tried to install the driver. Half way through the computer hang up and contact with him was
 lost. I am not sure if this has any bearing on the sound problem or not.</p>
<p>I have tried driver updates, through Driver Booster, Driver Easy etc. None seemed to work in this case.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Updating/roll back/re-installing drivers does not work.</p>

</p><p>The speakers work fine on my other PC.</p>

                    <p>I keep having a blue box with a pin verification required pop up constantly.&nbsp; It starts with when I log on to my computer and continues the entire time I am on the internet.&nbsp; I have tried going into my account settings to disable it and it says that there
 is no pin assigned.&nbsp; I am the only user of the computer.&nbsp; I have tried everything to figure out where it is coming from and there is no indicator at all.&nbsp; From reading other posts I have seen that it may be an outside program causing the issue.&nbsp; How do I figure
 out what program would be causing this so I can delete it and/or how do I get it to stop?</p>

<h2>            Audio playing stops randomly</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I am using windows 10 version 1703 64 bit. Suddenly I get an <strong>X</strong> mark on audio icon in taskbar and sound stops working, it happens randomly no specific time, when I run troubleshooter I get this
<strong>( as seen in image below ),</strong> I have checked <strong>" Windows audio, and Windows audio endpoint builder services"</strong> and they are running and startup type is set to
<strong>"Automatically"</strong>. The thing is when I restart my laptop it works and then stops again. I have tried to uninstall and reinstall audio drivers, but no luck. I also used system file checker, it did not find any integrity violations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to solve this issue?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now when I start my laptop the problem happens, I have to restart it to make the sound work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Non of the above solutions worked for me. Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi Khaled,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you already utilized the audio troubleshooter and the System File Checker tool, but the issue is still occurring, we suggest that you perform perform a clean boot.
<span>This eliminates software conflicts that occur when you install or update&nbsp; a program or a driver in Windows 10. Once the computer is a clean boot state, you can try updating the audio drivers again. You can refer to this article:

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have performed a clean boot in windows and uninstalled, reinstalled audio drivers, checked for updates, and it worked perfect all day, but just before I sleep it happened again I think that it happened after I have muted the sound ( after about 20 minutes
 ).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for late reply, but I had to wait a whole day to make sure it won't happen again.</p>

<p>Since you already performed a clean boot, but it only work for a couple of moment, try to
<strong>uninstall</strong> the <strong>audio driver</strong> from the <strong>Device Manager</strong>, then go
<strong>Services</strong>, then stop&nbsp;<strong>Windows Audio</strong> and <strong>Windows Audio Endpoint Builder</strong>. After that, restart your computer. The audio driver will be reinstalled automatically after you rebooted your computer. Once your computer
 is completely rebooted, go to Services, then run the Windows Audio and Windows Audio Endpoint Builder services.</p>

Along with the HP Stream were a variety of 8 inch Tablet devices such as such as the Dell Venue Pro. With the introduction of Windows 10, migrating these devices to Windows 10 might prove difficult because of their low storage capacity, but it is possible to do so.

<h2>            Windows Backup Won&#39;t Start</h2>
                    <p>Computer is running Win 7 Ultimate.&nbsp; I've defined a backup in the "Backup and Restore" panel, and it was running up until last month.&nbsp; Now suddenly it doesn't run as scheduled, and the only error message is that the backup was not successful.&nbsp; When I click
 on "More Information"', get the trouble shooting window and click on Retry, the "Busy" cursor pointer displays for an instant, then nothing, not even an error message.&nbsp; The same thing happens when I click on "Backup Now".&nbsp; No matter how I try to run the backup,
 nothing works.&nbsp;&nbsp; Can anybody help me with this?&nbsp; This is a business machine, and mission critical for the business.&nbsp; My data is being backed up on line in the meantime, but I need to get a system image backup.</p>
<p>I've looked at all the other "Backup Won't Start" questions, but no help there either.</p>

            <p>I suggest you get away from the Windows backup program and get yourself a good commercial backup program. This forum is fraught with problem reports for the Windows one. I know I was very unimpressed when I tried it. Three I'm familiar with and like are
<b>Norton Ghost </b>(which I've been using for 8 years without the 1st problem), <b>
<i>Easeus Todo Backup Free</i></b>, which you can download from </p>
<p><a href="http://www.todo-backup.com/products/home/free-backup-software.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://www.todo-backup.com/products/home/free-backup-software.htm</u></a>
 and <b>Memeo</b> which has a 30 day free trial and you can buy it for $29.99 - you can download it from
<a href="http://memeo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://memeo.com</u></a> . You can get Ghost for next
 to nothing (like I did) if you watch the sales. </p>
<p>The March 2012 issue of PC World is very high on the FREE program from Easeus, and I've been testing it lately in a variety of configurations and have to say I'm very impressed. Like Ghost it will back up to a networked drive, and it will create a boot CD
 for when your PC won't boot.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>CNET has a lot of backup program reviews at </p>
<p><a href="http://download.cnet.com/windows/backup-software/?tag=contentBody;sideBar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://download.cnet.com/windows/backup-software/?tag=contentBody;sideBar</u></a>
 .</p>
<p>Some of these are free (last time I checked there were over 300), some have free trials (over 1000), and some are purchase only (over 200).</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>External hard drives are best for backup. You can get a 500 GB one for around $70 and a 1.5 TB one for around $90. You can also buy a 16 GB flash drive for as little as $10. It's the best insurance you can ever buy!</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I hope this helps. Good luck</p>

            <p>Thanks for the info and the links, I do appreciate them.&nbsp; FWIW, however,I looked at the Todo Backup, and when I started to download the free version I was smacked in the face with a comment saying, "DONT USE THIS PROGRAM"&nbsp; I seems that the very reason that
 I need the System Image backup - disaster recovery -&nbsp;is&nbsp;exactly what that program won't do, namely a "Bare Metal" recovery".&nbsp; I'm looking into the other two that you mentioned, however.</p>
<p>I just don't understand what could be causing my problem; I have three other Win 7 computers and a Server running (Win7 based) Server 2008 R2, and they've been faithfully backing up files and system images for months, without a problem; and had to do a bare
 metal recovery on my laptop with its backup, and that went beautifully, without incident.</p>
<p>It's really a shame that the Windows product is problematic.&nbsp; Before I retired from my 50+ year career in IT, on of the "Prime Directives" in our mainframe and mega-mini shops was, "Don't mix products", and I guess I'm still in that kind of mindset.</p>
<p>Well, enough nostalgia.&nbsp; Thanks for your help, and I'll be looking in to those products, although I'd truly prefer to be able to fix whatever's wrong with the Windows Backup.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;I just downloaded the Easeus program and got no sign of that "DON'T USE THIS PROGRAM" message you mentioned.&nbsp; That sounds like you have a virus.&nbsp; I don't know exactly what you mean&nbsp;by "bare metal recovery", but I assume you mean something like the ability
 to boot from a disc and completely restore your system over a corrupted one.&nbsp; If that's what you mean, the Easeus program WILL do that.&nbsp; If I'm misinterpreting your meaning, let me know.

            <p>this is a Windows help forum, the customer came for help with his Windows 7 backup operations, he didn't ask for recommendations on third party tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The libraries in Win7, or reparse points, &nbsp;should be populated with the files associated with libraries. There will be a file somewhere, such as a movie download for example, sitting on the desktop, that is preventing the backup to complete. You can test
 this by running a series of manual backups on just the desktop, just the documents etc to identify the library causing the issue, then you you can proceed to identify the file causing the problem.</p>

I'll certainly try that, but so far, in everything that I've tried, Windows Backup won't even start.&nbsp; When I click on the "Backup Now", nothing at all happens other than the "busy" cursor pointer, and then only for a split second.<br />

            <p>OK, now here's one for the books.&nbsp; I think that computer has developed a mind of its own.&nbsp; I thought I'd try what you suggested, so I logged on, went to the Backup and Restore control panel, and Guess What!&nbsp; The previously defined backup was no longer there.
 instead it said that a backup has not been set up.&nbsp; Can't imagine what could have caused that because it had been backing up properly until last month.&nbsp; There have been some other wacky things that have happened; two days ago when I restarted the computer
 and logged in, it came up with an entirely new desktop with none of the shortcuts on it, as though it was a new account.&nbsp; I then restarted it again and when I logged in it came up correctly with the regular desktop.</p>
<p>Anyway, I figured I'd go ahead and define a new one,&nbsp;specifying only the desktop as you suggested.&nbsp; In the final step, when I clicked on, "Save settings and run backup" I immediately got an error message box saying, "The request is not supported (8x80070032).</p>
<p>I tried it several times bue always with the same results.&nbsp; Now I'm really worried.&nbsp; Please tell me I'm not going to have to reinstall everything.&nbsp; That would take a long time, and the computer is crucial to my wire's business.</p>

<p>it is sounding like you have been logged into Windows with a temporary user account because your orginal account is corrupted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest to create a second user account with a different user ID such as your account name2.</p>

<p>Try running the backup from the new account.</p>

            <p>I sort of tried that, but got the&nbsp;same results.&nbsp; The main account&nbsp;- the one used to do business -&nbsp;came back the way it was - or at least appears to be - right after the restart following the crazy occurrence.&nbsp; The second account, however&nbsp;- the one I use
 for maintenance - is still messed up.&nbsp; When I log into it, I immediately get a "Preparing your desktop" display, then it comes up looking like a brand new account.&nbsp; Since there's nothing of any value saved in that account, I'm going to delete it and re-create
 it.&nbsp; Then I'll try again what you suggested above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll get back to you with the results, but I can't do anyghing today during business hours, because my wife is doing business on that computer.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help.</p>

I tried the above, but still didn't work, but dig this craziness.&nbsp; While the windows backup won't run from the control panel, the command line (wbadmin start bacup) does work.&nbsp; I was (thankfully) able to run a "bare metal recovery" backup using that command,
 and this would be a satisfactory work-around,.</p>
<p>There is, however, a rather aggrivating situation there.&nbsp; I printed out the "Webadmin start backup" document from Microsoft TechNet, to make sure that I did it correctly.&nbsp; Acording to that document's descrption of the "-include" switch, for Windows 7 and
 Windows Server 2008 R2, Im supposed to be able to include multiple files, folders of volumes, but that isn't true.&nbsp;There are even examples using folders in the -include switch.&nbsp; But that's not true for Win 7.&nbsp; On my server (Win Server 2008 R2) I AM able to
 specify folders - e.g. -include:d:\temp etc. - but NOT ON WIN 7 MACHINES.&nbsp; Every time I tried specifying a folder, I get an error message saying, "A partial backup of volumes is not supported on this version of windows".&nbsp; Just to verify that, I also tried
 it on my two windows 7 computers at home, and got the same results.&nbsp; This is a&nbsp;mournful situation that I have to back up an ENTIRE VOLUME when all that's needed is certain folders.&nbsp; What has Microsoft done here??&nbsp; Why would they make a false claim??&nbsp; Is there
 some patch that noone tells us about, that makes this work?</p>
<p>This is really a serious problem because we have&nbsp;two folders on the C: drive, and three on&nbsp;an external eSTATA&nbsp; (Z:) drive that need to be backed up, without having to back up those entire drives.</p>
<p>Is there any hope of a solution to this problem???????</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 Type Cover Not Working, In BIOS&#47;UEFI or Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Type Cover Not Working, In BIOS&#47;UEFI or Windows 10 after 1803 Update</h2>
                    <p>My Surface Pro 4 Keyboard with Touch is no longer being recognized by my Surface Pro 3 after updating to 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disconnected and reconnected dozens of times.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have cleaned my connectors on both the Surface Pro and the Keyboard unit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled the keyboard in Device Manager, as well as the mouse however the only things showing up there are HID compliant Mouse and Keyboard, nothing that says Surface or Type Cover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have hard reset the device several times (Volume Up and Power), also booting into UEFI/BIOS several times where the keyboard also does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I registered my device with Microsoft to of course be told it is Out of Warranty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in the process of downloading the Recovery Image from 2015 from a trustable 3rd party website since I cannot find any links to the recovery image on Microsoft's website.&nbsp; This will I think put me back in time to before the 1803 update as far as Windows
 is concerned, however I am not sure if that will fix my problem since it is not being recognized in the BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions you have would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>there are NO trusted 3rd party websites. where are you downloading from?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Go to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (if you enter</div>
<div>the serial number it should offer the correct download)&nbsp; and download a recovery</div>
<div>image for your Surface. You will need a 16GB USB stick formatted FAT32.</div>
<div>Unzip/extract the recovery zip to the formatted USB stick and then-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To reset your Surface from a USB recovery drive:</div>
<div>Step 1:&nbsp; &nbsp; Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in (hold down the power</div>
<div>button for 30 seconds).</div>
<div>Step 2:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Insert the USB recovery drive into the USB port on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 3:&nbsp; &nbsp; Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the</div>
<div>power button on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 4:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.</div>
<div>Step 5:&nbsp; &nbsp; When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.</div>
<div>Step 6:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset your PC.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; If prompted for a recovery key, select Skip this drive at the bottom of</div>
<div>the screen.</div>
<div>Step 7:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Select the target operating system you wish to reset. This</div>
<div>refers to the current operating system installed on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 8:&nbsp; &nbsp; Select Yes, repartition the drives, and on the next page, select Next.</div>
<div>Step 9:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Choose Just remove my files.</div>
<div>Step 10:&nbsp; &nbsp; Select Reset.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Surface restarts and the Surface logo displays while the reset process</div>
<div>continues (this can take a while).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it does not work in the UEFI, it is very unlikely imaging will fix this. </div>

<p>I tried to recover with Recovery Image from 2015. But nothing happens. But my Surface Pro 3 is under warranty. So I contacted to MS Support. But they coudn't resolve this. So now MS support asked me to replace this with the stocked one.</p>

Hi James</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
I have had the exact same problem with my SP3 over the last week.&nbsp; Updated using the latest firmware and because of that the type cover is no longer working.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Have tested different type covers from other SP3 and SP2017 on the non working SP3 with the same result yet they work flawlessly on their own machines.&nbsp; The type cover from the faulty SP3 works flawlessly on the other two Surfaces.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Have over the last few (sleepless) nights:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Disabled and reenabled drivers in device manager</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

I was on the telephone yesterday with a MS Surface support technician who ran me back through the bottom four of the above methods to no avail.</p>

</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
I was then told my only recourse to get a working machine was to buy a new one for around $500 (why dollars? I live in the UK!) which works out to around 600 UK pounds!&nbsp; I have to pay for MS breaking my computer!&nbsp; Now that's a business plan!</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
This problem was caused by the latest firmware Bugs that MS pushed out to everyone and they should be fixing it.&nbsp; They have already acknowledged that they bungled the SP4 update (see&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/Surface/forum/x/y/db8dcfd0-e033-443c-a01f-1a62a075f71f?auth=1">Surface

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Will MS be issuing a fix for their botched SP3 firmware update too?&nbsp; The problem is not with Windows.&nbsp;
<strong>It is with the Firmware/EUFI</strong>.&nbsp; How do I know this?&nbsp; because the keyboard does not work when booting into the EUFI setup whereas on a working SP3 it does. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
MS needs to fix this as they broke it.&nbsp; I do not want to be told its "<strong>tough luck</strong>" and "<strong>You'll have to go buy a new one</strong>" by the MS support technician!</p>

<p>Will you be please tell me, how to remove the battery ? I have read one post about draining the battery. So I tried to do it completely drain up to end of white round symbol and after confirming I lay it idle for 1 day&nbsp; Thereafter I recharge battery and
 tried but no way it responds . Still I don't have any clue.. Frustrated. Why Microsoft did not attend such difficulty and post any link? Worldwide mass people are hesitated to turn on Microsoft products .&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am one of the victims of sp3. My cover type key board work well on another sp3, but their working key board can't on mine . I have done above all the processes since from a week but not Succed to run it . This is very bad thing. MS must attend this . This
 happens because of the auto updates of firmwares .&nbsp;</p>

<p>This update broke my Surface Pro 3 so hard that no type cover works anymore (had a spare one from a previous Surface model.</p>

</p><p>I live in a country where the Surface isn't even sold officially, so I'm out of support options because of a software issue caused solely by Microsoft.

<h3> dannydw  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to restore a data backup created under Win 8.1 &#63;</h2>
                    <p>After having to re-install Windows 10 several times due to the instabilities &nbsp;with the Mail app, the Store and others, I am trying to restore by data back from a Western Digital NAS system (MyBookLive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Backup worked perfectly under Windows 8.1, but in Windows 10 I can not select this existing backup, so I can not restore my old files.</p>
<p>When setting up File History in Windows 10, a new backup set is immediately created.</p>
<p>In December 2015 I succeeded in restoring my old backup by first setting up backup in Windows 10, then turning it off again&nbsp;and copying the 2 database and 2 config files from the backup set to
</p>
<p>C:\Users\danny\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\FileHistory\Configuration and then making sure the PC-name, usernme and IP-adress were corrected to the new situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I once again had to to a reset of my system after the problems with the Store app, I am trying thi trick again, but it does not work anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noticed that File History now seems to use new naming conventions for setting up the backup files: in December a directory with the name of the PC was made, now I see a directory 'DDW' (which happens to be my initials) is made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy as I was with the file history system in Windows 8.1, I am now very worried about using the Windows file history in Windows 10. I think I will start using a third party backup software again since Microsoft is delivering VERY POOR QUALITY IN WINDOWS
 10.</p>

            <p>I did run, as suggested, the removal tool for Norton and McAfee.</p>
<p>I have no idea if something was removed or not, since these tools gave no actual result, but I would be surprised if something should have been left on my pc after at least one full system restore in Windows 8.1 and my recent (December 2015) clean install
 of Windows 10. If a clean install is not 'Clean', then Microsoft has a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still waiting for an simple answer to the question: how to restore a previous backup made in Win 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please consider also the following situation that can happen to any Windows user:</p>
<ul>
<li>PC 1 uses Win 8.1 but crashes for wathever reason (HD crash, something else, laptop lost/stolen...)</li><li>Buy a new PC 2 now with Windows 10 installen</li><li>QUESTION: how can I restore the backup from PC1 on this new PC 2 ?
<ul>
<li>PC 2 may have another name (maybe I am not replacing PC 1, but just have bought a new PC 2 and will later on recycle PC 1 for another family member)</li><li>In PC2 the user name (C:\users\username) may be different: I have had the case were at forst I used *** Email address is removed for privacy *** as user account, but later on I installed an extra account *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. This resulted in the original C:\users\danny
 directory te be changed in c:\users\danny_000</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>I have asked this question at first on the Belgian forum, without result, then I found a solution that worked in December 2015 ( reading some threads on a similar problem in Windows 8.1).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try the same trick now, it will not work: when I replace the 2 database and 2 config files from the backup set to C:\Users\danny\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\FileHistory\Configuration, Windows only shows that there is a backup of 220 GB, but when
 I try to recover the files, I get the message that I have to wait until a first backup has finished.
</p>
<p>Even when I switch off automatic backup, and I reboot the pc, automatic backup is switched on and a new backup set is started on my NES under a directory called DDW.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please stop blaming third party software for everything that goes wrong in Windows 10 and answer the question. I am sure other users will have the same question sooner or later.</p>

            <p>Firefox nor Chrome are installed since the clean reinstall of December 2015</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did no format of the harddisk before the clean install of December 27 2015, since I wanted to avoid having problems with the free upgrade not working. Formatting would have deleted all traces of my previous valid 8. installation and the right to a free
 upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did do a refresh of he system beginning of February 2016 to solve the problems I had with my store app having disappeared. By the way, I send all detailed information end of January to MS as was asked in one of the threads but never received any answer
 or indication that this problem was solved by an update</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was talking about the backup made with Windows 8.1 File History. I had been using WD Smartware before, but at a certain point decided (based on my experience with File History on my Surface RT) the File History was reliable and working perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not installed nor used&nbsp;Ccleaner from Piriform since the clean install of December 27 2015. I did have backups from previous registry cleanups, but they have all been deleted with the clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have no answer to my original question: <strong>WHAT IS THE CORRECT PROCEDURE TO RESTORE THE FILES FROM A BACKUP (File History) MADE PREVIOUSLY WITH ANOTHER PC UNDER WIN 8.1</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I have started a new backup set using File History, but after some time this stopped and I can not get it started again. I have deleted the backup files from my NAS, removed the network drive in the settings of file history and I am going to retry
 this. I hope that, once a first backup is completed, I will be able to change the database and cinfig files with the previous ones (from Win 8.1) and be able to access my old backup.</p>

            <p>Sorry for my typo (not was meant to be nor)&nbsp;and my grammatical errors (I am Belgian, Dutch speaking).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I meant was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firefox is not installed</li><li>Chrome is not installed</li></ul>
<p>(Looking at&nbsp;threads complaining about&nbsp;Edge, I seem to be one of the few users that like and work with Edge)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having some experience with computer systems and with Windows, one of the things I did after experiencing problems, was to do a clean install and limit third party software to the absolute minimum. I only installed Office and Roxio NXT4. This last program
 I use a.o. to burn ISO images to DVD.</p>
<p>I did not install any other browser, I did not install TrendMicro although I have had years of good experience with this on all Windows versions since XP, I did not install CCleaner although I have been using this with success in Windows NT, 7, and 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>The clean install I did in December 2015 was done using the Media Creation Tool, but I am not sure I used the USB version or the DVD version on my PC.</p>
<p>I did do a system reset in February to solve the problems with Store: on my main useraccount Store had disappeared although on 2 other accounts Store was still available and functional. See
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_store/re-recent-store-launch-issues/2ea78e22-d5a6-40e7-a9e7-7ee46a155f2e">

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the referenced articles, but they are no answer to my actual situation:</p>

<li>Learn how to use File History to back up your files and restore them in Windows 10<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/getstarted-back-up-your-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/getstarted-back-up-your-files</span></a> is a description of the
 restore function, which is I think exactly the same as in Windows 8.1</li><li>How to Restore&nbsp;[Win8] Backups on Win10 <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/212768/how-to-restore-windows-7-backups-on-windows-8.1-or-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 Win 10 environment.</li></ul>
<p>My experience (October-November 2015)&nbsp;in Windows 10 is that you can start File History by defining the (external) drive you want the file history to be stored. What happens then is that the system
 the file history I made under Win 8.1.</p>
<p>Settings in Windows 10 only allows me to define the drive, not the directory. Since the directory Danny-Acer-7 already existed, Windows 10 at first set up a new directory Danny-Acer-7 (2).
</p>
<p>That is why I found this workaround: </p>
<ol>
<li>set up File History in Windows 10.</li><li>Wait until a first backup is complete</li><li>shut down the backup / File History function</li><li>replace the 2 database and 2 config files from the existing Win 8.1&nbsp;backup set found on the NAS server&nbsp;to C:\Users\danny\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\FileHistory\Configuration and then make sure the PC-name, username and IP-adress are corrected to the
 new situation</li><li>Switch backup / File History back on: at that moment Windows 10 sees the old Windows 8.1 file history</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>However I noticed that in the beginning, that directory had the same name as the computer name. Since updates around beginning of March, this directory is now called (in my case) DDW. DDW happens to be my initials as&nbsp; entered these in my Office suite.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
 Very strange, and probably due to the use of a wrong registry element.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noticed changes in the way network devices appear in Explorer:</p>
<ul>
<li>before March 2016, my NAS server did not appear under Network. The same goes for my wireless Epson printer</li><li>I needed the WD-utility WD-Discovery to connect the shares on my NAS server to a drive letter before I was able to define a share as he target for File History</li><li>Since March, both my NAS device and my wireless printer do appear in Explorer under Network.</li><li>At the same time, shares connected as network drive using WD Discovery are not visible when trying to select a share as target for File History. The link must exclusively&nbsp;be made in Explorer</li></ul>
<p>I am running some more tests and tried to se another share as target for my fie history. First thing I noticed: a directory called DDW was made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I have my doubts now about the changes in the way network connections work since beginning of March, because I also noticed that the same NAS server is not visible anymore by an second useraccount defined on the pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So still I am waiting for the correct procedure to connect my file history in Windows 10 to an already existing Windows 8.1 file history on my NAS server. This is, as far as I can see, not documented anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will also open another thread about my findings on de way network devices work since March 2016</p>

<h2>            Email encoding in Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    I have Windows Live Mail running on two machines. &nbsp;The format of the emails are different from one machine to the other. &nbsp;These are the same emails. &nbsp;One has the correct format for the email. &nbsp;The other shows format test such as: &nbsp;------=_Part_1570321_1515176767.1374253283133<br />
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8<br />
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit<br />
<br />
&lt;!--Hero Update ID--&gt;<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It also shows links that should be in the format of the message. &nbsp;This makes the message harder to read and respond. &nbsp;I am runnig Windows 7 64 bit on both machines. &nbsp;I have tried changing the encoding but the message still do not appear as intended. &nbsp;What
 should I do?</div>

            Is this the same message that is displayed differently on the two machines? If so, there is definitely something on the problematic machine that's interfering with the message before Windows Live Mail receives it. This is most likely security software
 - anti-virus, anti-spyware or anti-spam - configured to scan incoming mail. Turn off any such scanning and see whether the problem persists.<br />

<p>What if you want to do a clean install?&nbsp; What if you want to selectively restore files? It can be done with an image but it involves creating a VHD and mounting the image in it, and it's a lot easier just to restore from a file backup.&nbsp; What if you want
 to backup files incrementally? In order to do that with a system image, new images must be created continually.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>One way is to get a 3rd party program like EaseUS ToDoBackUp. It has a free copy.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I will certainly help you with the issue. This issue usually occurs when there is a driver conflict. I would suggest you to try the following methods to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Run Power troubleshooter</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Since you are facing issues with the sleep and hibernate options, I would suggest you to try this troubleshooter. This will automatically detect
 common issues and fix them. Refer to the article below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Power-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Open the Power troubleshooter</span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, try method 2.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Clean Boot</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate
 software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. To know more, follow the article below:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‘<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>’.</span></em></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 3: Update the drivers</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>To update the drivers, you may refer to the link below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Automatically-get-recommended-drivers-and-updates-for-your-hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Automatically-get-recommended-drivers-and-updates-for-your-hardware</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue still persists, I would recommend you to visit the computer manufacturer’s support website and download the compatible
 drivers for your system.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information was helpful. Let us know the results once you have tried these methods.</p>

<h2>            SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED during clean install</h2>
                    Hi, I had upgrade my windows 7 (in dual boot) to 10 and it was running fine, then i decided to remove dual boot and completely move to 10. So i formtted linux partition and tried to install win10 using a pendrive but it displayed system thread exception
 not handled error. Thinking that it might be caused by some driver so i formatted C drive as well using other linux pendrive. But stilll the same issue

            <p><span>Hi <b>John</b>,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for <span>writing to Microsoft Communities. From your problem description I understand that you are unable to find drivers for
<span>dolby digital</span>. Please correct me if I have misunderstood. </span></span></p>
<p><b><span>John<span>,</span></span></b><span> </span><span>I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. Please do not worry we are here to help.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Before we start troubleshooting on the issue please provide us with the additional information by answering few questions mentioned below, this will help us to troubleshoot better.</span></p>
<p><span>For which device you are unable to find <span>dolby digital</span> drivers?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please click on the link <a href="http://www.dolby.com/us/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.dolby.com/us/en/index.html</a> and try to download the drivers for your device. If you are unable to find the drivers for Windows 8, you can download the drivers for Windows 7 and install them in the compatibility mode. To do that follow the steps
 below:</span></p>
<p><span>a) Download the drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Right-click on the driver and click on <b>‘properties’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click on the <b>‘compatibility’</b> tab and check the box <b>‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’</b> and select Windows 7 operating system from the drop down.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click on <b>‘Apply’</b> and click <b>‘OK’</b> and run the file to install it.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps!!</span></p>

                    <p>Still looking for help with printing. Oki B410d printer. Windows 10. Word document. The doc will print but it's like I gave a command to print as a watermark Very light.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Same document. Different computer. Windows 8.1 Doc prints fine. No problems.</p>
<p>Is this a driver problem. Oki doesn't have an actual Win10 driver. They just suggest installing and using the driver that's been written for 8.1.</p>
<p>Any suggestions appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<h2>            What would be the best option for pen&#47;stylus&#63;</h2>
                    I recently bought a Toshiba Fusion 15&nbsp;http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msca/en_CA/pdp/Toshiba-Satellite-Fusion-15-L55W-C528-Signature-Edition-Laptop/productID.320617500 . I love my laptop, but I would like to know if this model supports pens with digitizer(
 like the surface pens) or what if at there is at all, would be the best option for me to use a pen/stylus on this model to take notes in class? i tried a point stylus &nbsp;http://musemee.com/us/notier.php the notier v2 but quite honestly it does not work properly.
 I calibrated it , but i would be writing and there would be gaps in my letters. Is this laptop not really capable of touchscreen note taking? Thanks a lot of the help, it would really save me from spending on buying pens/styluses uselessly.&nbsp;

    <title>New Xbox wireless adapter won&#39;t work with my PC, but does with my - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pengudood  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Xbox wireless adapter won&#39;t work with my PC, but does with my laptop....what can I do&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Good morning,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when the new xbox wireless adapter released at the end of January, I got one so my wife and I could pair 2 controllers to the same system for couch co-op.&nbsp; When I hooked the adapter up to my laptop, it automatically installed the drivers and I was able
 to pair both controllers without any problem.&nbsp; Tested them on about 5 different games, everything worked flawlessly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later, I hooked the adapter up to both my PC and hers....neither of which would auto-install.&nbsp; When I looked in the Device Manager, both systems had the Xbox Acc. showing in the "Other devices" listing instead of "Network Adapters" where it should be.&nbsp; Looking
 at the properties, it says that the device drivers could not be installed and gives an "error Code 28".&nbsp; We also both have the old "super-sized" style of individual USB Wireless adapters, and those still work normally (obviously only one at a time though).&nbsp;
 It's only the new adapter, and only on our PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried Uninstalling and Reinstalling countless times....I've even tried a complete and total reformat on my C:/ drive, in the hail-mary attempt of having something wrong with another driver or registry...nothing has worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried running the Windows updater a few times to see if I was missing any critical update that the device may have required; despite the VERY limited instructions not mentioning anything.&nbsp; Prior to my reformat, the system said it was up-to-date.&nbsp;
 Post reformat, the only update I can't seem to get is the 1709 feature update.&nbsp; Is this perhaps a requirement for the adapter and the cause of my problems post-format?&nbsp; Is there any way to just get a .bat/.cab/.exe of the drivers so I can do a forced manual
 installation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help...I'd very much love to co-op games with my wife.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jeff</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Yes, I'd go ahead an install the Fall Creators Update Version 1709 manually by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade your PC Now.  
<br />
<br />In the working Xbox PC open the Driver tab Details in Device Manager, browse to the driver locations and copy them to a stick, transfer stick to the problem PC to browse into from the same Device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse. 
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work what I do is copy the whole Windows &gt; System 32 &gt; Drivers folder to stick to browse into.    
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help I would ask Xbox Support or in the Xbox forums where others have surely dealt with this before:
<br /><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us</a>

<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>I am currently trying to get the 1709 update, but I guess my wireless ethernet adapter has been a bit finicky today, and has been causing continuous-internet-connectivity issues for me.&nbsp; Is there a way to get the update loaded onto a usb drive and just do
 a local install for it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried grabbing the operational drivers from the working laptop and doing a manual drag prior to my reformat.&nbsp; When I did, I totally bricked the xbox drivers (even my old stick wouldn't work).&nbsp; I just want to double check, but you're saying to Device Manager
 &gt; Network Adapters &gt; the xbox adapter &gt; Properties &gt; Driver &gt; Driver Details and then just manually going to those paths and copying the .bin and .sys files correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for copying the entire sys32 drivers folder...would that not potentially cause issues with other aspects?&nbsp; I mean, because my laptop has very different hardware from my PC, or should I just uninstall the existing wireless adapter from the PC and just
 skip any files replacements that are prompted?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

            Hi again Jeff.  
<br />
<br />Absolutely, the best way to install it is from the media which you can create or download ISO onto from another PC by installing Media Creation Tool:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Then transfer the media to target PC, open it or click on ISO to mount, right click Setup to Run as Admninistrator.  
<br />
<br />If any problems then follow these steps for Overcoming Upgrade Hurdles:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If problems persist with the wireless adapter I normally replace them with an inexpensive USB nano like this:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>

            You're not copying into the problem PC the drivers folder, just browsing into it to pluck the Xbox driver needed if it remains elusive.  It wont' use a driver it cannot, and you can always roll back in Device Manager &gt; Adapter &gt; Driver tab &gt; Roll back or choose Upgrade Driver Now &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick to see all previous drivers. 
<br />
<br />All other methods are in the link I gave, including tracing the driver by Hardware ID as a last resort:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<p>HI Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah I just got fed-up with the network adapter and bought a new one.&nbsp; I'll give the media creation a shot and see if that resolves, assuming I don't pull the 1709 automatically tonight.&nbsp; I won't be able to get around to any more work on the machine until
 probably early tomorrow morning.&nbsp; I'll update with anything I find, but thanks again for your help.</p>

<p>hai lo stesso identico mio problema. </p>
<p>il problema NON è legato alla console, nel senso che non è un difetto hardware come avevo inizialmente pensato.</p>
<p>E' un problema di configurazione/compatibilità con la vodafone station.</p>
<p>Ho escluso il problema hardware perché collegando via Ethernet, la XBone ad un'altra rete, lei funziona perfettamente.</p>
<p>Quindi è un problema di configurazione. </p>
<p>Per il momento non ho approfondito perché questa settimana (per vari motivi) sto utilizzando la XBone in un'altra stanza con il wifi..ma settimana prossima mi metterò un po a fare delle prove. Spero si possa risolvere spippolando tra le impostazioni avanzate
 della Vodafone Station (ho la seconda versione).</p>

<p>Buongiorno a tutti!</p>
<p>Stesso identico problema anche per me. </p>
<p>Ho una vodafone station 2 e la connessione via cavo con la xbox one non mi consente di accedere al live. Nessun problema se invece scollego il cavo e connetto la xbox one tramite wifi.</p>
<p>Preciso che la console non presenta nessun problema hardware, ho infatti provato a connetterla via cavo alla rete del mio vicino di casa e sono andato in live senza problemi.</p>
<p>il problema è senz'altro legato alla vodafone station, ho provato anche a sostituire il cavo di connessione, ma il problema rimane.</p>
<p>Lato ruter ho provato sia la connessione con dhcp automatico sia impostando il dhcp reservation. ho provato ad aprire tutte le porte indicate sul sito ufficiale microsoft e anche ad impostare una DMZ per l'ip della console, ma il problema persiste.</p>
<p>Qualcuno è riuscito nella connessione ed è in grado di darmi qualche suggerimento?</p>
<p>grazie in anticipo per qualsiasi risposta</p>

<p>Io questa settimana non ho avuto modo di provare a contattare la Vodafone. Lo farò questa settimana (non so ancora quando)... ho poco tempo durante il giorno e so già che dovrò perdere ore al telefono con il suo customer care... appena posso tenterò di districare
 l'arcano. Al momento sto giocando col WiFi ma è una soluzione che non mi piace per niente</p>

<p>Ciao!</p>
<p>Premetto che non ho ancora preso la One- però anche io ho la Vodafone station 2 e anche se piazzerei la console di fianco al router preferirei poter connettere anche il cablato.</p>
<p>Non riuscite a connettervi al Live del tutto con il cavo Ethernet o vi da un NAT strict/moderato?</p>
<p>Sulle opzioni della station (consultabili da htt://vodafone.station) andate su avanzate/altre configurazioni e assicuratevi che UpnP sia attivo- sulla schermata firewall disabilitate il firewall. In teoria non serve impostare la DMZ- ma alcuni utenti americani
 hanno riscontrato che per qualche motivo se la console è settata con opzione instant on non riconosce in automatico il Upnp- causando NAT moderati con connessione ethernet o errori tipo il vostro. Settando la console su energy saving molte persone hanno risolto
 il problema.</p>
<p>Non è la vodafone che fa schifo- è un problema che un sacco di utenti stanno avendo con diversi modelli di modem/router e diversi ISP.
</p>
<p>Inoltre sulle impostazioni network della One- dovreste trovare l'opzione, clear MAC- anche fare quel tipo di reset risolve il problema in alcuni casi.
</p>
<p>E' sicuramente una questione di impostazioni- se proprio non sapete dove mettere le mani, fatevi mandare un tecnico da Vodafone.</p>
<p>Tra parentesi- non so quanto sia attendibile, ma un utente con vodafone station 2 sul sito everyeye.it dice di aver risolto il problema del nat moderato aprendo tutte le porte.</p>

<p>Ciao Kendrene!</p>
<p>innanzitutto ti ringrazio per l'interessamento e i consigli, ho provato a cambiare le impostazioni di risparmio energia, ma il problema perisiste in entrambe le modalità (instant on o energy save). ho provato anche ad eseguire il comando clear-MAC ma la
 console non ne vuole sapere di andare live. </p>
<p>il parametro UpnP era già settato su ON</p>
<p>Per rispondere alla tua domanda iniziale, io non riesco proprio a connettermi al live, la console non mi da NAT moderato o limitato, semplicemente non mi indica neanche il nat limitandosi ad rilevare la connessione cablata. In particolare, la ONE consente
 di fare 3 test di rete:</p>
<p>1. il primo test "esegui test connessione di rete" viene superato correttamente, ciò significa che il ruter assegna l'IP alla console (sia in modalità automatica che con DHCP reservation) e la consoe accede alla rete domestica.</p>
<p>2. il secondo test " esegui test multiplayer" verifica la velocità di download e non viene superato dalla console o per errore di velocità di dowload troppo lenta 0KB/s o per errore sui DNS 0 generando l'errore che da il titolo a questo tread</p>
<p>3. il terzo test "statistiche di rete dettagliate" aggiunge dati su latenza, MTU perdita pacchetti e velocità di caricamento. Anche questo test non viene superato.</p>
<p>Nella pratica, la console accede alla rete domestica, ma non comunica con internet, forse il problema risiede negli indirizzi dei server DNS, ho provato ad impostare vari server DNS ottenendo risultati altalenanti riuscendo a connettermi al live per alcuni
 minuti con NAT aperto, trascorsi i quali la console si disconnette dal live e non riaccede più</p>
<p>l'idea che mi sono fatto è che il problema risieda lato ruter con la vodafone station 2 in quanto, come riportato nel mio precedente post, la mia console installata a casa del mio vicino e collegata tramite cavo ad un ruter d-link è andata live senza problemi
 di sorta, tanto è vero che ho eseguito da lui il primo avvio scaricando il corposo aggiornamento di attivazione</p>
<p>in WIfi la connessione non da problemi</p>
<p>non so più dove sbattere la testa, se qualcuno ha novità sono pronto a qualunque test, in caso di news poterò a mia volta</p>
<p>ciao a tutti</p>

<p>Grazie Kendrene per le delucidazioni. Nel primo w.e. di One ho fatto tutte le prove da te menzionate, ho disattivato e attivato &nbsp;UPnp, ho tolto i port forward e li ho rimessi (in teoria se metti su i port forward non ha senso avere l'upnp attivo e viceversa).
 I firewall li ho tutti disattivati ma niente di fatto.</p>
<p>Se connetto la One in cablato lui riesce a funzionare bene nella mia LAN ma non va sul Live..</p>
<p>Ora giusto stanotte (ore 2.30) ho visto che il firmware della Vodafone Station 2 si è aggiornato..era troppo tardi per provare..ma stasera guardo se per caso VS2 adesso funziona.</p>
<p>Il problema non ce l'ha solo VS2 ma diversi Router che fa gestiscono la connessione ADSL tramite un protocollo di mascheramento e non tramite una connessione diretta.
</p>
<p>Con tutta probabilità si tratta di lavorare sulle impostazioni avanzate tipo l'MTU; purtroppo in questi giorni torno troppo tardi e non ho di fatto la possibilità di stare attaccato al 190 per fare le varie prove incrociate. Spero questo w.e. di poter far
 luce definitivamente su questa storia. Per il momento, ahime, mi sto accontentando della connessione wifi</p>
