<h2>            LD-3W with Android devices&#63;&#63; &#40;eg Tablet PC with Jelly Bean 4.1.1&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any experience or knowledge of using the LD-3W GPS receiver with an Android device (specifically in my case an Odys Fusion Tablet PC running Jelly Bean 4.1.1)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used to use my LD-3W with a HP iPAQ hx series Pocket PC and it always paired and connected everytime with no problem via Bluetooth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now with my tablet, it will discover the receiver and pair with it but it won't connect. (However, the tablet does work completely without issue with a BT keyboard and also with the Pocket PC via BT, so I know the functionality of the Odys Fusion in this
 respect is not at fault.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm guessing that somehow the drivers and/or the Hardware ID are not included in the tablet's database. By searching this forum,. I found that in Windows it's possible to edit the BTh.inf file, but I would have no idea how to do this in Android. I can see
 some Bluetooth folders in the root folder, but do not know what information to add in nor in what format.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems probable that during the development of Android 4.1, the team at Google contacted all manufacturers of Bluetooth products (including Nokia) and asked them to submit technical infos for their products. Whether Nokia conceded to this request and provided
 these details, and if so why the developers did not then include these in their OS, is something I cannot answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a week of trying to get an answer from Nokia Live Chat, I eventually got an Email (see below) from Level 2 support, but the Email address was of the do-not-reply format which makes me suspicious and I wonder why they are trying to hide behind this
 veil of secrecy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I understand this person 'Brian' correctly, you must only use a Nokia product (eg GPS receiver) with another Nokia product (eg one of their phones). I am not laywer, but I would say this statement puts Nokia in breach of a whole raft of UK, EU and international
 legislation. How do they expect to have succesful sales figures if they have these kinds of restrictions?</p>

<p>&gt; hi,<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; As per assessment of my colleague from level 2, that it is safe to say that we can only confirm connectivity if both devices are nokia branded. And based from that since the other device is not a nokia device then its not compatible in a way that the other
 device is unknown to us<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, that's just my point really.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Mobile CE 5.1 is almost 10 years old and it can cope with the Nokia GPS receiver no problem, and also with connection via BT to the tablet. (Although I admit, on the few small tests I did swapping files back and forth in both directions between the
 two devices, I had to instigate the commands for send and retrieve from the Android. But I think that could just be that I am inexperienced with how to do this properly on an HP PADA. Also, it was very late at night when I tried, I didn't spend a lot of time
 on it, my objective being just to find out if it was possible to establish a BT connection between them - answer: yes, and easily)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Jelly Bean 4.1 was only developed a couple of years ago, and yet it finds itself unable to pair &amp; connect properly with this particular device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My hunch is that somehow the driver and/or Hardware ID for the LD-3W were not included in the OS code during development. I assume that later Jelly Bean OS versions 4.2 &amp; 4.3 and KitKat 4.4 do not have this problem. Anyone like to confirm that, if they have
 the LD-3W and one of these devices??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, i already know there will be no further firmware updates for my tablet, so it is something I will have to live with until I get another one (unlikely for a while as this tablet is only 2 weeks old!!)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am aware that there is a third-party app (as mentioned in your link) that is a good workaround, but it really bothers me that the pairing and connecting doesn't work 'natively' with the LD-3W like it does with my BT keyboard and probably many other BT
 devices - if I wanted to buy them (and not just GPS receivers either) - without any hassles at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just wish I knew which Android system files are involved and how to edit them to include the Nokia's Hardware ID.</p>

<p>Which Bluetooth&nbsp;GPS receivers work natively in Android 4?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Bluetooth, there was&nbsp;no standard profile for Bluetooth GPS receivers&nbsp;at that time. All these receivers use the Serial-Port Profile (SPP) and that has to be selected manually because no computer on earth can detect those automatically. The ‘class of device’
 is no indication either, nor did the Nokia LD-3W support the Device Identification profile (DI). Technically, a&nbsp;tablet cannot determine it is dealing with a GPS receiver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is different with a Bluetooth keyboard which has all these identification bits&nbsp;because there is a standard.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really? No Bluetooth GPS receiver will work natively on any Android tablet, irrespective of its OS??? When you say 'Android 4' do you mean only 4.1 or do you include all later versions too?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe you Abi99 about this, but I would be grateful if someone else on this forum would also confirm it. You said yourself you had never tried it, so I would just like to get the opinions of others who are using Nokias (my model the LD-3W, as well as
 other similar ones in their range) and other manufacturer's GPS receivers with their tablets. No offence intended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have very limited experience of using this particular protocol, apart from - as I mentioned before - my Windows CE PDA, where it always worked without any issues, so I never had to dig deeper, like now, to do any problem solving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just assumed in my ignorance that because it worked on that, an Android PC should have no problem with any BT device, whether it be a keyboard, headphones, speakers or a GPS receiver, Clearly I was wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I plan to try out as soon as possible my Nokia receiver in a few local computer shops with some of their Android-based tablets on display to find out if what you say is indeed the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And by the way, what is a 'profile' 'for Bluetooth receivers? Is it just a list of Hardware IDs and drivers included in the operating system code? [EDIT: I just answered my own question cos there's a list on Wikipedia about all those profiles, including
 the SPP you mentioned..........but it still doesn't help me understand why Android won't connect but a Windows PDA can.]</p>

<p>Back in those days, internal GPS was not that common. The authors of navigation software faced end-user who were used to pair their Bluetooth GPS receiver, and then select it. That part – this choosing and selecting – was never added&nbsp;in modern operating
 systems because&nbsp;the&nbsp;internal GPS unit exists already. Furthermore with an internal unit, A-GPS and compass is&nbsp;much easier. Or stated differently: Nobody&nbsp;codes that piece of software to glue these together, today anymore.</p>

<blockquote>But I would also expect that JB 4.1.1 would also work natively with other BT GPS receivers, including my LD-3W. If my tablet has no built-in GPS, surely that's a good enough reason for the Google developers to INCLUDE the relevant drivers, Hardware
 IDs and profiles (and maybe remove some of the bloatware if there is not enough space)??</blockquote>

<p>Not quite sure where you're going with this. First, you recommend me going somewhere else to discuss it, but then you proceed to give me an Android-centric discussion about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, it's still all early days for me with this. My tablet is only 2 weeks old and my first port of call when I found the GPS receiver did not work natively was with the device manufacturer Odys (part of the Axdia group) with the expectation there might
 be an OTA update to fix this. They fobbed me off and told me to contact Nokia. No joy at all with their Customer Care or Level 2 support (as I reported in my first post), so now I am hoping on this discussion board that other LD-3W owners are using their device
 with 4.1.1 Android tablets and have encountered this problem before and solved it, WITHOUT resorting to third party apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now Nokia seem to be washing their hands of it and pointing the finger at the the Google developers of JB 4.1.1, and I must admit that's where my hunch is now leading me to as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, your statement that 'nobody codes that piece of software to glue these together' doesn't really hold water. If a device is advertised as having Bluetooth functiionality, then it needs to have included in its operating system all current (at or around
 the time of development) and past profiles for all BT devices, GPS receivers included. (If a new BT device comes on to the market AFTER the release of the OS, there is obviously no onus on Google to add the required coding in a firmware update, which they
 may or may not decide to do, depending on whether there is enough end user demand.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the device doesn't have complete Bluetooth functionality (unless they specifically say "here is a list of compatible devices; other devices may or may not work), irrespective of whether it has built-in GPS or not, then it is 'not fit
 for its intended purpose', which I believe is the correct phrase. In the UK, this would be covered by legislation, something like the Sale of Goods Act, although I am not a lawyer so don't quote me on that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So that's where I am at the moment. I've spent the last of my savings on a brand new tablet PC, only to find out that it doesn't work out-of-the-box natively with my LD-3W. (That came free&nbsp;and&nbsp;included as an accessory as part of the package of my second
 hand iPAQ bought on eBay many MANY years ago, so no real financial loss there). And I know it works properly with other devices such as that aforementioned PDA. There's no point considering another receiver such as an LD-4W as the price for that is almost
 as much as I paid for the tablet - I might as well buy another tablet with internal GPS (which I can't afford to do), but then I would be left with a superfluous LD-3W unit.</p>

<p>It does not work.</p>
<p>I would have to go for that workaround as well. It was the same in Android 4.1. Instead, I sticked to the internal GPS because that gives me a compass and A-GPS. As downside, I had to buy a powerbank as recharger.</p>

<p>If that really is Nokia's official corporate line, I am incredulous. My jaw is still touching the floor in surprise.</p>

<p>Do Nokia REALLY believe that people buy their products to use ONLY with OTHER Nokia products??</p>

    <title>Can not get Edge to fill in password in Build 15031 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bottom low  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can not get Edge to fill in password in Build 15031</h2>
                    <p>I cleared the cache and history&nbsp;in both IE 11 and Edge and I can not get Edge to fill in the&nbsp;username after highlighting the name. I have four accounts for the library accounts for my children I can see get the list of accounts but I am unable to click on
 the account that I want. Once I type in the user name the password does fill in. I have the same problem filling in forms with Edge my past entries are there but the selected response does not enter into the form.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I removed Edge twice using the method above the scan did not show any faults. &nbsp;I still have the same problem I start typing the password and the list of user names appear but I can not highlight the user name to enter in the box. Once I type in the whole
 name the password appears.&nbsp;I cleared the data for the form filler so I have a clean slate there.</p>

<h2>            news &#38; announcements - read more link</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p><br />
I have a news and annoucnments web part on the home page of my sharepoint 2013 site. I would like it if a few lines show up then below it a link to "read more" which expands the text or opens the full announcements. many guides on the net for this but none
 of them clear... anyone got this working?</p>
<p><br />
I've done the following:</p>
<p>1. saved a file called annoucnments.js in the site assets folder on sharepoint</p>
<p><br />
2. opened the news and announcments web part and under Miscellaneous heading in the JS field box, i've copy and pasted the location of the .js file.</p>
<p>This doesn't do anything unfortuantely. any help appreciated. </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have tried changing the resolution or the Windows theme (If posible) in you tab?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try changing these setting and see if it helps you.</p>

            Sadly, not an option.&nbsp; My Samsung only has two screen resolution settings, and the higher one renders everything too small to read.<br />

                    <p>Does anybody have a way of disabling cortana after the&nbsp;anniversary update that doesn't involve using regedit???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Such a joke that MS try and force these things down your neck just because it's one of the main features of their add campaigns. I like many other people don't want their inanimate PC to be creepily friendly!! And I've always preferred pc's because it's
 not the one size fits all approach of a mac!!! Let people have the choice!!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also if I don't have an easy way to remove cortana I will just use regedit like many others, which is both a security and system threat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rant over, just let me disable cortana</p>

<h2>            &#34;Open a Contact group to check names</h2>
                    How do you open a Contact group to check names there without having to send off an email. I am operating in Windows 7. When I go to Contact groups, it just shows the group title but cannot seem to open the box to view the names. There must be an easy way
 to do it without having to send off an email to the group to see who is in it.

            <p>A 'quick and dirty' way is, with the group showing in the left-hand pane, to click
<em>Send email </em>on the command bar. A message compose window will open with the names (only) of the group members in a more compact form in the
<em>To </em>box.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Taking this one stage further, to get a listing of the names and email addresses of the group members,</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <em>Add a subject </em>and type the name of the group.</li><li>Click <em>Save draft.</em></li><li>Click <em>Outlook </em>in the top left-hand corner.</li><li>Click <em>Drafts </em>in the left-hand pane, then select the message you just saved.</li><li>Use your mouse to mark the name+address entries in the <em>To </em>area of the message, then press Ctrl-C.</li><li>Open a new document in your favourite word processor and press Ctrl-V</li><li>Use <em>Find and replace</em> (in Word, that's Ctrl-H) to find '<strong>; </strong>
' (semi-colon space) and replace with newline (in Word, that's <strong>^p</strong>).<br />
Find '<strong>(</strong>' (opening parenthesis) and replace with tab (in Word, that's
<strong>^t</strong>).<br />
Find '<strong>)</strong>' (closing parenthesis) and replace with nothing.</li><li>Save and/or print.</li></ol>

    <title>Issue with outlook client unable to connect to both On-Prem Exchange - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> psskw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue with outlook client unable to connect to both On-Prem Exchange and Office 365 Online Mail</h2>
                    <p>Been trying to troubleshoot an issue where after changing the smtp on Office 365 to match my on-premise email smtp name, outlook will fail with the message "your mailbox has been temporarily moved to Microsoft Exchange server".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recreating the profile as per "https://support.microsoft.com/en-my/help/3197025/your-mailbox-has-been-temporarily-moved-to-microsoft-exchange-server-m" Microsoft guide does not solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further troubleshooting indicates that the on-prem mailbox email is connecting to office 365 mailbox causing outlook to think it is connecting to the right connection when it is not hence the mailbox error when outlook starts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have been testing with the disabling the autodiscovery settings in registry but still not able to solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is needed is to have outlook 2016 connect to on-prem mailbox and office 365 without being confused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how to compel outlook to behave correctly ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I have no control to change DNS records or Exchange mail or move to Hybrid mode. I can only have access to make changes on the outlook client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Psskw,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>About this issue, please try to create a new profile in the Control Panel &gt; Mail and select the "<strong>Manual setup or additional server types</strong>" option when adding your account to manually configure your account to see if it can help you fix this
 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can successfully add your account in above steps, please don't forget to
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/export-or-backup-email-contacts-and-calendar-to-an-outlook-pst-file-14252b52-3075-4e9b-be4e-ff9ef1068f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">back-up</a></strong> your data and remove the old one as the
 article you mentioned in your post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if manually setup your account still cannot help you resolve this issue, as your mailbox is hosted on On-Prem exchange server and our forum is focus on Exchange Online service.

</p><blockquote>I think it's time to close this thread once and for all... It's already 2020, and AFAIK, Microsoft officially announced the discontinuation/shut down of the online services as well as windows phone related
 services at December 2019, which was last month. Thus, the store today, that we once love, is already DEAD. You have to stick onto cracked XAP/APPX/APPXBUNDLE files online to deploy it into your phone and/or depend on your already (or surviving) installed
 apps and/or games. That's all... Please mark this question/thread answered... This is the truth, and nothing but the truth... :( RIP WP7-10

<p>
</p><p>That is incorrect. End of support for <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>WP8.1 devices</strong></span> was reached in July 2017 and the Store for <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>WP8.1 devices</strong></span> was indeed closed on December 16th 2019. </p>
<p>
</p><p>All services incl. the Store currently function for Windows 10 Mobile devices and since this thread is about Lumia 640, which is supported for W10M, there is a solution for it:</p>

                    <p>I would like to do a factory reset on my computer and I&nbsp;have MS Office Professional Plus 2016 through my school as seen below. I don't know how many times I can install it or if there are anymore installs left on the disc I was given.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I need to buy a new product key? <br />
<br />
I was told&nbsp;I would not have to renew or buy anything once I downloaded it but because I would like and need to do a factory reset I want to know if there is a way to keep it or reinstall it after I'm done resetting my laptop.</p>
<p>Also, my Microsoft account does not recognize that I have even have&nbsp;a MS Office Professional Plus 2016....&nbsp;can I register
 my MS Office in some way as a way to keep it on file and then reinstall it?</p>

            No need to purchase a new key, just make sure you have the product key and the reinstall media to reinstall Office. There is a slight change you might have to contact support to reactivate using the same key though, but if its the same machine that should not be the case.

<h2>            Windows 10 Insider Build 18290 - setup.exe - Bad Image</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 7 on my PC, and I thought it'd be a good idea to upgrade to 10. However, I got the insider build (18290). When I burnt it, I opened it on my DVD and got "H:\Sources\SPWIZENG.DLL is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains
 an error.". I tried the media creation tool then do that, but even with over 8GB free, it don't work. I've tried many different burners for the insider build. I tried the built-in Windows 7 burner, and ImgBurn. I would check the SHA-1 but Microsoft doesn't
 have that shown... I can't redownload it as I don't have great internet (6MBPs). The size of the file is 2.08GB, or 2,242,985,984 bytes. I have a Core 2 Duo @ 3.00 GHz with 2GB of DDR2 RAM (yes I know it's not the best I plan on getting a new PC...).<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b1bb2e49-cc19-40d0-ba16-6d17f30eddda?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b1bb2e49-cc19-40d0-ba16-6d17f30eddda?upload=true" /></a>

<p>If you don't care about your W7 installation, why go thru all that? you said you made copy of your files right? that's all you need because you cannot retrieve programs from Windows.old, only files like pictures, documents, etc. Go back to using the MCT,
 choose to make a bootable USB drive and do as I said previously unless you want to dual boot W7-W10.</p>

</p><blockquote>You gave me an idea! Thanks! But how will I replace GRUB with the Win 10 Bootloader????
</blockquote>
<p>Booting from USB bypasses GRUB, when presented with the options to Upgrade or Custom install, choose Custom, delete all partitions, create a new one preferably equal to the size of the drive, the installer will take care of the rest.&nbsp;<strong><em>This method
 will wipe your HDD clean of everythin</em></strong><em><strong>g!</strong><strong>&nbsp;including Windows 7.</strong></em></p>
<p>You'll end up with a nice and clean W10 installation you can then upgrade to an Insider build.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Once again! make a full backup image of your drive before you start.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>edit: the reason I keep telling you that is because some 32bit machines do not run Windows 10 anymore.</p>

            Windows 8 "Refresh" will wipe all "Desktop" / non-metro apps!&nbsp; It is "F.A.D."&nbsp; (Failing as designed). In other words, it is working as no one but MS expects.<br />
<br />
So after a Refresh you have to re-install all of your desktop apps<br />
<br />
<b>Going forward, There is a solution! <br />
<br />
</b>The Refresh process actually uses a backup that is created by a tool called RecImg.EXE that ships with Win8.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So, after you setup your PC, and finish "decrapifying" it you run RecImg to create a new image for Refresh to work with, but this time it will include all of your installed desktop apps that weren't in the image created at the factory.<br />
<br />
Every time you install new applications, especially desktop apps, run RecImg to update the Refresh source.<br />

            <p>Yes, Windows 8 refesh requires that you cleanly install your programs after the refresh procedure completes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of Office, you will need the installation files (either download or on disc) and the Office product key.

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 900 Not Charging</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Lumia 900 from MTN South Africa.&nbsp; I am unable to get the phone charged after the battery drained out two days ago.&nbsp; This is a major problem that needs to be rectified by Nokia and Microsoft.&nbsp; It is also perplexing that the phone has to come on when
 it is charging and even more irritating is that to set an alarm, the phone needs to be on all night.&nbsp; Come on Microsoft get this right other Symbian Nokia alarms&nbsp;work perfectly even when the phone is switched off.&nbsp; I have been a faithful Nokia user for ten
 years.&nbsp; I am now considering switching to Samsung or Apple or if they merge, an Applesammy!</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/AAA4F49E-EB3A-4970-9E72-47A4F30494AE">Anesh,</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your post and welcome to the forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If your Lumia 900 does not come on when connected to the charger please perform a reset first. This will not delete any personal data;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Press and hold the power button for 10 seconds </li><li>Release the power button </li><li>Press and hold the volume down and power button until the phone vibrates </li><li>Release the power button </li><li>Release the volume button after 10 seconds </li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>You should now be able to switch the phone back on. If not please connect the phone to your PC running Zune for a while and try the above sequence again. If this does not resolve this please visit a
<a href="http://nokia.com/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia Care Point</a> for further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea that Nokia Sx0 or Symbian phone can use the alarm while switched off is a general misconception as these phone are not switched off by pressing the power button, but are put into a sleep mode. If you actually turn the phone off by removing and re-inserting
 the battery you will find that the alarm will not go off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you are sleeping, why not have the phone on the charger? This will always give you a fully charged phone ready to go when you get up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>Kosh</p>

<h3> lakesidemom  say:</h3>
<h2>            report prints extra page</h2>
                    <p>I have a report in Access 2003 that is printing an extra page(blank third page). This report is similar to another report that does not print an extra page(same database, same computer,same printer, same print driver). The report has a page header and a
 footer(footer is empty) and a detail section. I have read may posts and it does not appear to be based on margin setup.
</p>
<p>Margin info:</p>
<p>Report that prints w/o extra page: top,bottom,left, right margins: 0.169, width 8.0014, length19.5417, "same as detail" box is checked. This report has a report header and footer that are both blank.</p>
<p>Report that prints with extra page: top,bottom,left, right margins: 0.167 or 1.168(If I set them to 0.169, the computer sets them to 0.168), width 8.0007(can move margins for this to go larger but extra page is still there), length19.5417(I have adjusted
 this to as low as 19 and still get the extra page), "same as detail" box checked. I have attempted to print both with and without blank report header and footer and the extra page is there in both cases. I have reduced margins to 0 and the extra page is still
 there. I have moved all controls in to the mark before page width and the extra page still prints. The printout shows plenty on top/bottom and left/right margins. There is one page break inserted to force the page one to page two break.</p>
<p>I have looked at the detail section properties and the "force new page" is set to none on both reports.</p>
<p>Any ideas? </p>

<p>The detail section of the report has a subreport in it. I set the background of the detail section to yellow and the background of the subreport to blue. (I ran across this troubleshooting idea in similar posts on this site.) When the print preview displayed,
 I saw a thin yellow strip just below the header on the third page. I adjusted thedetails section and the top and bottom margins until I eliminated the third page. Although it doesn't explain why the settings are different from the similar report in the same

<p>Are you sure that Office 2013 is the source of the error message? Sometimes, the computer manufacturer or Windows itself has added a trial version of Office 365. If you find a trial version of Office installed alongside your full version, just uninstall
 the trial.</p>

<p>Nothing did work for me, and the Office 365 tech support asked me to contact my work admin (after the long weekend) so he can open a ticket. The solution was very simple, and these techs don't know anything.</p>

</p><p><strong>I opened Word instead of Outlook, and the activation worked automatically from there.

    <title>Draft emails show up in Deleted Items in the On My Computer Deleted - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Draft emails show up in Deleted Items in the On My Computer Deleted Items Folder</h2>
                    <p>BUG Description: When using Exchange/Office365, if you close and don't save a draft email, it goes to "Deleted Items" folder "On My Computer" instead of Deleted Items on Exchange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I an use Exchange/Office365 account. When I delete emails, they go to my corporate deleted items folder, as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I can make certain emails go to the On My Computer // Deleted Items folder (this is reproducible).</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Start a draft email and type some stuff.</p>
<p>2. Close the draft without saving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This creates a ghost email that I can see when I use Raw Queries to find emails, which I do every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Now I delete the ghost email. The ghost email goes to the&nbsp;On My Computer // Deleted Items folder. It *still* appears in my Raw Queries searches. When I try to delete it again, I'm prompted to "Permanently Delete?" the item.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work around this by manually moving these ghost emails to my Exchange/Office365 Deleted Items folder. Now all my Raw Queries filter these out properly because I ignore my Exchange/Office365 Deleted Items folder by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can work around this problem fine. I'm not looking for workarounds. I'm letting you (Microsoft and community users) know that there's a bug in the code that needs fixin'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I upgraded to Office 2013, I had an Office 2010 xlsx file under password protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">After the upgrade, I cannot access the excel file. There is no password prompt when it opens, and the buttons on the tabs are unclickable</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only options on the FILE tab are 'new', 'open', 'account', 'options', and 'add-ins.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outside of the file, when I right-clicked for Properties to get to the Security tab, there appear to be no password setup. "Full control permission" is listed.</p>
<p>

    <title>Multiple domains and email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darrenjerrett4131  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple domains and email</h2>
                    
<p>I have multiple domains, for example mywebsite.com and mywebsite.com.au and anotherwebsite.com and and anotherwebsite,com.au&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to moving emails to Office 365 business premium service all emails from the secondary domains and &nbsp;.com addresses were automatically redirected to the primary domain mywebsite.com.au address, same goes for the different domain names and all point to
 one website.</p>
<p>I have 3 email addresses I use generally, plus an additional one for admin and website email. these were info@, accounts@, darren@ and admin@</p>
<p>In Office I've had to setup darren@*****.com.au as the main email, then I've had to add the following "shared emails" &nbsp;darren@*****.com, admin@*****.com.au, admin@*****.com, info@*****.com, info@*****.com.au, accounts@*****.com and accounts@*****.com.au
 , then I still need another 8 shared emails to cover the other domains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All these simply to imitate the previous emails that have been used for years.</p>
<p>In the old system I would have 4 email inboxes in Outlook, now I have 8 but will need &nbsp;a total of 16 by the time I'm done. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a simple way to redirect email addresses to another?</p>
<p>I tried using RULES in outlook desktop but that doesn't work reliably with shared email.</p>
<p>There doesn't seem to be any options to change inbox address in exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated and we may need to revert to the old system for emails. (AND we could have as many REAL email addresses as we liked, but thats another point. ;) )&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can tell I am new to exchange as such as in the past we have always used linux based systems / servers. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Darren,</p>
<p>Thanks for visiting our community.</p>
<p>From the information above, I understand that there’s one mailbox with the Username:
arren@*****.com.au. All other “shared emails” are
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/Add-additional-email-addresses-to-a-user-in-Office-365-0b0bd900-68b1-4bf5-808b-5d240a7739f4?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-IE&amp;ad=IE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
proxy email addresses</a> of the mailbox. Please correct me if there’s any misunderstanding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better understand the situation, could you please share with us the following information?<br />
1. I notice Small Business in Tag, are you using Small Business currently and would you like to upgrade to Business Premium?<br />
2. About these inboxes, do you refer to some folders named these proxy addresses in your mailbox? Please also share with us a screenshot.<br />
To upload the screenshot in the forum, click Use rich formatting and then the Insert/Edit Media icon.<br />
3. An example of “Is there a simple *** addresses to another”.<br />
4. Let us know the configuration of these rules in the Outlook.<br />
5. What does “inbox address” refer to?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Brook</p>

<p>I run the Office Business premium. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I finally found an area through domains where I can "Forward" emails automatically from the shared mailboxes to the appropriate email. &nbsp;It seems to be an almost hidden option under the exchange options. &nbsp;I only found it because I logged in with a computer
 that has a newer admin backend than the one I usually use. (Apparently its a prerelease or beta of the new interface coming)</p>
<p>Anyway by enabling auto forwarding and entering the details it seems to work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On the old linux vps system with virtualmin that host some of my websites, I would &nbsp;simply set up a domain as an alias and all emails would be automatically forwarded. &nbsp;Apparently Office, or exchange doesn't support alias type domains so every email address
 needs to be created and forwarded I assume.</p>
<p>It messy but works.</p>
<p>So for example if I own a domain called qwerty.com.au and I also own qwerty.com and qwerty.net then normally I would create the domain qwerty.com.au and then create 2 aliases - qwerty.com and qwerty.net. &nbsp;This would all link to one website, and one mail
 server etc</p>
<p>When I create emails such as *** Email address is removed for privacy *** it would also accept emails addressed to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>With office I need to create the 3 email address and then forward 2 of them to the 3rd. &nbsp;IE *** Email address is removed for privacy *** would be the primary email and *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and *** Email address is removed for privacy *** would be shared emails that are automatically forwarded to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>the trouble of course when I have multiple emails such as sales@, admin@ etc in which all the other variations need to be set.</p>
<p>Confusing?!</p>
<p>You bet ya! But it works anyway for the moment.</p>
<p>I can only assume that there IS a way this could be simplified, and that is my query.</p>
<p>As stated, I am new to exchange etc.</p>
<p>I thought possibly there was a way to redirect emails using DNS etc rather than relying on forwarding.</p>
<p>Before I was trying to use RULES in Outlook 2016 (desktop) and found that it can't work effectively with shared address. &nbsp;It doesn't treat them as full email. &nbsp;More like folders. Hence I could transfer emails between real email addresses but not those received
 in shared emails. &nbsp;It was a messy idea anyway because it would only work on one PC anyway. (One of my dumb moments!)</p>
<p>Anyway sorry for the rant, and thanks again. </p>

<p>hi darren,</p>
<p>thanks for the detailed information.</p>
<p>i’d like to make a summary. as to the example, you have three domains (qwerty.com.au, qwerty.com and qwerty.net)
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-your-users-and-domain-to-office-365-6383f56d-3d09-4dcb-9b41-b5f5a5efd611?ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
verified in office 365</a>. there’s a licensed mailbox with the default smtp address
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** and two other smtp addresses (proxy addresses),
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** and 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***. emails sent to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** are received by 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** automatically.</p>
<p>you also have other email addresses such as sales@, admin@ etc. emails sent to them need to be received by
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;to.&nbsp;so you created some
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-shared-mailboxes-in-office-365-871a246d-3acd-4bba-948e-5de8be0544c9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
shared mailboxes</a> for them, which don’t need licenses. and forwarding rules are set up respectively.</p>
<p>when you set up the mailbox in the outlook client, shared mailboxes showed up automatically. it’s not feasible to set up inbox rules for shared mailboxes in the outlook client.</p>
<p>in my point of view, instead of shared mailboxes, you can set up some proxy addresses for the shared email addresses.</p>
<p>in <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/?rfr=admin_o365&amp;exsvurl=1&amp;mkt=en-us&amp;realm=bp55.onmicrosoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
exchange admin center</a> &gt; <b>recipients</b> &gt; <b>mailboxes</b> &gt; choose the mailbox &gt; edit &gt;
<b>email address</b> &gt; add them as smtp addresses&nbsp;one by one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=308ef78f-593a-4be1-88b9-f3bf81f2e906" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d308ef78f-593a-4be1-88b9-f3bf81f2e906" /></a></p>
<p>in this way, they work in&nbsp;exactly the same way as 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** and *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>when setting up rules in the outlook client, please untick<b> on this computer</b>
<b>only</b> so that they can&nbsp;run from the server side. or you <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/inbox-rules-in-outlook-web-app-edea3d17-00c9-434b-b9b7-26ee8d9f5622" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Sms link - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> velho83  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sms link</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm trying to put a link in a web page to send a sms, here what I've done:</p>
<p><span>&lt;a href="sms:?body=hello world"&gt;Send sms&lt;/a&gt;</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>I works great this way.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>Problem is the body content needs to be a link like this
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>"http://myserver.com/Start.do?f=12&amp;b=32"</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>I had problems with some phones that didn't display the link properly, so I changed the html character encode to "ISO-8859-1" and I put the link like this:</span></p>
<p><span>"http://myserver.com%2FStart.do%3Ff%3D12%26b%3D32"</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This way it works on all phones that is wasn't.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But I'm still having troubles with a HTC phones with mobile IE.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It shows: <span>"http://myserver.com/Start.do?f=12"</span> missing "&amp;b=32"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>any suggestion on how to fix that?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />

            I think I would head over to the MSDN forums (&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/default.aspx?site" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/default.aspx?siteid=1</a>&nbsp;0 and ask the question in the WIndows Mobile section.&nbsp; My guess is that a developer
 will be able to assist you there.
