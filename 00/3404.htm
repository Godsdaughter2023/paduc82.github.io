<h2>            Symbian Music Player suggestions&#63;</h2>
                    I tried about every S60 music player out there on my 6120 Classic. None of the players did what I want. Is there a player without the problems listed below, or should I wait until someone ports WinAmp to Symbian?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(problems indicated by a * mean the program is totally useless for me)<br />
<br />
Nokia's built-in player (Nokia 6120 Classic)<br />
free<br />
- Music Library only displays track title. No option to display tracks as artist-title or by file name, which makes navigation of large music collections unnecessarily complicated.<br />
- Music Library ignores folder structure, which makes navigation of large music collections unnecessarily complicated. (workaround: copy the folder name to the composer field of the mp3 tags)<br />
- Music Library is unable to ignore ringtone folder(s).<br />
- Can't append tracks to the "now playing" list. Selecting a new track or group of tracks overwrites the current list. (workaround: create a temporary ad hoc playlist)<br />
- Playing a song automatically adds the entire virtual folder (artist, album, genre) to the "now playing" list instead of just the selected track.<br />
- Right softkey quits the program. We already have the red key for that, so the right softkey could be used for more useful functions (hide the player, show "now playing" list or music library, ...)<br />
- Opening a track from the file manager launches the player in reduced functionality mode.<br />
- Player stores playlists in the root of the phone memory or memory card instead of in a user-defined folder.<br />

The two worst issues of Nokia's built-in music player can be worked around, which makes it the "best" player of the list. This doesn't mean Nokia's built-in player is good, but only reflects the sorry state of the other Symbian music players.<br />
<br />
If there's a good music player out there that I overlooked, I'd love to hear about it.

            I bet you did not miss any;). Did you try N91' music player?<br />
I mean 6120 c is not music oriented phone. The LCG Jukebox has sound quality but its UI is kinda horrible.

            The N91 is not a music player but a brick.<br />
<br />
113.1mm x 55.2mm x 22mm, 156g... you don't want to put that thing in your jeans or shorts.<br />
<br />
<br />
The 6120c could be an excellent music player if only the software would be a little better. A pleasant surprise was that it supports microSDHC cards, so the 2 GB limit from Nokia's own specs doesn't apply. It works with my 4 GB card, and I'm sure you could
 stick an 8 GB card in it when they hit the market.<br />
<br />
Maybe I should learn how to program Symbian apps?

Its music player is the heaviest music player in term of features, quality, playback everything.<br />
I have now N91 8GB, previously N91 4GB.

            Whether it's got flash memory or a HD shouldn't make any difference for media player software as long as it can read the data fast enough to play it.<br />

Hmmm,<br />
<br />
I tot that creating smaller capacitors to squeeze into a small square plastic is the limiting factor for flash size.<br />
<br />
In any case, I wouldn't go for disk based players... I can't bring them for a jog without killing them. :(<br />

that's only true for full blown processors like one find in PC because the processor doing much work, but for a limited power like in mobile ....? checks specs for both flash(CF, SD etc) &amp; harddisk in IEEE.

<br />
<br />
Even for the limited power like in a mobile, which is not so limited as you may think.<br />
<br />
Todays smartphones have much more RAM and processing power than the desktop computer on which I wrote my MSc thesis back in the 90s. My microSD card is way more efficient than the hard drive I used back then. It stores more data, and reads and writes it faster.
 My old computer could do a lot of things at the same time, including playing mp3s, with just a quarter of the resources of my smartphone.<br />
<br />
The simple task of playing music and browsing through a collection of mp3s gets you nowhere near the limits of processing power, RAM, or the read speed of memory cards. Processing power or the read speed of microSD cards is no excuse for the sorry state of
 Symbian media players out there.

            Well Diabo,<br />
<br />
For the sake of discussion outside topic...<br />
<br />
I do agree with you to a certain extend. While the hardware may be up to mark to a certain extend, the OS isn't yet.<br />
<br />
My 2nd PC with 333Mhz &amp; 32MiB RAM, over a decade ago, did wonders with Windows 3.1. :) It actually disgrace my 206Mhz &amp; 43MiB RAM N80 in comparison.<br />
<br />
One of the key issue I see is that the OS has not yet mature as fast as the h/w. E.g. paging capability isn't available in current production OS on Nokia mobiles. This IS a key limiting factor which curb the real power of N80.<br />
<br />
On the bright side, they are improving. I read that Nokia mobiles will soon be packed with Demand Paging, which will dramatically improve RAM utilisation. Though I'm not sure if this is a concept of real swap space paging or garbage collection.<br />
<br />
For us consumers, we have no options but to patiently wait. :(<br />
<br />
BTW, I *didn't* give you that negative above. :p<br />
<br />
Cheers.

<p>You are posting in a Vista forum, so if you have Vista you don't have IE11 and if you have IE11 we don't know your OS;&nbsp; perhaps it's W7?</p>

<p>You are posting in a Vista forum, so if you have Vista you don't have IE11 and if you have IE11 we don't know your OS;&nbsp; perhaps it's W7?</p>

<p>If you have an update which indicates Internet Explorer 11 you could try uninstalling it, to go back to whatever browser level you had before that update.</p>

<p>Otherwise, to use IE11 on sites which require "IE" but are not aware of IE11, you can use the Developer Tools, Emulation tab (F12, Ctrl-8) to try finding a combination of User-Agent string and Document mode that they do like.</p>

    <title>Unwanted added characters in Find textfield - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dcayce  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unwanted added characters in Find textfield</h2>
                    Hey, Forum;<br />
<br />
I'm working on a project where I need to perform a Find &amp; Replace using hidden characters like Tabs ( ^t ), Spaces ( • ) &amp; Paragraph Breaks ( ^p ). I copy a text sample from the document, paste it into the Find text field, then put a modified instance of the
 text in the Replace field. The problem I'm running into is that anytime I paste a string of text containing a paragraph return into the Find text field, the program automatically attaches an extra paragraph break at the end of the string. For instance, when
 I go into the manuscript, select <span style="font-weight: bold">^p^tHOURS</span> and drop it the Find text field, it will show up as
<span style="font-weight: bold">^p^tHOURS^p</span> with an extra <span style="font-weight: bold">
^p</span> at the end. The same thing happens if I try and paste something into the Replace text field. If there's a
<span style="font-weight: bold">^p</span> anywhere in the string, another <span style="font-weight: bold">
^p</span> is added at the end.<br />
<br />
If I don't catch the error in the Find field, I'll get a result of No Items Found, because the finder is looking for the added paragraph break. If I don't catch the one in the Replace field, I'll have breaks throughout the manuscript that shouldn't be there.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to disable whatever MSWord is doing to cause this?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />

            <p>I'm going to guess that you don't have your non printing character turned on so when you copy something you aren't seeing that you are accidently picking up the paragraph mark. To turn them on select the backward P on your standard toolbar or Click + 8 will
 do it as well.</p>
<p>Also there is a preference setting in Word &gt; Preferences &gt; Edit for including the paragraph mark in what you select (when selecting paragraphs) and you might want to
<span>temporarily</span> turn it off while you're doing this copy and pasting.</p>

<h2>            Calendar - wrong dates, no ability to change it</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have a problem with a valid adding calendar events.</p>
<p>Using build in application only. I have synchronized: Hotmail, Room hotmail, Google, Facebook.</p>
<p>When I'm trying to add an event (for example) on 5 January 2014 in Google calendar, using the WP8 calendar it changes the date to a day before (4 January).</p>
<p>It happened several times. Also I cannot change the date from my phone and I need to use google calendar on the website.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What can be the cause of it?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for help!</p>

            <p>Not sure why that is happening but on the surface it sounds like an error in the time zone settings. I might verify the time zones on both your device but in your Google account as well.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As an aside, I used Google for years but have totally migrated to my Outlook calendar. It is (in my opinion) far superior to the service from Google. Just my thoughts...</p>

<h2>            Virus on my Windows phone 7 Optimus 7&#63; &#40;LG E900H&#41;</h2>
                    Apparently i have confirmed last night that my Windows phone 7 optimus 7 does has a virus, at least thats how it looks like! i left my cellphone on my bed.. recharging and after 5 minutes of charge it began to do strange things with my calendar, like if
 a ghost was setting dates and it was naming them by itself how did i notice this? because i was doing my room, and i looked at my phone and found out it was doing this, i caleld my sister to show her what the **** it was doing? and i told her to record it
 with her cellphone shes only 14 y old and she didn't beleive me she thought i was joking with her or even trolling her.. but i wasn't my optimus 7 kept doing it over a minute.. setting random dates in calendar at an speed like if it was a robot doing it, i
 thought something was wrong with the cellphone i take it off the charger.. and it kept doing it so .. yeah here is when i put my finger on the touchscreen too and IT WAS LIKE IF IT WAS FIGHTING WITH ME TO CONTROL IT SO WHAT I DID was press the power button
 once.. since it has a password the robot or the virus couldn't get in anymore but it was sliding up the screen to type in my password.. and it type many things till it blocked out my cellphone. and it was asking me for the sim password now.. and i have it
 so NP i turned off completely the cellphone and the virus was gone (for that time) i put in my SIM pass, and then log back in and virus didn't came back.. tho sometimes when im sleeping .. i look at my cellphone and the screen just keeps turning on and off...
 i don't know if this is explainable but this is completely true.. if this happens again i will record it and show it to you explain to me why happened this? and why my cellphone shut downs randomly, when i wanna watch a video.. i lose sound, and it pauses
 everytime.. i can't play games.. because then the game gets laggy and the sound goes off.. and after a while the cellphone just shutdowns... i've read because it might be overheating i have let it off over an hour and it's very cold actually so i turn it on
 to play something and watch some videos but the same problems come back everytime .. overheat or not.. they are still there and i don't know if the virus will come back thannks if someone can help me

            <p>That's pretty weird, try this next time your phone gets wacky, go to settings, select Cellular, switch off Data connection. then Select Wifi, turn it off.&nbsp; If your phone still does those wierd&nbsp;things, I'd leave the room. I doubt it's a virus. Try powering
 off, pull your battery and rebooting.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Lumia 950 Firmware Update</h2>
                    I'm using a Windows Phone since 2012 and now I have planned to upgrade my mobile. I'm planning to buy a lumia 950, but I scared about the bugs that model comes with. Will there be a firmware update to eradicate the bugs problem on lumia 950?

            Thanks for your interest, laveen_87. LCRT may be right that all software may experience some issues. We may not be able to answer in definite words if there will be a firmware update to eliminate all issues, MS Mobile continues to address reported bugs
 through software updates and upgrades. Aside from fixes, what comes with updates are the improvements for the current features that your phone has.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What we suggest is that you take some time to read blogs and reviews about the Lumia 950, its features and challenges, so you'll know how to manage your concerns once you decide to buy one. This community is always ready to assist you as well if you need help
 in the future. :)

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the issue description, I understand that the top bar on Internet Explorer page is transparent and showing up some icons which are from the background screen. I will certainly help you in fixing this. I would
 appreciate if you could help me with more information.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Are you referring to transparent window panes of the Internet Explorer window?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong> is one such <strong>feature</strong>. When you open any window, you can experience the transparency at the edges. But this feature needs resources to run. I would suggest you to follow the below mentioned steps to get this feature
 off</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Right click on the desktop and select the option “<strong>Personalize</strong>”.</em></li><li><em>click on “<strong>Window color</strong>” </em></li><li><em>In Windows color and appearances, <strong>uncheck</strong> the box <strong>
next to Enable transparency</strong></em></li><li><em>Click on “<strong>Save changes</strong>”</em></li><li><em>Now open Internet Explorer/ any window and check the edges, you <strong>won’t find it transparent now</strong></em></li></ol>

            <p>The problem probably arises in that it is English text typed over text that was originally in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai or another Asian language. In these languages, breaking the ends of the line mid-word is a paragraph format option (as is breaking
 them at the end of a word, as we do). When you overtype such texts in a Western language, the option to break lines in the middle of words remains active. For instance:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/304bf980-7ea1-4dbf-ac5a-265809d179ce" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The simplest solution is to apply another paragraph style to the text, then delete the original paragraph style to avoid further headaches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The complex way would be to close Word, open Microsoft Language Register in folder
<em>Microsoft Office 2011/Additional Tools</em> to enable Chinese typography, then open the file and disable the following option in the paragraph's format specifications:</p>

<h2>            What is the different between HSDPA and 3G, GSM or dual mode&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    Hi,Experts..‎‏<br />
i found some types of connection and idn exactly what is the differences between them and wich is the best and good to use, i found HSDPA and 3G ,GSM but every one in different sections:<br />
<br />
HSDPA i found it in: setting/connectivity/packet data and there are two option for hsdpa (on or off)...<br />
<br />
3G, GSM, Dual mode i found them in: setting/device/network mode (and its dual mode)...<br />
<br />
*there is also GPRS and EGPRS but i just hear about them but didnt found options or sections for them in my mobile..!<br />
<br />
*So what is the different between this connections and which is new and which is best,uses mostly in countries and which of them effect on call quality or internet speed??!<br />
<br />
<br />
Please explain in details and i will be very thankfull..

<p>HSDPA(High Speed Download Packet Access) - called high downloads- speed up to 14,4 Mb/s</p>
<p>HSUPA(High Speed Uplink Packet Access)-called high uploads- speed up to 5,76 Mb/s</p>
<p>HSPA(High Speed Packet Access) =HSDPA+HSUPA</p>
<p>HSDPA is often called&nbsp; a 3,5G network. It`s faster than 3G technology&nbsp;and backward-compatibile with devices and networks. It`s upgraded from of a 3G.</p>
<p>To set up GPRS connection on your phone you will need to obtain specific informations from your operator by SMS.</p>

            Ok, man thank you,,<br />
<br />
So that mean HSPA is service of 3,5G , so if i select 3G mode instead of dual mode i wont be able to use HSPA?!<br />
<br />
And what about GSM is that mean 3,5G because i only have two options (3G or GSM or Dual mode)??<br />
<br />
And what is the different between that connections and (GPRS or EGPRS) which need to be set firs of use??

<p>1) If you select&nbsp;3G mode you will be able to use HSDPA with lower speed.</p>
<p>2) GSM means 2G. The majority GSM networks&nbsp;in Europe use&nbsp;900MHz and 1800MHz&nbsp;, but in the USA&nbsp; 850MHz, 1900MHz&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) A 2G network is not compatibile with 3G and 3,5G</p>
<p>4) GPRS (General Packet Radio Service)- is a system used to transmit packet data in a 2G network at speeds up to 100kb/s to send and receive emails and to browse the internet.</p>
<p>5) EGPRS (Enhanced GPRS) = EDGE( Exchanged Data rates for GSM Evolution)- it`s an&nbsp;upgraded version&nbsp; of GPRS. It`s much faster than GPRS ( speeds up to 236kb/s)</p>

            Thanks very much man,,<br />
<br />
My mobile is just have (3G or GSM or Dual mode) and it some times it writes to use "3,5G" near to the network signal, so is that mean that every mobile can use 3G technology can also use 3,5G??<br />
<br />
U said that 2G doesnt compatible with (3G or 3,G), So is that mean the "Dual mode" option isnt significant or it reduce the speed of internet??<br />
<br />
If i choosed 3G instead of dual mode is that better??<br />
<br />
Is that networks effect also on call voice and quality or just effect on internet Data speed??

            If your phone supports 3.5G network, it also supports, 3G and 2G/GSM networks as well. This is called backward compatibility.<br />
<br />
Use 3G for faster internet access(you may need to activate 3G data plans from your network provider). 3G also consumes more battery than 2G.<br />
<br />
Dual mode, when set, phone selects the network which is available with better signal and internet access.<br />
<br />
Hope this clarifies your doubt. :)

            And call quality is almost same in both 2G and 3G/3.5G, voice may break in case of areas with weak network signal.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

*U said that "if my mobile support 3,5G it also support 3G and 2G",,,what about the opposite, so my mobile just have two options in Network mode setting (3G or GSM or Dual mode) but doesnt have option for 3,5G although it some times write 3,5G beside the network
 signal in the top of the screen,,So is that mean that every mobile have 3G have also 3,5G like my mobile??!<br />
((i mean that my mobile some times connect to 3,5G althout it just have option for 3G or GSM))...

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pivot table has 2 columns: Level 1 and Level 2. It has 1 Values.</p>

</p><p>When I create the Pivot Chart, ideally, I'd want to see the following in the bar chart.</p>

    <title>Accidental backspace click&#59; Archive folder missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vol4ever  say:</h3>
<h2>            Accidental backspace click&#59; Archive folder missing</h2>
                    <p>I had 2 windows open &amp; clicked backspace a few times thinking I was in a Word document BUT system focus was still on my Outlook Inbox.&nbsp; I noticed several e-mails had mysteriously disappeared.&nbsp; After Googling, it appears backspace is a shortcut for archiving.&nbsp;
 The problem is I don't use archive feature nor can I find default archive folder that's supposed to be automatically created by Outlook.&nbsp; I've looked both in my desktop copy as well as webmail interface (on direct office365.com . . . . not a 3rd party like
 gmail or hotmail).&nbsp; There simply is no folder labelled "archive".&nbsp; Messages aren't in my deleted folder either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I desperately need help as I'm not sure what other e-mails evaporated, and my inbox is my personal "to do" list.&nbsp; Need to pull them back from accidental archive.&nbsp; Hope that makes sense.&nbsp; Thanks!!</p>

<p>My apologies for not reporting back sooner.&nbsp; I couldn't get any of the recommended solutions to work, but I ended up self-solving.&nbsp; I stumbled on "Filter E-mail" in the top toolbar &amp; selected This Week / Today.&nbsp; Then sorted by "In Folder" and BOOM, there
 they were.&nbsp; Highlighted all those listed as Archive &amp; dragged back into my active Inbox.&nbsp; Problem solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Weird part is I still have no earthly idea where that archive folder is physically located, but at least I have a workaround if the accidental button click ever occurs again.&nbsp; Wish I could just disable the archive function completely as I don't use it, but
 oh well.</p>

<h2>            Soundtrack in Sway</h2>
                    I've create a set of sway photo slides and want to have a background sound track play with it. I've uploaded the photos and the .mp3 file, but it's not clear how to have it auto-start when the slides start showing the photos. Any insights?

            <p>Hi Will,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is not currently a way to have an uploaded piece of audio auto-play.&nbsp; One potential workaround this is to use an embed card from another site that allows auto-play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 &#40;O365&#41;&#58; new inbox email &#34;duplicates&#34; when opening message.</h2>
                    <p>We are using O365 Exchange server - not a POP3 - the messages are NOT coming into the inbox twice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The list of "new" messages arrive, when they are opened, they can be read, but when they are closed (from a double-click) or a new-new message is selected, the closed message duplicates in the mail list display. However, if you delete the "duplicate" the
 other copy can not be opened (says it was deleted).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never seen this before, and all searches point to actual receipt of duplicated mail - in this case, the messages are not being duplicated per se - just displayed as duplicated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not happening on every one of our systems - just one employee (who seems to attract the oddest problems on her system).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be nice because this one has me stumped.</p>

<p>Hi Andrea Welsh,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you said “Outlook 365”, is it Outlook Web App? The impacted account is an Office 365 account? Please login
<strong>Outlook Web App</strong> to see if deleted items folder displayed on web side.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is Outlook desktop client, if the account is in cached mode, please use online mode to see if issue persists: Account Settings-&gt;double-click the impacted account-&gt;untick checkbox “<strong>Use Cached
 Exchange Mode</strong>”-&gt;restart Outlook client. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can’t find the deleted items folder both in Outlook Web App and Outlook desktop client, to recover the deleted items, you may let your admin run
<strong>e-discovery search</strong> or <strong>content search</strong> in Security &amp; Compliance center and help recovering the deleted items:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meantime, to further look into this issue, would you please share a screenshot of this issue symptom with me? Issue occurs on Outlook client, or Outlook Web App?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Anna</p>

            If you restart Outlook desktop with the resetfolders switch does it come back?  If the folder was marked hidden, this should bring it back.  Or, you could look at the mailbox using MFCMAPI and see if it is marked hidden.  See <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/delete-outlooks-default-folders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/delete-outloo...</a> for instructions to look for the folder. 
<br />
<br />To use the reset folder switch: 
<br />Close Outlook. Right-click on the Start button and choose Run or press Windows key + R  to open the Run command. Type or paste the following into the Open field and press Enter or click OK to restart Outlook. (There is a space before /.) 
<br />
<br />outlook.exe /resetfolders 
<br />
<br />This will reset the folder assignments to the default folders for the account and recreate any missing folders.

<h2>            Importing Data in One to Many Relationship</h2>
                    
<p>I have an Excel spreadsheet which contains a table of data that when entered into my database will be split across two tables. I created a query and was hoping it'd be as simple as copying and pasting, but no, it's not.</p>
<p>The link between my two tables is the Purchase Order number.</p>
<p>table 1 (one side): tblLDC!LDCPONum (Index with no dups allowed)</p>
<p>table 2 (many side): tblPOItems!LDCPONum (Index with dups allowed)</p>
<p>In my Excel sheet, I've preassigned the PO number to each item. Some items can be shown on the same PO. In my query, I've tried showing the tblLDC PO field, then tried showing tblPOItems PO field, but the database keeps telling me that I'm creating duplicate
 entries. Typically the PONum field is left blank and put into an "Paste Errors" table.</p>
<p>It seems that because tblLDC is set up to not allow dups, it's confusing the database. But when I look up further in the query, I see duplicate entries for existing records so I'm not sure why it won't allow me to do this.</p>
<p>Now the weird thing is earlier today, it seemed to allow me to do it, but now it's giving me problems. Sorry if I'm not explaining this good enough.</p>

            You need two queries.&nbsp; The first query uses DISTINCT and just selects the fields for the One side table.&nbsp; After that one appends its records to tblLDC, then run the query that selects the fields for the Many side table.&nbsp; The only field that's common between
 the two queries is the LDCPONum.

<p>You need a query for each table.</p>
<p>The first for your PO number and other unique data use a totals query to roll it to single record.</p>
<p>The second query the PO number and the many details.</p>

<h2>            Cannot delete groups from my Windows Phone</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to delete a group from my Microsoft Lumia 435 running Windows Phone 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The group is now obsolete, and the contacts have been removed / deleted but I cannot actually delete the group.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has already been deleted in Outlook 2016 and the People app of my Windows 10 laptop, but just won't go away.&nbsp; How do I remove / delete it?</p>

<p>Hi Alison,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is normally resolved by performing a <strong>
<span><span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/wiki/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d" title="hard reset">hard
 reset</a></span></span></strong> on your phone. <span><span>It
</span></span>will bring your phone back to factory settings, the same state as when the device was first turned on.
<span><span>We suggest that you use it and check if the issue persists.

<p>Thank you.</p>

</p><p>However, if a hard reset is the only&nbsp; option I will live with the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My poor phone is teetering on the edge of&nbsp;obsolescence, in spite of upgrading to&nbsp;Windows &nbsp; 10,&nbsp; and I&nbsp;dread to think what will disappear if I hard reset. Last time it was the WordPress App and the time before was Shazam.</p>
