<p>This is an update to the below saga. Because many have been blaming the SD cards for the problems noted below, I contacted SanDisk, whose customer service and support BTW far outshine Nokia thus far. Bottom line: YOUR SD CARD IS NOT LIKELY THE CULPRIT causing
 problems with duplicate files or not seeing files on your phone. If you plug the SD card into your PC and the files are there and acting normal, it's not the SD card. To be certain, do three things: 1. Reformat it; 2. Try your SD card in someone else's computer;
 and 3. Try a different SD card in your computer. If all is well, it's not your SD card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SO NOKIA, FIX YOUR PHONE, PLEASE. I've given you great info to work with below. So far this phone has been a LOT of work for me. If I don't get a fix soon, I will be going Android, and will never recommend that anyone get a Nokia or Windows phone.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*******************</p>
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a problem with the SD card on my phone and the music/videos/pics showing up on the phone; BUT the files show on the SD card when I connect to the PC. Previously, the music and pics were duplicating; now, they are not showing up at all. When I go into
 Settings, Storage, the files show up under "Other." The do not show up in any photo albums or music apps (including Nokia and Xbox). NOTE: I use the file folders created by the phone. As my pics and music are an important part of my life, I hope you can help
 me!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first, my phone would see the files on the SD card. But then file duplications of both pictures and music started. Some files would be duplicated twice, some up to six times. NOTE: The pic files were not affected as often or as badly as the music files,
 probably because I don't access them as often (?). I have not been using videos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I will first give you spec info on the phone, then I will tell you what I have done to troubleshoot (in part, I have troubleshooted mostly using info on these forums). With all this info, I hope that you can help me resolve my problem (and as both the
 duplication and the SD card issue seem prevalent, your answer to this post my solve the problems for many).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PHONE SPECS:</p>
<p>Phone Model: Nokia Lumia 822</p>
<p>Mobile Operator: VZW-US</p>
<p>Mobile OS Version: 8.0.10211.204</p>
<p>Configuration ID: 121012</p>
<p>Firmware Revision: 1532.5951.1250.1012</p>
<p>Hardware Revision: 1.0.0.0</p>
<p>Radio Software Version: 2.0.092021.3</p>
<p>Chip SOC Version: 8960</p>
<p>Boot Loader: ?? [Cannot find this]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you also need the following, I can supply it: MAC address; RRL-ID; MEID; MDN; ERI; IMEI; SimID; Sim Unlock; SMS vCard Receiver; Contacts Initializer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SD CARD INFO:</p>
<p>SanDisk 64GB microSD/SDHC/SDXC</p>
<p>When reformatting, I reformat it to its “original” state, when it asks me. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Music files are in .mp3 format; tried .mp4, and that did not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I update/check the following at least 3x/week per what came with the phone and what I later installed per Nokia: Phone Update; Lumia Pusher; nokia-lumia-updates.xap (now on Sim Card [wasn't working on SD card]); Phone Storage; Email + Accounts; Backup; Backup
 Assistant Plus</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHAT I'VE DONE:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. First, I tried deleting all files and recopying them over using my phone cable connection to the computer. After doing this 5-6 times, I decided that something else had to be done, as nothing was improving, and file transfer over the phone cable takes
 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Next, I tried reformatting the SD card. I thought this would work, because when reinserted into the phone, the phone asked if I want to use it for music/videos/pics, and I answered "yes." When I went under Storage in Settings, it is indeed set up to use
 the SD card for these items. Then the duplications started again. I repeated the formatting procedure. Dupes started again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Next, I tried reformatting the SD card, then putting the files onto it not through the phone cable, but through the SD card slot on the computer (which was significantly faster, BTW). I reinserted the card into the phone. Again, it asked if I wanted to
 put music/video/pics on SD card; I said "yes." This time, I went into the xBox music application and most of the music is there, but not all of it; so I went into Nokia Music app, and all of it was showing there. So I decided to use the Nokia app. Then dupes
 started up again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. At this point, the pics seemed OK, but I was getting empty albums, which I deleted from the phone since I never used them anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Without reformatting the SD card this time, I deleted all music files from the card, then recopied files again, not using the phone cable since it was faster (I figured if I had to keep doing this, I might as well do it the quick way). Result: I put the
 SD card into the phone again. This time NO files at all showed up in the picture and music apps. I went to Settings/Storage. The SD card was there, the settings for it being used for pics/videos/music were in place. I clicked on the SD card. It showed 0 bytes
 under pictures, music, and videos. Instead, all memory&nbsp;used&nbsp;was located under "Other," which doesn't help at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. So, I reformat the SD card again, reinsert it into the phone, and again, asked if wanted to put videos/pics/music on SD card; I answer "yes." I connect the phone directly to the computer, and this time use the phone cable to the computer to copy files
 onto the phone (SD card) again. Result: Files </p>
<p>still not showing up in pic and music/video apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. I tried reformatting one more time. Same as in point #6 above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Lightbulb goes off: I wondered if the problem was with the *.xap file I downloaded from Nokia. The instrux had said to put it on the SD card. If the SD card was not communicating with the Sim card/phone correctly, then maybe that was the issue. So I moved
 the Nokia updater *.xap file from SD card to Sim card on a whim. Suddenly all sorts of things were being updated.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Since moving the *.xap had such positive results, I did step #6 again, wondering if the lack of updates were the problem. But, no change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I am sitting here with a phone that might as well not be a Smartphone. Without pictures and music, it is just a phone to me. I might as well have not upgraded from my old phone (which was BASIC, cheap, etc.). This is my first Smartphone, and I have been
 almighty frustrated with this situation. When it's working, I love it, though. As an aside, I find the trend to have everything dependent upon the Internet a bit much, and with data plans no longer unlimited and getting more expensive, this dependence on the
 Internet is cumbersome. I don't have Internet at home, and I live in a rural area, which means I have to travel to get to a Wi-Fi zone.&nbsp; Which I turn makes it hard to get things resolved when they go wrong. *sigh*</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to look into this. If you can help me troubleshoot this, I would be SO appreciative!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have the same phone and card.&nbsp; I have similar, though not identical, issues with the SD card.&nbsp; In my case, the phone just stops reading the card, doesn't see music or photos on the card.&nbsp; What works for me is to just take the card out, stick it into the

<p>I've never had the duplication problem others have had, knock wood.&nbsp; I'm hoping the upcoming OS update will fix this bug.</p>

<p>Jim, </p>
<p><br />
It hasn't asked me to fix it yet. I'll put it in and see if there's an option to do it, though. Question for you on this: do you transfer files via phone cable, or via the sd card put directly into the computer slot? My hope is the computer slot, because the
 cable is tons slower. Thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Didn't work *sigh* It doesn't give you an option to fix it unless something triggers it. I tried to purposely reformat in the wrong mode. Phone asked if I wanted to reformat in right way, I said yes, and it then just hung there. I've tried before having
 the phone reformat it, with no change to being able to see things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll just cry, because my Zune player stopped working, so I counted on my phone to be a replacement. As an audiophile, this situation is just depressing.</p>

I start to wonder if MS will ever manage to fix this issue. It couldn't be that difficult for the people who has developed WP8 to find this bug and correct it. I will not sit still and wait for the fix any longer, now it's IOS or Android for me!<br />
<div><br />
<div>Sorry Microsoft, no company has ever gained from ignoring their customers. At least not in the long run!</div>

            I was too suffering from similar problems..... But now its alright...take the sd card out of your phone..format it in you pc keep file system fat32 .... Copy songs..then put it back in the phone.. Everything must be fine. Or just delete wpsystem folder
 from the sd card.... Using a sd card reader. Google it how to delete wpsystem folder. And remember don't format you sd card via phone or you'll suffer from same problem again....

    <title>Outlook 2013 External Automatic Replies Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 External Automatic Replies Not Working</h2>
                    In the company I work for, we have been upgrading people to Office 2013. In Outlook 2013, when they set up Automatic Replies, the external reply does not work. We checked the settings and they are both turned on, the message is set up the same and the
 Automatic Reply is set up to send during a specific period of time, however when people from outside the company send them an email when their automatic reply is turned on, they receive nothing in return informing them that the person they are trying to reach
 is not in that day. Is there a setting or update that we have to run for this to work correctly?

<p>I have two email addresses set up on my Outlook account. &nbsp;I set up automatic replies for each of them, but it is only working for one of them. &nbsp;I set them both up the same way, but a different message for each. &nbsp;That's the only difference. &nbsp;It's working
 fine for my primary email account, but it's not working for the other email account. &nbsp;Is there a reason for this?</p>

<p>have you tried a reboot?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you can also try all of the following, just to see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>open a browser, then type a choose a webpage (doesnt&nbsp;matter if it connects), tap on the top bar to open the menu, option/clear private data/(check all of them)/clear</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>install rootsh into your device through the appmanager</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>after installation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>open xterm</p>
<p>sudo gainroot</p>
<p>apt-get clean</p>
<p>apt-get clean</p>
<p>apt-get upgrade -y</p>
<p>apt-get clean</p>
<p>apt-get autoremove -y&nbsp; (if this gives you an error, then omit the -y)</p>
<p>apt-get clean</p>
<p>apt-get autoclean</p>
<p>reboot</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>settings (wrench icon)/internet connections/(under "connect autumatically" choose WiFi/check in the "wsitch to WiFi when avialable/connections (check to be sure that you have the wifi ssid set up correctly for what you are ttrying to connect to)/done/save/exit
 settings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>go to main screen and tap the battery level to drop the menu down/internet connection/choose the internet connection you want (wifi)/will close and try to connect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>watch for the icon to solidify for wifi and then open a browser and try to use the internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>report back if that works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>hope that helped.</p>

<p>I am experiencing this weird situation as well. My 3G works, when trying to initiate a WiFi connection, the local WLAN SSID is recognized and can be saved in settings. Any attempt to connect to it fails, though. By tapping in the routine of ceroberts75 (thanks
 a lot for posting it!) I do not achieve the WiFi to be recognized (WiFi icon never solidifies, After a long while of "select connection" and spinning wheel, nothing is found (N900 reporting back: No connections available" and after a while it offers me to
 disconnect from T-Mobile Internet).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Now the question is, whether there is a command I can use to perform a healthcheck on the WiFi component in order to stop loosing time with maybe a faulty hardware?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have gotten the N900 through a US reseller but am using it in Europe. I switched to France as a permanent setting after a reboot/battery removal FWIW.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            i had this issue once with a replacement device and it was a hw problem which couldn't be fixed by any xterm commands... i even flashed the device to make sure it wasn't a sw issue so chances are it needs a repair :-(<br />
<br />
@meyag look in the app manager for 'health check' or something similar, not sure if thats the correct name for it

    <title>Word 2013 Will Not Print - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike c_1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2013 Will Not Print</h2>
                    Brand new desktop PC (AMD FX-8350/8 core 4 GHz, 32 GB RAM, yadda), Windows 8 (x64) installed, Office 2013 installed.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Opened Word 2013, typed up a small one-page document, tried to print to my default printer (HP LaserJet Pro 300 color). The document will not print.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Tried printing to XPS format as a test. The document will not print.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Saved as a PDF, opened PDF in Windows 8, tried printing. The document prints.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Unfortunately saving every Word documents as PDF, then playing the switching game between Windows 8 desktop and Metro modes just to print individual documents is not an option for me.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Haven't found much info on this yet, but figured I'd post here as I continue searching. Any ideas appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            Thanks Raju,
<div><br />
<div>I just tried again and the document printed directly from Word 2013. The only difference between the other night and just now is that I did a hard reboot of the computer this time. Last time the computer had been on for several hours and I had woken it
 up from hibernation.
<div><br />
<div>I'll let you know when the problem occurs again, as it has happened on 4 occasions now and I expect it will happen again in the near future.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>
<div>Michael</div>

            Hi TomokoIkari,
<br />Do you receive that error message with every message you try to send or only with messages to specific addresses? 
<br />
<br />SMTPUTF8 is used for  UTF-8 encoding and the error message indicates the address you are sending to has an error in the format. 
<br />
<br />Who is your email provider?

<h2>            My Phone &#34;can&#39;t connect to the Wi-Fi network&#34; without a reboot first</h2>
                    I have 3 regular wi-fi points, 2 @ home and 1 @ work. Whenever I travel between these wi-fi spots, 9 out of 10 times I need to reboot my phone before I'm able to link to the local network. If I don't, my phone will tell me: Your phone can't connect to
 the Wi-Fi network Sitecomxxxx (network name will vary depending on where I am). I cannot imagine that it would have anything to do with the access-point settings since, after that reboot, the Lumia 930 (Version1511 build 10.0.10586.318) seems quite able to
 connect after all. I believe I've seen this issue for awhile now, but it's now getting steadily worse (estimate fr 5/10 to 9/10 times currently). Similar experiences with other Wi-Fi points, but am using these 3 as a specific example. Any suggestions?

            <p>Hi, MB2KSE.<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you still experiencing the same concern with the Wi-Fi connection?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may need to perform a hard reset on your phone. It will bring your phone back to factory settings, the same state as when the device was first turned on. All apps, messages, media, personal settings, etc will be removed from the phone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If backup is turned on under Settings, you can restore your apps and settings after performing a hard reset (as long as you initialize the phone with the same Microsoft Account).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that resetting your device will not remove any OS or firmware updates. You will remain on the same version of Windows Phone after the reset.<br />
<br />
You can reset your phone under Settings: <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>about</strong> &gt;
<strong>reset</strong> <strong>your</strong> <strong>phone</strong>.<br />
<br />
Keep us posted for further assistance.<br />
<br />
Regards.</p>

When I try to do this on Romanian version - it redirects me to confirmation page where it says "Thank you for downloading" without downloading anything.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Nicolai,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It could be the device is not compatible to install the said language proofing tools.
<span>We need to do further investigation on your concern.&nbsp;Kindly answer the following questions for clarification:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Have you tried downloading it using a different browser?</span></li><li><span>Is this happening only on the device that you are using or other devices as well?</span></li><li><span>Did you try to download other language proofing tools and see if the issue persists?</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Furthermore, we suggest that you try to uninstall </span>Office 2016 completely and install one version. Do not use
<strong>setup.exe</strong> provided in the <strong>Microsoft Office 2016 DVD</strong>. Instead, open the
<strong>"Office" folder</strong> and run <strong>setup32.exe</strong> or <strong>
setup64.exe</strong> appropriately. After the clean installation, you should be able to install the language pack without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<h2>            E 75 Keyboard trouble</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a E75 since july '09, and during the time being it has been a nightmare. The first E75&nbsp; I traded in after a few days after problems with answering the calls. The second (and current) E75 has had bad call quality or bad reach...something&nbsp;I never experienced
 with my previous Nokia phones. Also the phones craches a lot, for instance when swithcing to the "home" panel to internet etc....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The newest problem is that the main (numeric) keyboard is not responding anymore....especially the "menu" key (upper left) and the row with the numbers (1 -3). Also the main center key responds really slow to my touches.....I brought it in for repair at
 a certified nokia service center...but I would like to know if somebody has a clue what happened to my phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: the keys mentioned do respond to touching them;&nbsp; as the backlighting of the screens turns on after pressing them. But they don't do the task where they are designed for, so is it something in the software??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Build 10074 - ESD found and is working.</h2>
                    <p>So I found out on WinBeta that the Build 10074 ESD's were available to download directly from the Windows Update servers. So I followed the link and download the ESD. I am using esd-decrypter-wimlib-4 to convert it to ISO. So far it is working.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c6a5541-ff2c-4695-ae16-87be20987d19" /></p>
<p>So, if I get it installed, I will update you here. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anybody heard of this build?</p>

            No, you need to convert to a ISO and then Burn onto a DVD or save to a USB drive, and do an install.

<h3> dt7blue  say:</h3>
<h2>            E70 drivng me crazy&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Can any one help me with either solving a problem with my E70 or failing that how I can talk to a human being at Nokia Customer Service.<br />
<br />
I have had a E70 since January (bought off eBay 6 months old (unwanted upgrade from a Vodafone,but unlocked). I am on 02 user and have set up the phone with email settings etc and then have a recurring fault in the the phone powers itself off and then reboots
 itself. Now after 3 returns to Nokia my E70 has at last been replaced with a "new" handset. However, when I go to back up all the settings using the Nokia PC Suiteon my laptop I loose all the menu functionality and therefore all data. I've tried for hours
 to get through to the 0845 0455555 Nokia Helpline. Help please before I either eBay it or flush it down the loo!<br />
<br />

<p>I just did and you are correct, there are some codes entered that don't have a closing "}"</p>
<p>I will correct those instances and test it again tomorrow.</p>
<p>How do I avoid errors like that in the future?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Well, this change to your expression will at least prevent that specific error from breaking it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IIf([SIMED ORDERS Followup]![Note] Like "{PT*}",(Mid([SIMED ORDERS Followup]![Note],InStr([SIMED ORDERS Followup]![Note],"{")+1,InStr([SIMED ORDERS Followup]![Note],"}")-InStr([SIMED ORDERS Followup]![Note],"{")-1)),"")
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that, the complex Mid() expression will only be evaluated when there's a "{PT" followed -- after some number of intervening characters -- by a "}".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above version will not come out right if you have something like this in the field:&nbsp; "x}y{PTzzz}" (there's a closing brace before the opening brace of the "{PT"; or if you have something like this:&nbsp; "x{y{PTzzz}" (there's an opening brace before the opening
 brace of the "{PT").&nbsp; The results will be wrong because InStr([SIMED ORDERS Followup]![Note],"}") or InStr([SIMED ORDERS Followup]![Note],"{") will find the first brace of that type, which is not part of the "{PT...}" code.&nbsp; It can be fixed by specifying the
 starting point of the InStr scan, like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IIf([SIMED ORDERS Followup]![Note] Like "{PT*}",(Mid([SIMED ORDERS Followup]![Note],InStr([SIMED ORDERS Followup]![Note],"{PT")+1,InStr(InStr([SIMED ORDERS Followup]![Note],"{PT"),[SIMED ORDERS Followup]![Note],"}")-InStr([SIMED ORDERS Followup]![Note],"{PT")-1)),"")
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I don't know if I got that exactly right, and I'm leaving it to you to test if you need to guard against extra braces.</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mobile</h2>
                    Hi I have a strange problem with Windows Live Mobile.<br />
<br />
When first set up, everything went great, and all contacts/inbox etc was synchronised, I could see my online &amp; offline contacts etc.<br />
<br />
Then, after a while (a few hours) the program stopped synchronising properly. It runs the sync and when it gets to personal settings, it fails. (hotmail syncs OK, messenger still works).<br />
<br />
Went into my messenger settings on the pc and deleted my picture and set this to not display as I had read this could cause problems. Still no joy. The only way I can get a full sync is to go to Switch Account and act as though I am switching account, but sign
 in again as myself, then I get 1 or 2 syncs that are flawless, and then the same problem begins again.<br />
<br />
If it's of any help, the About, says that this is version 10.6.0028.2700 and it is running on an HTC Touch running WM6.<br />
<br />
Can you help me with this please?<br />

<p>The issue that you are describing with e-mail&nbsp;seems to be&nbsp;fixed in the latest release of Windows Live for Windows Mobile (10.6.42.1900) at
<a href="http://wl.windowsmobile.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://wl.windowsmobile.com</a>.&nbsp; The release is intended for those phones that do not come preinstalled with Windows Live and only provides Hotmail.&nbsp; If you want Messenger you need to
 stick with the version preinstalled in ROM on your phone.&nbsp; Give it a try.&nbsp; Also check out the release notes that describe some problems where certain e-mails can block the e-mail sync from working.</p>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
I think I know what's the problem is, I did a hard reset and I found Live Messenger on my programs list. I noticed that I'm installing Windows Live Messenger With no IM.
<br />
<br />
Hope this help. <br />
<br />

            Hello Tommy, 
<br />
<br />Hello 
<br />
<br />My name is Parmi, I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting your question. I'll be happy to help. 
<br />
<br />unfortunately, in outlook.com there is no option to block a person completely. if, it was O365 tenant then from exchange online tenant admin portal it could have been avoided before reaching users mailbox. 
<br />
<br />However, it is a great idea and i recommend you to create this as new suggestion at outlook uservoice forum <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.uservoice.com</a>
<br />
<br />Sorry, couldnt help much here. 
<br />
<br />Please let me know if, you have any other queries. 
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />Parmi

            Dear Tommy,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />Although there is no option to block someone completely, you can create a rule <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-inbox-rules-in-outlook-com-4b094371-a5d7-49bd-8b1b-4e4896a7cc5d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-in...</a> that will automatically mark emails from a particular sender as junk and delete those emails.

<p>LordAlukard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for the advice.&nbsp; As you stated, there is no way to completely block emails from any specific sender.&nbsp; For now, I guess I will just have to bite the bullet and continue to delete emails from my junk folder.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have submitted a suggestion to "outlook.uservoice.com" to allow users to completely block emails from specific senders and domains.&nbsp; There have been many other users requesting the same function.&nbsp; Hopefully, the folks at Outlook Support will comply and
 allow this to be possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, thanks again for replying to my query.&nbsp; It's totally cool to see people who are not employed with Microsoft trying to help other users.&nbsp; Our world is a better place because you are a part of it.</p>
<p>

            Dear Tommy,
<br />
<br />If you submitted request at uservoice, you can paste a link to your reply and every user that will find this a good idea, will also be able to vote for it. I will.
<br />
<br />As for emails that you have in Junk folder, you do not have to delete them, they are deleted automatically after 30 days. You can find more information here <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/restore-deleted-email-messages-in-outlook-com-cf06ab1b-ae0b-418c-a4d9-4e895f83ed50" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/restor...</a>
<br />
<br />Also I advise you to read this information on how to handle spam emails more effectively ( of course if you want ):
<br />1. First of all check your spam filters and see suggestions on how to keep spam out of your inbox <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-keep-spam-and-junk-email-out-of-your-inbox-in-outlook-com-a3ece97b-82f8-4a5e-9ac3-e92fa6427ae4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-k...</a>
<br />2. Report the phishing, spam and unwanted emails <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-with-abuse-phishing-or-spoofing-in-outlook-com-0d882ea5-eedc-4bed-aebc-079ffa1105a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-w...</a>
<br />3. Add emails or domains to block sender (those that were actually used to send emails - see #5) list <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-senders-or-unblock-senders-in-outlook-com-afba1c94-77bb-4f50-8b85-057cf52f4d5e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-...</a>
<br />4. Create specific rules for subjects or common phrases that are present in those emails <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-inbox-rules-in-outlook-com-4b094371-a5d7-49bd-8b1b-4e4896a7cc5d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-in...</a> and add conditions, that are common for those emails, for example additional keywords, recipient address includes etc.
<br />5. Nowadays some scammers have learned how to mask their emails addresses that you can see in the emails. However, in the message source you will find the real one (and the real domain) In order to view message source please check this article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/receiving-email-from-blocked-senders-in-outlook-com-265923a0-b52c-4157-92c8-370385215da1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/receiv...</a>

<p>LordAlukard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the advice; however. the goal is to block emails from being received in ANY of my folders.&nbsp; Apparently, that is NOT yet possible.&nbsp; Nobody can do it.&nbsp; Microsoft Outlook does not have a function to completely block emails from a specific sender
 or domain.&nbsp; The best they can do is to have blocked emails routed into the junk email folder.&nbsp; Everyone who has complained about this issue is suffering the same problem.&nbsp; There is nothing we can do about it for now.&nbsp; I don't think I can explain the situation
 any differently.</p>

    <title>Wrongful closure of my bing ads account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zanepir  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wrongful closure of my bing ads account</h2>
                    <p>Hello guys,</p>
<p>I've recently started paid advertising and was trying to promote my ebay store by opening a campaign with the necessary keywords and targeting, but after opening my first campaign (although I haven't used bing ads before I did read a thorough course on how
 to run your first ad successfully) , I created the campaign and did not receive any traffic, afterwards the account was showing as blocked (within 1-2 hours) and I contacted support to look into it, they did and still didn't open my account back up. They called
 me though after I contacted support to verify my credit card which I also successfully did but still my account was closed for no discernable reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not get a single click even, I may have had a bad ad copy but as far as I know I typed in everyday correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Does anyone know why would bing ads do that? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help and thank you for any answers at all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Zane</p>

<h2>            contact support for Outlook 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    <p>I have an iMac 27" desktop. Never used Outlook until earlier this week as required by switch of service of a nonprofit I work with. Outlook never worked, it would open and then freeze before I could do anything. Multiple times, each time I closed it and
 reopened, it would get a little further in the initialization process, but never to the point where I could use it. I got fed up and uninstalled the application, thinking reinstalling might solve the pbm. Only thing is once uninstalled, I can't find a link
 to download to reinstall it. &nbsp;I reinstalled High Sierra, thinking it would automatically download it. It did not.</p>
<p>Where can I go to get this app back into my desktop?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloading an application, such as a reader should not cause any concerns or performance issue on your computer.&nbsp; If you already have a default reader and it's working properly, it's okay for you to not download another application, especially if you want
 to save some space on your device. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there are some documents that might need the Adobe Acrobat Reader which is why you may have received a pop up message asking you to install it. You can try printing the coupon using your default application in opening the documents, if it will not
 work, it is best to install the application as it might be needed for the coupon that you're trying to print.

    <title>I am not getting emails that were sent to me on Outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crystal parker  say:</h3>
<h2>            I am not getting emails that were sent to me on Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>For many weeks now I have been sporadically not getting my mail.&nbsp; I can verify this having been on the phone while only 3 of 4 mails sent to me from the other party were delivered, and while having 2 different conversations with my accountant, I only got
 replies to my own emails on one thread... when he sent the replies to the 2nd thread to my ISP account, I could see he was not doing anything to change my address or otherwise make his REPLY to my mail not come to the account that sent it.&nbsp; I needed to get
 a password reset for a system but unfortunately that mail was also dropped.&nbsp; At this point I am desperate to know what important mails have been lost, and I need help either fixing this or moving to gmail.&nbsp; I never had problems with Hotmail in the past, this
 only happens with outlook.com mail.</p>

            <p>Hi Crystal Parker,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for the delay in response. Let me assist you in solving your issue with incoming emails.
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>It is possible that your junk mail filter settings is blocking your incoming email messages. We recommend that you check and modify your junk mail filter. To do this, refer to the link
 below:</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/emails-missing-from-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>Email is not reaching my Hotmail inbox</font></a><font><font color="#0066cc"><font><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Make sure that the following features of Hotmail are not blocking your emails:</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>1. <strong>
Junk folder</strong> - check your junk folder if emails sent are there. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>2. <strong>
Blocked sender list</strong> - check your blocked sender list to make sure that the sender address is not included in the list.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>3. <strong>
Email rules</strong> - check your email rules in your account if there are rules conflicting the receiving emails.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>4. <strong>
Email forwarding</strong> - if you have enabled email forwarding to your account, kindly check your other email account for any incoming emails.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Also, we suggest that you disable conversation threading of your email settings to make sure that you are not missing any incoming emails. To do this, follow the steps below:</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. In your Outlook.com Inbox page, click the gear icon beside your Profile name.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2. Click

<font><b>Save</b>.</font></span></p>
</span>&nbsp;
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Once done, kindly check if you'll be able to receive emails. Let us know the results.</font></span></p>

            I have similar issues. Emails from decent longstanding institutions and companies (Canon, Hertz, my employer) do not show up. Occasionally they do show up. Mostly not. Can you please help me rectify this? They are not in junk mail. They are not blocked
 senders. These emails just vanish, never to be seen. No trace of them, even though the other sender does not get any indication that the email has not arrived, exactly the opposite.&nbsp;

            Same problem.&nbsp; Some emails coming through and some are not from the SAME sender. These are important emails from work that I am not receiving.&nbsp; I might receive 3 or 4 a week when maybe 6 or 7 were sent.&nbsp; WHY??&nbsp; This is affecting my job!&nbsp; Like I said these
 are from the same sender so it has nothing to do with junk filters or blocked senders.&nbsp; I've checked and rechecked this as Outlook keeps repeatedly suggesting but how can this make sense when I do receive some but not all?&nbsp; I can't be the only person this
 is happening to.. Someone else must have a solution.&nbsp; Please help.&nbsp; <br />

            Microsoft is in the process of getting this issue fixed. Though no timeline is committed but this should get fixed in next Windows update which will flow in.

    <title>Excel 2016 Win 10 Pro - Enabling Solver add-in freezes and crashes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mister_vulcan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 Win 10 Pro - Enabling Solver add-in freezes and crashes Excel</h2>
                    As the title says, enabling the Solver add-in for Excel 2016 or in a separate Excel 2010 (x86) installation causes the concerned application to crash - specifically, to throw an unhandled win32 exception. I tried uninstalling Office (both the 365 version
 and the 2010 version) and just reinstalling Office 365. Upon launching Excel 2016 and enabling the Solver add-in, it crashed. Again, this is after uninstalling any instance of MS Office and doing a complete re-install. Also of note is that this issue occurred
 while Excel was in use - I was using a 3rd-party add-in that relied on the Solver add-in for some of its functionality when the first instance happened. The 3rd-party add-in was removed from the add-in list and not re-enabled after reinstalling Office.

<p><span>Hi Mister_vulcan,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your description, it seems that you only installed Office 2016 on your computer and Excel 2016 crashes when you enabled the Solver add-in.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If yes, to move forward, I’d like you to confirm and provide the following.</span></p>
<p><span>1. If you can reproduce the issue, I’d like you to upload a video describing the crash issue onto a shared folder provided in
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox</a>. In the video, please record all the scenarios the crash issue include.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Upload a full screenshot of the page showing the version information of Excel 2016. You can access the page via File&gt;Account.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Do you install Office 2016 on your Windows 10 Pro computer? If you have some test computers which are the same operating system or different operating systems with the same version of Office 2016,
 what’s the outcome of the tests?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Given the situation, I suggest you try and check the following.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Run Excel 2016 in <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-Office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-Windows-PC-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Safe Mode</a> to see the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Check if the issue happens in a specific file and in all Office applications.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Cliff&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Find similar text from one excel sheet to another - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Find similar text from one excel sheet to another</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please can someone tell me if its possible to find similar text from one sheet to another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sheet 4, i want to look up to see if cell A4 is repeated or has similar text within sheet 2 range A4 to A233, and return a result of sheet 2 range B4 to B233. The result is to be displayed on sheet 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So sheet 4, cell A4 contains the words Company Procedure, i want it to tell me whether those words are repeated on sheet 2, and if so to return a result of its procedure number from sheet 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this makes sense but if it doesn't i can try and explain further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A formula that works for a specific instance is easy to devise but I'm now beginning to doubt if this can be done robustly with a formula that would work all the time. Usually when doing these
<em>fuzzy</em> lookups we are trying to find an occurrence of a short string within a long one and here you're trying to do the opposite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway let's be positive and keep trying. On sheet 4 it seems to me that the <strong>
key</strong> words we're trying to find on sheet 2 are the first 2 words in the cell and that's what this formula does. So from the string</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Progress Measurement &amp; Reporting Procedure</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">it takes the first 2 words of 'Process measurement' and looks up those on sheet 2</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=VLOOKUP(TRIM(LEFT(A2,FIND(CHAR(7),SUBSTITUTE(A2," ",CHAR(7),2)))),'MK Procedures'!A2:B221,2,FALSE)</p>
