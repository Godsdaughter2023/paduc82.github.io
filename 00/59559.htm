                    <p>Is anyone else having trouble have the enemies load in the first level? Everything is running great but enemies won’t appear. I’ve love this game since it came out in 2002. Was the reason I fell in love with xbox. Hopefully they are already working on a solution to fix this.&nbsp;</p>

            You didn't say, but I assume that C: and D: are both partitions on the same physical drive.<br />
<br />
You also didn't say, but I assume that you are using some version of Windows XP.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Windows XP has no native (built-in) tools that will do what you want.&nbsp; You need to use a third party disk management tool.&nbsp; Here are a few:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.partition-tool.com/personal.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Easeus Partition Master Home</a> (free)<br />
<a href="http://www.paragon-software.com/home/pm-personal/?__utma=1.349930667.1306085709.1306085709.1306085709.1&amp;__utmb=1.1.10.1306085709&amp;__utmc=1&amp;__utmx=-&amp;__utmz=1.1306085709.1.1.utmcsr=google%7Cutmccn=%28organic%29%7Cutmcmd=organic%7Cutmctr=partition%20managment%20tools&amp;__utmv=-&amp;__utmk=181245607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Paragon

<a href="http://www.acronis.com/homecomputing/products/diskdirector/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Acronis Disk Director 11 Home</a> (not free)<br />
<br />
There are undoubtedly more, including more applications that are free or nearly so, but I have no experience with the others.<br />
<br />
Although rearranging the partitions on your disk using one of these specialized utilities is generally safe, as a matter of good practice, you should back up your system, or at least your important data, before using one of them.<br />

            <p>Lem has explained the problems you have in trying to resize partitions on the same drive.</p>
<p><span>You can create more free space in C by carrying any of the measures suggested below.</span></p>
<p><span>The default allocation to System Restore is 12% on your C partition which is over generous. I would reduce it to 700 mb. Right click your My Computer
 icon on the Desktop and select System Restore. Place the cursor on your C drive select Settings but this time find the slider and drag it to the left until it reads 700 mb and exit. When you get to the Settings screen click on Apply and OK and exit.</span></p>
<p><span>A default setting which could be wasteful is that for temporary internet files, especially if you do not store offline copies on disk. The default
 allocation is 3% of drive. Depending on your attitude to offline copies you could reduce this to 1% or 2%. In Internet Explorer select Tools, Internet Options, General, Temporary Internet Files, Settings to make the change. At the same time look at the number
 of days history is held.</span></p>
<p><span>The default allocation for the Recycle Bin is 10 % of drive. Change to 5%, which should be sufficient. In Windows Explorer place the cursor on your
 Recycle Bin, right click and select Properties, Global and move the slider from 10% to 5%. However, try to avoid letting it get too full as if it is full and you delete a file by mistake it will bypass the Recycle Bin and be gone for ever.</span></p>
<p><span>You can generate more space in the system partition (usually C ) by relocating folders.</span></p>
<p><span>For Temporary Internet Files select Start, Control Panel, Internet Options, Temporary Internet Files. Settings, and Move Folder.</span></p>
<p><span>To move the Outlook Express Store Folder select in Outlook Express Tools, Options, Maintenance, Store Folder, and Change.&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://www.tomsterdam.com/insideoe/files/store.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.tomsterdam.com/insideoe/files/store.htm</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>How to Change the Default Location of the My Documents folder:&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?id=310147" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/?id=310147</span></a></p>
<p><span>You may also need to change Default File locations in the Microsoft Office programmes when you choose to move the My Documents folder. For Word go to Tools, Options, File Locations, highlight
 Documents, click on Modify and change file path. For Excel go to Tools, Options, General and change default file path.
</span></p>
<p><span>My Documents is one of a number of system created Special Folders, which include My Pictures and My Music. These can more easily be relocated using TweakUi. Download TweakUI,
 one of the MS powertoys, from here: </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/downloads/powertoys.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/downloads/powertoys.asp</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>In TweakUi select My Computer, Special Folders. You can scroll down to see the full list of Special Folders to the left of the Change Location button.</span></p>
<p><span>You can move programmes but to do this you have to uninstall and reinstall the programme. With Word and Excel the existing data files are unaffected by reinstalling. Most
 of the work involved will be reinstalling all updates issued after those included with original Microsoft CD / DVD.</span></p><span>If your drive is formatted as NTFS another potential gain arises
 with your operating system on your C drive. In the Windows Directory of your C partition you will have some Uninstall folders in your Windows folder typically: $NtServicePackUninstall$ and $NtUninstallKB282010$ etc. These files may be compressed or not compressed.
 If compressed the text of the folder name appears in blue characters. If these files are not compressed you can compress them. Right click on each folder and select Properties, General, Advanced and check the box before Compress contents to save Disk Space.
 On the General Tab you can see the amount gained by deducting the size on disk from the size. Folder compression is only an option on a NTFS formatted drive / partition.</span>
<p><span>I would be interested in seeing a Disk Defragmenter report. Open Disk Defragmenter and click on Analyse. Select View Report and click
 on Save As and Save. Now find VolumeC.txt in your My Documents Folder. Open the file, place the cursor anywhere in the file, select Edit, Select All to highlight all text and copy and paste into the body of your message. Do this before running Disk Defragmenter
 as it is more informative.</span></p>
<p><span>Select Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools, Disk CleanUp to empty your Recycle Bin, remove Temporary Internet Files and other selected options. I also recommend
 you click on the More Options tab, System Restore and remove all but the latest System Restore point. Run Disk Defragmenter</span></p>
<p><span>Using the System restore option is most appropriate when your system is running slow and you need to increase free disk space on your C partition. If you have errors which
 might be resolved using System Restore to put your system settings back to before the error first occurred, do not use this option.
</span></p>
<p><span>Select Start, Control Panel, Folder Options, View, Advanced Settings and verify that the box before "Show hidden files and folders" is checked and "Hide protected operating
 system files" is unchecked. You may need to scroll down to see the second item. You should also make certain that the box before "Hide extensions for known file types" is not checked. Notwithstanding there remain some files which remain hidden. You still will
 not see the System Volume Information folder. </span></p>

<h2>            I am getting error 8024001F when attempting Windows Update but am in fact connected to Internet</h2>
                    I am setting up a brand new computer with Windows 7 Professional 32-bit. I installed Symantec v.12.1 and updated it. Internet is via DSL, but the computer wasn't happy getting its IP address from the router, so I gave it its own IP and put in the DNS information.
 The Internet is working fine, as are Symantec updates. I haven't installed any other software or hardware. When I went to run Windows update, it said it had to install something first and then close and reopen Windows update. It did that (I think, but I admit
 I walked away during the process) but then when it tried to run Windows Update again, it gave me error code 8024001F and said I needed to connect to the Internet (even though I am connected). I went through the "let us fix it for you" options, which ran, but
 didn't change anything. I disabled antivirus. I did a "clean reboot," following the directions. I added the variations of windows update URLs to trusted sites. Nothing helped. I am at a loss as to what to do next!

            when accessing websites that all of a sudden quit working, this could be a windows update issue. &nbsp;Either an up caused the connection problem or the website updated their servers with new security features and this is what is causing the problem. &nbsp;Make

 that my renter’s computer was wide open to the hacker. The hacker had my roommate’s computer set up to function the way that they wanted it to operate but she didn’t know so she was easy prey.</span></li><li><span><br />
</span></li><li><span>As I cut off the hacker I started investigating what was going on and discovered that each and everyday everything that my roommate did was extracted onto the hackers database, nothing was left untouched but everything was left intact. Then I thought
 about my computers so I went downstairs and sure enough the hacker was manipulating them. I cut off all internet activity as I did upstairs only this time the result of my action was met with a persistent attempt to infiltrate the internet activity. I know
 this because every 3 to 6 seconds Trend Micro was alerting me of suspicious activity (svchst) trying to make changes to my computers settings. It was incredible what I was witnessing. As I was witnessing the brashness of this hacker trying to undo my settings
 with no attempt at concealing him/herself I was a bit shaken up. I started turning off all remote services but to no avail, it was like nothing I ever seen before. Finally after having enough I unplugged my computers, one of them was my clients which I performed
 data recover for him.</span> </li><li><span>After a while of replaying what had just happened I turned on the computers that I had running and not only was my data, records, QuickBooks etc…compromised, everything was gone, nowhere to be found on my computers so I suspect that as I was occupied
 with this hacker her/she was intentionally keeping me busy as they helped themselves to my data and literally stealing it from my desktop. The part that made me physically ill was when I discovered that all of the data that I recovered from my client’s computer
 was also wiped out.&nbsp;</span> </li><li><span>I have never been faced with anything like this and I had no idea the sophistication of this predator until I began to meticulously eradicate my computers of this nuisance.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>First I wanted to call Trend Micro and share with them what I had just experienced. My objective was to use Trend Micro’s Tech Support and welcome their expertise at setting up Internet Security with the strictest settings possible. As a long time
 consumer of your product this was the first time I ever called in for advice g=however it was a terrible experience that left me feeling somewhat abandoned. The person on the other end of the line initially suspected that I was trying to blame TM for my losses.
 We did not hit it off well at all; he hung up on me so I called again this time speaking with a young lady. I was equally dismayed at the lack of concern that I detected on the receiving end and needless to say, my experience with calling TM was a complete
 waste of time. To give your tech team the benefit of the doubt I confess that I was most likely excitable when I called. I can be taken the wrong way when I am this way. Some people may think that I am angry when in actuality I am overly passionate at communicating
 what just happened to me.</span> </li><li><span>What I tried:</span> </li><li><span>I ran spy ware, I used Malewarebytes, Combofix, Housecall and all kinds of other programs. My Vista Business and Windows 7 Professional were hit hard as they are my most used for business and record keeping.</span></li><li><span>What I discovered”</span> </li><li><span>Hacker introduced a plethora of programs to maintain a stealth command. I discovered that my hard drives were partitioned into 4 hidden hard drives. Each hard drive had recycle programs that immediately replaces anything that I attempted to remove.</span></li><li><span>I discovered programs that trained TM to allow safe passage as legitimate. He has control through wireless and remote access, has control of IPv4 and IPv6, the list is too long.</span></li><li><span>Programs specifically altering the normal use of certain counter programs associated with UBCD, Hiren;s Boot CH, ERD Commander and the likes. Take for example if I want to run memtest, the “not en
 Windows 7 Pro that Hs 8 GB of memory.</span> </li><li><span>As stated earlier, the hidden partitions with multiple MBR and system folders is a clever set up that has me at a complete loss.</span></li><li><span>I tried to reformat, no avail, hackers commandeered the functionality of my computer. Hacker has set up firewalls preventing me from accessing the internet if I do not opt to share my folders on a network. I have changed the router settings to 128
 bit changed the Username and password from the generic to a complicated set of characters. Each time I did I was locked out from accessing the internet. Again, that explains why I have not got in touch with you sooner. As you can see, my hands are tied and
 I have to knowingly carry on as a spy watches my every move.</span> </li><li><span>I bought Partition Commander 11.0 and wiped out the Hard Drive, reformatted and again was held hostage from my own internet unless I include this hacker on the shared network. I have never shared any of my computers on a network and now I am at this
 persons mercy for now.</span> </li><li><span>After Partition Commander failed to merit the results I had hoped for I bought a new Hard Drive, formatted it, installed OS and had the hacker one step ahead,&nbsp;</span></li><li>I then bought new memory, Disk Utilities Professional which is a series of disk tools to wipe and repartition a new anti virus program and a new graphics card all in the name of wishful thinking, no luck. Each time I tried to rid the hacker he took more
 control over my computers functionality. Now he owns the BIOS on my computers. When I try something new the BIOS CPU fan speeds up like it’s going to fry the bearings,. As I try other things hacker disables USB ports so that I can not use my mouse or keyboard.
 He has fried a couple of my motherboards I suspect to show me that he is in control and it is true, the hacker is in control. I have the remaining computers rendered useless as he has total control of my BIOS, I can’t even change the settings on them as he
 has commandeered all attributes and rendered me merely a guest on my own PC’s.</li><li><span>He locked me out of my BIOS on my Lenovo Think Pad by requiring a password on system startup. I was able to get pass that through research and disassembling my laptop to disconnect the equivalency of a CMOS on a laptop and powering the laptop up with
 no battery power at all. Although I have use of my Lenovo I have a hacker who at any moment can take away any and all access at will.</span></li><li><span>I can’t flash the bios if the hacker disables all means of booting up to do it. The last thing that the hacker has done is to take control of my desktop monitor or graphics card. If I try to use Disk Wipe or any other tool that does not appeal to
 hacker, he will shut off my monitor.</span> </li><li><span>I know that this is no fault of Trend Micro’s, as far as I am concerned, TM has done it’s job. Sometimes a warning can be given and people can choose to ignore such warning or a 70 year old woman who is in love with this new technology (computers)
 and can’t yet differentiate the difference between spam, phishing, spy ware, etc..so with no malice or bad intent a decision to allow the lion into the den can impact the rigorous standards of good products like Trend Micro.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>I have tried so many things and different sequences and I seem to lose another computer in the process, I think the first thing that I need to do to combat this hacker is to reclaim my BIOS but that is a real puzzle.</span></li><li><span>Thanks for your time,</span> </li><li><span>Raymond</span> <span>ving problems with</span> </li><li>Error messages </li><li>Recent changes you made to your computer </li><li>What you have already tried to fix the problem </li><li><span>I have reinstalled O/s several times and now hacker arranged to have my copy of windows 7 pro appear as&nbsp;counterfeit.</span></li><li><span><br />
</span></li><li><span>I have blocked him from internet access by changing the wep and each time I did I too was prevented from using the internet.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span><br />
</span></li><li><span>Hacker manages to program spyware programs on the go to not detect any&nbsp;Trojans&nbsp;etc...I have seen him work his&nbsp;magic. Last night I deleted a bunch if ip&nbsp;WiFi&nbsp;hidden icons as I watched them vanish I watched the new&nbsp;downloads&nbsp;reinstall what I&nbsp;removed.&nbsp;</span>
</li></ul>
<div><span>ven though my O/S is listed as counterfeit my computer goes through tons of downloads presumably from Microsoft. I know better as hhacker is constantly upgrading his programming that counters anything I ever did. He is very good very impressive.</span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span>Although I reformat and do a disk wipe first his control is in effect immediately after I start newly formatted ZO/S for the&nbsp;first&nbsp;time.</span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span>I have turned off services and he has them programmed to restart on a 2 second timer. It is absolutley amazing to watch this guy work. I can have the router turned off, my wireless card removed from my desktop and still hacker manages to have contro;
 at wi;; over ,y files documents etc...\</span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span>Lots of hidden devices to include Media Player, Microphone,Beepp, Bubbles wifi control over all of ,y irq ports on Motherboard using my resources and managed to slow my computer down to a crawl. I have 8gb of memory.\ I have 3 visible icons on my
 available wireless network screen. I know for a fact that hackers icon is netgear but I also suspect that other two icons are his as well.</span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span>Please be careful if you e-mail because hacker screens my email and withholds email as well. Untill I can regaon controll I have no need to change my password as he has most likely some very awesome keylogger program monitoring me too.</span></div>

            Sorry to hear it.&nbsp; If you can't get into the console dashboard then you may need to do a factory reset on the console.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please try power cycling the console by holding the power button on it for 10 seconds till&nbsp; it shuts down.&nbsp; Then unplug it for 30 seconds.&nbsp;
 When you power on quickly hold the Sync button (left side near the USB port on the original Xbox One and just below the power button on the S and X consoles) and the Eject button for the console until you hear a second start up noise.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You should now see a new screen.&nbsp; Scroll over to Restart/Reset and reset the console to factory settings.&nbsp; There is an option to keep installed games and apps so you won't need to redownload them.

</p><blockquote>Sorry to hear it.&nbsp; If you can't get into the console dashboard then you may need to do a factory reset on the console.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please try power cycling the console by holding the power button on it for 10 seconds
 till&nbsp; it shuts down.&nbsp; Then unplug it for 30 seconds.&nbsp; When you power on quickly hold the Sync button (left side near the USB port on the original Xbox One and just below the power button on the S and X consoles) and the Eject button for the console until you
 hear a second start up noise.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You should now see a new screen.&nbsp; Scroll over to Restart/Reset and reset the console to factory settings.&nbsp; There is an option to keep installed games and apps so you won't need to redownload them.

<p>OK,</p>
<p>Firstly, I was Referring to the mobile Xbox app which after I log in, keeps saying "Sorry, something went wrong. give it another try, or try on Xbox.com". (It is an Xbox 360 Account).</p>
<p>Secondly, I was talking about Minecraft PE, which i somewhat got working, but on my main WiFi connection I launch the app then it says "Signing into Xbox Live Account" it will then last for a few seconds leading to Everything Freezing. But on Other WiFi,
 it works fine with no issues at all. (The other WiFi isn't always accessible as it is a friends WiFi).</p>
<p>[Sorry if i sounded Rude]</p>
<p>Please Reply As Soon As Possible,</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hey there Blake!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're experiencing problems with getting signed into Minecraft PE.
</p>
<p>Since this is the pocket edition, I would say some of the best thing for you to try would be to uninstall and then reinstall the game back to your phone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work, then try maybe restarting the phone. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Give those steps a shot and let us know how that helped in resolution of your issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Much thanks!</p>

<p>After you started a new game did you save over your previous save? Unfortunately if you saved over that, you would be unable to access it and would need to play through the game again.</p>

<p>The same thing happened to me!&nbsp; I'm talking weeks and weeks of progress all lost.&nbsp; I'm not playing the game ever again if there's nothing that can be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read the numerous posts on reddit of people offering their save files for the PC.&nbsp; But as far as I understand it, even if I take my xbox one usb3 external hard drive to a PC, the filesystem is proprietary and I would not be able to drop a save file
 on there.</p>
<p>I thought everything was supposed to back up to the cloud?&nbsp; There is a reddit post for a PS4 system that links to a page showing how to download the ps4 cloud save back to the console.&nbsp; It fixed the guys problem.&nbsp; I can't figure out any way how to access
 my xbox live saves to download them back to the console.&nbsp; All my achievements and gamer scores are there from this game.&nbsp; Shouldn't that be enough proof that I've been playing?&nbsp; Why is SquareEnix insisting I start over?</p>

<h2>            Xbox game Fable on Xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am currently trying to play the disc version of Fable on my Xbox 360.&nbsp; It's the console with about 200 GB.&nbsp; I get a message that says up top "This original Xbox game has encountered a..." and at bottom "This original Xbox game has not been c..."&nbsp; The message
 tells me it's not supported and that an update may be available via the info on xbox.com/games to support it.&nbsp; There was an update for my console there that I was not able to update automatically via USB or CD.&nbsp; How do I get my Xbox 360 to play Fable?</p>

<p>The storage space on the hard drive is not the issue. Official MS hard drives have the emulation software on them that is required to run original Xbox games. If the hard drive is not official, it will not work.</p>

<p>The only other thing to try would be to try playing another original Xbox game. If that works then it's an issue with the game itself. If it doesn't work, then it's most likely a hard drive issue.</p>

<p>FYI</p>
<p>The store employee where I bought the XBox360 from claims there are only Microsoft XBox360 consoles and gave me a helpful number (18004MYXBOX) where I discovered that the Xbox live service is free and obtained the download to play the Fable game after I
 signed up wholly.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 Professional 64-Bit Conquest Frontier Wars Compatibility</h2>
                    I have Conquest: Frontier Wars set up on my computer (HP Elitebook 2760p), using Windows 8 Pro 64-Bit. I'm trying to run it, but it opens, loads, and tries to go fullscreen (its default setting), and then it crashes. (default "Conquest has stopped working"
 message). I tried running it under XP SP3 and Vista SP2 compatibility settings, since I know it worked on both of those, but it still crashed. Anybody able to suggest different settings that could make it work?

<h2>            My 1TB External Hard Disk Drive has been reduced to 31.9 GB after I downloaded the Win 10 Media Creation Tool</h2>
                    <p>This is a big problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I downloaded the Media Creation Tool for Windows 10 and I have inadvertently downloaded it to my 1 TB External Hard Drive.
<br />
The 1 TB content was missing from this Hard Disk Drive and it showed Drive now reads as ESD-USB (F Drive) and shows only 31.9 GB<br />
I decided to Format this Drive.</p>
<p>However, even after Formatting this Drive, it reads as ESD-USB (on F Drive) and shows only 31.9 GB<br />
Below is the Screenshot</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/777561a3-037a-4cdb-a938-93f4aa7c500e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/777561a3-037a-4cdb-a938-93f4aa7c500e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I Right-Clicked the Drive and went to Properties and in Properties I find that it shows that the Drive is named ‘Imation Apollo M300’ and also shows that it has a volume of almost 1 TB.<br />
Below are two Screenshots</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f2265b6-6781-4741-869a-fffb3df6c916?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f2265b6-6781-4741-869a-fffb3df6c916?upload=true" /></a></p>

            Use diskpart to clean the entire drive - this will mean you’ll lose everything on the drive.
<br />Open cmd prompt/powershell with admin &amp; type:
<br />Diskpart &amp; press enter
<br />List disk then press enter
<br />Select disc x where x is the number of the external hard drive you wish to clean.
<br />Type Clean &amp; click enter
<br />Once completed type exit &amp; click enter.
<br />Then go to disk management under control panel &amp; it should pop up stating the drive needs initialising/formatting, Choose to do so &amp; it should then show the full capacity.
<br />If not then try a third party software: EaseUS partition manager:

<p>Hi Imtiaz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have formatted your hard disk it may have lost its allocation properties and would be no longer visible with the other Hard Disk Drives in 'This PC'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make it visible you will have to follow the below mentioned steps: <em>(make sure your external hard disk is connected)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open Start</p>
<p>2. Type - Create and format hard disk partitions</p>
<p>3. Open it</p>
<p>4. At the bottom of the open program you should be seeing your external hard disk with a long black colored line</p>
<p>5. Right Click on it and Select 'New Simple Volume'</p>
<p>6. Thereafter a Dialog box should appear asking what kind of setting you would like to apply to your external hard disk, select accordingly (make sure to keep the File System to NTFS).</p>
<p>7. After clicking apply you should be able to see your external hard disk along with other hard drives in 'This PC'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>

            <p>Where did you look for it in the registry. It's only a partial key displayed. You'll find it here if it exists.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility</em></p>

<em>Paste</em>).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Then configure the command prompt. Right click the Command Prompt's titlebar -
<em>Properties</em> - <em>Layout</em> tab - and enter 1000 for <em>Screen Buffer Size Height</em> and 43 (or 50) for

<p>If the key exists right click it - <em>Permissions</em>. Click each user and see what each user can do. Also repeat for the parent key (<em>ActiveX Compatibility)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While you can see what happens if you attempt to access the key in regedit I can't. So try this in&nbsp;the command prompt. Also note how we can abbreviate the beginnings of long key names (the other two abbreviations are HKCU and HKCR).</p>

            <p>Office appears to have prettied up the actual error message. This is the Windows Installer version</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could not write value [2] to key [3]. System error [4].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(with 2 being replace with the value, 3 with the key name, and 4 with the Windows error)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your office translated error message doesn't mention 2 (not that we care), mentions 3, and for the error mentions permissions (error 5 - Access Denied). I don't know if it's a translation of error 5 or a general thing they always say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a log file somewhere that will tell you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is for office XP</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Most Laptop has a Physical swtich that can switch Om and Off the Wireless card.</p>
<p>Check the Laptop manual and make sure that your Wireless card is On.</p>
<p><strong>Maybe this can further&nbsp; Help.</strong></p>
<p>Check the Device Manager for valid Wireless card entry.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a></p>
<p>If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wireless card's Drivers.</p>
<p>Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Wireless Network Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Make sure that if there is a vendor's Wireless Utility the utility is Not Running together with the Windows native Wireless utility.</strong></p>
<p>Make sure that No Firewall is preventing/blocking the Wireless components to get to the Network.</p>
<p>If everything above is OK and it is not connecting to the Wireless router. Log from any computer that is, or can be connected to Wireless Router with a Wire, disable the Wireless Security, make sure that the Wireless broadcast is On, and try to connect with
 No Wireless security.</p>
<p><strong>When working turn On the Wireless security.</strong></p>
<p>Note* People sometimes make mistakes in writing and retyping the security passphrase.</p>
<p>Alternative way is to copy it from the Router's menu, and then paste when asked by the Wireless card.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>-------------</p>
<p>The following pages were<em> </em>written for Win XP some terms, and menu location are different in Win 7.&nbsp; However, they depict the principles of the Wireless working in computers running Windows OS', and can serve as a fast education to understand the
 basic of the Wireless computers working.</p>

    <title>Windows Remote Desktop 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> calebhoolihan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Remote Desktop 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have a problem with using the latest RDT version. We use mac computers here (groan, not my decision lol) and the older version of remote desktop (8) works fine. But that is going to be decommissioned in the near future, so we are going to need to switch
 to Version 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using RDT to load an accounting software called avionte. For some reason as you load avionte in remote desktop it just minimizes&nbsp;the session. The only way to get it back is to right click the RDT icon and maximum the session back up. Obviously we
 can work around that, but its rather irritating. Any ideas on why the new version does that?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Caleb</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>

<p>Enter the email address that the child/member uses to sign in to the system, then select

<p>The child/member will need to accept the invitation from their emails.</p>

<h2>            Intel&#40;R&#41; USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller - 1.0 &#40;Microsoft&#41; waking computer</h2>
                    <p>I see many posts on this subject and no solutions.&nbsp; When the computer wakes, (from an administrator's cmd prompt) I enter "powercfg -lastwake" and get to see it was&nbsp;Intel(R) USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller - 1.0 (Microsoft) that was the culprit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have tried the command from the administrator's command prompt:&nbsp; powercfg -devicedisablewake "Intel(R) USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller - 1.0 (Microsoft)".&nbsp; I get in turn, "you do not have permission to enable or disable wake".</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no settings in device manager for this device that will solve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen comments that I do not have a high enough level of "administrator"&nbsp; so I created a pure administrator user but that didn't do anything different.&nbsp; This problem appears to be around for a couple of years with no fix.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel has not created new drivers for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a solution?</p>

<p>2. Does the computer restart when using any particular program or game?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to reinstall the graphics/display card driver and check if it helps.</p>

</li><li>
<p>Click the '<span>Driver'</span> tab, click '<span>Uninstall'</span>,</p>
