<h2>            Is there a way to create a clickable checkbox that is not linked to the tags</h2>
                    I wanted to setup&nbsp;a simple checklist system that I would use for archiving purposes. When I use the checklist tag, it creates a searchable unique tag for every instance which I use for simple identification. By using it in this manner, I would quickly
 overload the tagging system to the point that it would be useless for me. Is there a way I could insert a clickable checkbox that would do nothing more than insert a checkmark when clicked?

<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In OneNote the check boxes are always used for To-Do. You may however, choose to insert check-boxes from the Developer tab in OneNote. For this you need to enable
 the Developer tab from <strong>File &gt; Options &gt; Customize Ribbon &gt;</strong> select
<strong>Developer</strong> in the <strong>Customize the Ribbon</strong> column <strong>
&gt; OK</strong>. You can choose to add Check-box controls from Controls group in the Developer tab.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope the above information helps.

<h2>            Microsoft Edge White Screen Issue on Page Refresh&#47;Ctrl&#43;F5&#47;F5 for SharePoint Online Publishing Sites</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are facing issues while loading the pages of SharePoint online publishing site.</p>
<p>We have a customized the OOB Seattle master page. It has few links to the CSS/JS files stored in the centralized site collection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are further loading some custom fonts within the CSS files added in the master page.<br />
</p>
<p>Its been observed that the page is loading properly on first load, but when we refresh it (i.e.&nbsp;F5), its taking longer time as compared to first page load. Also the pages seems to be hung with white screen for almost 10 second, there is no activity on the
 screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On further analysis of the network traffic we found that, for page refresh, its checking for the freshness of each file by again firing a GET request to the source, and after getting 304 response it loads from the cache. This over head is the reason behind
 the white screen issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to ask what can we do to resolve this issue i.e. directly load CSS/JS/Images/Fonts from the cache instead of checking from the GET request from the Server. It is happening only in IE Edge, Working Fine in Google Chrome.</p>
<p>

    <title>Automatically copy as plain text in Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mithrandir107  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automatically copy as plain text in Word</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am taking a JavaScript class and my teacher often has assignments that require copying code out of Word and pasting into a code editor such as JSFiddle. However, the code seems to gain some invisible illegal characters when pasting directly from Word that
 makes the code fail to run. A workaround I have been using is to paste the text into Notepad and then copy it again, and then pasting it again into JSFiddle. This works, but I was wondering if there is a way to set Word to automatically copy all text as plain
 text. Is this possible?</p>
<p>Thanks!<br />

            I don't know of any way to do this. As a workaround, save the entire Word document as Plain Text, open in NotePad and paste directly from there. It will save a little time.

<p><br />
That's because it is not malware. According to the post I marked as the answer, it is part of the extraction and definition updates. The referenced Prevx detection is that it is apparently being classified by Prevx. You saw the file yourself, without running
 Prevx.</p>
<p>On my Win7 machine, the folder is there today, as well. Right clicking the file reveals the properties and shows that it is part of the updater and signed by Microsoft.</p>
<p>If you are concerned that there is undetected malware, then follow the instructions in my prior reply.</p>

    <title>Interrupted Insider install at 98&#37; has left machine in very odd - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gordontwatts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Interrupted Insider install at 98&#37; has left machine in very odd state</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp; TL;DR: Insider update hung &amp; interrupted at 98%, machine in a very odd state, is it possible to roll back to previous insider build?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; The latest windows update has failed on my machine. I'd love to know if there is a way to roll back. First, here are the symptoms:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>During the update, it got stuck at 98% for over 24 hours</li><li>I hit the machine's reset button and it rebooted</li><li>Rebooting, shutting off and turning on, etc., do not change the below behaviors.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The following happens anytime I try to log in, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am able to give it the proper password for my main account and get in. But Windows Hello is not working (I had a fingerprint reader successfully setup)</li><li>After a few seconds of the please wait prompt, it turns to "Preparing Desktop". From there it logs in and presents me with a dialog box that says that desktop is not accessible at "c:\windows\system32\config\systemprofile\Desktop"</li><li>None of the taskbar buttons work - the windows button, the action center button, the search/Cortana button.</li><li>No short-cut keys work (e.g. windows-I to bring up settings).</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>So, I thought I'd try to invoke a rollback to the previous insider build. Of course, to do that, you need the settings app (at least, as far as I can tell). So, I started exploring further:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I can't get the windows start menu open to invoke a restart with the shift key</li><li>alt-cntl-del gives me the power icon in the lower right of the screen, and from there I can select restart, and hold down the shift key. I then get the advanced/recovery options.</li><li>I tried going back to a previous restore point - but there are no restore points (which makes some sense given it just installed the latest windows insider build)</li><li>I tried rolling back a stability update, but there was no update to roll back.</li><li>I tried rolling back the latest feature update, but an unknown error occurred, and so it didn't update</li><li>start-up repair found nothing wrong.</li></ul>
<p>I was prepared to just do a reset and keep-my-files at this point. But I decided to take a look around with the command line tool first.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I was surprised to find I was on disk mounted to drive-letter X. And on disk X there is *nothing* but a windows installation. It could be that the reboot into recovery is what caused this - so I'm on a different partition.</li><li>Using the "wmic logical disk get caption" command I saw a list of all the disks on my system. They are there, tho the drive letters are assigned in sequential order rather than the order I'd assigned them.</li><li>diskpart's "list vol" shows all my disks with the proper letter assignments.</li><li>The drive mounted against "C:" is my system disk.</li><li>C: contains a Windows.old folder in there which has 6/15 as a creation date (there are some older ones as well). I have no idea how complete the Windows.old folder is, but given it got to 98% it looks like the upgrade probably made the Windows.old file
 correctly.</li></ul>
<p>Now that I've seen the "x:" disk and the c: disk I'm pretty confused as to what is going on. It feels like the upgrade process got stuck, I interrupted it, and it didn't automatically rollback (which has happened the one or two times I've done this over
 the course of the insider program).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to recover this machine. I won't lose any data if I don't, but a significant amount of setup will get lost which will take a long time to recover. But this is an insider machine, so I'm "ready" for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get this going? Given I'm sitting on "x" I'm now nervous to do the reset option even. But something that would trigger the rollback would also be awesome. I've touched nothing (other than a few reboots) so I can
 access other information if you tell me how!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp; Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Desktop.</li><li>It is home built, UDR3x mobo, about 8 or 9 years old. The system disk is 240 GB or there abouts, has 38 GB free, is an SSD. It has three 6 TB disks attached, in a storage pool supplying several disk mounts, along with a second SSD to provide high speed
 caching for the pool.</li><li>WIndows Home Pro</li><li>I do not know what build - it was the latest minus one. I can't hit the win key at this point, or anything else (see explanation above).</li><li>I'm trying to get the build that was released on Friday. In fact, I'm pretty sure it is mostly installed, as I said before, and hung at the end.</li><li>For a detailed explanation of where it is happening, etc., please see above. I can log in, but the desktop is not found, rendering the UI almost useless.</li><li>I don't have error codes that are exposed in this UI. I did not try to look at the event log as I don't know how to do it with text.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I hope this helps! -Gordon.</p>

<p>Sorry, I entirely missed you are running an Insider Build.</p>
<p>On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.<br />
Create a USB Flash Drive<br />
https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html<br />
Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.<br />

https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21284-enable-disable-fast-boot-uefi-firmware-settings-windows.html<br />
Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.<br />

Try doing a Reset from there</p>

<p>Thanks, Sumit!</p>
<p>
</p><p>On that page with all those options you pointed me to - I can use option 2. Is that good enough? Or is it important to create a USB stick?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, it sounds like you are directing me to "reset" the PC, which, of course, will loose all my installed programs and settings, is that right? I was, of course, hoping to avoid that. :-)</p>

<p>Little trick;</p>
<p>If you have not cleaned it out before doing a clean install or reset do this; copy the Download Folder in File Explorer to a USB or another drive on the disk.&nbsp; Then use it to install the downloaded programs rather than wandering all over the Internet to
 download the programs again.</p>

<p>Indeed. I was really hoping the script command line install stuff was going to catch on. Then I could just do the install from a script. Better yet, if most utilities were in the store, I could then have a list of things I wanted on each box, comment out
 what I didn't want, let it rip...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd need Visual Studio in the store, however... :-)</p>

<p>No, you must create a USB stick. There is a significant difference in running repair from USB and WinRE(Option2)</p>

</p><p>That says you booted in a command only mode to a RAM drive.&nbsp; You can use&nbsp; diskpart&nbsp; to find your real drive.&nbsp; You shouldn't just guess that it will be given a C: for its letter in that state but I suppose it has to be if the registry would be of any use

<h2>            Chromebook</h2>
                    I am a college student, and my Chromebook is all I have access to. My classes require certain features for Microsoft Word, Excel, and Powerpoint that are not available on Chromebooks. This is very frustrating. A Chromebook is the most affordable option
 for most college students, especially students like me who are also&nbsp;single parents. There needs to be more features available for Chromebooks. The fact that the current features are very limited is infuriating. I was given a Chromebook as a gift because it
 was believed a Chromebook was perfect for college.&nbsp;

<h2>            IPOD and Ford Sync</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello All.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I purchased a new Ford Focus equipped with the SYNC system this week and am having problems getting it to see my ipod.&nbsp; When I plug in the USB cable, and press the AUX button, it displays "Sync Line In" as the only option.&nbsp; I then tried going
 to the Media Menu and selecting the source as "Sync USB" but it displays "USB Empty".&nbsp; After monkeying around with it awhile, I got it to work.&nbsp; The next day I plugged in the ipod and again it would not work, and this time I can't get it to work at all!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the&nbsp;SYNC website, my ipod&nbsp;video&nbsp;is recommended and is supposed to be highly compatible.&nbsp; Any ideas on what to try?</p>

 indexing and how USB devices interact with WINDOWS.&nbsp; It's not based on VID/PID, SN, because those are hard coded.&nbsp; Problem with your IPOD (I have&nbsp;a&nbsp;IPOD VIDEO&nbsp;as well and it is working) is you can't really wipe it and start over.&nbsp; You'd think the IPOD would

 SYNC is indexing and how USB devices interact with WINDOWS.&nbsp; It's not based on VID/PID, SN, because those are hard coded.&nbsp; Problem with your IPOD (I have&nbsp;a&nbsp;IPOD VIDEO&nbsp;as well and it is working) is you can't really wipe it and start over.&nbsp; You'd think the IPOD
 would be the greater problem.&nbsp; Other things to try are performing a factory reset on SYNC.&nbsp; This is doen in the system settings menu.&nbsp; More extreme is the master Reset, but this will require you to start from scratch on everything SYNC does.&nbsp; Since there is
 minimal documentation for troubleshooting, I don't really know where else to go.&nbsp; Please let me know if you find a solution.&nbsp; Nothing about this makes sense.&nbsp; The same thumb drive functions perfectly everywhere else.&nbsp; Simpy formatting the drive does not correct
 my problem.&nbsp; Somehow SYNC is not properly disconneting devices which is creating havoc only with itself.</blockquote>

</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are referring to changing your Skype Name, we do not have an option to do it. Changing Skype Name has never been possible in Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you are referring to changing your display name, or the name that shows on your contacts' end, it is possible. To change it, just follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to your Skype application.</li><li>Click your profile icon.</li><li>Click the settings icon.</li><li>Tap the name displayed on the page.</li><li>Rename your account's display name.</li></ol>

<p>I have exactly the same problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I have an outlook.com and a hotmail.com email address</p>
<p>- I have full access from my Mac email client, iPhone and iPad client</p>
<p>
</p><p>- however, when I go to the URL http://outlook.com, as of the other day my Chrome browser started sending me to the wrong login page, which is titled Windows Live Custom Domains, where above the email address and password entry boxes it says clearly "Work
 or school account"</p>
<p>- when I try to login there with either of my addresses, it responds with "<span style="color: rgba(226, 41, 16, 1)">outlook.com isn't in our
 system"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>- this does not happen when I use Safari to go to this same URL, http://outlook.com; there I get the regular login page and I can get my email no problem</p>
<p>- this is pretty strange - clearly browser-related - do I need to clear my Chrome cookies or something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise...</p>

            <p>Hi Kerekes,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gee, just a little more detail would have been really helpful, but since you posted in this forum I'm going to provide the troubleshooting response for this error code as it relates to MSE.&nbsp; If you mean something else, please see this
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/555375" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/555375</a>&nbsp;and then post back with additional details as explained in that article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now to deal with this error&nbsp; in MSE:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>0x80070005 is an Access is Denied error this is because either an application or executable does not have the necessary elevation to invoke a specific action. One possibility is you are trying to do this or did the update or installation as a standard user
 instead of as an Administrator - especially if you are using XP. Login to an Admininstrator account to proceed. This is not always required and I'm not sure about your circumstances or configuration or operation system, but given that error we should err on
 the side of cautiion and use the Administrator account here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's start with some possible troubleshooting ideas and solutions from others who also experienced this error code:</p>

<p>Please see if the answer in the following thread helps: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/error-code-0x80070005/1e5cc042-2fcc-4ca1-a489-b44b1343e224">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not try the answer and the other suggestion in this thread: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/0x80070005/563455d4-5ec5-4e8f-a8d3-b6a4005b189d">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/0x80070005/563455d4-5ec5-4e8f-a8d3-b6a4005b189d</a>. It is similar to the above, but includes another link which may apply depending on your version of Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point if the above did not work, let's do a complete troubleshooting process to try to identify the cause and the solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE<span>.</span><span>This means not only current
 ones but any EVER (including free trials you may never have used) or done years ago and possibly forgotten. See the following compliments of Dave__M:<strong><span>If you aren't sure of what may still be on your system as remnants, which could be interfering
 with the MSE install, try a scan of your system with this security application detection and removal specialist:</span></strong></span><a href="http://www.appremover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://www.appremover.com/</span></strong></a>.<span>Do
 not yet remove the one primary AV program you are using until you have downloaded the MSE file so you are protected while doing so – then uninstall and remove that program after the download but before beginning to install MSE.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install “McAfee Security Scanner”, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally
 installed McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the
 PC and like any battery can eventually run down).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify if MSE is already installed that Windows Defender is disabled (Vista or W7) or uninstalled (XP).If not, please do so as this is a classic cause of conflict-related problems.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Then, if anything changed, restart your PC.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try a clean boot (Vista and W7) <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a> (except for MSE). If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem. Follow the procedures in the article. Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it. Once
 done be sure to reset your system back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work. If using XP, see<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a>
 and<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, uninstall and re-install MSE. To uninstall MSE, proceed as follows:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</a>
 or<span>try </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install or re-install MSE, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4</a>-
 but also check out the next paragraph before you begin the download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed after downloading MSE but before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing
 of removal tools<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.<span> </span>You cannot just uninstall these programs – you MUST also use the removal tool – even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn’t use a removal tool at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> and click on more languages and versions and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the desktop (rather than running
 it). When finished, uninstall and remove any remaining AV program you retained for protections during the download and then reboot.Then right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you’re logged in as an administrator) as I’ve
 found this sometimes helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is as safe
 as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine and
 save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on MAPS and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining the
 infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the MAPS database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, then there's a good chance you may be infected by malware. Please proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full ESET online scan: <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>. This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Start here - </span><a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</span></a><span>and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected. Options will vary
 by region, but phone support leads you to Microsoft Answer Desk (</span><a href="http://www.answerdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.answerdesk.com/</span></a><span>)<b> in the US at this time.</b> After an initial free consultation, a fee will be
 charged for assistance, based on the details of the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can start here: </span><a href="https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/</span></a><span> (which will also lead to the paid support options if you are in the US)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In other regions not served by the link above, go here: </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://Support.microsoft.com/security</span></a><span>and go to the “assisted support” or contact us menu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the above is too expensive and you'd like some free options (though they can take days or a week or so before getting a response and then more days going back and forth in a forum environment - and though the quality of help you get is generally
 good, the level of expertise of the person assigned to your case is pretty much the luck of the draw - but that's the "price" of free options), here are some free malware-removal forums:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>********************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If malware was found and removed, then you need to again uninstall and re-install MSE as it will never work properly if installed on an infected system (which we didn’t know at the time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, one of these solutions (or a step in one of these answers) will resolve the problem. If not, then open a support case describing the problem starting at:<a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</b></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

    <title>My WM5 disconnects after synch.. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> farhan arain  say:</h3>
<h2>            My WM5 disconnects after synch..</h2>
                    Running WM5 phone, trying to connect via Windows Mobile Center 6.1 on Vista..<br />
<br />
My phone will connect, WMC6.1 syncs the data.. all well up until this point. However, right after synching, the phone disconnects. WMC6.1 status shows disconnected, and I can't access the device or install any software to it, even though its connected to the
 USB port, and is still charging.<br />
<br />
My laptop with XP is still connecting fine with AS4.5, and the device stays "Connected" until I remove the USB cable.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated..<br />
<br />
Farhan.<br />

<p>I'm not sure why that happens but I have experienced it with one of my devices.&nbsp; It syncs then disconnects and yet another device will sync and remained connected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I've been doing is disconnecting the device and reconnecting.&nbsp; Once it's re-connected, I have been able to go into WMDC and use the file manager (or what ever I've wanted to do).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What device are you using?</p>

            I'm using Imate Jamin (WM5).. actually it connects, syncs and disconnects within 30 seconds or so.. so its rather hard to go into the explorer window.<br />
<br />
What exactly is WMDC? Windows Mobile Device Center?<br />

    <title>Corrupted hyperlinks in Excel 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jbettison  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupted hyperlinks in Excel 2010</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I have a periodic nightmarish situation where my 1000+ hyperlinks in a very large spreadsheet (MSExcel 2010) are all changed from expressing a location in my Documents folder to a location in the AppData folder. Neither the spreadsheet nor the files they
 are linked to have ever been moved or encrypted. </p>
<p>I've run the following two macros, but the hyperlinks' text remains unchanged. This happens once, sometimes twice in a calendar year, and even it can never be understood why Excel would automatically change all my hyperlinks, I would be less tempted to Trebuchet
 my computer into the next county if there were a simple solution to fix it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The first, which I found on another website is:</p>
<p>Sub AppDataCorrection()<br />
Dim lnkH As Hyperlink<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim sOld As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim sNew As String<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sOld = "file:///C:\Users\MyName\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sNew = "file:///C:\Users\MyName\Documents\FolderW\"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each lnkH In ActiveSheet.Hyperlinks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lnkH.Address = Replace(lnkH.Address, sOld, sNew)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lnkH.TextToDisplay = Replace(lnkH.TextToDisplay, sOld, sNew)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second, based on macro code for a similar problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub FixHyperlinks()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim wks As Worksheet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim hl As Hyperlink<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim sOld As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim sNew As String<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set wks = ActiveSheet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sOld = "file:///C:\Users\MyName\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sNew = "file:///C:\Users\MyName\Documents\FolderW\"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each hl In wks.Hyperlinks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hl.Address = Replace(hl.Address, sOld, sNew)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next hl<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither of these worked. Save me. </p>

            <p>I don't know why the macros don't work for you (assuming the worksheet containing all the hyperlinks is active when you run the macro).&nbsp; Do you get an error message?&nbsp; If so hit Debug and tell us what the message was and what the Address and TextToDisplay
 properties of the hyperlink were.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to why the change happens, I would guess that one of the following happened:</p>
<p>a) You received a copy of the spreadsheet as an email attachment, opened it in Outlook and saved it to its usual folder</p>
<p>b) You opened a "Recovered" version of the spreadsheet after an Excel crash and saved it back to its usual folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hyperlinks can be either absolute or relative.&nbsp; By default if the destination of the hyperlink is in the same folder as the workbook containing the hyperlink, or a sub-folder thereof, the hyperlink will be created as relative.&nbsp; You can then move the set
 of files as a group (or access them from a different drive letter or path) and the hyperlinks will still work.&nbsp; But if you Save As to a different folder the hyperlinks become absolute to the folder you opened the workbook from.&nbsp; In scenarios (a) and (b) the
 file you opened was in an AppData folder when you opened it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your hyperlinks had all been absolute this would not have been a problem - though you would lose the ability to move all the files as a set and have them still work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can force all hyperlinks to be absolute by setting the master workbook's Hyperlink Base property.&nbsp; File &gt; Info &gt; Show All Properties and it's about the 10th line down on the right hand side.&nbsp; Set it to
\\NoServer\NoFolder (for example).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can build your hyperlinks using the HYPERLINK worksheet function:</p>
<p>If the path to the files is in a cell named Path =HYPERLINK(Path &amp; "\ThisFile.xls","ThisFile")</p>
<p>You can then change the expected location of the files by changing the Path cell's contents, and the problem of the links changing by themselves will not occur.</p>

<h3> ghostwheel00  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t see emoticons in conversation in Skype for Business Basic in Window 10 Pro</h2>
                    <p>About a dozen of us got new computers, all identical&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dell Optiplex 7050</p>
<p>Intel i7-7700 3.6GHz</p>
<p>32 GB RAM</p>
<p>64 bit</p>
<p>Windows 10 pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also upgraded to office 365 for all machines and use Skype for Business Basic.</p>
<p>We can see the emoticons in the drop down.</p>
<p>We can see the emoticons when put one in when we type our message.</p>
<p>When we send our message, the emoticons do not show in the conversation on either end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling, reinstalling, un checking boxes, logging out, rechecking boxes,&nbsp; deleting all information except the tracing folder, flushing the DNS, if there was a possible solution on the internet, I tried it in various combinations. All I
 have left is to think that if Skype For Business needs to access some external website for the emoticons to appear in the messages, maybe our blocking software is blocking that site. I know I can't get the Skype symbol to appear in my office 365 on a browser.
 We miss our emoticons because we work on several floors, take laptops into meetings, and it isn't always possible to talk in person or on the phone. A sentence can be taken several ways without the proper emoticon sometimes. In fact, I tried to send (6) to
 someone and it ended up (Devil) when they got it, but I couldn't see that it was thinking that was an emoticon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if the emoticons must be accessed at a website, or what that website might be? Are there any more suggestions on how to get these little guys to appear in the conversations?</p>

            Hi Ghostwheel00,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your post. According to your description, the emoticons are unable to view well in the conversation of Skype for Business Basic. In this case, we suggest you try to repair Skype for Business Basic client by following steps:<br />
<br />
1. Open Control Panel.<br />
2. Click <strong>Uninstall a program</strong> under <strong>Programs</strong>.<br />
3. Right-Click your installed Skype for Business Basic product and click <strong>
Change</strong>.<br />
4. Restart your computer after the repair process is complete.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/560d97c1-2824-487e-84fb-cca34d3f784a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/560d97c1-2824-487e-84fb-cca34d3f784a?upload=true" /></a><br />
<br />
Besides, you can try to launch Skype for Business <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-windows-pc-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
in safe mode</a> to check if it can work well:<br />
<br />
1. Open the Run command dialog (Simultaneously press <strong>Windows logo</strong> and
<strong>R </strong>keys on your keyboard).<br />
2. Type “Lync /safe” (be sure to add a <strong>space</strong> between “Lync” and” /safe”).<br />
3. click <strong>OK</strong> to open Skype for Business in safe mode.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, to further look into it, we need to collect some information:<br />
<br />
1. As you use the hidden emoticons like “(6)”, please check if you can use the standard emoticons by clicking smiling face related icon near the send icon.<br />
2. If possible, could you please provide us the related screenshots to clarify it?<br />
3. What’s the detailed version information of your Skype for Business Basic client?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jay<br />

<p>Note: Fixed the images. I was on Chrome, so images were not allowed to be uploaded I guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. I want to clarify that it's not that we can't see them
<strong>well</strong> in conversations, we cannot see them <strong>at all.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>As I previously stated, I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, and change&gt;repair as those are both solutions available on the internet, with no luck. Safe mode makes no difference, either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To respond to your request for information:</p>
<p>1) To&nbsp; reiterate,<strong>&nbsp;NO</strong>&nbsp;emoticons appear in the&nbsp;<strong>CONVERSATION</strong>. I can see them in the pop-up (as you see below), I can select one and see it as I type my message, but when I click the send button, the emoticon is not in the conversation.
 Not on my screen, not on the receiver's screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was not trying to use a hidden emoticon. Please note the the Devil emoticon is clearly in the standard set. And that was an accident, not intended, as I said.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cab89c9e-bd74-4e95-8666-c0142e76638a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cab89c9e-bd74-4e95-8666-c0142e76638a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Conversation looked like this after each message was sent:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/712654c0-1d37-4052-991d-5c09b45de15c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/712654c0-1d37-4052-991d-5c09b45de15c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>If I copy and paste the lines, they look like this because we did put emoticons in our messages:</p>
<p>[‎4/‎12/‎2018 5:38 PM]&nbsp;<br />
:)<br />
: )</p>
<p>YES!!!!&nbsp; <em>(The 'YES!!!!' was because he was able to get a colon and paren with a space in it to make a rudimentary smiley)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>[‎4/‎13/‎2018 9:52 AM]&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Do you see your icons in your message? I don't :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>[‎4/‎13/‎2018 9:53 AM]&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
nope<br />
I see nothing<br />

<p>Hi Ghostwheel00,,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, please open <strong>Skype for Business &gt; Options &gt; IM &gt; check the Show emoticons in messages</strong>. Then check if it works. For your reference:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7ab792a8-9f25-46c0-bdf9-15e5f2d10036?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7ab792a8-9f25-46c0-bdf9-15e5f2d10036?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, please go to <strong>Control Panel &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Ease of Access Center &gt; Make the computer easier to see</strong>. Then uncheck the
<strong>Turn off all unnecessary annimations</strong>. And please let me know if there any update.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply, Carlos. I must admit, I am a bit dismayed that all I am getting in response are the standard answers that are on the internet and I have already tried.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have tried:&nbsp;<span>open&nbsp;</span><span>Skype for Business &gt; Options &gt; IM &gt; check the Show emoticons in messages.</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;We have tried that with and without the "Turn off Emoticons Animations" box checked.
 No emoticons in the chat for sender or the receiver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have also tried:<span>Control Panel &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Ease of Access Center &gt; Make the computer easier to see</span><span>. Then uncheck the&nbsp;</span><span>Turn off all unnecessary animations</span><span>.&nbsp;</span>All
 we get for that is the checkbox for "Turn Off Emoticons Animations is grayed out and cannot be enabled. No emoticons in the chat for the sender or the receiver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't now ask me to delete my Skype for Business cache. I have already done that. Twice. These are the steps followed:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the gear in top right-hand corner.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose File – Sign Out to log out of Skype for Business.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Sign In window, choose the link to Delete my sign-in info.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the pop-up window to forget sign in info, click Yes.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the gear, choose File&gt; Exit to exit and close Skype.<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to the location:<br />
&nbsp;C:\Users\<span>&lt;username&gt;\</span>AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locate the sip_YourProfileName folder and delete it.<br />
Open the Tracing folder and delete all files in in it. Do not delete the Tracing folder itself.<br />
If you receive a message that the action can't be completed because a file is Open or that you need Administrator permission to delete a file, click the Skip button.<br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open a command prompt (in Windows, click the Start button, type cmd and select the command prompt from the menu. Type ipconfig /flushdns and press the enter key on your keyboard to clear the DNS cache.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to ask, is there any possibility that a Security Gateway (website blocking software) could cause this situation on Windows 10 when it did not on Windows 8?</p>

<p>Hi Ghostwheel00,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your details. I have consulted and it is suggested to wait for the next product version and check if the issue can be fixed in this new version. You can monitor it and keep the Skype for Business up to date. Your time and understanding will be
 much appreicated.</p>

<p>Hi GhostWheel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the steps below to collect the log files for us to analyze:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Go to location: C:\Users\&lt;user name&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync\Tracing, delete all log files which end as&nbsp;<strong>.uccapilog</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Restart Skype for Business&gt; go to settings&gt;&nbsp;<strong>General</strong>&gt; select&nbsp;<strong>Full&nbsp;</strong>for logging in Skype for Business&gt; tick "<strong>also collect troubleshooting info using Windows Event logging</strong>" to enable logging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Reproduce the issue&gt; send the messages with emoticons about 3 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp;Go to&nbsp;C:\Users\&lt;user name&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync\Tracing, find the log file with .<strong>uccapilog&nbsp;</strong>as suffix, upload the log file&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/new">via private message.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">please refer to the steps in private message to collect the fiddler log.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand it may take you some time to collect the log, &nbsp;but they are important for us to move on the issue.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi LeanneMaynard,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your description, I understand that your environment is like the following and you can achieve your requirement via the following steps.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Create a list named list test 1 and create a customized InfoPath form.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Configure the InfoPath form’s item to be created in a form library named form library1.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fc642485-2fae-458d-bc7f-16a516f1a696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fc642485-2fae-458d-bc7f-16a516f1a696" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b93c4ea3-661b-4156-b71f-9fbdbc3737a0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b93c4ea3-661b-4156-b71f-9fbdbc3737a0" /></a></p>
<p><span>3. Download SharePoint Designer 2013 from
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-sg/download/details.aspx?id=35491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-sg/download/details.aspx?id=35491</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Connect to the corresponding site and create a SharePoint 2010 workflow in form library 1 with the following settings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bbd767aa-3e24-4a7a-8aed-0438703563d5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bbd767aa-3e24-4a7a-8aed-0438703563d5" /></a></p>
<p><span>Now when the item is created in form library1, the email will not be sent to the creator user1.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Cliff</span></p>

<h2>            How to remove hyperlinks from a document without having to remove them one by one&#63;</h2>
                    How to remove hyperlinks from a document without having to remove them one by one? was my original question. Then, I could not find the correct path to get to this page, or a Chat page where I could enter my question and get a free Chat or emailed response.
 When I found this page, the dialog boxes to enter this information did not work. I did not know how to immediately "diagnose connection problems" while still on the webpage. Then, I contacted my Earthlink DSL provider to let the techie know I have been unable
 to fill out forms or send emails from a number of websites which provide those resources. She suggested there was a problem with Internet Explorer 8, or with a recently downloaded program on my computer. (I recently downloaded the DivX Suite of free software
 to watch streaming movies.) I think there is a problem with these items as she suggested, or else there is malware on my computer from a third-party vendor which OneCare is unable to detect. But, miraculously (as usual,) aft

<p>The wiring for the 3110 and 6310 is the same, so you could change the phone controller and the car's cradle and then use a Visee0 1000 MBU Bluetooth module.

<h2>            Reminders for Meetings get set to &#34;None&#34; instead of retaining their original value</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10</p>
<p>Outlook 2016</p>
<p>IMAP</p>
<p>
</p><p>New PC, new install of Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I receive a new calendar invitation the reminder gets set to "None" instead of retaining its original value. &nbsp;I have verified from the source (tested this dozens of times now directly from a separate account and from other people) that the meeting invitation
 includes a 15 Minute reminder before the start of the meeting, but for some reason the reminder gets set to "none" when I accept to my calendar. &nbsp;I then have to go into the meeting and manually set the reminder to "15 Minutes" (or appropriate time) to be reminded....obviously
 not the way it should work and I've already missed a few meetings, so not good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've reviewed <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2787708" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2787708</a>&nbsp;and all of the settings are properly configured, including the registry. &nbsp;I've also run&nbsp;outlook /cleanreminders without any luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that I am missing something very simple but am currently out of ideas and could use some help. &nbsp;Has anyone else run into this issue? &nbsp;Does anyone know how to fix?</p>
<p>

            <p>hi Thank you for your response. &nbsp;This does not seem to be related to the issue you mentioned although I have do have an iPhone I use as well (IMAP) so maybe I am wrong. &nbsp;However, I changed my desktop Outlook to retrieve email via POP and the reminder values
 are now properly retained for new invitations. &nbsp;The problem I have is that on another computer I have that is set up for IMAP the calendar reminder values are retained without any problem. &nbsp;I do not want to switch to POP if possible.</p>

 me my formula was wrong.&nbsp; I've checked both the look up fields and the table arrays, all the numbers are actual numbers, formatted as such, there are no blanks, spaces, apostrophes,etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why does this not work? Is the table array range too big maybe?&nbsp; I'm using Excel 2010 so it hsould be able to cope.</p>

<h2>            Trouble with Windows 10 insider preview 18936.1000 &#40;rs_prerelese&#41;</h2>
                    I've tried installing the update twice, both times it seemed to complete but when restarting I got a blue screen. I've heard it could be a driver issue, I have an M.2 MVMe.&nbsp;Any thoughts or ideas I would appreciate it.
