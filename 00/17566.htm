<h2>            Microsoft Band 1 vs 2, and HR variability</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if someone could explain to me the benefits of Microsoft Band 2 vs the first one. I see the shape is different and it has a barometer, but I'm not sure of how it's better in regards of data quality and/or comfort and performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also wonder if the HR monitor could provide information of heart rate variability, that is how steady or variable the heart rate is in any given situation. That can help detect reactions to food and also help with awareness and mindfulness practices, the
 steadier the HR the better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help me out with these two questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot,</p>
<p>
</p><p>V.</p>

<h2>            Email Account Unreachable</h2>
                    <p>I am in Microsoft ****. 5hrs spent today simply trying to forward an email to an employees email account and filtering those emails to a sub-folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the account says it no longer exists, yet it allows me to log in to it... All emails are being bounced back to everyone trying to contact us. 100s of them every hour.

</p><p>Can anyone help? This is my 4th attempt to get a response on here. </p>

            <p>Hi RJ2879,<br />
<br />
From your description, I know the error message of the above screenshot was generated while you forward/ others sent to that employee’s account. Please clarify it with more details if anything is misunderstood.
<br />
<br />
If so, according to the error message, the issue can be considered via the following aspects:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Typed an incorrect email address of the employee’s account.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The email address (smtp address or you can call it email alias) won’t exist for the employee’s account. (I mean, user@contoso.com was an email alias of that account. But now the email alias has been removed)<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Check if the employee has a valid Exchange online license. You may go to<a href="https://portal.office.com/adminportal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Office 365 Admin Portal</a>&gt; Users (Active Users)&gt; double click the employee’s account&gt; Product
 license&gt; Exchange online plan1/Exchange online plan 2<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Check whether user@contoso.com is the email alias (smtp address) belongs to the employee via running the PowerShell cmdlet<strong> Get-Recipient -Identity user@contoso.com | fl
</strong>Note: user@contoso.com stands for the employee’s account and before running the cmdlet it is needed to
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
connect to Exchange Online PowerShell</a> via an <strong>admin credential</strong>.

<p>
</p><p>After that, please provide a screenshot about the PowerShell cmdlet output in the

 forum)?&nbsp; If not, could you create a brand new Sway, attempt to upload the PDF, and then send us the URL to that Sway, please?&nbsp; With that we should be able to check what went wrong.</p>

            <p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure the PNG solution was quite good enough as the images are not coming through as clearly as a PDF and I can't seem to send you the multiple page pdf I was originally trying to upload, but I have managed to get single pages to upload now. The
 problem is that the formatting is all over the place and it bears no resemblance to the original layout - is this normal? Maybe I'm trying to use this application in the wrong way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Sway including the lacewing doc is attached as a pdf and as a jpeg for comparison.</p>

            <p>Mel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sway attempts to give viewers a layout optimized for the device they try to view it on (desktop, tablet, phone, etc.) meaning that the Sway can be laid out and look different in all those places.&nbsp; Because of that, you cannot specify exact placement or size
 of content or else we the layout wouldn't be as flexible.&nbsp; Therefore, it is expected that a PDF will not look the same when uploaded into a Sway.&nbsp; To get exact pixel-perfect layouts, you would want to upload the file to something like OneDrive and then embed
 it in your Sway so that it looks the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to investigating this issue, could you try creating a new Sway, trying to insert only the PDF that fails into and just do it once.&nbsp; After it fails, copy the URL, close the window, and then respond to this thread with the URL.&nbsp; That will make it a little
 easier to sift through the logs to find the exact problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Cannot save new email contacts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrisbryant  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot save new email contacts</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have a new Outlook 2010 profile. It was created when I set up Google Sync for Outlook. When this profile was created, I set up my existing hotmail account and Exchange account in the same profile. This made the Exchange the default account within the profile,
 as opposed to the Gmail account.<br />
<br />
Since this happened, I am no longer able to send new emails to addresses not already in my contacts list. I am also not able to reply to anyone at all. I am also not able to save new email addresses to contacts.<br />
<br />
This is the error message I get when I try:<br />
<br />
"the operation failed the messaging interfaces have returned an unknown error. If the problem persists, restart Outlook. Cannot resolve recipient."<br />
<br />
Thoughts greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Chris<br />

            Hi there,
<div><br />
<div>Acutally I've researched this quite a bit now and it appears you cannot have Google Sync for Outlook and and Exchange account in the same profile.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have taken out the Exchange account and good works fine. And set up and new profile for my exchange account and hotmail, which works fine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Google have not said when they expect to offer support to allow Exchange to work with their software.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks,</div>

That happens when the service is not able to generate the thumbnail for the photo. Anyway, you should be able to sync your photos back and forth without problems as the service doesn't touch your files - just backup them. Regards, Lopes

            My guess is that it is just not reading the thumbnail.&nbsp; I would try restoring one just to see if in fact it does work.&nbsp; I'll bet it does.

    <title>How can I auto populate a table with dates increasing by set intervals - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I auto populate a table with dates increasing by set intervals such as monthly or four weekly&#63;</h2>
                    I have set up a&nbsp;REPORT to show a bank account. I enter payments and receipts as they arise on a FORM. I want to be able to generate recurring items (such as standing orders) automatically on a TABLE or QUERY as each one becomes due. This will be combined
 with the data generated from the FORM above.

            These sort of scheduling operations are not uncommon in various contexts.&nbsp; I've had occasion to do them for programming regular maintenance operations to engineering structures for instance.&nbsp; One way to insert a specified number of rows into a table with
 a date value requires some code which loops through the number of transactions needed and inserts a row into the table, incrementing the date at each iteration of the loop.&nbsp; This can be wrapped in a little function along the following lines:<br />
<br />
Public Sub InsertMonthlyDebits(lngTransactionTypeID As Long, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lngCreditorID As Long, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intNumberOfDebits As Integer, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; curAmount As Currency, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dtmStartDate As Date)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strSQL As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim n As Integer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For n = 0 To intNumberOfDebits - 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL = "INSERT INTO Transactions" &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "(TransactionTypeID, CreditorID, TransactionDate, Credit, Debit, Amount) " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "VALUES(" &amp; lngTransactionTypeID &amp; "," &amp; lngCreditorID &amp; ",#" &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Format(DateAdd("m", n, dtmStartDate), "yyyy-mm-dd") &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "#,0," &amp; curAmount &amp; ")"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CurrentDb.Execute strSQL, dbFailOnError<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next n<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
This assumes a table Transactions with columns TransactionTypeID, CreditorID, TransactionDate, Credit and&nbsp; Debit.&nbsp; The table would also have a DebitorID column, but that will be left Null in this case as the transactions are debits from the account payable
 to a creditor.&nbsp; TransactionTypeID would be a foreign key referencing the primary key of a TransactionTypes table, CreditorID would be a foreign key referencing the primary key of a Creditors table and Credit and Debit are columns of currency data type.&nbsp; In
 this case a zero value is inserted into the former as the amount is being debited from the account.<br />
<br />
So to insert rows for 24 standing orders of 10.50 GBP payable on the first of each month, starting next month, to creditor 42 where the key for 'standing order' is 5 would mean calling the procedure like this:<br />
<br />
InsertMonthlyDebits 5, 42, 24,10.5, #2012-02-01# <br />
<br />
In an application the values would normally be variables of course rather than hard coded, obtained from combo and text boxes on a dialogue form for instance.<br />
<br />
I don't think Tom need be too incredulous about using Access in this context.&nbsp; I've maintained records of all my personal accounts in Access for many years.&nbsp; This is purely for my own use of course, I'm not running a bank!&nbsp; I have it set up so that the regular
 monthly debits from my current accounts (checking accounts in US-speak) are assigned at the beginning of each month.&nbsp; The actual payments made from the accounts occur on or about the dates assigned of course.<br />
<br />
Note that these regular transactions are represented by rows in the same table as other credits and debits.&nbsp; Your post suggests that you might be considering putting them in a separate table.&nbsp; That would not be a good idea.&nbsp; A query on which a report is based
 can restrict the data for the report in whatever way you wish.&nbsp; You might want to show only transactions to date for instance, excluding those such as standing orders scheduled for future payment; or you might want to show only regular or non-regular transactions.&nbsp;
 Once you have all the required data in the table you can manipulate it however you wish.<br />

<h2>            Sharepoint 2013 Visio Service &#34;Refresh Conflicts&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have SharePoint 2013 OnPrem with Visio Services configured. I have a Visio diagram that is link to a SQL&nbsp;View that gives me a "Status" health score of every server. 0 = OK, 10 = Informational, 20 = Warning, 30 =&nbsp;Major, 40 = Critical. I use this to populate
 Data Graphics under the Servers in my Visio diagram. Everything is linked up and working great. &nbsp;I even followed this blog to make sure my Data Connections functioned correctly.
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/chhopkin/archive/2011/04/20/visio-services-external-data-refresh-part-1.aspx?CommentPosted=true#commentmessage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HERE</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I confirmed with Excel and a Trace on the SQL server that SharePoint and Office Web Apps (OWA)&nbsp;is using the correct Data Connection submitted to my Data Connection Library. The Excel refreshes with new data without errors when I click the Refresh button
 in OWA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I use the same connection with my Visio, I see Visio Services using the correct Secure Store account and Connection through the SQL trace. BUT I then get a warning in Visio Web App that says I have "Refresh Conflicts"&nbsp;and the drawing does not
 refresh. I click details and get the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Visio Web Access</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Visio Service Could not refresh all the data in the diagram because the structure of data in the data source has changed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Please open the drawing in Visio and update the data connection information.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I open up the Visio Diagram in the client and everything is fine. I click refresh and everything updates as expected. Any idea on how to resolve this Visio\SharePoint error message?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Since the last windows update (two or three days ago, today is 7/13/14) - every time I click anything on any site I am on I get 'pop-up blocked for this site' with the 'allow once' button. Even for things like opening my email from the home page of centurylink,
 which didn't happen before. There used to be a 'send report' thing that came up when you had a problem, now there isn't. So did this 'pop-up' thing happen with the update? Will it be fixed? It took me a half hour to navigate all your **** to join up just to
 ask this question. Guess it won't be answered now. Oh well, maybe it will be fixed on the next update. I can't be the only one this is happening to.

</p><p>I purchased Office 365 University on 11 March 2014.&nbsp; Initially had to wait on my new laptop to arrive to download the product.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once installed on device unable to activate product keeps asking for a product key code which I never reveived.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Microsoft support visit www.office.com/verifysupport You can then receive support on how to validate educational eligibility and the process for receiving a verification code through manual verification process if you cannot be verified by your school
 or don't have an International Student ID number. You will need the following product code for support<br />
Product Code(s): &lt;removed&gt; </p>
<p style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">This is NOT a "LICENSE CODE " and will not unlock trial or demo versions.
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">This is NOT a "VERIFICATION CODE " and cannot be used to verify eligibility.
</p>
<p>the above product code loops me back around to myaccount and still unable to activate product need help</p>

</p><p>I'm a little frustrated at the moment with this installation.&nbsp; The product code (Product Key Removed as PII Violation)&nbsp;provided is invalid when attempting to activate Office 365, or does not allow me to enter my student email address when I registered and

            <p>HI</p>
<p>I was working on Office 365 perfectly until I downloaded windows 8.1.&nbsp; Now I have been deactivated and only have until the 11th to reactivate it.</p>
<p>I have spent the equivalent of a day trying online, via call centres and chat to microsoft and have zero progress!&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been cut off 3&nbsp;times, sent to the OZ and NZ call centre 3 times and the SA call centre cannot assist so keep transferring me to&nbsp;nowhere.&nbsp;
 The chat room also sent me the SA number so I&nbsp;am right back where I started. &nbsp;This is ridiculous!</p>
<p>Everytime I try to activate - it brings up the 'sign in' page and then tells me my password is wrong.&nbsp; After a few attempts It tells me &nbsp;"this account is not associated with this Office product".&nbsp; How can that be when it is the only account and I am using
 it.?</p>
<p>I tried the run as administrator suggestion from this site but it brings up the same 'sign in' page asking for a password which it then doesn't recognise</p>
<p>I can get into my microsoft account but cant do anything there related to Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>sometimes (for some unknown reason) my Outlook 2010 Home &amp; Business does not close properly and when restarted some of my personal settings&nbsp;(Outlook options) is missing, for example 'views, 'templates and&nbsp;fonts' etc.
</p>
<p>So I wonder, where and how can I restore these settings?</p>

            <p>These are stored in the registry. Try setting them then closing outlook. That should preserve them in the event of a crash, although&nbsp; I have noticed installing updates sometimes reverts - in my case, an autocorrect entry i tested. I swear i delete that every
 couple of weeks. </p>
<p>settings for all offce apps are at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office - export the key (or the outlook subkey) to back up settings. Generally speaking, you can safely use this on any computer running the same version of outlook or office if you
 want settings the same on all computers you use. </p>

                    <p>I did everything as is explained here:&nbsp;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/See-your-Google-Calendar-in-Outlook-c1dab514-0ad4-4811-824a-7d02c5e77126</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did it in Outlook 2016 and Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>The link I am pasting from Google is working - checked in the browser - it downloads .ics file instantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook is stubborn and says: Cannot verify or add the Internet Calendar in Outlook. Verify the link is a valid calendar link.</p>
<p>Exactly the same way it worked before, but I received a new laptop with clean installation and now it doesn't work, although it still works in old laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, what is wrong with you? Are you blocking usage of Google apps? In first place I am connecting to MS Exchange, Google calendar is my private one and I want to see them both in one screen.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Mac 2016 asking for certificate on start</h2>
                    <p>I've been using Outlook Mac 2016 with my work Office 365 account for a long time now and it's been working fine. &nbsp;This week seemingly out of the blue, when I start up outlook it has started asking me for a certificate and I don't seen to have one. &nbsp;I've
 spoken with my email administration team with my company and given them the name that it's asking for the certificate for and they are telling me that a certificate should not be needed and they no idea what certificate it's talking about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to access my email through my browser and iphone without any problems. &nbsp;It's just the outlook client that seems to have the problem. &nbsp;I've tried it while connected and disconnected from my corporate VPN (It worked both ways on Monday morning).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a complete loss for what to try next and desperately need help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

    <title>How do I know if a trojan virus removal was successful&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> buttercupcl  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I know if a trojan virus removal was successful&#63;</h2>
                    Hi all, I am a first time question asker and learning computers as I go, hardly understand much tech speak, so please go easy on me?
<br />
A few days ago my security essentials scan detected a seedabutor trojan and I am wondering how to tell if it is totally gone. I have been browsing around this forum and have followed advice given to others. I have deleted temporary files, deleted java cache,
 and completely uninstalled java. I have run security essentials in safe mode, downloaded and run tdsskiller and Microsoft Safety Scanner in safe mode, and all say that nothing has been detected. I am not feeling satisfied though. I am feeling a bit scared
 as I had a worm virus shut down my computer and hack my bank accounts about 5 years ago, and I do not want to go through that again! HOW can I be sure that this thing was successfully removed and that it's not just hiding?&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you in advance for any help.<br />

 as I had a worm virus shut down my computer and hack my bank accounts about 5 years ago, and I do not want to go through that again! HOW can I be sure that this thing was successfully removed and that it's not just hiding?&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you in advance for any help.<br />

<div>I would use the following scanners (which may find left over remnants of malware that are no longer active so if the scanners find something you can remove/quarantine it and then scan again) and if you can receive "clean scans" with MSE, Malwarebytes,
 TDSS Killer and Hitman Pro then you can "assume" the malware is removed. &nbsp; But the only way to be sure the malware is removed is to reformat/reinstall the operating system and based on information within your post I think that would be a bit extreme in this
 case.</div>

            Well I&nbsp; ran a quick scan with Malwarebytes and it detected something called pup.bundle. The log says it was successfully quarantined and deleted. There was nothing else detected but I think I might go ahead and run Malwarebytes in safe mode.

    <title>Strategy for updating Access database with remote data - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> buzz burhans  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strategy for updating Access database with remote data</h2>
                    <p>I have a small MS_Access db that is used to &nbsp;accumulate numeric performance data on customer enterprises for subsequent reporting (using Tableau).&nbsp; The data is currently acquired and the db updated on a &nbsp;monthly basis by a combination of site visits and
 electronic data transfer followed by manual entry, all accomplished&nbsp;by a dedicated company technician.&nbsp; The data collection interval&nbsp;needs to change from monthly to weekly,&nbsp;and it is impractical for the technician to do site visits weekly.&nbsp; We would like to
 have the tech/sales reps, who are on the accounts weekly anyway, capture and submit the data. I am looking for guidance on the best and simplest way to accomplish this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further details: </p>
<p>1. There are ~ 15 reps that we need data from.</p>
<p>2. The data is quite limited, about 20 numeric fields.</p>
<p>3.The Access db resides on a citrix server, however, accessing the citrix server from the field is very slow.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;I am concerned that having multiple reps connect to the Access db on the server directly could end up causing db corruption in cases where they might access the db simultaneously, or if the connection is dropped (not uncommon, this is a fairly rural region,
 and many reps do not have very good internet access..</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Reps have Excel on their personal PCs, and will have tablets soon that could run Excel.&nbsp; Reps are reasonably comfortable with Excel.
</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;Most Reps do not currently have Access &nbsp;on their PCs.</p>
<p>7. There is no Sharepoint server set up currently, and it is preferred that we not have to set one up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My thought is this:</p>
<p>1. Create an Excel User Form that reps &nbsp;complete on their Tablet at the site visit. Have the Excel file be resident in a Dropbox folder.</p>
<p>2.On the corporate end, have an Excel file that loops through the rep files nightly, and accumulates &amp; compiles the records they have created using the User Form. I assume this would be accomplished by a VBA procedure.</p>
<p>3.Set up an Access update query to run daily that would update Access tables with the compiled Excel table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a small company, and althought there is some budget for consulting / programming assistance, there is not a budget to build a totally new&nbsp;or extensvely more elaborate db or system.&nbsp; I would appreicate thoughts, suggestions, guidance, recommendations,
 or identification if individuals who could code key pieces of this schema, or related suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Well, the easiest and *cheapest* way I can think of is...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Have the Reps fill out a Template that is placed in DropBox</p>
<p>2. Have someone drop the files in a folder daily</p>
<p>3. Set up the database with an DoCmd.TransferSpreadsheeet on a button to get the files and import them into the database and run your queries to either add the data to the tables or update the data to the tables.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With little or no guidance you should be able to set up the above fairly quickl;y.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a side note, to automate the above process would probably take more then you probably want to spend.</p>

            Thank you Gina. Your information is the kind of perspective I wanted.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I am curious about why you think automating the process would be more expensive than we want to spend- not necessarily, but what processes / programming are your thinking would be necessary to implement?<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*...there is not a budget to build a totally new&nbsp;or extensvely more elaborate db or system.*</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usually, and please don't take this personally, but a developer comes in and there's a bit of *redesign* that is involved.&nbsp; And, what you are talking about is fairly elaborate.&nbsp; Now, taking all tht into consideration AND that any decent developer's going
 rate is $100+ an hour... well, you get the picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, my thought was to offer an alternative you could implement yourself (with a little guidance from us, if needed) and the only thing&nbsp;involved would be your time.</p>

            Thanks Gina.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I have worked on a number of similar projects over the years, and am aware of the potential for a real programmer/developer to identify multiple opportunities that might (or usually) end up being quite expensive.&nbsp; In some cases, there is a real need to redevelop
 the entire system. In others though, the existing system functions fine, but requires more than a minor input to achieve the new desired functionality.&nbsp; In such cases the desired outcome is often most efficiently accomplished by bringing in a pro, if the pro
 is willing to work with real world situations as so often exist that might be less than optimal.&nbsp; If the pro's strategy is to throw out the entire project and redo it from scratch, for small companies whose system is functional even if not perfect, this is
 often a non-starter. I can tell you from experience that depending on the "pro" involved, this can get prohibitively expensive and has NO guarantee that the new "pro" will end up providing a reasonably functioning system at anything near a reasonable cost.&nbsp;
 My first experience with outside database developers was many years ago when I hired a small local shop that mostly did work for banks.&nbsp; The kind of systems that banks require are far far beyond what our needs were at the time. After months, and thousands
 and thousands of dollars, a system was delivered...that did not work.&nbsp; Six months later I had a system built on 4000+ lines of code in Lotus that worked - but I had had to do it myself - quite a learning curve.<br />
<br />
In any case, in this case, there is some budget dollars available if required, for bringing in a real programmer on a limited basis.&nbsp; You are correct when you sensed that I would prefer to do as much as possible on my own, but will need help from guru's such
 as yourself on the various forums.<br />
<br />
I am still interested in alternative options to the simplest one you have proposed. Not that I am rejecting your initial suggestion, but I am also interested in options which might not be the "cheapest", but would provide at least a modicum of automation to
 the process.&nbsp; How would you approach that, given that there is a desire to keep it simple, relatively inexpensive, but not necessarily to find the "cheapest" alternative for accomplishing this?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any further inputs you might have.<br />
<br />

            <p>Are theses Reps going to have internet connectivity or must the data be collected off line and then uploaded?&nbsp; Could the Reps have connectivity via a cell phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If connectivity could be maintained, you should consider Office365.&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe the lowest plan, still has Access Web apps.&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe the Web apps would be good enough to allow the data entry you need.&nbsp; The Reps would not need Access, just a browser and
 internet connectivity.</p>

            <p>I would post the project on a board, such as UtterAccess which has a section for that, with a complete description of what you want the database to do and take bids on estimated costs.&nbsp; Even that is no guarentee you will get a *pro* that will do as *you*
 ask and not try to inject what they *think* you need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hmmm &lt;light bulb lit up&gt;, another choice is ask a *pro* if they know of someone whom might be more flexible in their rates.&nbsp; For example, I know of someone who is less expensive than me, who has time, AND whom I have used before, so I know she's *honest*
 and a good developer.&nbsp; If you are interested you can drop me a line...</p>

            Thanks for the idea Jack.<br />
<br />
I have not used Office 365 - I have a vague memory that I saw somewhere it was being discontinued?<br />
<br />
In any case, the reps typically make multiple customer calls within a day, and all the reps have cell phones and will have Tablets soon.&nbsp; I have suggested that when the Tablets are purchased, they need to be running Windows8 because I thought that would optimize
 the opportunity to use MS products.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
However, the customer sites are all in rural areas, and a significant number of customer sites do not have cell phone access.&nbsp; The reps would generally have access at various times throughout the day, but not necessarily at every customer site they visited.
 I would assume, though, that we could still record the data and transmit it later when they had service?<br />
<br />
I will investigate the Office365 possibilities.&nbsp; We have enough licenses for Office 2010 for everyone now, not sure what would be involved in setting them all up on 365.&nbsp; Sounds like it might be a good alternative though.
<br />
<br />
If you had any more specifics of ow this might work, I'd be interested to know how you envision it being implemented.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<h2>            Lumia 950 xl Contacts can&#39;t hear me well enough</h2>
                    Hey guys I am not sure how to do a search on this subject so I decided to post. So when I call people they can't hear me very well, I always have to yell into the phone and then they say it's fine. I've done a factory reset and it doesn't help the issue.
 Does anyone have advice on how to fix this or is this a warranty thing? Thanks

            <p>Hello, I sent my phone in for repair. I always keep my phone updated and the suggestions you made I had already done except for checking the speaker phone.</p>
<p>The phone is not muted. Resetting the phone does not help. Calling back does not help. It's all numbers not just specific ones. They can hear me with a headset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently they are sending me my phone back after about a week. Here's what they said:</p>
<p>
Here’s what you told us was wrong :<br />
<br />
Device freezes and restarts all the time but the MAIN problem is that people have a REALLY hard time<br />
<br />
hearing me on the phone. I have to yell into the phone for them to be able to hear me at all.<br />
<br />
Here’s what we did to fix it :<br />
<br />
• Passed Software Update<br />
<br />
Passed Complete Functional test •<br />
<br />
Passed Complete RF Test •<br />
<br />
• Passed Quality Inspection
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If I get a broken phone back because they just ran a diagnostic test then I will never purchase a Microsoft device again. That is just straight laziness</p>

            yes! so I did the factory reset and all but it did not work so I sent it in for warranty and they returned it saying they reset my phone (and did some tests) and all that but after they did the reset it actually worked so I would send it in. It's free
 anyway since it's under 1 year. Took almost 2 weeks from the time I sent my phone

            Having the same problem, however if you plug earphones into my Lumia 950, the receiver can hear me really loud. Remove the earphones and my voice is faint to the receiver. Why is this?

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like the issue has something to do with your presence status. Please consider the following troubleshooting steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Make sure that Skype is
<a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA10980/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">no longer running</span></a>.</span></li><li>
<span>Press the Windows
&nbsp;and
<strong><span>R</span></strong> keys on your keyboard at the same time.</span></li><li>
<span>Type <strong><span>"%appdata%\skype"</span></strong>&nbsp;into the Run window, and click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>Find and delete the
<strong><span>shared.xml</span></strong> file. If file extensions are not displayed on your computer, the file will just be called
<strong><span>shared</span></strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>Open the folder that has your Skype name.
</span></li><li>
<span>Locate and delete the
<strong><span>config </span></strong>or
<strong><span>config.xml</span></strong> file.</span></li><li>
<span>Uninstall Skype.</span></li><li>
<span>Restart your Windows computer.</span></li><li>
<span>Download the most
<strong><span><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">up-to-date version</span></a></span></strong>.&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p>I also suggest trying to connect to a different Internet connection source to check if it will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope the information above helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no option to change how a call appear in Skype as that is how it is designed. If you really wish to see the&nbsp;person you're in a call with, you might as well initiate a video call.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Office 2010 won&#39;t install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ribena06  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Office 2010 won&#39;t install</h2>
                    Ok, so I bought Microsoft Office Home and Student 2010 in-store, and neither the installation disc nor the file for the program from the Microsoft website will work. I've deleted Microsoft Office 2007 from my computer, both from the Control Panel and using
 Microsoft Fix-It.&nbsp; I've also tried starting the computer with a clean boot, but to no avail. When I put the installation disc into the drive, it will whir around and come up as a blank disc. I've installed software using this drive before, and all other discs
 work in it, but the installation disc won't. Then I tried downloading Office from the website; used the product key and all was fine until I tried opening the file. The error message said "Installation of this package failed". My computer runs Windows 7 64
 bit. I've trawled through this website, trying all of the suggestions, but nothing works! Does anyone have any other ideas? Thanks.<br />

            You've already taken most of the steps I would suggest.&nbsp; At first I thought your CD reader might be slightly out of alignment, just enough to prevent it from reading that disk. But if you have problems with downloaded install files too, there is something
 more going on.&nbsp; I do have the following tip that suggests the error message is due to a corrupted installation file download. Did you first save the download to HD BEFORE running the install?&nbsp; Try downloading from a different source:<br />
<b><span>2010 Full Download</span></b>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: if you do not have the installation file on an “official” MS installation disk, download and save it to your HD. Then you should burn it to one or more DVDs for future
 use. And at the same time, write down the product key on the DVD. You need both items for future installations, say after your computer crashes and you have re-installed windows. At that point you won’t be able to extract it from the registry and won’t remember
 where the online account is.</p>
