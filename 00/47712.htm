    <title>The action can&#39;t be completed because the file is open in Windows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            The action can&#39;t be completed because the file is open in Windows Explorer.</h2>
                    
<p>OK, this one seems to be coming up a lot but no one's been able to answer it (including Microsoft) so I'll ask and be as specific as I can.</p>
<p>Because I work with vector art I have to constantly save files by over-writing them and everything was cool with WinXP pro.&nbsp; I just got Win7 Pro and everything was cool, until recently.&nbsp; Whenever I tried to overwrite my files, I'd get error messages saying
 the file was either read-only or was open elsewhere, but it only happened about 50% of the time.&nbsp; A had to start re-saving files with different names.&nbsp; after getting the files re-saved i would then try to delete and rename the files, but found i couldn't do
 either, as I was constantly getting the error message 'The action can't be completed because the file is open in Windows Explorer.'&nbsp; Closing and reopening explorer does nothing.&nbsp; Someone else mentioned emptying the recycle bin works, but not for me.&nbsp; Being
 that the files are on an external drive I attempted to disable write caching through device manager and the windows Management Console (or whatever) froze up and took the pc with it (nice job, MS!).&nbsp; Rebooting seems to fix the problem for a little bit, but
 it returns quickly and at random.&nbsp; It also seems to pick files at random to lock up.&nbsp; Some files I can't change, some I can.&nbsp; Others start functioning after a while of inactivity.</p>
<p>I tried disabling thumbnails in Explorer and even added a NoThumbnailCache DWORD in the registry, but it still happens.&nbsp; I'm basically going to have to save all new files over and over again and only occasionally be able to delete the old ones while only
 randomly being able to over-write others.&nbsp; This issue seems to be plaguing Vista and Win7 and people have been waiting for a fix, but Microsoft's been very mum on the issue.&nbsp; If anyone can come up with a fix, that would be great.&nbsp; This is killing my productivity!</p>

            Here are some solutions :<br />
<br />
Solution 1: Use CMD.<br />
0- Note that the following 3 steps are going to terminate your explorer.exe process, so your desktop and all of windows explorer open folders and any other related process would be terminated.<br />
1- Run Task Manager. ( by pressing ctrl + shift + esc or etc)<br />
2- Go to Processes tab.<br />
3- Find "explorer.exe" and click "end process" button. If you find more than one explorer.exe, kill them all.<br />
4- Now, click the file menu -&gt; New Task (Run...)<br />
5- Type CMD and click OK.<br />
6- Now you can do any thing that you couldn't did before with this UI. Some useful commands :<br />
- cd : Changes the current directory. Use "CD .." to do the "Up Button" in windows explorer.<br />
- dir : Lists the existing file and folders in current directory. Use "dir /p" to list it in pages.<br />
- del [File Name] : Deletes the existing [File Name] file in the current directory.<br />
- rename [Old File Name] [New File Name] : Renames the existing [Old File Name] file or directory existing in the current directory to [New File Name].<br />
<br />
Solution 2: Use another file manager.<br />
0- Install and execute another file manager like "XYPlore".<br />
1- Note that the following 3 steps are going to terminate your explorer.exe process, so your desktop and all of windows explorer open folders and any other related process would be terminated.<br />
2- Run Task Manager. ( by pressing ctrl + shift + esc or etc)<br />
3- Go to Processes tab.<br />
4- Find "explorer.exe" and click "end process" button. If you find more than one explorer.exe, kill them all.<br />
5- Use XYPlore UI and do what ever you want.<br />
Please note that the problem could happen with this kind of external explorers too. So close any file and go to a safe directory after your work.<br />
<br />
Solution 3: Do it your self!<br />
If you can program, there are some codes that could help you. These codes that Im talking about, will tell MS Windows to delete your annoying pinned files just before shutting down the system.<br />
Here is a sample one:<br />
MoveFileEx('C:\windows\system32\ld21E.tmp',nil,MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING or MOVEFILE_DELAY_UNTIL_REBOOT);<br />
This code will work properly in Borland Delphi Compilers, and as you can see, the file "ld21e.tmp" will be removed after compiling this code and restarting your windows.

<p>There&nbsp;will never be a Hotfix because in general its not caused by Windows. Sure, in cases where it can be reprduced and explained, one particular root cause can be fixed via a Hotfix. In general this can be caused by anykind of Scenarios and Software. Please
 read my answer from a different thread some topic.</p>
<p>The official KB Aricle can be found at the bottom on the handle.exe Site:</p>
<div>
<p><span>The issue is mostly never caused by Windows itself. Tools like AV Software, are mostly the rootcause. Due to a bad timing issue the file get then stucked forever,&nbsp;until reboot.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are lucky the lock releases, after you close all open windows and wait a minute.</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes you can find something checking the properties of the locked file, using the process explorer tool.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What always work is the Tool handle.exe from Sysinternals. Its a command line tool, showing you what process is having an active handle on this file and gives you the option to
 release it.&nbsp; The handle tool should not take as general solution but it should point you to he "bad" software holding the file. You can then take action and for example reconfigure your AV, or remove some 3rd Party app you dont need.</span></p>
<p><span>In general you should&nbsp;disable all software on startup, visisble with msconfig.exe&nbsp; In addition you can disable all non-microsoft services here, which you don’t need. And these are
 usually a lot after checking for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span>There are situation where the lock does not get released after reboot. The root cause was probably the same, unable&nbsp;for a program to clean up after themselves. Here&nbsp;you need to
 go to the security settings of the file. Dont try to change the permissions&nbsp;if you don’t have permission’s of course :-)&nbsp; If you are an administrator you need to&nbsp;take the OWNERSHIP first before&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to change the security permissions.&nbsp;You will find the&nbsp;option&nbsp;in
 the security&nbsp;settings sa well.</span></p>
<p><span>As an example an Windows&nbsp;Hotfix was installed and AV Software was running all time. After the installation the pc wants to restart, but the AV Software has still an open handle
 on the installation folder. If the lock does not release, Windows will&nbsp;restart the Machine anyway, causing a&nbsp;locked folder which&nbsp;yoi need to take the ownership first.</span></p>
<p><span>In some cases I have seen that it does not want to fully delete all the folders and subs. In this case a file or empty folder was left in one of the subfolders. Go there delete
 the very last one and delete the locked root folder.</span></p>
<p><span>Handle.exe:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896655" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896655</a></span></p>
<p><span>Process Explorer:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx</a></span></p>
<p><span>I agree I find this issue also very annoying and happened to me a couple of times already. Hopefully the handle,exe will be sooner or later integrated in the explorer, so it could
 display a message immediately pointing to the process holding the handle.</span></p>
<p><span>So if we all say PLEASE, we might get integrated what bothers me since W2003.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>BTW - Instead of saying please, you need to log new feature ideas to MS Connect, the only chance it ever gets picked up...</span></p>
<p><span>Regards</span></p>

            The status setting is not only not always accurate anymore, it only shows their status on your screen if they're set to Available. In other words, If they're offline, you will not have a dot of any color by your contact. I've often had to refresh my status
 just to show me as green to others. This is the way things are headed because people have skype on devices that go to power save mode but still get notifications. I can be set to available, and power off my phone. This will not change my skype status to others
 though. I'll still show as available.

<h2>            Surface Book turns on to &#34;Just a moment...&#34; circle of death.</h2>
                    <p>I bought a brand new 512GB i7 Surface Book. I was setting up Windows, when I accidentally unplugged the power cord, then I plugged it back &nbsp;in and turned it on again. But now, it's stuck on a gray background with Just a moment... circle of death.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the 2-button shutdown. I tried to download a recovery image but the surface recovery image download site said that recovery image for this device couldn't be downloaded at this time. I am not sure what I did but at one point, it did say Preparing
 for automatic repair but that was also stuck on a circle of death. So I restarted it again and we are back to the gray background just a moment circle of death.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Please help. I was wondering if there was any way to reset the computer without having access inside the Windows 10 (I can't get to that point) or if there are hard reset buttons that I am missing.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Just in case anyone else was having this problem as well or any other problems that might result in the circle of death. Here is the solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Register your surface book with your Microsoft account which will let you download the recovery image, just copy and paste the contents into a USB and boot from there. It will take a couple of hours to do a full reset and configure.</p>

<h2>            Windows Defender error 0x8c800222</h2>
                    <p>My wife is&nbsp;using a Samsung RV511 laptop with a core i3 intel processor, running 64bit Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>I found yesterday that Windows Update is not doing its job.</p>
<p>Trying to update Windows Defender I got the following message:-</p>
<p>"This program can't check for definition updates. Error found 0x8c800222. Length of message passed to NtRequestPort or NtRequestWaitReply was longer than the maximum message allowed by the port.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anti-spyware defintions version 1.135.1404.0 created 17/9/2012 at 08.18</p>
<p>I went to Microsoft.com - Support and searched for the error code which could not be found.&nbsp; However, the Fix It tool was offered so I allowed it to run. It claimed to have 'fixed' two windows update issues but it didn't solve the problem as when I ran an
 update request from Defender I got the same error code and message</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only does she have this problem but I've found that Internet Explorer updates haven't been downloaded since 2010!</p>

<br />
Thank you. The problem was less with Windows Defender than with Windows Update per se.&nbsp; Windows Update was apparently running, but doing nothing. I may have quoted the wrong error message as later I was reading 0xc8000222.<br />
I tried to install and run the Windows Update Standalone Installer from KB947821 but it returned the same error 0xc8000222.<br />
I then followed the instructions in KB971058, leaving out step 4 as instructed. It was not a perfect exercise -
<br />
1 All of the attempts to rename files using REN statements failed (syntax errors?)<br />
2 mshtml.dll, shdocvw.dll, qmgr.dll and browseui.dll loaded but entry point DllRegisterServer was not found<br />
3 msxml.dll, gpkcsp.dll, sccbase.dll, slbcsp.dll, initpki.dll, wuaueng1.dll, wucltui.dll, wuweb.dll, and muweb.dll all failed to load - message said make sure binary is stored at specific path or debug to check for problems with the binary or dependant dll
 file; specified module could not be found.<br />
4 As for resetting Winsock, the command 'netsh reset winsock' returned command not found 'reset winsock'<br />
Having gone through as much as I could do, I restarted and found no change to Windows Update functionality - so that was a big waste of time.<br />
However, late at night all was not lost. I found a solution on another website (not Microsoft) and successfully download 781mb of accumulated updates. The solution was found at http://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-7/cannot-run-windows-update-on-a-windows-7-pc/&nbsp;
 - the workaround was easy to do and dealt with the problem. I take my hat off to the guy.<br />

At 1% of upgrade installation the upgrade stops with the following message 'windoes cannot copy files required for installation.&nbsp; The files may be corrupt or missing.&nbsp; Make sure all files required for installation are available then restart. Error 0x8007001.<br />
previous to the upgrade I had run the upgrade check and removed programs listed.<br />
I cannot locate any info on the error message.&nbsp; I have tried to obtain support, have entered the product no exactly as it is in the package and it is not recognised.&nbsp; Having purchased the product been unable to install it's a little annoying to find no means
 of help other than relying on goodwill or a cost of 46.00.<br />
New day. new start. new error message.&nbsp; E:\data error (cyclic redundancy check) A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available.<br />
I've tried to return the upgrade advised by the provider to contact msoft support - hmm tried that the product key is not recognised (yes I have keyed in accurately) without a recognised product key I will be charged for assistance to install a new product.&nbsp;
 Have I been here before?&nbsp;

<div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
Make sure the Windows 7 disc is clean and no scratches exist. Disconnect any external/usb devices before upgrading.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Disable any security software before attempting to upgrade or do a clean install. Don’t forget to enable it back after upgrade. Make sure your computer is updated (device drivers and applications).<br />
<div>While trying to contact Microsoft support it might have asked for product ID. Product ID and Product Key are different.&nbsp;
<br />
<div><br />
You may try performing flat installation and check if this helps.<br />
<br />
A flat installation may help resolve problems that occur when you install Windows Vista. For example, a flat installation provides the following benefits:
<br />
&gt;A flat installation verifies that all files are successfully copied before the installation starts.
<br />
&gt;A flat installation avoids problems that are related to the CD drive or to the DVD drive.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Note</strong> The hard disk must have at least 3GB of free disk space for Windows&nbsp;7 installation files. The hard disk must have at least 16 GB of additional free disk space to install Windows 7. For more information about the system requirements for
 Windows 7, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

<br />
<ol>
<li>Insert the Windows 7 installation disk. </li><li>Start Windows Explorer. </li><li>In Windows Explorer, click to select the drive for the Windows 7 installation disk.
</li><li>In the <strong>Edit</strong> menu, click <strong>Select All</strong>. </li><li>In the Edit menu, click <strong>Copy</strong>. </li><li>Click to select the hard drive that you want to contain the flat installation files.
</li><li>In the <strong>File</strong> menu, point to <strong>New</strong>, click <strong>

<p>Hello, Thank you, I've followed your instruction.&nbsp; The disk is clean no scratches.&nbsp; Nothing in the upgrade package to indicate a product ID.&nbsp; Anti virus and&nbsp;Firewall off</p>
<p>&nbsp;I ran the Windows 7 compatibility check again, no issues found.</p>
<p>The install stopped at 1032 items with the following message 'cannot read from the source file or disk.&nbsp; boot.wim type WIM file size 137 mb date modified 14/07/2009 09.26.&nbsp; I retried and got the same message.&nbsp; I then skipped.</p>
<p>Several minutes later the installation stopped again with the following message: cannot read from the source file or isk install.wim type wimfile 2.03 gb.&nbsp; Re-tried same message.&nbsp; Skipped.</p>
<p>Went to install Windows 7 - install ran for a few seconds and the following message appeared 'Windoes was unable to loate required installion file (boot.WIM).&nbsp; Verify the installation source is valid and re-start the installation.&nbsp; Error 0x80070002</p>

<p>In theory PCM uncompressed can give you a pure audio without the need to compress the audio to a core dolby digital or DTS sound codec. &nbsp;DTS is a form of audio compress audio codec. &nbsp; I don't believe the any game has been encoded with a lossless audio. &nbsp;The
 xbox is doing all the audio decoding and you can choose what it outputs.</p>
<p>For Games: &nbsp;DTS or uncompressed should be the same audio with little to no difference. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tested both and I actually prefer the DTS output due to it being slightly louder. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If game developers start to make games with lossless sound like on most blu-ray disk then switching to the lossless setting would be the way to go.</p>
<p>For Blu-ray: uncompressed is the way to go, most blu-ray movies are encoded with either DTS HD-master or Dolby TrueHD. &nbsp;The xbox is doing all the decoding on the system chip and is out putting as a PCM to a capable receiver.</p>
<p>Now there are some problems with this and I hope microsoft addresses this in a future upgrade. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have an Onkyo 7.1 receiver and system. The receiver supports PCM as well as DTS and yet none of my games, streaming content, or cable box outputs to 5.1 or 7.1. Any thoughts on this? I am really frustrated right now as I am an audiophile and have never
 experienced a problem like this with a blu ray player or anything before this. I also have a hum that never existed in my system until my Xbox one was introduced. Anyone else having this problem? Anyone know how to fix this?</p>

<p>When I set the HDMI audio to 5.1 Uncompressed I loose the dialogue in games but the TV sounds good. If I change it to DTS the games sound great but the TV sounds terrible. I hope they add Dolby Digital soon.</p>

<p>My son just purchased an XBox One, it took about 1 hr to do full set up &amp; install Forza, fairly simple. I am SOOOOOOOOOO disappointed with MS. I put in Lord of the Rings Blu-Ray disk to see how it looks and sounds. I noticed the Blu-Ray player does not play
 Dolby TrueHD &amp; DTS-HD Master Audio. What a HUGE mistake. So I either have to use my PS3 or go out and buy a Blu-Ray player now if I want to be able to watch those movies and utilize those features built in the Blu-Ray disks. I don't get it, the Xbox One is
 suppose to be All in one entertainment system for our living rooms, but you skimp on what a Home Theater is all about.</p>

<p>Those codecs will be supported in a future update for the Xbox One. I agree that they really dropped the ball with that, and it's one of several reasons that I've held off on purchasing a One yet.</p>

<p>You want to use uncompressed audio at any time you can because it yeilds the best representation to the original analog recording. Only use formats like DTS /DTS HD or Dolby Digital/Dolby TrueHD if the media you are playing was already compressed into that
 format. Most if not all games are always native PCM. Movies where compression is key use compression formats.</p>

<p>[quote user="DPC"] I noticed the Blu-Ray player does not play Dolby TrueHD &amp; DTS-HD Master Audio. [/quote]</p>
<p>Actually what happens is the xb1 is decoding the Dolby TrueHD or DTS-HD and passing it out to your AV receiver as uncompressed PCM. There is no difeerence in sound between uncompressed PCM and the HD audio formats. It's just a matter of which component is
 doing the decoding, and in this case it's the xb1.</p>
<p>I agree that the xb1 should be able to pass the HD audio formats to our AV receivers/processors and let the receiver do the decoding. I hope they fix this soon.</p>

<p>Hi well first of all I'm going to explain my situation I hadn't used my X-box for like 2 months then I start playing COD Black ops then I connected my console to Internet and an update appeared so I click on applying he update&nbsp; when it finished it said my
 console would restart and it did. As it restarted tha applying update appeared but before it completes a system update failed appears with the Status Code: &nbsp;3151-351F-B380-0402-C000-0001 I called Xbox support and they told me tht the final 8 digits meant that
 I have tamper with my console but I have never done such thing as I asked the reason he said that they didn't have that information but that they're formums where I can post this error and that I will receive help. Everytime that I turn my Xbox 360 console
 Applying update appears and the same status code message pops out I can't play any game because even if it's not connected to internet the "applying update appears inmediatly after I turn on my console". I can't play and so LITERALY my Xbox 360 is useless
 at the moment I know I haven't been banned because no message about being banned has appeared so I would like any informaion someone might have about these. Just for the record my Xbox360 worked perfectly before these update.</p>

<p>did you ever happen to replace the dvd drive. if yes and spoofed it. that is your reason. also try downloading the latest update from xbox.com and burn to a blank disc or to a usb stick and then turn on your 360 with the stick or disc in your drive. hopefully
 then it will complete the update</p>

<p>Note that doing what you did is a way to get banned. &nbsp;MS can detect this, and will assume that you flashed the drive to play pirated games, whether you did or not.</p>
<p>The only way that MS considers ok to replace a broken DVD drive is to send it to MS so they do it.</p>
<p>In any case, the reason your update failed is because you have the wrong DVD drive in there. &nbsp;If you look around, you may find a solution to this (search for your error on google), but it will require reflashing the drive again to a proper verison of the
 firmware, which again opens you up to a possible banning.</p>

<p>i say you set up a law suite against them considering you are allowed to do anything to your console after you have purchased it. i donno if you realize this but alot of ppl that got banned for flashing there 360s to read back ups won their cases for this

<p>[/quote]<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">How is it "illegal on their (Microsoft's) part"? &nbsp;Sure, you may have "paid" for the console, but Microsoft are NOT preventing people who tamper with their console from accessing their 360. &nbsp;They are preventing them from
 accessing Xbox Live. &nbsp;Something YOU DO NOT OWN. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p>no they have completely bricked my friends console. she replaced her disk drive and now since she hooked it up to live even if she un hooks it from the internet it just pops up with the update thing. she cant close it to play a game or n e thing. and since
 it was out of warranty it makes sense to replace the disk drive yourself then send it to microsoft and get charged 120 dollars. and we pay for xbox live it aint free.

            <p>Hello, define how you installed it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you use the driver disk that came with the printer?</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Did you use windows update to download and search for the driver?</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Did you use the manufacturer of the printer's website to install the driver?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How are you connecting to the printer?&nbsp; USB, ethernet, wireless?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing you could try doing is uninstalling the printer, removing the drivers, then going to manufacturer's website and downloading the latest driver.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
The CAUSE for all of those is a Windows component which means something <br />
else&nbsp;drove it into Fault. Do not always load Driver Verifier as it can cause instability<br />
when there would otherwise be none. <br />
<br />
BiosVersion = 68SCE Ver. F.01<br />
BiosReleaseDate = 03/11/2011<br />
SystemManufacturer = Hewlett-Packard<br />
SystemProductName = HP ProBook 6560b<br />
SystemFamily = 103C_5336AN<br />
SystemVersion = A0001D02<br />
SystemSKU = LG652EA#AB9<br />
BaseBoardManufacturer = Hewlett-Packard<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Check with HP Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in
<br />
their forums about any known issues. Update the <strong>BIOS</strong>, <strong>low level chipset drivers</strong>,</p>
<p>and <strong>the major on-board and separate device drivers</strong>. Be sure to check with those<br />
resource to see if your unit is fully Windows 10 compatible.<br />

<strong>2. </strong>Try the Clean Boot method to see if that helps. - it a process of elimination.<br />
<br />
How to perform a Clean Boot in Windows &lt;- Windows 10 is essentially the same<br />
as Windows 8/8.1.<br />

<strong>3.</strong> Run the memory&nbsp;tests (see methods below).<br />
<br />
<strong>4. </strong>As needed use ALL the methods in the&nbsp;troubleshooters below.<br />
<br />
<strong>5. </strong>After ALL the above if needed run DriverVerifier to&nbsp;see if it can indicate a<br />
CAUSE (see DriverVerifier methods below).<br />

==================================================<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : <br />
<br />
Run DriverView -&nbsp;set&nbsp;VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without <br />
Dump in their names (and&nbsp;update BIOS and chipset).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

 but this option doesn't exist anymore in this Skype, and today I saw a message from somebody from my contact list sending me a link, with my email why? and I found out on internet that is a virus.. why do I receive this? is my contact aware that he sent me

<br />
<br />    Sign into Skype.

<br />    Under Allow calls from..., click the radio button for people in my Contact list only.

            That privacy option does not currently exist in Skype 8.x. If you require that, you would have to revert to
<a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">classic Skype (7.x)</a>. In regards to the link you were sent, if that was from your contact, even that privacy setting would not stop that link. When you recieve links like that
 from your contacts ,it generally means that their Skype account has been comprimised. You may want to send them a message back suggesting they change their Skype password immediately.&nbsp; If you are recieving messages or links from people who are not your contacts,
 you can always block them.

    <title>Why does Windows Media Player reload my entire library every time I - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaws1387  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Windows Media Player reload my entire library every time I open it&#63;</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 64-bit. I recently reformatted (yes, a clean installation). Every single time I close and open Windows Media Player, my entire library resets. It starts with nothing, and then has to readdo everything. My playlists, my music, my pictures.
 Everything. <br />
<br />
I've looked at other questions, and none seem to be related. I tried one that suggests renaming the media player folder in the appdata folder, I tried another that suggests stopping the network sharing service. Nothing. I have 14 gigs of music, and this gets
 rather tiresome. I like WMP and don't really want to learn a new interface that comes with other media players.

            let's try this the manual way:<br />
First stop media sharing service...then<br />
go to c:/users/your user name/appdata/local/microsoft/mediaplayer<br />
then delete all of the windows media library files.<br />
let me know what happens,<br />

                    <p>I am having a repetitive issue occur when restarting my computer.&nbsp; Every time I have to restart it, after a program update or installing new software, the computer hangs on the screen that displays restarting.&nbsp; It remains there and then a BSoD appears.&nbsp;
 I have provided the link to the most recent mini dump file below.&nbsp; I ran it through the Windows Debugging software and it reported that raspppoe.sys was the cause.&nbsp; Is there anyway to correct this?</p>

            Hi Eric.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you all possible fixes for Sleep, based on ten years troubleshooting it almost daily.  If you need help performing any step just ask back:
<br />
<br />First confirm you have the Sleep options configured correctly as shown here:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2843-change-power-plan-settings-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2843-change...</a>.  
<br />
<br />You might want to try Hibernate to succeed Sleep, or use Hibernate in place of Sleep - it's just a deeper sleep that actually powers off because desktop stored in RAM during sleep is written to hard drive hiberfile then powered off.  
<br />
<br />Most Sleep problems are caused by the Display driver, so try updating yours from the PC or Device maker's Support Downloads web page for your full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service tag.  While there make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Network, Sound, USB and all other drivers by comparing those posted for download with the version and date of the corresponding ones in the Device Manager.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then in Device Manager on Display device Driver tab choose Roll back, Uninstall (then restart to reinstall) or try another one previously installed at Device Manager&gt;Display adapter&gt;Driver&gt;Update Driver&gt;Browse&gt;Let me pick.  
<br />
<br />In addition there are steps here to specifically troubleshoot Sleep mode problems:  <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-sleep-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-sle...</a>
<br />
<br />What I do is go into Advanced Power options and set Display and Sleep to 1 minutes, Hibernate to 2 minutes, then after completing each step restart the PC and observe what happens for 3 minutes.  
<br /> 
<br />Also did it previously work?  Do you have a System Restore point from when it did?<a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />This may have been caused by Windows Updates.  Check which Updates were installed right before the problem began, and if necessary uninstall them from Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.
<br />
<br />You can also try to roll back using System Restore to a point before this began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if an Update reinstalls and causes the same problem uninstall or roll it back again, then immediately hide it using the Hide Updates tool from Method Two here:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi EricSohn 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Please try these options one by one and check after each option.
<br />
<br />1. Troubleshoot Power
<br />Type troubleshoot in Cortana Search &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down &gt; Click Power &gt; Run the troubleshooter &gt; Follow on-screen direction.
<br />
<br />2. Restore Default for Power Settings
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; sleep &gt; Click Additional power settings to open Power options &gt; Click Change Plan Settings &gt; Click Restore default settings for this plan
<br />
<br />3. Disable Fast Startup
<br />Reach to Power options as in previous step &gt; Click Choose what the power buttons do &gt; Click Change settings that are currently unavailable &gt; Scroll down to Shutdown settings and uncheck Turn on fast startup &gt; Click Save changes
<br />
<br />4. Uninstall / Install Battery Driver (Only for laptops)
<br />Shut down your computer &gt; Detach power chord &gt; Remove battery (if fixed no need to remove) &gt; Attach power chord &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; Expand Batteries &gt; Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System &gt; Uninstall &gt; Shutdown the computer &gt; Remove the power chord &gt; Attach your battery &gt; Attach your power chord &gt; Reboot the computer to automatically install the driver
<br />
<br />5. As a last resort, you should perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade (This is not an install of Windows). Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br />

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi Quinn.  I"m Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />Just checking:  Have you perhaps uninstalled Edge as that removes web search from the search box on task bar?  I'd try resetting Edge too in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Microsoft Edge &gt; Repair &amp; Reset to reinvoke the web search function it provides.
<br />
<br />Run the Search and Indexing troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Have you installed the newest drivers for your video card?<br />
<br />
<br />
Download Video Drivers <br />
<br />
Go to the website of the manufacturer and select your model (this is usually done in the Support section). You should have the option to download drivers for your model if they have drivers for your Windows version. Download the driver(s) and follow the instructions
 to install - the process can vary with different manufacturers so I can't give you exact directions.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Then Change The Screen Resolution<br />
<br />
1. Right click on your Desktop<br />
2. Click Screen Resolution<br />
3. Select the resolution you want<br />
4. Click apply<br />
5. ﻿Click Keep to use the new resolution, or click Revert to go back to the previous resolution.<br />
<br />
