<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the reply did not address the question I had.&nbsp; But the answer did not address my question. &nbsp;&nbsp; In any program, if I slide the cursor over a word, paragraph, etc.. it will "mark" those words so I can cut/copy, etc them..&nbsp; Now, when I mark the
 section is is marked I a dark blue.&nbsp; I want to make the color more easily transparent but cannot find out how,&nbsp; I changed the color by accident and cannot figure out how to change it back.</p>
<p>What do I need to do?&nbsp; Or what question should I ask?&nbsp; I am running Win10.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>See if this sorts it out,</p>
<p>First verify which Microsoft Net Framework you have installed</p>
<p>Click Start and type in the search box</p>
<p>uninstall a program</p>
<p>Look through the list for it </p>
<p>If using 32 bit and you have Net 4.6.1 uninstall it</p>
<p>Then download Net 4.5.2 and install it unless you already have it</p>
<p>If you have a lower version install 4.5.2</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42642</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the error still happens,</p>
<p>Switch your windows update setting to Never check for updates temporarily<br />
<br />
Restart the machine<br />
Then download this to your downloads folder to run it from there,<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/MS16-039?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/MS16-039?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</a><br />
<br />
Download the x86 for 32 bit system or x64 for a 64 bit system<br />
<br />
Install it and restart when prompted too after it does a stand alone search for updates which shouldn't<br />
take too long it took all of 5 seconds "If" the windows update settings are switched to Never check for<br />
updates before running it from the downloads folder.<br />
<br />
Once it installs and restarts<br />
You can reset your updates setting to whatever you had prior = Default....<br />
Then manually check for updates.<br />
<br />
I believe the solution came from Softpedia and Joel_CS posted it on this thread,<br />
<a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/windows-update-hanging-when-downloading-april-12-patches-502886.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://news.softpedia.com/news/windows-update-hanging-when-downloading-april-12-patches-502886.shtml</a><br />

<p>Does anyone have any idea how I can play Halo 4 Multiplayer in splitscreen mode with a friend? &nbsp;I have Xbox Live Gold, and we've tried signing him in as a Guest, but I keep getting the error that the account doesn't have permission to join Xbox Live. &nbsp;Thanks
 so much in advance!</p>

<p>I contacted Xbox Live support with the same issue. This is what worked for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign out of Xbox LIVE. In the Xbox home screen, go to System -&gt; Storage -&gt; All Devices (or Hard Drive) -&gt; Profiles.
</li><li>Go through each Profile* and select 'Delete Profile Only.' <strong>(DO NOT SELECT 'Delete Profile and Items.')</strong> Don't worry, you won't permanently lose any of your achievements or downloads. If your system won't let you delete your profile, restart
 your system, make sure you are signed out of Xbox Live, and try again. </li><li>Make sure you are signed out of any accounts. Then, hit the Xbox button on your controller. Select 'Download Profile.' Enter the e-mail address and password of whatever profile you have that has Xbox Live Gold. It will download all your achievements, and
 the like. </li><li>Sign into your account first, then jump onto Halo 4. From there, you should have no problem logging in a guest for online multiplayer.
</li></ol>
<p>Best of luck!</p>

<p>Thanks guys! It seems I was just confused about whether my friend needs an Xbox Live Gold account or not, in order to play multiplayer with me. &nbsp;I was hoping that he didn't need one and could play as a guest, but it seems that he did need to sign up for
 one in order to play. &nbsp;Thanks again.</p>

<p>Step 4 is saying to sign in with the primary profile, that has Xbox LIVE, launch Halo 4, and from the lobby you should be able to sign in your guest profile with a second controller.

<p><span>Hello
<span>pup,<br />
</span><br />
Can you&nbsp;confirm if you can access your account via Hotmail website (or web mail for non- Hotmail related account issues) to send or receive email? However, there are 2 possible causes why you've encountered this error message.
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Incorrect POP3 settings (usually the SSL option for SMTP) - check with your provider if it is required or not.
</span></li><li><span>Firewall is blocking the ports (usually port 25) - Windows Firewall generally allows this port through, unless specifically told not to
 do so.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>Kindly check your POP3 settings, listed below are the information&nbsp;to configure your account.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>POP3 Server:
<strong><span>pop3.live.com</span></strong> (<strong><span>port 995</span></strong>)&nbsp;
</span></li><li><span>SMTP Server:
<strong><span>smtp.live.com</span></strong> (<strong><span>port 25</span></strong>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<p><span>If the issue persists, please try to configure your account by following the steps provided in the Solution Article below:<br />

            Hi, thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
I am not sure what you mean with this answer. Maybe I have not made myself clear.<br />
<br />
I originally had two email accounts, hotmail and gmail. when using my PC at home I would open Windows Live Mail and use the two accounts from Windows Live Mail. I had no problem configuiring these accounts and both worked perfecly.<br />
<br />
I recently had a breach of privacy due to Googles new privcy policy so I deleted the gmail account and opened a new account at Zoho.com<br />
<br />
I configured the Zoho account to work with Live Mail. I have followed the instuctions given to allow pop3 in my zoho account, which is simply clicking a check box to allow access to all messages.<br />
<br />
When I try to send an email from my zoho account using live mail I get the message I mentioned in my first post, i.e. not recognining smtp.zoho.com. This is the correct address, I have double checked it<br />
<br />
Part of the set-up works as that messages in my zoho account will appear in Live Mail. Basically I can recieve but not send.<br />
<br />
The hotmail account works perfectly, as does the zoho account when accessing directly using my browser<br />
<br />
I have checked my firewall (comodo) and it is not blocking the ports<br />
<br />
I am not sure if it is a LiveMail problem or a Zoho problem, I am waiting for a reply from them.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Please try to disable the exisitng AV program (comodo) and check if there's an existing rule set in Windows Firewall with Advance Security. If there's a new rule for Outbound, please disable all the rules.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Do you mean disable the anti-virus programme? This is AVG, not comodo. windows firewall is disabled. Comodo firewall has the relevant port open.<br />
<br />
Incidentally there is a problem when I click on the link to this post from the notification email. The tab will not open properly, constantly shifting from the tab title to the revolving wait symbol. Non of the linkls work as the page is not working properly.
 Ido not know if this is related to my email problem but no other web page behaves like this.This is why I posted I could not see the upload button to upload the log file as it had not loaded. I have to go to the thread directly to reply.<br />
<br />
I will now try and disable the AV program (difficult, I will have to search to find out how, it cannot simply be stopped)<br />

<p>Hi <span>pup,<br />
</span><br />
For us to isolate the issue regarding, kindly create another user profile in your account.<br />
<br />
Please visit this <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>link</strong> </a>on how to do this. After doing the process, kindly login to the new user name you've created to check if the issue still persists.<br />
<br />
However, the reason behind&nbsp;that we want to disable your AV security setting is&nbsp;for us to rule out&nbsp;if there's possibility of severity for filtering your outgoing messages.<br />
<span><br />
Thanks,<br />

    <title>Last Win 10 update disabled my scanner - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rontiara  say:</h3>
<h2>            Last Win 10 update disabled my scanner</h2>
                    <p>I had two scanners and two printers which worked fine with Windows 10 -- until that ghastly update in September, 2016, which disabled almost all of my peripherals, including the scanners and printers. I had to buy a new printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After Microsoft hastily issued a fix for that update, my Canon scanner worked again -- until the last update last week. Now Win 10 doesn't recognize the scanner any more. Or should I say again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting really tired of MS's arbitrarily disabling my equipment at what seems to be their whim.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Canon has not issued a driver update for whatever happens to be the latest configuration of Win 10, and I can't say I blame them. The point is, the scanner worked fine until MS started "updating". As far as I can tell, they haven't updated anything except
 my blood pressure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a small business -- I don't have an IT department with unlimited funds at my disposal. I just want to get my equipment working reliably.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody have any idea how I can get my scanner working again?</p>

            <p>Yes, use full software package to get normal scanning from device - although Windows Fax and Scan can sometimes suffice if you want to run it from the PC, and will sometimes work with just the basic driver from maker or Windows Update (Open Windows Fax and
 Scan app to see if it detects printer).</p>

            <p>Greg, I think I owe you an apology.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some further research, and discovered that Adobe has terminated support of TWAIN scanners. Their update to Adobe Acrobat came about the same time as Microsoft's update. I had been using Acrobat to access the Scangear interface program</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I discovered, to my astonishment, that I can still access the scanner using, of all things, WordPerfect X6! It's clunky, but it allows me to use the scanner's user interface, which was most important to me, as it allows fairly extensive tweaking before
 the scan. Windows Fax &amp; Scan is pretty much useless for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will keep a copy of your instructions for later reference if I need it. I think perhaps downloading the full package driver for Windows 8 might help; the one I've been using is for Win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            Program install error&#58; A file that is required cannot be installed because the cabinet file setup has an invalid digital signature</h2>
                    
<p>Original title: Cabinet file setup 11.cab has an invalid digital signature.</p>
<p>When trying to install a software programme on my Windows 7 Netbook, an Installer Information Panel stated "A file that is required cannot be installed because the cabinet file setup 11.cab has an invalid digital signature. This may indicate that the cabinet
 file is corrupt". Thus the programme would not load. Is the problem with the software or with the Windows 7 Netbook? If the Netbook is the problem, can the faulty cabinet file be removed and replaced with a correct file? If so, how? Please help. Thank you.</p>

    <title>Change Windows Firewall settings to block Foxit update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Change Windows Firewall settings to block Foxit update</h2>
                    <p>Howdy friends,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overview:<br />
I need help crafting firewall settings that will prevent Foxit Reader updates.<br />
<br />
Details:<br />
When I run Foxit Reader I can see 'Foxit Reader.exe' in Task Manager. When I run Foxit Update (from Foxit Reader menu or from Start Menu's Run line), I see 'Foxit Update.exe' in Task Manager. Foxit Update starts downloading an update. Obviously, it is not being
 blocked. I need to block Foxit Reader &amp; Foxit Update from the Internet. The firewall settings are shown below. They don't work.<br />
<br />

</p><p>Note: Antivirus software and firewall can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software and firewall. If you have to temporarily disable them to install other software,
 you should re-enable them as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software and firewall are disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>

            <p>Hello Ratandeep,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help.</p>
<blockquote>Is your computer connected to a domain network?</blockquote>
<p>No.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>This issue may occur due to incorrect <strong>Foxit
</strong>update or Windows firewall settings.</blockquote>
<p>I'm sorry I didn't state my issue clearly. Foxit update is not really the issue. It is an example. The issue is that I can't devise a way to set up the firewall to block a program's outbound Internet access. Setting global outbound access to "Outbound connections
 that do not match a rule are blocked" doesn't work. So I created particular blocking rules to specifically block 'Foxit Reader.exe' &amp; 'Foxit Update.exe' as shown in my OP, and those also don't work. I must be misinterpreting something. It's confusing because
 the documentation here: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=137813" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=137813</a>, mentions only inbound permission whereas I'm interested in outbound blocking. Regarding blocking, the settings are confusing. For example, does "Allowed Users: Any" in a blocking context mean that "Any" user
 is blocked? Or that "Any" user is "Allowed"? (i.e., not blocked) Since nothing I do works, "blocked" -vs- "Allowed" remains unresolved (and mysterious).</p>

<p>1, That's a different product, and 2, it doesn't resolve the underlying problem.
<strong>I need to block outbound connections <em>at the firewall</em>.</strong> Why? Well, In addition to the issue of blocking program updates (the subject of this thread), there is the much more serious issue of trojan viruses.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Blocking A Trojan Virus Download.</strong></p>
<p>About 4 years ago, my computer picked up a drive-by trojan that exploited a javascript array-overflow vulnerability. The vulnerability allowed the trojan to copy its trojan payload across a memory segment into the lower part of another running task. When
 the multitasking scheduler resumed that compromised task, the task went to a web site in Ukraine and downloaded a rootkit key logger that was later identified as
<strong><em>Bagle</em></strong> (related to the email virus). Since it was a rootkit, anti-virus software didn't detect it. It took me 4 months to discover
<strong><em>Bagle</em></strong> and another 4 months to get rid of it -- it was a prolific (zombie) rootkit that kept coming back. Note that, though 4 months had transpired, I was able to recover the evidence from an old cache and I examined the javascript
 trojan and disassembled its payload and recovered the URL of the Ukraine server that sourced
<strong><em>Bagle</em></strong> -- by that time, the server had been shut down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows Firewall had blocked all outbound connections by default, the temporarily compromised (in-memory) task wouldn't have been able to download the
<strong><em>Bagle</em></strong> rootkit and my computer would not have been infected (and the next time I booted the machine, the trojan would have disappeared). But I've never found a way to block all outbound connections. Believe me, I've tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since that experience, I've switched to Internet-browsing via a Linux virtual machine, but program updates is still an issue in Windows because a Linux virtual machine can't update a Windows application.</p>

<p>This article is non-specific and vague and appears to apply only to inbound connections.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>Note: Antivirus software and firewall can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software and firewall. If you have to temporarily disable them
 to install other software, you should re-enable them as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software and firewall are disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.<br />
</blockquote>
<p>That is bad advice. You should NEVER bring the firewall down. Besides that, this is not applicable to my problem.</p>

<br />
I didn't know there was a Preferences beyond "Trust Manager" -- "Updater" doesn't appear in the height of my monitor display --
<strong>Administers self-dope slap!</strong><br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
That still leaves the issue of blocking all outbound connections. I wrote about trojan downloaders. What do you think of that?<br />

            <p>Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Bitdefender&nbsp;and I cannot help with Windows Firewall.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you might find useful guidance by searching this forum for <em>Windows Firewall block outgoing connection</em>s.&nbsp; Raise your own question with that title if there is nothing useful at the moment&nbsp;- I do recall that several of the regular contributors
 have posted about firewall issues in the past.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If this forum does not help you find out how to get to grips with your current issue then
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TechNet</a> or
<a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MSDN</a> might have useful information or provide useful responses to a question you post there.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - -</p>
<p>
</p><p>I switched to Bitdefender because I was annoyed with MSSE for having allowed the Registry malware Trojan.Poweliks.B onto my computer.&nbsp; It was supposed to be able to recognise it &amp; deal with it but I only discovered it when it had been there for at least
 six months [which I discovered by restoring then running Malwarebytes &amp; ESET Poweliks removal tool on every system image I had made over that period].&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Malwarebytes can deal with rootkits.&nbsp; Malwarebytes proved itself at the time by cleaning out the Trojan - I double-checked by using ESET's Poweliks removal tool [which I double-checked in turn by running it first after some image restorations and then running
 Malwarebytes afterwards].&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Afterwards, I selected Bitdefender because it came out so well for effectiveness in testing &amp; I found specific rootkit references in the user manual - see
<a href="http://www.av-test.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.av-test.org</a> for test results for many common anti-malware utilities.&nbsp; {<em>Norton did almost as well but it had a fault in my Windows 10 computer and I ditched it when online tech support
 proved that they barely even knew which day it was so I lost faith in the product's effectiveness.</em>}</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are considering a move then note that you can run a free 30 day trial for Bitdefender and during the trial period they will offer you a 50% discount to buy it.&nbsp; After a month or so, they will offer you a 25% discount to renew your subscription at
 the end of the first year.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked my <a href="http://www.bitdefender.co.uk/solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Bitdefender internet security 2016</a> both through its UI and in its user guide; it does have the ability to block outbound / inbound / both ways traffic for individual applications [it's on pages 119-120]&nbsp; I did not save a link straight to the download page
 for the user guide so it must have been fairly easily discoverable from the main product pages as I downloaded it before even downloading the trial version.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best,</p>

</p><p>You are a prince among men (...and probably among women, too).&nbsp; 8^)&nbsp; Unfortunately, it appears that the Bitdefender site got a marketing-lobotomy. I could find no links to user manuals -- but don't waste your time conducting a search for my benefit because

(similar to the preceeding case).<br />
<br />
From the above, it appears that my installation of Win FW is actually broken. I have no clue how to fix it. I will submit a question as a separate thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>I currently run VirtualBox with a Win7 Host and 2 Guests: Linux Mint &amp; Tails. I have a new terra-byte drive for my laptop and I installed Win10 on it and validated the license. However, I have read some very disturbing things about Win10 and have decided
 to go in another direction. I'm looking to initialize the terra-byte drive with dual-boot: Linux Suse (primary) &amp; Win7 (secondary) with 2 VBox Guests in Suse: a throwaway frozen Suse hard-coded just for on-line banking, and WinXP without a network connection
 at all. So you see, I will need no firewall and no antivirus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.<br />
<br />

Mark.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I did once reset Windows Firewall [Windows 7] and that was a simple matter of using a control that was on its initial screen.&nbsp; It might be worth your doing so just to eliminate it as a cause of problems if&nbsp;your firewall&nbsp;seems to be broken.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found a text file output from having run the Windows Firewall [Windows 7] troubleshooter so I must have used that at some stage.&nbsp; I have no notes about how I ran it but think that it must also have been a link given on its initial screen.&nbsp; Like all
 the other troubleshooters it might help but, then again, it might achieve absolutely nothing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lots of people have concerns about Windows 10.&nbsp; I've been using it since the start of last year and have been able to get round its main annoyances - updates eventually proved very easy to control &amp; the only real problem about privacy was that I had to read
 a lot of MS privacy&nbsp;documents to find out that there was no substantive difference between its privacy &amp; that of Windows 7 as long as the appropriate
<em>Settings </em>were used.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I set up my 11 year old XP to dual boot with Win10 and it has given a whole new lease of life to it.&nbsp; I did not have to spend any money as I joined up during the Preview period and have just kept that same installation running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not yet upgraded my 6 year old Windows 7 computer to Windows 10 but I set up a dual-boot on that as well - so I have been able to test Windows 10 quite thoroughly on it and I have no remaining concerns.&nbsp; I will upgrade the Windows 7 computer before
 the 29 July deadline since I have no reason to think this computer will die before the end of Windows 7 extended support [14 Jan 2020].</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's up to you but if you want to tell me what your Windows 10&nbsp;<em>very disturbing things</em> are then I might have tested or at least read about relevant solutions.&nbsp; And if you are determined to avoid upgrading your Windows 7 dual-boot&nbsp; then see
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/02d34ee4-66c1-4034-8d77-8009da6250cb?threadId=8a16a905-f9ac-4432-88d3-f8bd2331628a">
Disable Windows 10 upgrade</a>&nbsp;[the solution is so pathetically simple that it is worth implementing it even if you just want to disable&nbsp;the upgrade&nbsp;for a short period].</p>

<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">was found by tCruzin4lyfe.&nbsp; That was a good find so props for that.&nbsp; Here's the article:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
"With EA announcing a new <em>Dead Space</em> title will be coming next year, fans of the series are no doubt jumping about with glee. Well, brace yourselves: the latest rumors point to
<em>Dead Space 3</em> featuring drop-in and drop-out coop. You heard that right.</span><br />
<br />
Dead Space 3 will see a new character join Issac Clarke in his mission, serving as a guide throughout the main campaign. No name was given, but the man will wear their own RIG suit – though, unlike Issac, this one will emit a red glow from the helmet. When
 his helmet is off, players can expect to see a lovely scar on his face. We wonder if this is the Shadow Isaac that was mentioned a few months ago.<br />
<br />
According to IGN's source, this new character will also serve as a co-op partner, with players able to drop in and out of co-op at whim. However, those playing solo will see a slightly altered story. For example, players in co-op will see Issac and the new
 character appear together in cutscenes, &nbsp;while&nbsp;those who play solo will only see Issac. As well, Issac’s moments of psychological torment will be absent during co-op play. Well, at least he won’t appear in solo games.<br />
<br />
The co-op mode will also see players work together to solve puzzles, using some of Issac’s staple abilities such as&nbsp;telekinesis&nbsp;and stasis. Interestingly, once a player goes down they cannot be revived, the checkpoint will instead be reloaded – makes sense
 considering the gruesome ways Issac can die in the first two games.<br />
<br />
Now, I’m an open minded guy; I don’t really have problems with change in a game. If a studio thinks it’s a good idea to “modernize” or “streamline” their games, I’m all for it. But this just seems… off. It’s not that co-op wouldn’t work in the Dead
 Space universe – it worked well in<em> Dead Space: Extraction</em>- but for the core titles I’ve always felt that it was about the solo experience, being isolated and able to explore the environment at one’s own pace. That said, if what
<em>IGN</em>‘s source says is true, then co-op is entirely optional. Let’s just hope there aren’t any co-op only achievements – since some players won’t likely have an interest in playing
<em>Resident Evil 5</em>with necromorphs.<br />
<br />
Oh, and apparently Issac is now able to crouch, do evasive rolls and get into firefights with human enemies.&nbsp; Another series of controversial choices."<br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><br />
This will surely be a divisive issue, and everyone's entitled to his or her own opinion.&nbsp; Personally I think the person behind this article is spot on.&nbsp; Dead Space is best served in solo.&nbsp; Co-op will probably take away some of the fear that made the first two
 so good.&nbsp; But... if we have to have co-op, they're doing it perfect.&nbsp; First off drop in/drop out co-op is perfect.&nbsp; Co-op games are very frustrating where if someone leaves, the game ends.&nbsp; Props for that.&nbsp; Like the person said, we don't have to play the game
 in co-op if we want to.&nbsp; Perfect.&nbsp; I still feel Resident Evil 5 was lessened by having a forced co-op partner with us at all times.&nbsp; Whether we liked it or not, there was someone hold our hands at all times.&nbsp; Didn't have that same "Oh ****!" feeling like the
 previous games.&nbsp; I'm glad to hear that DS3 will give us the option to play it in solo, or with a friend.
</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">It especially sounds interesting to me that we'll be able to play through the game in two different ways, depending on if it's solo, or co-op.&nbsp; This is the first I've heard of Shadow Isaac and that intrigues me very much.&nbsp; With him
 playing through the game with normal Isaac, the dynamics should be interesting.&nbsp; Ying and Yang perhaps...&nbsp; Besides the visual differences, sounds like his personality will be greatly different from normal Isaac's.&nbsp; Very cool how the story will be a little
 different depending on how you play it, giving a different feel for the two.&nbsp; "As well, Issac’s moments of psychological torment will be absent during co-op play."&nbsp; Also cool that the cutscenes will be different when one mode is played.&nbsp; I find it lazy and
 lame when games that have a separate co-op mode, have the same cutscenes, just showing one character in both versions.&nbsp; Seems like they're really going to be careful with co-op because they know some fans will be up-in-arms about it.&nbsp;</span>
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">It's cool that there will be co-op puzzles that require kinesis and stasis.&nbsp; Should be a more calm break from all of the necro killing.&nbsp; Also cool that if one player goes down, you must revert to the previous checkpoint.&nbsp; There will
 be no hand holding like there is in RE5 and the LFD's.&nbsp; Sounds like there will be no revival.&nbsp; This will probably and hopefully make the co-op mode a little more intense, and encourage more teamwork.&nbsp; Hopefully this will cause less people to play through the
 game Rambo style with no fear of the consequences, as seen in RE5 and the LFD's.&nbsp;
</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">After the first game, the developers made DS2 more action-packed and theatrical because a lot of people complained the game was too scary.&nbsp; Many people complained at this move, but in the end I feel it turned out great.&nbsp; Very theatrical
 and more action-packed, but just as scary.&nbsp; Hopefully the game is still scary (I'm sure it will be) with the new control abilities like crouching and evasive roles.&nbsp; More control in my opinion is a good thing.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure they will stay true to the horror-filled
 tension that is so great about the series.&nbsp; I hope so at least.&nbsp;</span> <br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">To sum up it sounds like we DS fans will be able to have our cake, and eat it too.&nbsp; We won't have to play with a partner, but we'll have the option to.&nbsp; After I beat the single-player mode FIRST to completion like I did in DS1 and
 DS2, I'll be able to switch over to co-op for a different experience.&nbsp; Personally I really enjoy co-op games, and enjoy playing them just to play them.&nbsp; Never gets old for me playing them while helping others to complete things.&nbsp; Should add much longevity
 to the game for me.&nbsp; I was sort of hoping if there was co-op, Ellie would be the second player, but Shadow Isaac sounds cool too.&nbsp; With everything I hear about the game, I get more and more excited.&nbsp; Can't wait!</span><br />

<p>I am excited about it. The main thing I love is that it's "optional". I will do the same, turn my lights off, cell phone on vibrate, tv up and play through DS3 solo and then sometime after that I will co-op with a buddy. I love DS as a series and DS2 was
 a major improvement and I think 3 will be even better. I've heard the whisper of Shadow Isaac when they first mentioned the envoirment it would take place so I found it interesting. As long as the scares are there, that's what matters. I want it to keep the
 same survival/ horror feel as the 1st two games. So far I haven't heard of any leaked info that really worries me because though they are trying some new things, they are still very well in the realm of what makes Dead Space awesome. Plus we have to remember
 we can't keep the same formula for each game so fighting human enemies may sound like a bad thing, it actually makes sense going by what the setting is suppose to be. As long as its not overkill it should be fine.</p>

<p>Hopefully the lack of leaked info is a good thing...maybe since fans can't speculate on how certain details will pan out, there won't be any preconceptions about whether certain additions are good/bad! I think that (preconceptions) definitely enables negative
 opinions of sequels. I'm not sure what was leaked before the release of DS2, but if a similar pattern is followed for DS3, it might mean we won't be disappointed with DS3. *crosses fingers* Sequels are always controversial, but it also sounds like the DS series
 has done an above average job with the DS2 sequel not disappointing. I agree that the addition of coop does make me nervous...what hooked me to DS2 was how freaking scary it was! No other game had that...not L4D, Dead Island, or even Fear. Fear 2 was pretty
 good, but NOT AT ALL like DS2, lol. I'm excited for DS3, though! DS2 was definitely one of my favorite and most memorable games I've played!</p>

<p>I have no doubt Visceral will deliver another hit sequel. Multiplayer in Dead Space 2 no doubt had it's kinks (mainly on EA's side, due to people either having trouble logging in because of problems with EA accounts, or not able to log on the servers), but
 for the most part they pulled it off. Most people are fearful that the co-op path means it's all downhill based on decisions &nbsp;taken by Capcom with Resident Evil.</p>
<p>I personally hope there is a splitscreen option, but rendering levels takes a lot out of console with newer games, so I won't hold my breath on it. But the idea to play co-op on the hardest difficulty would be extremely awesome.</p>

<p><br />

<p>[/quote]I have no doubt as well.&nbsp; There were a ton of&nbsp;skeptics who were very angry about Visceral making DS2 more action based, feeling the series would go downhill with that decision because the game wouldn't be as scary.&nbsp; Well they were wrong.&nbsp; DS2 was/is
 fantastic in the eyes of most people.&nbsp; Just as scary if not more.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure DS3 will be amazing and then some.<br />
<br />
I too did not like how there was a walking/talking/shooting/inventory box/medic next to us at all times in RE5.&nbsp; Whether we liked it or not, a partner was there to save us.&nbsp; Still a fun game, but just I felt it was a move in the wrong direction.&nbsp; The way they're
 doing it in DS3 however, is perfect.&nbsp; We get to have our cake, and eat it too.&nbsp; If someone doesn't want a co-op partner (AI or human), they simply can play by themselves.&nbsp; Problem solved.&nbsp; Like the author of that article said, the only possible downside of
 this aspect to a person who doesn't want co-op, is that there might be co-op exclusive achievements.&nbsp; Then again they're just achievements, meaning this would only matter to a completionist.&nbsp; Personally I don't feel the need to get 1000/1000 in my games, but
 do every now and then.&nbsp; Them adding a co-op mode for me means much more longevity of the game.&nbsp; With LFD2 for instance, I run co-op all the time.&nbsp; Probably put over 300 hours into it.&nbsp; DS3's co-op will probably be the same for me, pending we can host/join
 random games.&nbsp; Only a few games have co-op which can only be played with people on friends lists.&nbsp; This is sooooo stupid (some Halo games do this).&nbsp; Why even have co-op if you can't host/join random games and meet new people?&nbsp; Maybe they do this to cut costs
 on servers, but I don't know.&nbsp; I'm sure Visceral will be smarter than this.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Indeed.&nbsp; Being able to roll some co-op with a friend or stranger on the hardest difficulty would be pretty cool.&nbsp; The two would really have to work as a team, since one person going down means a forced revert to the previous checkpoint.&nbsp; It will be interesting
 to see if normal Isaac and Shadow Isaac have any different abilities, besides being a little different in the head.&nbsp; If anyone finds any new co-op info, please post it here or in a new thread.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
Agreed.&nbsp; Haven't heard anything that makes me nervous.&nbsp; Everything leads me to believe they're going to be careful with the new changes to make sure it still has a true Dead Space feel to it.&nbsp; Agree about the enemy formula too.&nbsp; Keeping things the same can
 lead to staleness.&nbsp; Only makes sense that Isaac will run into some human enemies after DS2.&nbsp; In my opinion it would not be realistic if he conveniently managed to get through the entire DS3 game without engaging them, while they're desperately looking for
 him the entire time.&nbsp; Only makes sense that they will cross paths at some point.&nbsp; In the last game they were there in a number of parts, but they just didn't directly fight each other.&nbsp; Each time the soldiers conveniently died by means other than Isaac (necros,
 gunship, etc...).&nbsp; If this happened again, it would just be weird.&nbsp; Plus a little payback towards the Scientologists... sorry Unitologists, will be welcome in my book.&nbsp;

<br />
It's still pretty early.&nbsp; With time more details will come out and the wild crying and speculation that happened about DS2, will happen again.&nbsp; Them including co-op will only guarantee a ton of people crying until they can no longer speak or type.&nbsp; To those
 people I would simply say, "You don't have to play co-op if you don't want to."&nbsp; I fully intend to play through singleplayer first.&nbsp; They can stick to that if they want.&nbsp; People cried and whined about how DS2 was probably going to be too action based, while
 not being scary enough to remain true to Dead Space.&nbsp; All of those people were proven wrong.&nbsp; The game turned out better and more scary in most people's minds than the first game.&nbsp; I'm sure Visceral will do an amazing job, and I'm sure it will be plenty scary.&nbsp;
 With or without a partner.&nbsp; I'm betting with co-op they'll compensate and make changes so it's scary enough for us DS fans.&nbsp;

<p>Im really hopin they show something at E3, even just a quick teaser. As soon as they announce preorders I am on it! This time I am getting the Limited/ Collectors Edition or whatever they are going to call it. I'm telling you this is my favorite game series
 ever. My gaming catalog may not be as long as most but I know DS2 got to me in a way no other game could. I still have plenty of other amazing games but DS2 just tips them all for me. Again, they haven't announce not has any info leaked that scares me. I also
 hope they add a Hard To The Core type of achievement again or even bring back the 1 Gun acheevo from the 1st game (which I never got lol) but I'm ready for another nail biting challenge. Oh yeah and the upgraded visuals from the Frostbite Engine is very welcomed.
 Man oh man, I can't wait. Now that's two heavy hitters at the beginning of 2013 for me, Dead Space 3 &amp; Bioshock Infinite :)</p>

 Marker paper weight like the one seen on the desk in the very beginning of DS2 (While Isaac's talking to the psychologist).&nbsp; I want it!!!<br />
<br />
Right with you.&nbsp; Plenty of other amazing games, but DS2 is the best.&nbsp; So polished.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Exactly.&nbsp; Insane in DS1 was too easy, but Hard to the Core was perfect.&nbsp; The entire process of getting it was extremely intense.&nbsp; White knuckle game at its best...&nbsp; Think you said it another thread, but it's easily the achievement I'm most proud of.&nbsp;

<p>Another thing, about there being "co-op achievements". They could do as ME3 did by giving you a choice. In ME3 you can get complete extraction on every map on gold OR finishthe single player campaign on Insanity. So something similar would not be a hassle
 for people who are not interested in co-op at all. </p>

<h2>            How to create folders and move photos from Picture Library&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have just bought a new laptop and am new to windows 8. I uploaded roughly around 300 pictures and they have all saved in the Pictures Library under one folder. I cannot work out how to create separate folders or even how to move any of the photos. They
 just appear as one long line to scroll through which is a real pain. Is there a way to create folders and to move the pictures around or am I supposed to use another app type thing to store them? Sorry if this question has been asked but I couldn't find the
 answer that I was looking for. Any help would be appreciated... </p>

    <title>Test Video shows inverted image in Skype in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grangeland  say:</h3>
<h2>            Test Video shows inverted image in Skype in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am using the latest build of Windows 10 (version 1703) and I just downloaded Skype on my Lenovo Miix tablet/laptop PC. When I use the camera App, both the front and rear cameras work as expected. However, when I run Skype and go into settings and enable
 Test Video, the front camera shows an inverted image, but the rear camera continues to work as expected with an upright image. A left/right swap would not be too bad, but inversion is definitely ridiculously bad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously I am reluctant to use the forward camera - the one for face to face Skype conversations - if the I will appear upside down on my contacts screen. Why does Skype invert the forward camera image and how do I fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a connection to an Android tablet with a second Skype ID I have set up. The image was the correct way up in both directions. However, on my Lenovo laptop the small preview window in the corner of the screen is still upside down, but I have no idea
 why. I guess it's a bug in the Windows Skype App.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Good Day! </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for that information, it seems that it is an incompatibility issue with Skype. With that we highly suggest to contact your manufacturer.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Or you can also download/install ManyCam app, for you to invert the camera.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you! </span></p>

            Having had this problem with a Lenovo Miix 300 tablet/laptop, I have now tried it on an Acer Iconia W1-810 tablet with the same result. Therefore I'm inclined to think it is a Microsoft software bug.

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To clarify does it also happen if you use the desktop/classic version of Skype or it just happen with the latest Skype for Windows 10?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, can you try to flip the settings to test if it will change when you open Skype?

<p>I noticed the same problem just before Christmas when I was using my Windows 10 Mobile phone. As the app has been updated today (3rd Jan), I hoped it would have been fixed - but it hasn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the phone, I think a key part of the problem is that it is usually held in portrait mode. If both devices are in landscape mode when you establish the call, this seems to provide a 'workaround' as it seems to be OK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>TBH, as we just wanted to make the video call to wish people Happy Christmas, and we hadn't found the workaround, we were forced to use WhatsApp video call instead. It worked with no problem. as a career long MS user and supporter, it grieves me to say so,
 but I think until they resolve the problem with camera inversion, I'll continue using WhatsApp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When MS bought Skype, they were so pleased, because as they said 'Skype is a verb'. I think they may have changed the meaning of that verb.</p>

<p>Hello Eric,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. I did some experimenting since you posted your message, between my Iconia (Windows 10) tablet and my wife's Android tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Android device everything worked as it should; however, on the Windows 10 device everything except the small preview window showing the image that was being sent seemed to work correctly. I tried with the W10 device in portrait and landscape mode
 before the connection was opened and also I tried switching between one orientation and the other once the connection had been established. In each case the preview on the Iconia was rotated by 180°. Since it only effects me and my use of my Iconia tablet
 I suppose I will have to live with it and learn to move the tablet in the opposite direction from what the preview image shows to centre myself (and any others with me) in the middle of the transmitted picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I get some more time I will experiment further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I liked your final comment - perhaps the verb means "SK(ramble m)Y P(ictur)E" or some other similar expression.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, thanks for your reply. Best wishes for 2018.</p>
<p>

<p>Linx Windows tablet, Latest update Windows 10 build 1709 has given me the same issue as described by others on this thread, namely the preview in Skype App (12.13.274.0) shows an upside down inverted image. Using ManyCam app did not fix this issue as the
 ManyCam&nbsp; virtual webcam did not show up in the drop down menu in Skype App settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue was not there last week before the update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The camera works as it should in the camera app.</p>
<p>Downloaded Classic Skype and my Front camera is working fine and preview is working correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So why doesn't it work in the app??</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>ManyCam webcam was available as an option in Classic Skype but not in the App</p>

<p>Hi Richard, if you go to https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/ there is an option in the dropdown menu for"Classic Skype" also you can select what device it is for ie. Tablet, phone, desktop</p>
<p>download and install like any software package you will have to enter your skype name or sign in email and follow prompts to setup microphone and camera. Camera working for me in test but yet to try it in a call.
</p>
<p>hope this works for you</p>
<p>Francis </p>

<p>I have the same issue, having tried it on a built-in webcam, an SJ-4000 camera, and a new Microsoft HD-3000 that the test videos are reversed for all three. This is totally a Skype issue - and it's an incredibly stupid one.

<p>
</p><p>You install the printer on one of the computers, and then set the computer to share the printer..
</p>

<p>
</p><p>It does mean that the host computer has to be up and running for the other computer to be able to access the printer..
