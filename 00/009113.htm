<h2>            Office 365 Pro  Hang during install</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded Office 365 Pro from our company Sharepoint. I uninstalled the native office 2013, visio pro 2010, skype, I don't think there are any other old MS Office apps left. The install hangs at the Red box 'We are getting things ready'&nbsp; &nbsp;..&nbsp; for over
 an hour last attempt.</p>

    <title>Slicers in Excel Dashboard from Windows machine to a Mac - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Slicers in Excel Dashboard from Windows machine to a Mac</h2>
                    I created a dashboard in Excel on a windows machine using Excel 2010. &nbsp;I am running Excel 2016 on my Mac. &nbsp;The dashboard works great on the windows machine but does not function on the Mac. &nbsp;When I click on the slicers on the Mac the other slicers act
 like they should but the charts connected to the pivot tables do not reflect the changes made by the slicer. &nbsp;It works perfectly on the windows machine. &nbsp;Is there something that I am missing for the Mac?

            <p>The version of Excel on your Mac is critical to give you a good answer. PivotChart support has been gradually introduced into the product as updates have been released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the Excel menu and choose About Excel and reply with the version and build you are using. Here's Microsoft's explanation regarding PivotCharts in Excel for Mac:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304933-excel-for-mac/suggestions/9101221-include-pivotcharts-as-a-feature-for-excel-for-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Include PivotCharts as a feature for Excel for Mac.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment, slicers should be working, but probably not with PivotCharts. Last I tested, PivotCharts now display and can be formatted, but you can't make them or alter them in Excel for Mac.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Security Essentials scan takes too long&#59; MSE HELP PAGE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> invictusinvictus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Security Essentials scan takes too long&#59; MSE HELP PAGE &#34;UNSAFE&#33;&#34;</h2>
                    <p>My scheduled once-a-week MSE scan frequently (but not always) either does not run at all, or it takes many hours to complete.&nbsp; I have NOT checked the settings box that requires the computer to be on but not in use, nor have I tried anything fancy like trying
 to make the computer wake itself up for the scan.&nbsp; I have simply set the scan to take place at 1:00 A.M. every Sunday, and I make sure I closed programs but left the computer on when I leave it on Saturday night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once in September the scan was still running after 10 hours, so I went to the "help" page and from there read a great many FAQs and already-submitted questions, but I did not find anything specific to the immediate situation, so I tried the link that says
 "submit a support case."&nbsp; That got me a warning that the page I was seeking was not safe and that I should not go there.&nbsp; Shortly after that a friend's death interrupted my wonderings about what is wrong with the MSE help page; in the interim, I have run manual
 scans--some "full" scans that I start myself run in an hour or so, others take much longer.&nbsp; Since the size of the drive is the same and I haven't added very much more data, I'm uncertain why this is so, but that's not my major concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two weeks ago (15 Nov), the Sunday 1:00 A.M. scan was still running 21 hours later.&nbsp; I made a snip of the screen:&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a5dd4c8c-17e4-4a19-b767-3de3622ebe5e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a5dd4c8c-17e4-4a19-b767-3de3622ebe5e" height="345" width="483" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;After that scan finally finished, I checked the "Home" page on MSE to see what it had to say about it, and it reported that a QUICK scan had been done at 11:47 Sunday NIGHT (snip below).&nbsp; I cannot find any record of the full scan that had started at 1:00
 Sunday MORNING, and I did not start a Quick scan myself at 11:47, because I had just checked out the still-running full scan at about 11:00 P.M.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>What happened to the full scan?&nbsp; What started the Quick scan?&nbsp; Why am I not able to influence MSE on my own computer?&nbsp; Who IS controlling it?&nbsp;
</strong>Poltergeists?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c539ed3a-440a-43f9-bcb6-a79f10151e45" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c539ed3a-440a-43f9-bcb6-a79f10151e45" height="357" width="559" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Last week (22 Nov), the full scan apparently ran at 1:00 A.M.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning (29 Nov), no scan ran at all:&nbsp; the MSE home page still tells me the last scan was last week.&nbsp; I am absolutley certain I checked to be sure the schedule was correct at about 12:30 A.M., and I left the computer on so there would be power and no
 interference with the scheduled scan.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, once again I went to the MSE "Help" page, and once again I checked for already-listed questions about my question, and once again I tried to "submit a support case."&nbsp;(See snip--that's the link I clicked on.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e49b220e-ea78-4591-afea-92b331621e4a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e49b220e-ea78-4591-afea-92b331621e4a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once again (and this is what sent me back to find the snips I had taken in September), I WAS WARNED THAT LINK I WANTED TO FOLLOW WAS UNSAFE AND I SHOULD NOT GO THERE.&nbsp; The snip of that page which I took today--and which is the same as the one I got in September--is
 directly below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ddabef35-b5a7-4581-83bc-5c04aaeaad94" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ddabef35-b5a7-4581-83bc-5c04aaeaad94" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>HOW CAN MICROSOFT'S OWN LINK TO "SUBMIT A SUPPORT CASE" LEAD ME TO A PAGE THAT IS UNSAFE, AND AGAINST WHICH MICROSOFT WARNS ME?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What does this mean?&nbsp; Is there something wrong at Microsoft?&nbsp; Or has something invaded and corrupted my MSE to such an extent that Microsoft itself is cut off?
</strong>Should I be panicky about this?&nbsp;&nbsp; If my MSE is -- has been corrupted -- how do I find out and correct whatever damage has been done?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are my files not secure?&nbsp; Are my programs screwed up?&nbsp; Have my data been corrupted?&nbsp; Are my old files reachable?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get control of my own computer?&nbsp;&nbsp; I want it to be a tool for me to use with confidence, not a device that controls my behavior and makes me nervous about my own security.&nbsp;&nbsp; One MAJOR reason I do not want to have to get Microsoft 10 or to get the
 current Office products is that they will not reside on my PC, but apparently will require me to interface with Microsoft every time I want to use the computer.&nbsp; So the new programs do not let me work independently; they force me to "partner" with Micrososft
 and trust Microsoft with my data ( and with my clients' privileged and confidential data, the security of which I am personally liable for) as well as rely on the internet to deliver to me the capacity to use my own equipment.&nbsp; Too risky!&nbsp;
<strong>Please, somebody respond to this concern, too!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not tell me to get on the phone with Microsoft techs:&nbsp; the last time I did that, I got passed around from one person to another for almost 8 hours, and the last guy I talked to was so rude, patronizing, contemptuous, curt, and unwilling to listen
 that he had me in tears before I concluded that he was also utterly&nbsp;unable to solve the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any other advice anyone can offer.</p>

            <p>Time to scan depends on many factors like number of files which are being scanned , type of them, dependency to other files and so on. Quick scan would be short but full scan might take hours.</p>
<p>To see log files of scan, you should refer to event viewer and look for Microsoft Antimalware related event and there you could find information related to scan and other related to MSE.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Looking back at an earlier thread of yours in which you initially had issues setting up MSE for a full scan, my guess would be that your PC is set to sleep after some period of time and is thus going to sleep during the period the scan is running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is why GreginMich had suggested setting the full scan to run during a time you were using the PC rather than at night, since there's nothing within MSE scheduler&nbsp;to stop the PC from going to sleep,&nbsp; This must instead be programmed using a scheduled
 task to wake the PC as you mentioned, since this will also keep the PC awake during the period that MSE is running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since MSE is built as basic protection with minimal features, it appears that you require additional user friendly features to perform the things you'd like your antimalware to do for you.&nbsp; People such as GreginMich, myself and others helping here either
 know how to use things like scheduled tasks or&nbsp;simply perform full scans manually, since that's really what the original developers of MSE intended as one of them told me in a meeting several years ago.&nbsp; I personally only run a full scan manually on a rare
 occasion, with a quick scan scheduled to run every evening before I turn the PC off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Near the end of your other thread you responded last August that you were considering a different antimalware to replace MSE.&nbsp; Based on the above I would recommend that you try to find one that includes the scheduling and other features that you prefer.&nbsp;
 Complaining about the way MSE performs these isn't going to change anything at this point, since Microsoft has moved on to develop for Windows 10 and left legacy products like those for older Windows operating system versions behind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an example of this, that web page you discovered with the security certificate warning has been "broken" now for at least a few months.&nbsp; There's really nothing wrong with the page itself at all, the problem is with the configuration of the web server
 it resides on.&nbsp; When you click a link that takes you to that page it tries to take you to an HTTP page which is unsecured.&nbsp; However, once the page is reached something on the server is instead modifying the link and changing it to&nbsp;an HTTPS or secured URL instead.&nbsp;
 However, since the server itself doesn't contain an SSL certificate, your browser detects this as a potential security failure and responds instead with the certificate security warning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, since the help page is simply public&nbsp;text and so has no need to be protected by using an SSL&nbsp;certificate based transport, there's really no reason for the HTTPS&nbsp;URL prefix to be used.&nbsp; So someone involved in setting up&nbsp;that server simply
 messed up the configuration and created this entire pointless problem.&nbsp; However, the simple fact that this issue has existed for months now and no one at Microsoft has bothered to fix it tells&nbsp;me that their focus is elsewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the obvious push is on towards Windows 10 which includes Windows Defender that completely replaces MSE, I think it's clear where their attention has gone.&nbsp; Note that with Win10 Defender though, there's no longer a separate menu item to schedule a scan,
 only a quick scan is built-in to the Windows Maintenance schedule.&nbsp; Though you can still create a scheduled task to add a separate full scan, you've already indicated you don't like that solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your other questions regarding Windows 10 and the newer versions of Office are better asked in the forums here created for those.&nbsp; Most of them are probably already answered there, but since one question often leads to another I'd suggest asking those there
 instead.</p>

            Rob Koch, thanks for your candor.&nbsp; I would like to understand what Windows 10 is all about:&nbsp; It seems like a system in which everything takes place "out there" on the web, instead of inside my PC.&nbsp; In addition, if I understand it correctly, Microsoft's
 Office programs are to be "out there" on the web as well, so to use them, I have to work "out there."&nbsp; This causes me concern, because my clients count on me to keep their information privileged and confidential, which is something I cannot be certain of unless
 it is within my own control.&nbsp; Can you tell me why I would want to use Windows 10 OR the new versions of the Office programs?&nbsp; Is the reason simply that none of the old familiar programs will be supported in the future?&nbsp; Is the reason that the tech world has
 moved on to the cloud, so if I stick with something I do understand and I can control, I'm fated to be out of step with what's happenin' now?&nbsp; It certainly feels like I'm being asked to relinquish

            <p>I am repeating here what I'm sure has been discussed literally thousands of times on the Office forums, so please ask follow-up questions there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the cheaper&nbsp;Office 365&nbsp;products have been oriented heavily towards cloud storage, since most of those using these versions have little technical knowledge or don't wish to own or manage servers in order to store their data.&nbsp; This is a huge benefit for
 most home and many small business users who often would have greater issues if their PC hard drive failed or malware infected the device and its files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, Office 365 Home or Personal are simply 2 of the several options for purchasing, installing and operating Office, which in all cases can still choose to save documents to Offline storage on your local PC or MAC hard drive.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Note that the Office 365 Business versions of the product, though the cheapest Essentials&nbsp;version is accessed from online, allow installation on&nbsp;up to 5 devices for the higher levels including Premium.&nbsp; In this case though you'll notice the sharing and other
 business or social network applications available to allow collaboration across&nbsp;a larger&nbsp;business.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Those product feature charts are better at explaining the options than any words, so read them closely to understand the similarities and differences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you really should be doing is hiring someone (blue hair or none at all), to advise you and aid you in whatever system maintenance or other technical tasks are beyond your level of knowledge.&nbsp; Learning this on the side may be a fun hobby, but is really
 far more dangerous to your business and client security than the cloud will ever be.&nbsp; Anything that is Internet attached today is at fundamentally the same risk of attack and compromise, since it's the connectivity that creates the risk and not the specific
 implementation.&nbsp; If you don't fully understand this, you need help in insuring the security of your business data, regardless of where you store it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case you're wondering, I have over 35 years in the computer field, with the last 15 in various segments of the security portion dealing with financial institutions and businesses.</p>

<p>
</p><p>&lt; EDIT &gt; As for Windows 10 itself, my discussion above still applies, since the security profile of the operating system is dependent upon how it is configured, both during initial installation and setup as well as the decisions made during important application
 installations such as Office.&nbsp; What you are partially realizing is that the rich technical abilities available in modern Windows versions along with external features such as cloud storage can create a confusing mess if not understood, which for anyone not
 continually immersed in these technologies is simply lots of noise.&nbsp; That's why I recommend hiring someone to help at least initially, since otherwise the cost in your time to properly investigate and the risks to both data and systems are inherently higher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is the next and as Microsoft itself&nbsp;says, the last version of Windows.&nbsp; The question isn't whether you will eventually need to deal with it, but when, so only if you plan to close your business before the Windows 7 you now have ends support in
 2020 can you likely avoid it.</p>

            <p>The best advice is typically from self-employed computer businessmen who've had a background in supporting computers for years, though their&nbsp;individual background may vary widely.&nbsp; The big box stores are often manned by kids who may or may not know the broader
 concerns, but occasionally there are some good people there too, it's just hard to insure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You already seem to have a good recognition of how such a person should talk to you, so I suspect you'd recognize them once you talk to them.&nbsp; The key is finding someone local to be able to physically aid in initial setup as well as discuss the configuration
 you desire to the level you wish to support it yourself in the future.&nbsp; If they aren't&nbsp;interested in doing&nbsp;this, they're not the right person or business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the impression that you've typically done everything yourself to this point, so if you've been successful you already understand much of what you'll need, you just need some guidance to get past the changes that you're unsure about.&nbsp; Most people who
 do this professionally would probably recommend this be done on an hourly basis, with some estimate of hours to complete the project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hourly rates can vary widely, but I've seen rates from below $50/hr. for simple installation work by techs, up to $150/hr. or more for security analysis done by network engineers.&nbsp; Your&nbsp;needs should be somewhere in the&nbsp;middle of that range depending on other
 common hourly rates in your region for professional work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can perform any repetitive work that may save you money, but if it's only you and your own PC, this may only take a couple to a&nbsp;few hours.&nbsp; Often combining the work with the purchase of a new PC through the same&nbsp;business may help to&nbsp;absorb portions
 of the cost, but that depends on whether they resell and/or whether you want their hardware and further&nbsp;support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any truly effective&nbsp;business will work with you within reason, you just need to be clear up front about what you want so they can indicate what they can&nbsp;provide,&nbsp; If they give you a bad feeling, walk away before you commit, since a few minute discussion
 of what you're looking for should be free.&nbsp; Any sense they're just trying to sell you some hardware or software is a bad sign.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't been doing this type of work recently, though I've considered it, but wouldn't like to try it remotely at least at first.&nbsp; I feel&nbsp;more comfortable&nbsp;being in front of the person and equipment I'm responsible for even though the trend is moving towards
 online support as well.&nbsp; If your location forces you into this situation, I'd examine the major online options carefully, but consider Microsoft itself since they tend to bundle support for the current&nbsp;operating system and major apps like Office.&nbsp; If your
 business requires other major application(s), you may want to see whether anyone supports those as well, unless you feel confident in your own ability with them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no single right answer here, since I've done various versions of these for businesses my entire career, either as an&nbsp;in-house employee, contractor or on an hourly basis.&nbsp; What matters is your own level of confidence and how much support you'd like
 to have from someone else when your own abilities reach their limit.&nbsp; Paying someone else makes sense when it saves you time you'd spend learning how to do it yourself and can potentially gain the specific knowledge about your own configuration to provide
 peace of mind as well.</p>

            <p>Any issue with a product that requires this much verbiage to be "solved" is at its root a faulty-product issue, and no amount of apology on behalf of the manufacturer will solve it. Shame on a company that asks its customers to depend on the advice of strangers
 when its products fail. (On the other hand, this sort of cost-cutting DOES make Microsoft a fine investment!)</p>

<p>Hi Anthony</p>

</p><p>Thanks for the response. To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error messages I get are:</p>
<p>On Samsung phone: 'Sign-in' failed and 'Authentication failed'</p>
<p><em>(I prefer pop3 and inbuilt Samsung app to IMAP and outlook app)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>On Office outlook: 'ERR Authentication failure: unknown user name or bad password'</p>
<p><em>(Keep in mind the same user name and password work on the outgoing server and on outlook.com via web browser)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked that pop is still enabled on my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked my pop3 settings, which have not changed from, pop3.live.com (port 995 with SSL), and
<p>
</p><p>What's the next step?</p>

Yes, disabling this particular auto correct is a good workaround, but surely this is a bug?&nbsp; Why would auo correct change the keyboard focus?<br />

    <title>Duplicate messages when I send an instant message using outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nikolai ross b&#248;r&#248;en  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicate messages when I send an instant message using outlook.com user interface</h2>
                    I tried some searches, but I cant find any answer to my problem.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>First off I'd like to say that this started to happen today.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I was sending an instant message to a friend of mine using the IM option in the outlook.com user interface. All off a sudden I started to see every message I sent was sent twice, but I was the only one that could see this. My friend did not see the duplicates.
 The messages he sent me was just fine as well. No duplicates there.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Knowing this I logged into facebook to see if the same problem happened through that UI, but everything was fine there.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then I checked if there was any new settings in outlook.com for the chat, but couldn't find any and as I said earlier. I already tried to search for this, but couldn't find any&nbsp;solution&nbsp;for the problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Has anyone else had the same problem or know what might have happened?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

            I also have the exact same experience, sent messages (to Facebook friends) are dublicated on the chat side bar. But indeed, recipients do not see the messages duplicated. This strange behavior started today...

            <p>hello,</p>
<p>i also have the same very problem,</p>
<p>i have home n windows 8 OS and the messages i send are duplicated, i asked but none of the people i asked told they receive the same message&nbsp;twice. Apparently it is just me seein the double messages.</p>
<p>at work, i open the outlook.com IM and i have got the same error: i send an instante message and then it appears i sent the same one twice but i only sent one.
</p>
<p>At work, i use an XP desktop so it is not a Windows 8 bug but messenger\outlook.com bug.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S: the same does NOT happen on skype.</p>

This is very funny solution. Since bug is related only to facebook chat in outlook.com interface then obviously unlinking facebook account from microsoft account will remove double chat bubbles, since anyway you can't chat anymore :D
<div><br />
<div>Additionally outlook interface does not retrieve all FB conversation messages, only last one. I don't know if it's intended or not, but it seems a little sad not to be able to see atleast last 10-20 messages. This all in the end simply makes using facebook
 chat in official FB page the best option for conversation.</div>

            I'm also having the same issue and as most of you, it happens only for FB... I noticed that the duplicated messages&nbsp;have a 2min difference and to make it even more weird it shows a future time... For example, at 1pm I send a message and I see 2 messages&nbsp;come
 up in the chat window&nbsp;but the duplicated message shows I sent the message at 1:02pm

<h2>            Mail, Calendar and People App isn&#39;t working.</h2>
                    After installing the latest build for Windows 10 Enterprise technical preview I realize this app isn't working. Anyone knows what's going on?

<p>This is a problem that Microsoft knows about .... because they caused it over a year ago, and have refused to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has set the "auto-complete" attribute in the sign on page's HTML code to off. This only affects the Microsoft sign on page. All other sign on pages (for other company's sign on) are not affected .... that's why auto-complete works on other pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fix is simple .... all Microsoft has to do is change their sign on page's "auto-complete" attribute back to on .... but after a year they still refuse to fix this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have written a user script that sets the "auto-complete" attribute in Microsoft's sign on page to on. If you use Firefox as your browser and you are familiar with the free add-in called Greasemonkey ( which allows you to run scripts) then post here and
 I will provide the script I use.</p>

<h2>            Mac Os 10.7.5</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't log in to my skype account. As I've read on your website my Mac Os 10.7.5 won't be compatible anymore, which is a tremendous shame, because I'm not gonna buy a new computer or change my actual software, because it works perfectly fine. So, as I see,
 it means that you'll lose a regular client. As well, I would like to recuperate the credit that I charged on my Skype account (25 €). And the only way to communicate with you is through this community. I hope that you can solve this problem as soon as possible.
 I feel very disappointed about you, because I've been a faithful client for almost 10 years, and now this.&nbsp;</p>

retirement of older versions and some Skype enabled devices</a> and we deeply apologize for that, but please do know that this change is also a hard decision for Skype to make.
</span>Skype is committed in providing its users with the latest technology we have to offer,
<span>thus this change is inevitable and will enable Skype to focus in transitioning from a peer-to-peer chat and video and app to a more diverse, more mobile friendly cloud infrastructure which in the long run, will benefit a larger group
 of users. <em>See <a href="https://blogs.skype.com/news/2016/07/20/skype-the-journey-weve-been-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            I think the phone has a built in PDF reader. So put the pdf file in the phone memory or on the memory card (via USB/Irda/Bluetooth) and try to open it from the phone.

            what is the error dat you are getting??<br />
normally what i found is dat, it is unable to open large files, but works fine with normal sized files.<br />
<br />
if the software is crashing then you may download it from adobe site...

Please bear in mind that if you're phone happen to be an S40 - e. 5300. You won't be able to run symbian applications on it. Java (jar.) applets will run on it instead.<br />
<br />
Here is one PDF reader I got plus the word reader.<br />
<br />
You can also try these applications..<br />

<h2>            Outlook Web Access won&#39;t let me attach file on one computer but will on others</h2>
                    I am trying to attach files while in Outlook Web Access.&nbsp; It worked a week or so ago but now won't allow on one computer.&nbsp; I have no problems on other computers but they are running Windows XP.&nbsp; I can browse for files but when I click the Attach button,
 not happens.&nbsp; I am running Windows 7 and upgraded to IE 8 beta thinking that it would fix it and it didn't.&nbsp; I removed/turned off firewall, antivirus thinking maybe it was blocking the function but nothing worked.&nbsp; Please help or offer suggestions.

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you not getting the&nbsp;post snooze reminder on your phone as well?&nbsp; From testing, even syncing data between the phone and Band, after a&nbsp;Snooze on the phone,&nbsp;does not initiate a retrigger of a calendar reminder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps if Snooze functionality was supported and initiated through the Band, you might get the desired affect.</p>

<p>2) Any outgoing email I wish to send are&nbsp;hanging in the outbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually the incoming meeting email downloads and shows up in my inbox. After this the outlook performs as normal , i.e I am able to send outgoing email straight away and all incoming emails are showing up in my in box straight away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem only occurs when somebody sends a meeting invite&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you pls assist</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the response back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end, I decided&nbsp;to get in touch with the supplier&nbsp;who I purchased the original MS office from. He was very helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment my o.look seems to be working fine. I guess the litmus test will be when somebody else decides to send me a meeting invite using outlook calendar. Which I hope will download straight away and will not be hanging</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for the record. I also contacted MS support/help desk -&nbsp; &nbsp;They didnt&nbsp;wish to help me</p>
<p>
</p><p>See below the instructions I was given, which at the moment appears to have fixed my issue</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1, Open the Start menu, type Windows PowerShell in the search bar.</span></p>
<p><span>2, Right click on the Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator.</span></p>
<p><span>3, Enter the below command to reinstall the Mail and calendar app.
</span></p>
<p><span>get-appxpackage *microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps* | remove-appxpackage</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After performing the above steps, install the Mail and calendar app from the Windows store.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope above helps</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am Deepti from the Microsoft OneNote for Mac team. We are really sorry you are facing such an issue.</p>
<p>Could one of you please try these steps, these steps are not a solution to this problem but a step towards understanding where exactly the issue is.</p>
<p>1. Uninstall Onenote </p>
<p>2. Delete&nbsp;~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.onenote<br />
</p>
<p>3. Delete ~/Library/Group\ Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office</p>
<p>4. Run this command in terminal : killall -SIGTERM cfprefsd</p>
<p>5. Empty your trash</p>
<p>6. Reboot Mac</p>
<p>7. Install Onenote for Mac from app store</p>
<p>8. Sign in using a new Live account which is never used before (sorry for the inconvenience that you will have to create a new account)</p>
<p>9. Create a new notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please report back with your results. </p>
<p>
</p><p>-Deepti</p>
<p />
        </p>
