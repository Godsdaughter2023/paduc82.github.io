    <title>Why do i get a message saying that my &#34;trial version&#34; for - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why do i get a message saying that my &#34;trial version&#34; for Office 2011 has expired when I bought the full version 7 months ago&#63; I uninstalled the trial version and haven&#39;t had any problems until now</h2>
                    I bought the full version of Office for Mac 2011 several months ago. I completely uninstalled the trial version and haven't had any problem until now, when I try to open some new files on internet, I get a message saying that my trial version has expired.
 It's definitely not a trial version, I paid about $120 for Home and Student.

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>What application is saying it is a trial version? All of them or Outlook? Reason I ask that is since you have Home &amp; Student, it does not come with Outlook and may be there strictly as a trial app.</p>
<p>If you are getting the trial expired on Word &amp; Excel, I would simply completely remove Office and then reinstall. Make sure you are using the product key that was purchased. Here is a link that shows how to remove ALL of Office (some of the trial stuff may
 be messing with the purchased version):</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before uninstalling, you may want to make sure Office is completely updated as the latest version is 14.2.3. Maybe an update will correct the behavior.</p>
<p>Thanks...</p>

<h3> hover cat dave  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail spam filters vs Gmail spam filters</h2>
                    <p>I'm a web developer and our company gets complaints all the time from Gmail users that they're not getting their registration or order emails, and when I test it they go to Gmail spam but not to Hotmail or Yahoo spam. We're all convinced Gmail is overzealous
 (and it sends legitimate Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin, and other emails I've registered for to Spam), but Hotmail I've noticed doesn't seem to let through any more spam than Gmail does, but lets through way more legitimate email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has it been in your experience that Hotmail's spam filters are better than Gmail's?</p>

            Um, thanks for the acknowledgement, but that doesn't address the question. I would rather hear your opinion, or what you know for that matter (like a site that shows why Hotmail's spam filters are better than Gmail).

            <p>Well, it's pretty hard to typify the efficacy of one services junk filter as opposed to another's because there are many factors involved, like how long the account has existed, how you've used that address in public places, and so on. &nbsp;I get a lot more

<p>Well, it boils down to what gets through and what doesn't; on average, more legitimate emails are sent to my Gmail Spam folder than Hotmail sends to its Junk folder, so that's my example of where the efficacy is typified. It appears Gmail is just overzealous.
 My original question (which seems like a valid reason to keep this thread a question and not a discussion) was what people's experiences are, which should be enough to typify the efficacy of each service. I'm not looking for proof (though it would be nice),
 just what people's experiences are. Your feedback is valuable, but I think you think maybe I'm expecting more than I actually am from any answers.</p>

<p>Hmm, that hasn't been the case in my experience and the people I work with, across multiple work/personal Gmails, and its spam filter has become a problem for a company I work with, where Gmail users are not getting our emails but Hotmail and Yahoo users
 are. In our own tests, our emails go to Spam in Gmail but not to that or Junk in Hotmail or Yahoo, even in newly-created test accounts. Also, we get emails for sites we sign up for sent to Spam in Gmail but not others. In my experience, Gmail is just over-zealous
 filtering spam.</p>

            <p>I think you have more experience in this than many other people here since you're directly experiencing the issue. I, like Brian, haven't used Gmail in a long time so it's difficult for us to give you a reliable opinion. I can always come out and be like,
 OMG MICROSOFT TUNZ BETTERZ YOLO! but that's just dumb and doesn't help you at all. So many factors play into spam filtering that it's too difficult to know which one is better. I've had a lot of MVP email directed to SPAM for some reason, and I'm not using
 Exclusive Filtering, just letting Outlook.com decide for me (now that doesn't make much sense) so it goes both ways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be worthwhile to post this on the Google Product forums and say their filters are sending your legitimate emails to SPAM.

<div><br />
<div>The <i>paragraph</i>&nbsp;or <i>pilcrow</i>&nbsp;(e.g.&nbsp;<span>¶</span>) symbol is a formatting mark and it is displayed only if an individual computer has that option turned on, e.g. it may be displayed on yours when you create the email but not on the recipient's
 computer when they read it.&nbsp;Likewise, it does not print irrespective of its display status.</div>
<div>Due to Outlook's close relationship with Word, the <i>toggle</i>&nbsp;for turning the display of
<i>formatting marks</i>&nbsp;is pretty much the same. You can use the keystroke combination
<i>Ctrl+Shift+8</i>&nbsp;or click the&nbsp;<span>¶ button in the <i>Format Text</i>&nbsp;tab's <i>
Paragraph</i>&nbsp;group.</span></div>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your current identity is working just fine you can delete older identities depending on how you feel about keeping a backup "just in case." Chances of an identity becoming corrupt and unusable are very small, but there is always that chance.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using Time Machine and include your profiles in your Time Machine backups, that's yet another layer of backup you can rely on.</p>

<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>my new nokia e7 had an hardware problem, so I brought it one of the Nokia repair centre in Dublin.<br />
They have fix it but they also have done an hardreset of the phone (aslo loading the wrong firmware but at least in one week (...) they have fix this).</p>
<p>The results is that OVI STORE is not working anymore on the smartphone and THEY DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO FIX THE PROBLEM.</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestions to fix this situations?<br />
it is one month that they have my mobile phone.</p>

            Nokia care point flash devices for almost any problem and as far as E7 is concerned, after hard reset, only Nokia care center can get the Ovi store back on the device. I tried with whatever stuff Nokia has to make it work but I couldn't install Ovi store
 on my E7 as I did a hard reset(four/three fingers reset, not *#7370# reset), this removes 'some' Ovi store file which, I beleive, only Nokia care center have in their systems. So get back to them.

<p>Hello</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had the same problem a few weeks ago. Can you download OVI store? If yes can you install it?</p>
<p>If you said No to any of those here is what you need to do.</p>
<p>Go to you normal Nokia web browser, then select&nbsp; "options" and then "Clear privacy data" and then select "All". After that restart your Nokia E7 and try to download or install Ovi store again.</p>
<p>Worked for me, If that still doesnt work then I`m not too sure :-)</p>
<p>Let me know if it worked or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanx</p>

            Did exactly the same thing with mine E7 due to it refused to boot. Since it corrupts or deletes needed files/register which is needed to run Ovi store, very much likely to be QT related, Ovi store won't work or update or install...<br />
<br />
Recently there has been some post regarding to restoring Ovi store on S^3 devices which has been exposed to a hard reset, but it's hard to verify if this will work with the E7 as I have only seen posts on N8/C7. And it seems to be a bit confusion regarding
 what exactly the hard reset is. I think a lot of users believe the hard reset is something else than the 3+1 button salute. Anyway, maybe you could verify it?<br />
<br />
What you do is to go into your phone settings and select delete and restore. After the phone has bootet go to the SW updater app and check if an ovi store update is available. If so, try to run it and see if it works. If not try open the ovi store app and/or
 go to ovi store with your mobile browser to see if you can download and install it.<br />
<br />
If this does not work, you will as krizanand has already mentioned, take it to a Nokia care point. They should have the needed tools to completely flash the whole firmware package onto your phone again. They did that on mine. If they for some stupid reasons
 take shortcuts and just reinstalls the firmware with ovi suite, it will not work as it does not containt the whole package. They will need to use their special software tools and flash it completely. If they don't know how to do it, they should manage to contact
 Nokia and get help with how to do it. Sending you home is stupid. You have to tell them that they will need to flash it and not do a hard reset!<br />
<br />
Good luck mate!

            @hawknz not sure how you got it worked but I find no relevance with Ovi store installation, after hard reset(three finger reset), to what you have said. Something goes missing in regards to Ovi store after hard reset on E7 which cannot be installed or
 retrieved by the user, well that's how it is so far.

            @hawknz: Was writing my post when you posted yours.<br />
<br />
@kriz: Yeah, I have yet to see if it works, but there was a Nokia emplyee here on the forum saying that it was now possible to restore ovistore after a hard reset, but that was regarding to a N8 I think. Did you see the post. Will see if I can find it.<br />
<br />
If however it turns out to be possible now, it's good and not soon enough, but I still have my doubts. :)<br />
<br />
How long was it since you did the hard reset on yours, kriz?

            @Fender I saw that method on the web and later on the forum it works only after soft reset(*#7370). I've tried every method in a sane and insane way, in a logical, crude and stupid way LOL.... to get Ovi store working on my E7 all have failed miserably.
 It has been since April I'm without Ovi store and 3G ;-) what a mess I am in :D..

<p>I see, that's what I thought. And as i mentioned above there has been too much confusion about what's hard reset and whats not.<br />
<br />
But it might be fixed for the N8 at least regarding to pj98's post specific pointing out the 3 finger reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Too many mixed messages on this matter. Hopefully we can sort this out with some final advices soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looks like it works for some and for others not.</p>

            Yes, I agree with you Fender many refer *#7370# as hard reset, which is basically a format-phone memory/soft reset, and say they've got Ovi store back, first the reset confusion has to be cleared. I'm hoping that Anna update will solve the Ovi store problem,
 fingers crossed.

<p>Not a solution for OTA guys, but the new Beta Labs version of Ovi Suite allows you to download direct via PC if phone is connected :)</p>

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;<span>lenachou,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does
 this happen only on this website?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Was
 it working fine before?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Add the website you are having issues to the trusted zone</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 internet explorer &gt; Go to<strong> Tools</strong> menu, Click<strong>Internet Options</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 the<strong>Security</strong> tab, and then click the <strong>Trusted Sites</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 the<strong>Sites</strong> button. In the <strong>Add this Web site to the zone</strong> box, type in the Web Site address you are having issues with and then hit<strong>Add button.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click<strong>OK</strong>
 twice.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Restart internet explorer and check to see if the issue persists</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Important: -</span></strong><span>Only do this for Web sites whose content you trust 100 percent.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, you may try step 2</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Uninstall and reinstall the<span>surveillance camera software</span></span></strong><span>,
 you may want to check with your device manufacturer for reinstallation and activation of the software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Uninstall or change a program</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Uninstall-or-change-a-program</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists you may contact your surveillance camera manufacturer for any known issues with the Web site</span></p>

    <title>Why do I get DUP emails that are sent to my outlook.com email address - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff a. davis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do I get DUP emails that are sent to my outlook.com email address in my Outlook 2013 set up Exchange ActiveSync&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This is still troubling me as to why it keeps happening to me. These DUP emails arrive sometimes, but not always, when an email is addressed directly&nbsp;to my outlook.com email address. It makes no sense to me. They vary as to Time Received also. Some arrive
 with the same Time Stamp and others, such as the ones that I'll show below, arrived several minutes apart.</p>
<p>FYI, I have ONLY my outlook.com email address set up in my Outlook 2013 using the Exchange ActiveSync method since I also have a Windows 8.1 Nokia Lumia 635 phone so it is neat that all of my Contacts, Tasks, Appointments and Emails in both the Inbox and
 all of my Custom Folders are synced.</p>
<p>You should also know that if I go to delete them one-by-one with a click and then a click on the X in the upper right of it in the Inbox column, the first one deletes as it should but if I don't wait a minute or so, the other DUP one can't be deleted yet
 and it pops a box to&nbsp;tell me something like "This email can't be accessed right now". I wish I had&nbsp;a PrintScreen to show you but I don't and I can't find a DUP email right now to create one with. I'll try to&nbsp;add one in a Reply tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So here's the latest one that was sent from Microsoft after they were helping me with something by using online access and a chat:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/74f0c3d2-2063-49aa-a2f0-47b9ed5b89b0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/74f0c3d2-2063-49aa-a2f0-47b9ed5b89b0" /></a></p>
<p>Here's what they both look like over in the right column of Outlook 2013:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce8a5f42-faca-4251-895e-3e11ff8ac2b2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce8a5f42-faca-4251-895e-3e11ff8ac2b2" /></a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Here are my Account Settings to show proof of how I have things set up:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f1a3d0fe-665e-444d-8725-375c3885ac02" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f1a3d0fe-665e-444d-8725-375c3885ac02" /></a></p>
<p>And not that this should probably matter. but the Address Book tab is the only place that I found anything showing two items in the Name list:</p>

            <p>This whole deal is a screwed up mess. I'm SO sick of trying to fix it. I did just find another DUP email in my Outlook 2013's Inbox that I didn't need either copy of. It was a Reply Notification from this website. I Deleted one of them and then I didn't
 wait long enough, which I should know by now to do, and I tried to Delete the other DUP copy of it and it popped this same old box that I'm all too familiar with:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=6089f845-4283-4dac-846d-cff1f017e8cc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d6089f845-4283-4dac-846d-cff1f017e8cc" /></a></p>
<p>I just looked online at my Outlook Live thing which I NEVER normally do since I use Outlook 2013 on my computer and I carry a Windows Nokia Lumia 635 phone for the ONLY reason that I want to save work by having stuff linked so as not to need to change anything
 EVER in two places. And I don't think that I see any DUPS there but once again, since this stupid ACER AIO All-in-One computer is such a SICK piece, it has a tendency to not change the image that is displayed to the right of the Inbox list of emails of what
 any email says very quickly when I click on another email. It just stays unchanged for a minute or 2 so I need to just watch and wait to see if it ever changes and then I need to try to remember what it had been displaying and if this was anything new. I get
 SO many Reply emails from this site since I use it all the time to try to keep our family's 4 computers all happy and working together, that I do get TONS of Reply emails and often I get more than one in a row from different Users of this site back to back
 to the Subject line is the same and the only way to tell the difference it to use that silly Viewing Pane or to actually double-click it to Open it.
</p>
<p>Oh God, help me.</p>

            <p>All that as I said in my last Reply AND I'd swear that perhaps due to my SICK PC taking too long to tell the outlook.com server something in the background, I often get emails sent back to me with their original dates on them and they'll be buried in my
 Inbox of my Outlook 2013. I know this only because yesterday I gave up and I Deleted EVERY email in my Outlook 2013's Inbox that had come from this site but mysteriously, there are several days worth of them showing up again today down in my Inbox. WTH? So
 I often have even needed to Delete them again?</p>
<p>Often, I wonder if this is&nbsp;my SICK PC's fault or if it is the fault of the new outlook.com aka live servers that I've heard were just rolled out to Users in phases starting in August.</p>

            <p>I just finally checked and this same email has duplicate copies in the Inboxes in all places, Outlook 2013, my Windows phone and online at outlook.com. They are all stamped that the DUP was received 6 minutes after the original.</p>
<p>That should tell us something. I'd sure like to stop this from happening. Here's some PrintScreens from all 3 places. The last 2 are from my Windows phone:</p>

            Since this most recent DUP email that I showed in my last Reply was set to a Gmail address and none of those are set up directly in my Outlook 2013 which is set up with ONLY my outook.com address using the Exchange ActiveSync setup, perhaps this is some
 setting that I made in Gmail or online at outlook.com in order to get them everywhere? I do know that I've got a few email accounts set to do something to accomplish that. But these DUP emails have always baffled me.<br />
I think that I've gotten some DUPs of emails that were addressed directly to my outlook.com address. But I could be mistaken or maybe it just appears that way since I've noticed that sometimes it will just list my name in the TO: part instead of the address
 that it was sent to which I'm sure has something to do with that email address being one of the ones that I have set up in my own Contact/People in either Outlook 2013 or online at outlook.com.

            <p>In case anyone might wonder, I see the same DUP emails mess in the Inbox of my Outlook 2013 on my computer and my Outlook is set up with my outlook.com email address using the Exchange ActiveSync format and it is the only address that is in Outlook 2013.<br />
It is pretty darn odd how that 2nd and 3rd came in a full 20 minutes after the 1st one did. That's WAY longer than Outlook does automatic Send/Receives.</p>

            <p>I <strong>haven't changed the auto Send/Receive setting </strong>and in fact, I wouldn't even know how to.<br />
I've also <strong>never used anything but Windows Defender anti-virus on either of the two Windows 10 machines
</strong>that I now use. I used to use McAfee on my old Windows 10 machines since the whole McAfee APP&nbsp;was given to me for free by my&nbsp;Time Warner Cable monthly service (if you knew how to enable it and not just be sucked into using the trial version that they
 give you at first to suck in some new McAfee customers)&nbsp;but I'd heard that it was a resource waster so I'd gotten rid of it and had been using only Security Essentials.</p>
<p>But I've put those machines to rest and I only use newer ones and Windows Defender.
</p>
<p>Google helped me find out how to alter the Send/Receive setting in Outlook 2013:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.solveyourtech.com/change-outlook-2013-send-and-receive-frequency" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.solveyourtech.com/change-outlook-2013-send-and-receive-frequency</a>
</p>
<p>Mine are set at 15 minutes for ALL GROUPS and 30 minutes if OFFLINE. I don't know anything about how Outlook is supposed to do anything if it is OFFLINE. I've always thought that meant that something wasn't connected to the internet or to a network, either
 at home or at work. But I'm just a dumbo so what does it matter.</p>
<p>Anyway, I really don't think that I ever altered these so I'll just leave them alone for now. I don't see how that could affect anything anyhow that might help cause this particular issue that I've asked about in this Question.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since about a week I can't receive any mails anymore (I can send them). It has nothing to do with software I'm using, since I'm using the outlook.com web application, which I can log in to. I didn't do anything weird. It just stopped working suddenly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe it's good to notice that I'm a former Windows Live Admin (domain.outlook.com) user, so I'm using my own domain. Not sure if that's is related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, my friends get automated replies that I'm not receiving their emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me?</p>
<p>

    <title>Verify Account Locked out of Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Verify Account Locked out of Outlook</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<p>Hello - This is for the Outlook website</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using this email for a long time and have it combined to my other email which is more professional use, so i can get my Code/Pin for logins and such. And yesterday while deleting spam emails and such i saw a mail
 from Microsoft Team which said that if you want to send emails you need to verify your phone. I concluded it was a scam and flagged it as that. But after a few minutes i was redirected to the login screen of Outlook having the only option to verify Phone Number
 for access code.</p>
<p>When i opened my microsoft account it only asked me for my pin from another mail and i successfuly opened the settings and could access everything else but i couldnt access my outlook. After a while i decided to add my phone
 because i just gave up after going through the customer service and finding out nothing i got a Text message from the sender: SMSInfo and with the contents: Microsoft Access Code **** . After getting the code on my phone and inputing it in the required field
 my outlook worked as it always did. &nbsp;<br />
Before adding my phone i tried accessing the website on multiple devices as a 3g mobile and a tablet and i got the same result.&nbsp;I quickly changed my password, and revoked all trusted devices and now on the way home will check everything more detailed.</p>
<p>I am mostly afraid that i have been hacked for my phone number, but that couldn't be possible since i accessed the website on 3 different networks and devices how can i check where the phone is added after typing it on the
 verify screen or that is only a one time login? In the security i didn't see any numbers added so i am still a bit sceptical. I just want to know if this was Valid on Microsoft part or something else.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<div>Hi DarkCrow1,&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>It's good to know that you're aware and taking precautionary measures when it comes to your Microsoft account. You said you've added your phone number to your Microsoft account because the system is requiring you to. To be sure, check if your phone number
 was added to your Microsoft account by going to <strong><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Account.live.com</a></strong>&gt;&gt; Click on More actions&gt;&gt; Choose Edit profile&gt;&gt; Select Contact info&gt;&gt; Look under Phone and see if
 the number you've added is there. If the phone number is present, you have successfully added to your Microsoft account. Not unless something different changed after adding your phone number.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Unspecified error when trying to activate microsoft office 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kate_mx0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unspecified error when trying to activate microsoft office 2010</h2>
                    <p>My microsoft word 2010 professsional plus just decided to no longer verify the product license. I spoke to someone using the online chat feature who told me to uninstall and reinstall. I did this and it won't let me activate my product by internet or phone.
 If I try to activate by internet it says that there is an unspecified error please try again later. If I try by phone I don't get the ID needed to put in to the automated system. I then rang the number given to me by the online chat guy for tech support. They
 say I either have to get an answer on here or pay £46 for someone to help me! I have already paid for the product and it has been installed on this computer for 6 months! I am based in the UK.
</p>
<p>Any help would be most appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            If it was previously activated, you should be able to get the "product ID" from the File &gt; Help pane. It is at the bottom of the column of info on the far right side of the pane.<br />
<br />
Since you are having internet activation problems, phone activation is your only resort.<br />
<br />
Here are some other ways of starting the phone activation process:<br />

<p>NOTE: you can find links to the specific activation instruction for Office or Windows in hyperlinks at the bottom of the article</p>
<p>Do a phone activation. Do not enter anything, wait a LONT time, until the phone system offers you the option to talk to a live “service” rep. Explain the problem to them. You are transferring the installation from a “dead” computer, or
 you are getting an invalid product key and would like to know the exact reason</p>

<p>
What can you do if Office product activation is refused?</p>
<p>If phone activation fails you can ask the same person for help though most likely it’s a mix-up with the activation code.</p>
<p>If you don’t get an activation code, Microsoft staff should explain why authorization can’t be given. If they can’t, then ask to speak to a supervisor. Try to find out exactly what the problem is and ask about further appeals process.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<br />
<br />
Do you know under what program you got Office Pro Plus. It is not normally sold to the general public.<br />
<br />
There are 2 ways for a company to buy Pro Plus for you. Since you are a student, one way is for them to get it through the "University" discount program.&nbsp; MS would provide support for that.<br />
<br />
The other way I can think of is through the "HUP", Home Use Program. But, on second thought, you are not an employee so you wouldn't qualify.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: MS online support "service" &lt;heavy sarcasm&gt; reps are notoriously lazy. They constantly tell people they don't qualify for support, or send them here help instead of doing their jobs.

            Those apps are probably just links to a website and the website has a buggy script on it. The message is an error from the website, not the phone itself.

            Hello mw-,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor willing to help.
<br />
<br />I would suggest if you can install office again:
<br />1- Completely uninstall office (before check if you have an account configured in Outlook be sure that all your emails are on the web) , follow the link below to be sure that you completely remove all old office instances <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-for-mac-eefa1199-5b58-43af-8a3d-b73dc1a8cae3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninst...</a>
<br />2- Restart your computer. Check and install updates, then restart and check for updates again until your computer don't show more updates.
<br />3- Install Office and keep it up at date.
<br />
<br />If you have not the source to install office again i would suggest to do the troubleshoot below:
<br />
<br />Empty the AutoRecovery folder
<br /> 
<br />If there are too many items in the AutoRecovery folder (user\Documents\Microsoft User Data\Office 2008 AutoRecovery or Office 2010 AutoRecovery), this can cause memory problems and save problems because these files are loaded into memory when Word is started.
<br />
<br />Move AutoRecovery files to the desktop or to another folder to see whether they are causing the problem. To do this, follow these steps:  
<br />
<br />To empty the AutoRecovery folder, follow these steps if have version 14.2.0 (also known as Service Pack 2) installed:
<br />
<br />1.     Quit all applications.
<br />2.     On the File menu, click New Folder.
<br />A new folder is created on the desktop. The folder will be called "New Folder."
<br />3.     On the Go menu, click Home.
<br />4.     Open Library.
<br />Note The Library folder is hidden in Mac OS X Lion. To display this folder, hold down the OPTION key while you click the Go menu.
<br />5.     Open Application Support, and then open Microsoft.
<br />6.     Open Office 2011 AutoRecovery.
<br />7.     On the Edit menu, click Select All.
<br />8.     Drag all files into "New Folder" on the desktop.
<br />The AutoRecovery folder should be empty.
<br />9.     Open Excel for Mac 2011 and try to save a file.
<br />If you can save a file, review the contents of "New Folder" to decide which files that you want to keep.
<br />
<br />If the problem continues to occur, go to the next method.
<br />
<br />To empty the AutoRecovery folder, follow these steps if you do not have Service Pack 2 installed:
<br />
<br />1.     Quit all applications.
<br />2.     On the File menu, click New Folder.
<br />A new folder is created on the desktop. The folder will be called "New Folder."
<br />3.     On the Go menu, click Documents.
<br />4.     Open Microsoft User Data, and then open Office 2011 AutoRecovery.
<br />5.     On the Edit menu, click Select All.
<br />6.     Drag all files into "New Folder" on the desktop.
<br />The AutoRecovery folder should be empty.
<br />7.     Open Excel for Mac 2011 and try to save a file.
<br />If you can save a file, review the contents of "New Folder" to decide which files that you want to keep.
<br />
<br />If the problem continues to occur, go to the next method.
<br />
<br /> Remove Word preferences 
<br />
<br />Note Removing the preferences will remove any customizations that you made. These customizations include changes to toolbars and custom dictionaries and keyboard shortcuts that you created.
<br />
<br />Quit all Microsoft Office for Mac applications.
<br />On the Go menu, click Home.
<br />Open Library. Note The Library folder is hidden in Mac OS X Lion. To display this folder, hold down the OPTION key while you click the Go menu.
<br />Open Preferences.
<br />Look for a file that is named com.microsoft.Word.plist.
<br />If you locate the file, move it to the desktop. If you cannot locate the file, the application is using the default preferences.
<br />If you locate the file and move it to the desktop, start Word, and check whether the problem still occurs. If the problem still occurs, quit Word, and then restore the file to its original location. Then, go to the next step. If the problem seems to be resolved, you can move the com.microsoft.Word.plist file to the trash.
<br />Quit all Office for Mac applications.
<br />On the Go menu, click Home.
<br />Open Library. Note The Library folder is hidden in Mac OS X Lion. To display this folder, hold down the OPTION key while you click the Go menu. 
<br />Open Preferences, and then open Microsoft.
<br />Locate the file that is named com.microsoft.Word.prefs.plist.
<br />Move the file to the desktop.
<br />Start Word, and then check whether the problem still occurs. If the problem still occurs, quit Word, and restore the file to its original location. Then, go to the next step. If the problem seems to be resolved, you can move the com.microsoft.Word.prefs.plist file to the trash.
<br />On the Go menu, click Home.
<br />Open Library. Note The Library folder is hidden in Mac OS X Lion. To display this folder, hold down the OPTION key while you click the Go menu.
<br />Open Application Support, and then open Microsoft.
<br />Open Office, and then open User Templates.
<br />Locate the file that is named Normal, and then move the file to the desktop.
<br />Start Word, and then check whether the problem still occurs. If the problem seems to be resolved, you can move the Normal file to the Trash. If the issue continues to occur, go to the next step.

<h2>            Importing saved text messages from file to my Lumia 640 LTE</h2>
                    <p>I have an issue that I haven't seen a sufficient answer for on the forum yet. So here goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to have an iPhone 4S (an absolute **** phone) and after Wi-Fi and Bluetooth stopped working I decided to switch to a Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have successfully (through third-party apps) transfered contacts, fotos, videos, documents, etc. but I haven't found a way to transfer my text messages from the iPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And please don't answer 'just use the trasfer my data app' - like I said - Bluetooth on my iPhone 4S DOESN'T work :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it helps - I have exported all my text messages to an Excel-file, a html-file and a pdf-file from my iPhone - so maybe it is possible to import the text messages to my Lumia from one of those files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way hope this forum can help since I'm very desperate... there are some very important text-messages I need... if not then I will have to sell my Lumia again an keep using my **** iPhone where nothing else works...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy New Year...</p>

            Hi. Great choice with the Lumia 640 LTE. Going back to your concern, this feature is not yet supported by the phone as backed up messages are not accessible for editing. The website will only let you know when was the last time you backed it up:&nbsp;<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?v=managestorage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?v=managestorage.</a>&nbsp;While&nbsp;we
 appreciate you switching to Lumia, it will be your discretion if you want to stay with your Lumia 640 LTE or move back to&nbsp;iPhone.&nbsp;

    <title>Where is the download for IE10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Where is the download for IE10&#63;</h2>
                    I uninstalled IE10 on my Windows 8 machine. &nbsp; How do I reinstall, since apparently Windows 8 will not function without it.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Perhaps that capability should be taken away if it's going to ruin everything else, such as Windows Update.<br />

<p>Does IE (now) work from the Desktop Taskbar icon?</p>
<p>Does IE work from the START screen "tile" (has it EVER worked from the START screen tile)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If neither of these 2 are working,&nbsp;how about&nbsp;a little more detail on what steps you took to "uninstall" Internet Explorer.&nbsp;

<p>BTW.&nbsp; You can't download another copy of &nbsp;IE10.&nbsp; It will tell you that it is already on your computer, if you try.</p>

            Thank you!&nbsp; A little clarification:&nbsp; <br />
<br />
"<i>The shortcut I created</i>" - I did a right-click, then "Send to...Desktop (shortcut)" as directed elsewhere when I was searching for an answer.&nbsp; But no, it didn't work.<br />
<br />
<br />
"<i>ran the files</i>" was from the elevated prompt.&nbsp; Not even an error message.&nbsp; No IE either.<br />
<br />
<br />
I followed both your suggestions.&nbsp; From the taskbar, IE shudders when clicked, becomes illuminated, becomes normal again, then does absolutely nothing.&nbsp; Nothing at all happens when I run from Start + R.
<br />
<br />
As far as the tiles, I do not have an IE tile.&nbsp; I got rid of as much of that stuff as possible as I do not care about most "apps" and was horrified at how much of my data allowance Tangent Games for example was eating up.<br />
<br />
At this point I can't tell you for sure what I did to uninstall IE10.&nbsp; I seem to recall that IE10 was in the list of Programs and Features (from Control Panel), and I uninstalled it as I would anything else listed there.&nbsp; But as I've read that that's impossible,
 I guess I didn't.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I did turn off&nbsp; its Windows Features and renamed the Internet Explorer folders in both C:\Programs Files and C:\Program Files(x86), but I've turned it back on, renamed the files back, and it just isn't there.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, at the same time I did that, the Windows Updater no longer showed the two updates I'd installed for .Net 3.5 and .Net 4.5.&nbsp; And finally, System File Checker tells me something's wrong, it doesn't say what, just that it can't fix it.&nbsp;

            <p>Yes.............I sort of suspected most of that.&nbsp; I guess you had your reasons for trying to uninstall Internet Explorer but, unfortunately, it is not possible because Internet Explorer is not a program that can be installed/uninstalled.&nbsp; It is a "feature"
 of the Windows 8 operating system.&nbsp; The only thing you could have done was to disable it under "Turn Windows Features on and off".</p>
<p><br />
But, you tried reversing most of your actions, as you said,&nbsp;and sfc /scannow&nbsp;is telling you the bad news........you have some missing and/or corrupted system files and they are not repairable.</p>
<p><br />
There's only one course of action left and that is to reload the Windows 8 operating system.&nbsp; With it will come a clean copy of Internet Explorer 10, it will fix your registry errors, replace the corrupted system files, rename all the files you changed, reorder
 your file index, reapply all of your updates, and reconfigure your system back to its original factory default.&nbsp; The procedure is called "<strong>REFRESH</strong>" and it takes about 30-45 minutes.&nbsp; There are a number of drawbacks to doing this, but&nbsp;you are&nbsp;really
 out of other&nbsp;options.&nbsp; Its going to take some effort on your part.</p>
<p><br />
You are not alone in this sort of thing.&nbsp; Many folks try to customize their computers and run into similar quagmires.&nbsp; That's why the REFRESH function was included in Windows 8..</p>
<p><br />
Read this <u>THOROUGHLY</u>.&nbsp; About refresh ..............................</p>

            As my hopes grew ever dimmer, I suspected I'd have to do that too.<br />
<br />
I'll go read the article.&nbsp; I did have the foresight to make a Recovery drive, both on the hard drive and on a USB.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<br />
My initial reason for uninstalling was that when IE8 had that unpleasant habit of "notifying" me every time it blocked something and I couldn't turn off the notifications, AND the message would not fade away on its own but required me to stop what I was doing
 and slap it, I became a Foxfire user.<br />
<br />
One problem - maybe.&nbsp; You mention that Refresh will re-apply all the updates I've done so far.&nbsp; That's good because I've applied over 500 Mb of them.&nbsp; That may be bad, because 2769166 has given me an 8020002E and the log - at least the ones I have access to,
 another "undocumented feature" seems to be that I as Admin and sole user, cannot read the CBS logs - keeps referring to a persistent download.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to do anything tonight, because as you say it's got drawbacks, but I will do it and will be sure to let you know.&nbsp; I very, very much appreciate your help.<br />

            OK, that doesn't sound too bad at all.&nbsp; (crosses fingers)<br />
<br />
I read the link you provided above and it was so helpful!&nbsp; Hope it's OK if I say that you write in a way that shows a grasp of the situation and the ability to get right down to it.&nbsp; (That is not to say that the forum overall has not been good, quick and creative.&nbsp;
 I've got quite a collection of techniques on a cheat sheet that I got from the forum.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The information was reassuring and very specific.&nbsp; In fact it inspired me to make a checklist before I start the process:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Back up all my personal files, including .exe's of software I'll have to reinstall</li><li>Delete Image - nonworking image anyway <br />
</li><li>Have a hard copy of anything I might need to refer to if something goes wrong</li><li>REFRESH<br />
</li><li>Run System File Checker at completion of Refresh, after installing other software, and after uninstalling Norton and other apps<br />
</li><li>Check Windows Update log</li><li>Make sure Windows Defender got updated too<br />
</li><li>Recreate Image</li><li>Recreate Applications and Drivers backup drive (Gateway)</li></ul>
<br />
Before I forget: does the computer have to be online for the process?&nbsp;&nbsp; And, I applied some updates through Windows Update, and others as .msu's (because it appeared to take care of this problem for awhile).&nbsp; Will the updates sync up properly?&nbsp; If they do bomb,
 will the REFRESH continue or...?<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />

            Good thing I asked.&nbsp; The other link did not say, and my computer isn't usually connected; I use a USB760 modem.&nbsp; There are no other options.&nbsp; This is starting to look very frustrating to say the least.<br />
<br />
I bought this on 11/6/13 but had to apply updates that were well over a year old, and used around 4 - 4.5 G just trying (and trying) to have them work.&nbsp; There's another huge batch dated 12/10.&nbsp; There's no way this can all be done in 30-45 minutes on my USB760
 connection either, if I understand you correctly.<br />
<br />
Might I be better off just wiping it clean?&nbsp; If I have to start from scratch with a year's worth of uploads I'm unwilling to blow a whole month's worth of data at once and then go without, and I'm unwilling to exceed the allowance.&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you think?<br />

            Oh no, I do understand what Updates are for and what they do.&nbsp; I also understand why I've got a year's worth of them.&nbsp; I applied them throughout the last 20 yrs I've been using Windows and
<b>never</b> had problems except in the last few weeks before my W7 machine died.<br />
<br />
Whether it's size on disk or something else, it's getting charged against my 6Gb allowance.&nbsp; Last month, with downloading 500 Mb of uploads as reported on the WU screen, I mysteriously used nearly all 6Gb where my normal use is 2.&nbsp; I can account for about additional
 300 Mb for the four applications I downloaded and installed; that would come to less than 3 Gb in all.<br />
<br />
That was my point with the wipe.&nbsp; I really don't believe that it's going to take merely a bit longer at a speed of 33 kbps.&nbsp; My rough calculations just on the 500 Mb show over 4 hours.&nbsp; Add in the nearly 200 Mb waiting since Dec 10 and it'll be 6 or 7 hours.&nbsp;
 I don't for a moment think there's no possibility of a disconnect in 6 hours.&nbsp; If there's&nbsp; a disconnect AND I'm lucky, I'll be able to do the wipe then after wasting however much time and data trying the refresh.&nbsp; If I'm not, it's a paperweight and I've thrown
 away the cost of the computer, two months' worth of connection charges absolutely wasted, and many more hours than I should have had to spend after doing something that is accessible from a menu, should not be allowed or should be reasonably able to recover
 from.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I can't imagine having to refresh this after a couple of years.<br />
<br />
I realize this isn't your fault, but perhaps you're in a position to pass this information along.&nbsp; As someone who's helped make Gates very, very rich, I'd be much more impressed if instead of writing more and more "apps" to make grocery lists, and loading an
 unreliable OS with tiles to encourage me to buy stuff, they could fix this rather HUGE hazard that is "turning IE 10 Windows Feature off".<br />
<br />
I think I'm going to have to go with the reinstall.&nbsp; I will let you know what happens and even though I'm shall we say, extremely (and permanently) disappointed, I very much appreciate your help.<br />

            No, I made a Recovery drive immediately.&nbsp; I do learn from some mistakes!&nbsp; I plan to use that so it will not cost anything but the updates, and I can parcel those out a few at a time, which will allow me also to check the results as I go and stop right
 away if one fails.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:&nbsp; I also intend to try restoring the system to the day before all this stopped working and see if I can proceed with the updates from there.<br />
<br />
<br />
I thank you again for your time and help.<br />

    <title>Automatically change specific words&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maxb46  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automatically change specific words&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'd like to know if there is a way to get word 2007 to take any specific word of my choosing to automatically change font colour (of my choice) and underline that word with automatic capitalisation as I type it without having to go back and change it manually?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have worked out how to capitalise specific words, now all I want to do is work out how to underline those same words in the font colour of my choosing without having to re-do the settings after I close the wrod programme, I want the settings&nbsp;permanantly
 set to do specific words everytime I open word.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So for instance lets take the word "Stalling", when I type it in word and I type it in lower case I'd like it to automatically capitalise which I've worked out how to do, but I'd also like that same word to change to red in colour with it underlined without
 manually going back over the document to change it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I do that, if so please enlighten me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, Max</p>

            <p>This could drive you nuts, but all you need to do is set up formatted autocorrect entries for these words.</p>

<p>Type out and format Stalling then select it.</p>

<h2>            Various continuum questions - office365, printer, regular desktop software ...</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>here various questions:</p>
<p>1) I am having trouble to use my office 365 with my 950XL in the continuum mode. I have a regular account, but it does not work and asks for another upgrade for 7€ a month?!</p>
<p>2) In addition, I have trouble connecting/installing a HP Laserjet P1005 printer via USB to the continuum dock? Does it work at all?</p>
<p>3) What can I do when certain software is not available as app? Can I somehow use regular software, such as KeepPass in Continuum Mode?
</p>
<p>4) Sometimes when I disconnect the continuum dock, all the open edge browser taps were closed (and are gone) - why?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best 2be</p>
