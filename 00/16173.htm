<h2>            after upgrade 1803 my audio is bad</h2>
                    <p>after upgrade 1803 my audio is bad</p>
<p>music, spotify, youtube, my own mp3s, plays badly, it is fine for 4/5 seconds then there is a lag, as the hardware is not enough fast to process the data, then it goes ok for the next 4/5 seconds.</p>
<p>before the upgrade everything was OK</p>
<p>just to make a test, I have plugged in an USB audio interface, thinking the problem was due to some driver gone bad for the built in audio board, but the problem is still present</p>
<p>I have entered in the properties fot the audio device and found on the event log that the day the upgrade to 1803 was done, audio driver was changed</p>
<p>here is the event log, it's in italian since I am from italy, but I think you can understand anyway, everything happaener on june 5th 2018, the numbers indicate the time</p>
<pre><p>10.48.23 installazione dispositivo richiesta
10.48.57 installazione dispositivo richiesta
10.54.38 migrazione del dispositivo eseguita
10.54.39 servizio driver aggiunto (hdaudaddservice)
10.54.39 dispositivo installato (hdaudio.inf_amd64_ab6d44ea538e7e10)</p><p /><p>should I try to change the hdaudio.inf file with a previous version?</p><p>btw, my PC is a dell precision m4400, the audio device is an IDT hd audio</p><p /><p>what can I do?</p></pre>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You don't have to be annoyed with Microsoft for this.</p>
<p>Please ask your Univeristy IT team to reset your password and provide you with the temporary password with the option for you to change it the next time you login.</p>
<p>Once this is done you should be able to login using your temp password and reset the password to your choice.</p>
<p>I hope this will sort out your issue.</p>
<p>Regards!</p>

<p>Hi Dileepa,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my school's IT (aka Office of Information Technology, or OIT) cannot take care of this problem. &nbsp;As they declare on their website,</p>
<p>"The OIT &nbsp;Help Desk cannot help with passwords or activation.</p>
<p><strong>Call Microsoft</strong></p>
<p>If you are having problems please call Microsoft at: 1-800-642-7676</p>
<p>Select Home User and follow the prompts for Office Install help</p>
<p>Alternate Phone Support: 1-800-865-9408</p>
<p>Office 365</p>
<p>options, 4,1,5 for Office Pro Plus</p>
<p><strong>Call or visit the closest Microsoft Store</strong>"</p>
<p>I followed OIT's instructions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Microsoft has shuffled me between departments and various representatives for the past week, and I had to repeat my situation again...and again...and again...etc, as well as navigate and learn different communication platforms for each department
 again...and again...etc. &nbsp;I'm stunned at how unstreamlined their Support System is. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Hence my annoyance. &nbsp;Especially because I have work and critical deadlines.</p>
<p>Thus, while your solution may work at other institutions, my university happens to be an unfortunate exception. &nbsp;Regardless, thank you for replying.</p>

            I know it's late, but you can make full use of the activesync features of the Outlook.com account by adding it on the N900 as an exchange account.<br />
<br />
You can just follow the 'Mobile' section of the outlook.com help, e.g, <a href="http://help.outlook.com/en-us/140/hh135097.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://help.outlook.com/en-us/140/hh135097.aspx</a><br />

Worked first time for me, and sync is perfect :)<br />

<h2>            Unable to rename a folder in Outlook</h2>
                    &nbsp;I seem to all of a sudden be unable to rename a folder. I right-click on it, type in the new name, press enter, and it goes right back to the old name. On subsequent tries, when I right click on it, my new name comes up - I again press enter, and it always
 just goes back to the old folder name.&nbsp; Not sure what vesion of Outlook I have. Have not been able to find out. All the things I have read to do to determine which version you are using don't work for me (click on help "about microsoft outlook" - that doesn't
 come up when I click on help) (also saw "click on 'file' " - there is no 'file' on my email account.) I know I pay for Windows Live Hotmail Plus.

            Hi Sandi,<br />
<br />
There are several reasons as to why you're unable to rename a folder in your account. In some cases, this can be due to a corrupted file on your computer that affects you from renaming a folder. Regarding your concern, it seems that you were successfully renamed
 the folder. It's just that it didn't show up the changes on the Outlook app. To validate if you successfully renamed a folder, we suggest that you check the changes online through
<strong>Outlook.com</strong>.<br />
<br />
For you to know what Office version that you have, you may refer to this <em><strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/About-Office-What-version-of-Office-am-I-using-932788B8-A3CE-44BF-BB09-E334518B8B19?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em>.<br />

We look forward to your reply.

<h2>            Running Total in MS Access 2010</h2>
                    <p>I am fairly new to Access and am needing to add a column to get a running total. I tried a DSUM function, but it takes way too long. I have been attempting a subquery to see if it is fster, but cannot figure out the syntax.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the SQL for my query:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT [Sorted Spend].Material, [Sorted Spend].Rank, [Sorted Spend].[Part Class], [Sorted Spend].[Future Spend], FormatPercent([Future Spend]/[SumOfFuture Spend]) AS [Percent Spend]<br />
FROM [Sorted Spend] INNER JOIN [Raw Total Spend] ON [Sorted Spend].[Part Class] = [Raw Total Spend].[Part Class]<br />
WHERE ((([Sorted Spend].[Part Class])="Raw"));</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am needing to do a running total of "Future Spend". The "Rank" field is an autonumber form the table and is already sorted in ascending order. Can anyone help with how to write the subquery for this??</p>

            <p>Do you really need the running total in a query? You can create a running total in a report without needing to modify its Record Source:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Create a report based on your query.</li><li>Place a text box in the Detail section of the report.</li><li>Set its Control Source to Future Spend.</li><li>Set its Running Sum property to Over All.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Since a report is populated sequentially, calculating the running sum is relatively efficient.</p>

            The most efficient means of computing balances is with a join:<br />
<br />
SELECT S1.Material, S1.Rank, S1.[Part Class], S1.[Future Spend],<br />
SUM(S2.[Future Spend]) AS Balance<br />
FROM [Sorted Spend] AS S1 INNER JOIN [Sorted Spend] AS S2 <br />
ON S2.Rank&lt;=S1.Rank<br />
WHERE S1.[Part Class] = "Raw"<br />
AND S2.[Part Class] = "Raw"<br />
GROUP BY S1.Rank, S1.Material, S1.[Part Class], S1.[Future Spend];<br />
<br />
What are you trying to return as a percentage, however?&nbsp; Is it the running balance as a percentage of the total spend regardless of Part Class?&nbsp; If so:<br />
<br />
SELECT S1.Material, S1.Rank, S1.[Part Class], S1.[Future Spend],<br />
SUM(S2.[Future Spend]) AS Balance,<br />
FORMAT(SUM(S2.[Future Spend])/<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (SELECT SUM([Future Spend])<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM [Sorted Spend]),"PERCENT") AS [Percent Spend]<br />
FROM [Sorted Spend] AS S1 INNER JOIN [Sorted Spend] AS S2 <br />
ON S2.Rank&lt;=S1.Rank<br />
WHERE S1.[Part Class] = "Raw"<br />
AND S2.[Part Class] = "Raw"<br />
GROUP BY S1.Rank, S1.Material, S1.[Part Class], S1.[Future Spend];<br />
<br />
Or is it the running balance as a percentage of the total spend for Part Class 'raw'?&nbsp; If so:<br />
<br />
SELECT S1.Material, S1.Rank, S1.[Part Class], S1.[Future Spend],<br />
SUM(S2.[Future Spend]) AS Balance,<br />
FORMAT(SUM(S2.[Future Spend])/<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (SELECT SUM([Future Spend])<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM [Sorted Spend]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHERE [Part Class] = "Raw"),"PERCENT") AS [Percent Spend]<br />
FROM [Sorted Spend] AS S1 INNER JOIN [Sorted Spend] AS S2 <br />
ON S2.Rank&lt;=S1.Rank<br />
WHERE S1.[Part Class] = "Raw"<br />
AND S2.[Part Class] = "Raw"<br />
GROUP BY S1.Rank, S1.Material, S1.[Part Class], S1.[Future Spend];<br />
<br />
In the above I've assumed that all returned columns are from the Sorted Spend table.&nbsp; If so there is no need to join this to the Raw Total Spend table as the restriction on the Part Class value being 'raw'&nbsp; is on the join column.<br />
<br />
However, relying on an autonumber column to give a set of sequential values in order of the insertion of the rows into a table is living dangerously.&nbsp; An autonumber is intended to guarantee one thing and one thing only, as set of distinct long integer number
 values which are semantically arbitrary.&nbsp; You could well find that at some time a value which is not in sequence will be inserted.&nbsp; If you wish to number rows sequentially in order of the insertion of the rows into a table, then you should not use an autonumber
 column, but should compute the value when the row is inserted.&nbsp; If you merely need a set of values guaranteed to be in order of the insertion of the rows into a table then the simplest way is to date/time stamp each row by means of a column of date/time data
 type with a DefaultValue property of Now(). <br />
<br />
You'll find examples of queries for computing balances in various contexts as <em>

 the installation. So I tried to reinstall, but it says another installation is in progress. &nbsp;So I've followed the steps to try and fix this: run the uninstaller 'fixit' program, run CCleaner to strip out remaining registry entries, reboot. No effect: running
 the installer always claims there's another running. &nbsp;The only discernible effect of running the uninstaller Fixit is that it takes noticeably longer, a few seconds, before the error box comes up. There are no other msiexec or click-to-run processes running.
 Any ideas what to try next?</p>

            <p>This can happen when the form's Recordsource doesn't return any records (so you can't see existing data), but is also not updateable (so you can't see the blank "new record" either). The form just shows blank white.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doublecheck that the Recordsource for the form is correct - try opening it just as a query datasheet. My guess is that it won't show any records. If that's the case correct the query so it returns the records you want to see on the form. If you need help
 doing so open it in SQL view and post the SQL text here.</p>

            <p>An Autonumber is a unique identifier for each row in a table.&nbsp; The actual number is inconsequential and you should not be relying on it in any manner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you need to do is create 2 fields (Assuming the LH applies to all).</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Litigate Hold Date</li><li>Litigation Hold Number</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Then you add a control on your form for the date</p>
<p>and add a control of the sequential hold number (which you will calculate using Nz(DMax(...),0)+1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then if you want to display it, you can simply concatenate the various control values in another control as you see fit.</p>

            I think I referred you to my <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169http://" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
CustomNumber demo</a> in another thread; this illustrates, amongst other things, how to compute sequential numbering per group.&nbsp;&nbsp; But you first need to consider whether you should have a structured key like this.&nbsp; General speaking structured keys as a single
 column are inappropriate as the column is storing multiple attributes, violating Codd's Guaranteed Access Rule.<br />
<br />
If the prefix 'LH' is a constant then it should be stored in a single row in a single column in another table.&nbsp; If not, in a column in the current table.<br />
<br />
If the year value can be derived from another column of date/time data type in this or another table, it should not be stored but computed at runtime.&nbsp; If not, the year should be stored in a separate column, e.g. CaseYear, and the serial number in a separate
 column of integer number data type.&nbsp; The two columns should be included in a single unique index.<br />
<br />
To return the composite value is a simple task of concatenating the three values, formatting the serial number to three digits.<br />

            <p>Ken,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the responses you have given me, they have been very helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure if I had explained it in the other posting dealing with the tables but what the individual was doing while using an Excel spreadsheet to gather all of this information was as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)When the individual was notified from OGC about a new litigation they were using in the first column of the spreadsheet (LH Number) which was the LH-2016-051.&nbsp; This is how&nbsp;the individual&nbsp;was assigning the numbers then sending the information by E-Mail
 to all of the custodians using it in the subject line of the E-Mail the LH number.&nbsp; So once the documents that were attached to the E-Mail were returned, the individual could take those documents and save them into a folder on a hard drive, which then has
 to be maintained until the retention schedule says to destroy once the case has been lifted.</p>
<p>2)The individual&nbsp;would then fill out all of the other columns in the spreadsheet in order as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Case Name</p>
<p>Date of Case - This is usually the date the case was received from OGC</p>
<p>Attorney Name - Which this actually contained both the last and first name in the same column, but I was making it easier for the query by doing it in separate columns, especially when I was using the multi-valued fields, which I am seeing that is not the
 best approach on what I was trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>Custodian Name - This contained the same last and first name in same column but this column could have upwards of 50 people just in this field based on the case location on who could potentially have records for the case.&nbsp; Once again I was trying to break
 the names into two columns to make it easier for sorting purposes in queries to run the reports that my high level supervisor wants.</p>
<p>Date of Lift - The date a litigation was closed</p>
<p>Region - The region on where the case came from R1, R3, etc is how the individual was doing it.&nbsp; I had made this into a look-up field.</p>
<p>Forest - What Forest in the region the case came from if this information was available in the notification from OGC.&nbsp; I am actually doing away with this field as it is not needed and has hardly ever been used from the spreadsheets I have received.</p>
<p>Type of Case - This was a list of the cases being either EEO/FOIA/Etc., which I had done this column as a look-up field.</p>
<p>MSPB Docket #</p>
<p>Civil Case #</p>
<p>FS Agency #</p>
<p>Misc Notes</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yes it does look like the LH is constant, however what I&nbsp;am trying to do is just figure out a way that I can make sure that a number is never duplicated.&nbsp; What I mean by that is when a new case comes in you go right to the database form, which I will
 admit I am no programmer, so I was doing a basic form design with the buttons of add new record kind of stuff.&nbsp; But in order to find out what the next number in sequence was you would have to go to last record to see what the number was used.&nbsp; So that way
 you knew what the next number was.&nbsp; At the same token I was wanting to take it a step further so that at the end of every calendar year I wanted everything to start over with the new year and then start back from 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was then wanting to set it up so that when a case was lifted, I could run an append query to archive the old information from the main table that was being used.&nbsp; This way if my supervisor wanted to know what active cases we had I could have that report
 as a constant to supply him as well as if he wanted a report on what cases are assigned to the different attorney's or the custodians, I could provide him with that information as well just by running the queries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yes all of this other stuff that yourself, Gina, and Scottgem are telling me is a lot of information and I am truly trying to grasp what you are saying but some is I admit really going over my head but I am bound to learn this from you guys.&nbsp; So that
 is why I am glad I have met you individuals on here because I am learning a heck of a lot with this, moreso than what I learned from my training at New Horizons Computer Training.&nbsp; So whatever suggestions y'all are giving me I am trying to apply them into
 the database.&nbsp; I guess I am just getting confused with how to separate out that LH number **** and then trying to tie all of the tables together to where anyone who opens the database for the first time all they have to do is just enter in the new case information
 and just have to use drop down menus (combo boxes or list boxes) to select the attorney(s) assigned as well as the custodian(s) assigned and then I can run the reports as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attorney Last Name, First Name</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case Number (LH)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Case Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Typ of Case&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;MSPB Docket#&nbsp;&nbsp; Civil Case#&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FS Agency#</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Custodian Last Name, First Name</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case Number (LH)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type of Case&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Region&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Misc Notes</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then another report that has all information is what my supervisor is going to be looking for.&nbsp; Once again I hope this really helps all of y'all understand what I am trying to accomplish.</p>

            <p>ScottGem,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have hit the nail on the head with this new way of using Access is all new and a very good learning curve for me.&nbsp; Believe you me I am trying to nail down this new way of thinking on the design of a database.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"We understood that you were starting from an Excel spreadsheet. That happens a lot of times. Excel is a great spreadsheet, but its not a good database. So it frequently happens that people start with Excel because that's all they know. They then run

<p>
</p><p>ScottGem I totally agree with your statement about that is all they know and this individual only knows how to use Excel.&nbsp; Now I am trying to take that information and put it into an Access database to try and alleviate some of those issues encountered with
 using Excel as long as this individual has.&nbsp; In matter of fact every year they were starting a new spreadsheet to record the new cases but somehow still missed numbers or duplicated numbers, which still blows my mind on how they could do that if they were
 going row by row and entering that dang LH-2016-001 everytime.&nbsp; Believe you me and that is what I am absolutely trying to do with getting the table design down to a science right now.&nbsp; After looking at a lot of the demos that were provided by Gina or going
 out there and just doing research on google searches for videos after speaking with y'all the first time I see people with upwards of 20 or so tables and I am like I am only trying to use a couple by look-up fields from the main table to the other tables but
 after listening to y'all,&nbsp;I am like how in the heck are those with the 20 or so tables doing it for the linking to where I am not trying to make it so hard on myself to get this perfect from what y'all are telling me.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>I guess I am just getting confused with how to separate out that LH number ****

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ScottGem That is why I was listening to all of y'all because that LH number is what is killing me on all of this and I was trying to figure out the best approach on getting away from it, because even
 that other gentleman I think his name was Don was even saying the same thing on why is that a constant and that is how the individual was doing it in the Excel spreadsheet for so long that I am now trying to&nbsp;find a better way of thinking by listening to you
 guys and yes I will admit the learning curve here, but I really don't think the LH and the year need to be in there as the date of the case has the year.&nbsp; All I need to worry about is making sure that the next number in sequence is used.&nbsp; Because if I need
 to run a report by year that is simply making a query for whatever year my director would need, correct!</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>ScottGem the individual that is going to be taking over this litigation hold process was asking if there was a way of archiving the cases when they were lifted and of course I knew
 their was by using the separate archive table with an append query, but when I was using the multi-valued fields on the attorney, custodians, regions, and records managers it was giving me the error that it can not use the append query on the multi-valued
 fields.&nbsp; So if you do not mind sir can you please point me in the direction on video demos or even can you explain it not so&nbsp;techy programming on how to do the field on active or not, so that way I am only going to have maybe a couple of tables that I have
 to do the relationship on.</span></span></span></p>

</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>ScottGem I am also still trying to really grasp the one thing&nbsp;that yourself, Gina, and Ken have been trying to explain to me but maybe my learning curve and grasping is overwhelming
 me with the table design and that is setting up that unique identifier when there can be more than one attorney,&nbsp;more than one custodian, and more than one region assigned to a case.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>ScottGem I am going to only have the following tables:&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>tblPeople which will&nbsp;have all the attorney's, custodians, and records managers.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>tblTypeofCase which will have the look-up&nbsp;values however it will be a one-to-one relationship as there can only be one&nbsp;type of case (ie. EEO/MSPB)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>tblRegions - Which this is one of those that could be assigned&nbsp;as a many-to-many relationship as well as the People table.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>tblCases - which this is the one that will tie all of the other tables to this one.&nbsp; Please tell me if I am still not on track based on what you explained earlier.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>OK, You are worrying yourself too much about the LHID. That is very simple to do. Again my blog details it and should make it simple. It also makes it fairly automatic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, I'm not sure why this is so hard for you. In its simplest form you can have a Yes/No field that is set to True when the case is complete and remains False while its not.&nbsp;You then set criteria to show only records where the field is False.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The many to many relationship is hard for many to grasp. But you need to be more specific in your questions and less verbose. You keep repeating the same things instead of trying to get clarification of what you don't understand. There is no way to directly
 model a many to many. So you need to use the junction table. In a query you set up two 1 to many relationships, from the junction table to each table. For example:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>tjxAttCase.CaseID&lt;-&gt;tblCases.CaseID and tjxAttCase.AttorneyID&lt;-&gt;tblPeople.PersonID</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>..............however what I&nbsp;am trying to do is just figure out a way that I can make sure that a number is never duplicated.</p>
<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, if you store the sequential number as a separate column, and derive the year from the Date Of Case column's value you cannot do as would normally be done and include the two columns in a unique index.&nbsp; So you have two alternatives:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; One way to do it would be to apply a CHECK CONSTRAINT to the table which prevents there being more than one row where the serial number and the year of the DateOfCase column's value are the same.&nbsp; This cannot be done via the table design interface, however;
 it has to be done by executing a DDL statement.&nbsp; DDL (data definition language) is a part of the SQL language in which queries are written.&nbsp; It's not difficult, but I would not expect an inexperienced developer to be familiar with it.&nbsp; I can, if you wish,
 walk you through it.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; The other way is to break the rules and include a CaseYear column in the table, assigning its value when a row is inserted via a bound form with:<br />
<br />
Me.CaseYear = Year(Me.[Date Of Case])<br />
<br />
You can then include the CaseYear and the column containing the serial numbers per year in a unique index.&nbsp; Automating the insertion of the next number per year is relatively simple.&nbsp; As this does break the rules, however, it is not an entirely bulletproof
 solution, which is why the rules exist in the first place.&nbsp; The 'LH' prefix is not relevant to this issue.&nbsp; Having a single column as a 'structured key' is also not bulletproof of course as in both cases it would be possible for the year of the date and the
 year part of the key to be inconsistent with each other.<br />

            <p>I started as an Insider in Oct 2015.</p>
<p>I look at my name and it says I have been a member since Mar 2012.&nbsp; Long before this insider thing started.
</p>
<p>I think that is when I got my Microsoft account started even though I have been in PC since 1970 and computing using terminals since the late 1950s.</p>

            <p>Very interesting. I never had a Microsoft Account until I started this Insider Program. I guess it is like all other Microsoft stuff it is hard to find anything that is 100 % reliable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It all doesn't make any difference to me testing these Builds is just a puzzle and I do enjoy Puzzles.</p>

<p>The only way I know that will help this is to use a bluetooth headset.&nbsp; That way the alert will play in the headset but otherwise there's no other way that I know of.&nbsp; Basically what's happening is the sound coming
 from the speaker on the device is being picked up by the microphone just like your voice.&nbsp; The close proximity of the speaker and microphone makes it problematic to cancel out the sound.</p>

<h2>            Getting back in Windows Insider Program</h2>
                    I had been a member of the program already before build 10240 was released. Then I stayed on the stable version. Now I'd like to continue helping with testing preview builds inside a VM but I'm waiting for newly downloadable builds in vain. Is there any
 way to get back?

    <title>Birthday Reminders in Outlook 2010 Calendar Should be &#34;None&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dgbms  say:</h3>
<h2>            Birthday Reminders in Outlook 2010 Calendar Should be &#34;None&#34;</h2>
                    <p>We are running Outlook 2010 with an Exchange 2003 server.&nbsp; I have a user that at one time had in Calendar Options the Default Reminders set for 18 hours, with the box checked.&nbsp; She decided she wanted the default reminder to be "none", so she simply unchecked
 the Default Reminders box.&nbsp; Now when she goes to create a new appointment the drop down box next to "Reminder" is set for "none", as it should be.&nbsp; However when she goes to a Contact and adds a birthday then looks at the event in her calendar it shows a Reminder
 as being set for 18 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So unchecking the Default Reminders box under Calendar Options sets the Reminder for "none" as it should for appointments, but not so with birthdays added through a Contact.&nbsp; The user can always change the Reminder from "0 minutes" to "none", but she would
 prefer it show up by default as "none".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with this will be appreciated!</p>

<h3> fundam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Flow chart will not show text in inserted shape, unless a text box is also inserted.</h2>
                    <p>In Word 2010, when I set up a flow chart and insert a shape, and click in the shape, a cursor appears, but when I enter text no text appears.</p>
<p>If the text is spelled wrong, a curly red underline appears to indicate misspelling.&nbsp; Thus it is apparent that the program recognizes that text is being entered.</p>
<p>Clicking on "no fill" does not cause the text to be displayed.&nbsp; Nor does altering the alignment of the text.</p>
<p>OF COURSE, inserting a text box will provisionally solve the problem.&nbsp; However, the purpose of the present question is to determine whether inserting a text box is necessary.</p>

            It would appear that the text in the shape is formatted as white (or the color of the shape fill). Change the font color to Automatic, and you should see black or white as required.

Before installing the Windows 10 Technical Preview update, did you update the drivers for all the devices on the computer?</p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue could be due to some device driver issues on the computer.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You may try installing the latest drivers for all the devices on the computer using Windows Update or from the computer manufacturer’s website. Please follow these steps:</span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:

<p><span>If issue persist, proceed to next method.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 2</strong>: I would suggest you to perform a clean boot and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Clean boot</strong> will check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</span></span></p>

    <title>PowerPoint Audio Questions &#38; Others - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> archeradvisors  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint Audio Questions &#38; Others</h2>
                    <p>I wish to create a PowerPoint presentation to later record as a webcast to put on YouTube, etc. I see from some research I've done (I have no experience with PowerPoint) that you can record into the presentation. Is this recorded into the individual slide?
 In other words, if the presentation is launched, when slide 1 is shown audio 1 begins, then when you moves to slide 2 audio 2 begins, etc? Or is the recording done over the entire slide presentation as you click through it?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would it be easier to record the audio into the presentation while using something like Camtasia or FlashPro 5 when you are recording the screen?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you export the presentation and audio to a video file while in PowerPoint?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help as I work into this project. </p>

<p>Audio recorded into a presentation is saved as a series of audio objects, one per slide.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This does a pretty good job of making sure that the recordings match up with the slide changes, but doesn't allow for continuous audio; there'll be a break between slides.&nbsp; No biggie if you're just recording narration, but a problem if you want a smooth
 musical background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another possible problem is that PPT records at rather low quality and no longer offers the option of selecting a higher quality recording as it used to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are ways of having an existing audio track play through an entire presentation, but PowerPoint isn't able to keep the slide changes synchronized to the audio accurately when you do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have Camtasia, I'd use it instead. Record video as the slide show plays, then you can add audio later, even mix music b/g and narration tracks, and it'll all stay in synch when exported to a format that makes YouTube et al happy.</p>
