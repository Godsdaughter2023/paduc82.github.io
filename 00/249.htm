<p>so i took my phone to nokia care centre, technicians checked its imei no. in computer and said this mobile is from other country, so they will install its os again with different product code but they will charge for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have internet connection at home, how can i download and install suitable product code for my nokia 701.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone has any idea ??</p>

<p>Unfortunately that cannot be discussed on Nokia's official support site as it is against forum rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;What you can try is a full device reset and re-install of the firmware using Nokia Suite.</p>

<p>You may get a nasty surprise when using option to re-install existing device software in Nokia Suite &gt; Tools &gt; Software updates as it will revert to Belle FP2 for it's
<em><strong>original</strong> </em>product code as determined by keying in *#0000# upon dialler. Software for a different product code from this could have been installed previously, which would be updated from Belle FP1 to Belle FP2 via FOTA whereas using
 Nokia Suite has to install software determined by product code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really I am just warning you that you could be presented with a different set of languages installed from what you expected after re-installing software with Nokia Suite.</p>

</p><p>Does Word 2007 work properly if you restart the program in Safe mode (as part of troubleshooting)? Here's how to do that: Hold the Ctrl key as you start Word and say yes when asked about Safe mode. Create a new document and try copying/pasting. Note that
 this is just for troubleshooting; it's not a permanent fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Safe mode works, exit Word and troubleshoot add-ins as discussed in the article at

                    <p>Hi Yammer team, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever recent activity occurs such as a new announcement being posted to the group or replies from a conversation, network and group admins of the group they&nbsp;are a member of&nbsp;do not receive Yammer e-mails which should be sent to Microsoft Outlook. However,

</p><p>Do you have a solution as to how group admins and network admins who are members of the group can receive emails?

</p><p>Please respond ASAP. </p>

            <p>Hello Richard,</p>
<p>
To change the email notifications, follow these steps:
</p><ol>
<li>Sign in to your Yammer account. In the upper-right corner of the screen, click the ellipsis (…), and then click&nbsp;<strong><span>Edit Profile</span></strong>.</li><li>In the column on the left side, click&nbsp;<strong>Notifications</strong>.<br />
<br />
<span>Note</span> If you're a member of multiple networks, click the name of the network that you want to change the email notifications for. You'll have to change the notification settings for each network individually.
</li><li>In the&nbsp;<strong>Send me a digest of message activity</strong>&nbsp;drop-down list, select&nbsp;<strong>Never</strong>,
<strong>Daily</strong>, or <strong>Weekly</strong>. This sets the frequency at which you'll receive a digest email message that summarizes the recent activity in your network.</li><li>Under the <strong>Email me when...</strong>&nbsp;section header, clear the check box next to each update type that you don't want to be notified about.</li><li>Under the <strong>There is new activity in the following Groups</strong>&nbsp;section header, select the check box next to each group that you want to receive real-time email updates for. You can clear a selected check box to stop updates for
 that group.</li><li>Click <strong>Save</strong>&nbsp;at the bottom to put all the changes that you've made into effect.&nbsp;</li></ol>

    <title>Conditional Format Not Updating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> d0gknees  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conditional Format Not Updating</h2>
                    <p>I'm having trouble with Conditional Formatting not updating when values are changed. It only updates the format after I scroll away from the relevant cells and back again. And even that is not 100% reliable, sometimes I have to scroll away and back a couple
 of times before it updates the format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The condition is just checking a cell value so nothing too complex.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas where to start. Note that I'm not able to reproduce the error in another file as yet, but I have cut the file down and removed all code and other sheets and it still won't update.</p>

            <p>Mike, I'm not able to reproduce it in a new file. I've copied the content to a new sheet and it is now working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had a couple of issues like this with Excel 2016 in the last few days. It seems a little flaky around conditional formatting which refers to other sheets. Also had data validation failing in the same situations. In every case so far, copying the content
 to a new sheet resolves it but that's not a viable solution for protected templates used across the business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping it will now continue to work reliably as the file now has to go to the board members and if it fails there, bad things will happen!</p>
<p>

<h2>            OneDrive&#47;SharePoint on Windows Desktop</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I would like to set up OneDrive or SharePoint on my desktop so that I can drag files from Windows Explorer onto the OneDrive or SharePoint icon and the files will automatically sync to the cloud. This is how Google, Amazon, and Dropbox works.</p>
<p>I have tried many approaches to this, but none have been successful. I can manually upload files to my Office 365 portal via the web interface. These files are located in my OneDrive.</p>
<p>I have tried using OneDrive for Business sync and this isn't successful since it launches SharePoint on my desktop and indicates an error.</p>
<p><br />
Isn't there an easy way to sync files with Microsoft applications?</p>

<p>My subscription: Office 365 Business Essentials</p>
<p>My Office version: Office 2010, SP2</p>
<p>My operating system: Windows 7 Professional</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>hi zeke46,</p>
<p>thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>please confirm the following.<br />
1. what do you install on your computer, onedrive or onedrive for business?<br />
for the difference between onedrive and onedrive for business, please refer to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-is-onedrive-for-business-187f90af-056f-47c0-9656-cc0ddca7fdc2#__how_does_skydrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

2. if you install onedrive for business, confirm where you download the client and if you download from
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2903984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2903984</a>.<br />
3. which account do you use to access the onedrive for business client, a microsoft account or an office 365 account?<br />
generally we should use a microsoft account to access onedrive and an office 365 account to access onedrive for business.<br />
for more detailed information, refer to <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa12059/what-is-a-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa12059/what-is-a-microsoft-account<br />
</a>4. sharepoint online services is related to onedrive for business not onedrive. if you are an office 365 for business subscriber, you should get the sharepoint online services and use onedrive for business. the onedrive icon you see in the screenshot is
 the onedrive for business library in your personal site. the files in the library are only owned by you before you share them with other people. you can use the onedrive for business client to sync them not onedrive . sharepoint online is composed of multiple
 site collections. you can create a library, list and so on in a site collection. sharepoint online has more features than the onedrive for business library. the onedrive for business library is only a library, but sharepoint online can meet different people’s
 requirements in different fields.<br />

<p>Thank you for the previous answer regarding a clean boot. I did a clean boot and left all services unchecked and restarted. I get the same result. Are you able to help me further? You asked about the log. Here is the log created in the failed install after
 the clean boot.</p>

<h2>            Open Outlook Properties doesn&#39;t show information about user.</h2>
                    
<p>hi people,</p>
<p>i have a problem with a user. she want see information about other users with the option open outlook properties. however she can't do it with every users.</p>
<p>the user have a outlook 2010. she see a dialog like this (images from internet, only illustrative):</p>
<p>when she type a email and she click a suggest. the email is: amadeus ryus &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b4399f2-6a44-4fb2-a3f6-0ac8bb94ea8c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b4399f2-6a44-4fb2-a3f6-0ac8bb94ea8c" /></a></p>

<p>but the user want see the next:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15191177-ce38-4ea8-b638-50bb1be9422c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15191177-ce38-4ea8-b638-50bb1be9422c" /></a></p>
<p>she only can see the checked users (check names). when on &lt;&lt;for:&gt;&gt; the name is full:&nbsp;amadeus ryus</p>
<p>i can't reproduce that in my outlook...</p>
<p>i found a workaround:<br />
-write the clean email : *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
-press check names<br />
-then use open outlook properties (right click to email address).</p>
<p>but the user don't want this workaround. is there a different way to do this?</p>
<p>best regards</p>

<p>hi ruben,</p>
<p>from your description, i know that the user wants to see the properties of a recipient shown like the following picture:<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=ba70c39e-7bf4-43dc-b7ac-255be9f69352" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dba70c39e-7bf4-43dc-b7ac-255be9f69352" /></a></p>
<p>given the situation, i’d like to confirm whether the user can see the desired image via clicking “address book” in outlook 2010. see the following picture:<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=7b5047a1-62f9-4c62-a1ee-62bcc432b212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d7b5047a1-62f9-4c62-a1ee-62bcc432b212" /></a></p>
<p>if not, try configuring the user account in your outlook and see the result. we might further investigate the issue if it is needed.</p>
<p>regards,<br />

<h2>            Cannot sync contacts with iphone or ipad from outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>I've seen similar postings and all of them seem to end with it being "escalated to support" where they "make and adjustment" to the account to resolve it so I don't this is something I can fix on my own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Synchronization between outlook.com and my iphone and ipad had been working without issue until a week or so ago.&nbsp; I notice that contacts were not syncing FROM outlook.com to either of my devices.&nbsp; Creating a test contact on the iphone results in the contact
 being synchronized TO outlook.com but contacts do not sync the other way.&nbsp; Email and Calendar are still syncing just fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have deleted all contacts from outlook and tried with just a single test contact but it still doesn't work.</p>
<p>I deleted the outlook.com account from my iphone and ipad devices and re-added them but that didn't resolve the issue.</p>
<p>I configured an alternate account on both devices and both were able to sync correctly with the alternate account.</p>

            <p>Hi Pauldoesntwantspam,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and I appreciate you for providing as much details as you can about the issue of contacts not syncing with your devices. To give you an overview, this usually happens due to a synchronization error between your account with
 the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have tried our initial troubleshooting steps, but it didn't work, then it's likely an issue within the account itself. Therefore, kindly provide the affected email address so we can proceed with the investigation.
<span>Please click on </span><span style="font-weight: bold">You have a private reply to this message</span><span> link just above your post wherein you can provide the additional information
 for privacy. Note that you need to be signed in to the Microsoft Community forum to view the link.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We are looking forward to your response.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I used to have all my contacts in my Outlook.com account and they show up in my Windows Phone, Nokia N8, and iPhone. Recently however, my contacts have not been syncing with my iPhone and N8. I tried reinstalling my Outlook account in my iPhone but no luck.
 My People contacts are simply refusing to sync with my iPhone and N8. Please rectify this Microsoft. I'm sure it's at your end since my email are still syncing just fine which means my credentials are still working out.</p>

            <p>Sorry for the delay, we have been ships in the night, and only today back in the office together - hence the need for the calendar to be working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He has a Nokia Lumina 1020</p>
<p>If he sets a calendar event via his phone, he gets an audible alarm.</p>
<p>BUT, if I set up the event via outlook he only gets it on-screen, no audible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He thinks his phone is configured, but I have no idea what you are talking about via outlook.&nbsp; (which prob means I am the one at fault)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When he drills into an event set by me, on his phone is shows "no reminder"&nbsp; even though I have set the reminders at 1 hour for all of his appointments.</p>

<h2>            query from a list box with multiple selections</h2>
                    I have a form that will populate the criteria for a query.&nbsp; The form has two fields to enter a start date and an end date.&nbsp; It also has checkboxes to choose active or inactive.&nbsp; The problem I have is a list of events that the user needs to be able to choose
 from.&nbsp; I want them to be able to select one or more that will then show in the results of the query as well as the dates and active/inactive.&nbsp; I honestly have no idea how to go about this.&nbsp; Could someone out there please offer some suggestions?&nbsp; Thank you

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            There are a number of ways you can do this.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; The simplest is not to open a query as a datasheet at all, but to open a form (which can be in datasheet view of course, though continuous forms view allows you to present the results in a consistent 'house-style).&nbsp; The form is unfiltered by default and
 filtered by means of the WhereCondition argument of the OpenForm method.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; The same can be done with a report.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; You can open a temporary query as a datasheet by building the SQL statement and passing this to the following function:<br />
<br />
Public Function OpenTempQuery(strSQL As String)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim qdf As DAO.QueryDef<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Static n As Integer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n = n + 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' delete temporary querydef object if exists<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Error Resume Next<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CurrentDb.QueryDefs.Delete "Temp" &amp; n<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Case Err.Number<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case 0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' no error<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case 3265<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' temporary querydef does not exist<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' ignore error<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' unknown error<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox Err.Number, vbExclamation, "Error"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' create temporary querydef object<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set qdf = CurrentDb.CreateQueryDef("Temp" &amp; n)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CurrentDb.QueryDefs("Temp" &amp; n).SQL = strSQL<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' open query and then delete temporary querydef object<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenQuery "Temp" &amp; n<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' delete temporary querydef object<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CurrentDb.QueryDefs.Delete "Temp" &amp; n<br />
<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; Create and save a query which references the controls on the form as parameters.&nbsp; You cannot reference a multi-select list box directly, however, as it has no value.&nbsp; You need to loop through its ItemsSelected collection in code, in a way similar to that
 below, and build a value list which you then assign to a hidden text box control on the form.&nbsp; This text box is referenced as the parameter, but for this the IN operator would normally be used in the query, and this does not accept a parameter as its argument,
 only a literal string.&nbsp; There are a couple of ways of simulating this at the following link though:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/100131/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/100131/en-us</a><br />
<br />
The second option at the link, using the InParam and GetToken functions is more reliable as it handles strings which might be substrings of another value correctly; these can give false results with the first method, using the InStr function, unless it is further
 modified.<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp; Create and save a query and then in the form's module build the complete SQL statement for the query and modify the querydef object's SQL property.<br />
<br />
I'll confine my detailed comments to 1 and 3 above, though in my view 1 (or 2 for a report) is by far the best solution.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; In addition to the existing controls on the form add a button to open the form (frmEvents) bound to the unrestricted query, using code like the following, for which I've assumed that the query includes columns EventID (number), EventDate (date/time) and
 Active (Boolean, i.e. yes/no), and the dialogue form includes a list box lstEvents, a check box chkActive and text boxes txtStartDate and txtEndDate:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim varItem As Variant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strEventIDList As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strCriteria As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim ctrl As Control<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set ctrl = Me.lstEvents<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' build criteria for Active and EventDate columns<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strCriteria&nbsp; = "Active = " &amp; Me.chkActive &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " And EventDate &gt;= #" &amp; Format(Me.txtStartDate,"yyyy-mm-dd") &amp; "#" &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " And EventDate &lt; #" &amp; Format(Me.txtEndDate,"yyyy-mm-dd") &amp; "# +1 And "<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' build value list for IN operator <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If ctrl.ItemsSelected.Count &gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each varItem In ctrl.ItemsSelected<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strEventIDList = strEventIDList &amp; "," &amp; ctrl.ItemData(varItem)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next varItem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' remove leading comma<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strEventIDList = Mid(strEventIDList, 2)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strCriteria = strCriteria &amp; "EventID In(" &amp; strEventIDList &amp; ")"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenForm "frmEvents", WhereCondition:=strCriteria<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "No events selected", vbInformation, "Warning"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
<br />
I've not included any validation code for the txtStartDate and txtEndDate controls, which would be advisable, firstly to be sure valid date values have been entered, and that they are not inconsistent, i.e. the end date doesn't precede the start date.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; This is essentially the same as above, but builds an SQL statement and passes it to the OpenTempQuery function.&nbsp; It assumes the query is based on a table Events:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim varItem As Variant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strEventIDList As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strCriteria As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim ctrl As Control<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strSQL As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set ctrl = Me.lstEvents<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' build criteria for Active and EventDate columns<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strCriteria&nbsp; = "Active = " &amp; me.chkActive &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " And EventDate &gt;= #" &amp; Format(Me.txtStartDate,"yyyy-mm-dd") &amp; "#" &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " And EventDate &lt; #" &amp; Format(Me.txtEndDate,"yyyy-mm-dd") &amp; "# +1 And "<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' build value list for IN operator <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If ctrl.ItemsSelected.Count &gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each varItem In ctrl.ItemsSelected<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strEventIDList = strEventIDList &amp; "," &amp; ctrl.ItemData(varItem)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next varItem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' remove leading comma<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strEventIDList = Mid(strEventIDList, 2)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strCriteria = strCriteria &amp; "EventID In(" &amp; strEventIDList &amp; ")"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' build SQL string and pass to function<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL = "SELECT * FROM Events WHERE " &amp; strCriteria&nbsp; &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " ORDER BY EventDate"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OpenTempQuery strSQL<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "No events selected", vbInformation, "Warning"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
<br />
One thing to note about the OpenTempQuery function is that it can open multiple datasheets simultaneously, so you could change the criteria in the form a number of times and click the button, in which case the datasheets for each set of criteria would remain
 open simultaneously.&nbsp; This is really what&nbsp; wrote the function for, as a cheap and cheerful way of entering several 'what if?' scenarios and then being able to compare the results in multiple datasheets.&nbsp; The same could be done with a form, but that would be
 a little trickier as it would require creating a Collection in code and assigning multiple instances of the form's class to the collection.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
In Start &gt; Programs, you should find the Internet sharing application. Start the application and make sure that USB is selected, then click connect. Attach the device to the USB cable. You should be able to connect to the internet on your computer.<br />
<br />
You also need to have Activesync (XP)&nbsp;or WMDC (Vista or Windows 7)&nbsp;installed on your computer.<br />
<br />
Linley.

    <title>I need more INPUT &#40;not MENU&#41; languages in my E90&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> galaxer---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            I need more INPUT &#40;not MENU&#41; languages in my E90&#33;</h2>
                    Though E90 Communicator is awesome in majority of functions, usability and comparatively perfect in production quality, it lacks some features that I as business-user definitely need.<br />
<br />
The most disappointing issue for me is the language issue. While the "normal" phones have 6 to 8 languages pro firmware/product code, the E90 has only 3!!! (Maybe 4 in APAC region but i do not care.)<br />
<br />
I'll try to explain shortly. As a businessman who lives in Germany and is a native Russian-speaker, I have a LOT of partners/clients/friends who do prefer to have a communication profile with me in Russian. I have almost the same amount of people with whom
 I need to communicate in German or French. The tragic truth is that I cannot approach this with the actual firmware situation on E90.<br />
<br />
If I would buy my Nokia E90 in Russia, I would get the predefined languages of English, Russian and Ukrainian. That is nice, but in this case I cannot write in German as it should be written, saying with Ö, Ä, Ü, ß and so on. I also could not use some of the
 French special characters. If I would use E90 only as a SMS machine, it might be OK. But I use it more likely as a travel PC replacement the device pretend to be, so I use e-mail and document editing, where the lack of those characters are intolerable.<br />
<br />
Besides all, I live in Germany and am a client of German service provider, so why should I probably buy the device outside of Germany? So think I and so I doing, saying I renewed my service contract and bought the E90.<br />
<br />
In German firmware I got another three (!!!) languages: German, English and Turkish. Wonderful. I may speak out about the pure discrimination from the Nokia side: in Germany we have the same amount of Russian speakers as Turkish fellow ones, both about 8,000,000
 persons each. ;-) So why Turkish and not Russian, Italian or French? Every of those "communities" has equal rights, am I right?! Hei, Nokia! Do you hear my voice?!<br />
<br />
Is it really so hard to understand, that an ULTIMATE BUSINESS SOLUTION as E90 definitely would be preferred by the people, who really use it - really intensive - as a communication device?! Is it really hard to understand, that thousands of them would get e-mails
 and documents while on the road that definitely need to be urgent answered some other language than 3 preinstalled?! Should I change the firmware of my phone every time I need to answer e-mail in French or edit the financial contract for my Russian partner?!<br />
<br />
Ridiculous and disappointing - what else should I say?! Especially because I know, that the situation as easy to fix from the Nokia side as a single mouse click.<br />
<br />
I am sure there are people reading and writing to this Forum who needs for example Chinese Mandarin and German, or Hindi and Farsi, or Arabic and Spanish simultaniously. There is no way to understand why it is impossible to choose the INPUT languages - I do
 NOT speak about the MENU languages and never pretend to.<br />
<br />
So, because this Forum is Nokia's piece of land and Nokia has kindly allowed us to cry out here what I do really appreciate, I want definitely get the answer to following questions:<br />
<br />
1) Is it possible to add some INPUT (once again - NOT menu, just INPUT) languages to E90 firmware?<br />
<br />
2) If yes, when?<br />
<br />
3) If not, what is the reason? The reason - please, no "technical excuses", because I am not that stupid, OK? ;-)<br />
<br />
We are living in such a damn globalized world, aren't we? So let's be really globalized and let's help us ourselves to get out the most from this.<br />
<br />
Thanks to all for listening.

            Buy a Russian E90 and use oe, ue, ae to write in German. You may not be aware that this is pretty common in business relationships. Look at me, I'm German and I'm using an English OS/keyboard laptop.<br />
<br />
You can't seriously ask Nokia to offer every language on this planet to choose from, do you? Russian isn't as important as English in international business. Another suggestion would be to use TWO E90, one Russian and one German with the SAME number. Or better:
 for serious business, use an ultraportable laptop like the Vaio TZ11, UX1, G11 or the FSC P7230. You can always add 3G through an external modem, the P7230 is available with built-in 3G, same applies to the new Flybook V5.

            I also forgot mentioning: you claim that 8 Million Russians and 8 Millions Turks are living in Germany is completely untrue. This would be 20% of the german population, you must be kidding. Here are the OFFICIAL numbers as to end of 2006: a total of 6,85
 Mio foreigners were living in Germany.<br />
Turks are in a percentage of 25,7% (aprox. 1,738 Mio), Russians are even below the number of Croats in Germany who make 3,4%. If you think that a lot of Russians have been immigrants who already got the german citizenship, another statistic (I took the year
 2005 because there were more Russians who got the german citizenship). I just wanted to point out the ratio between the number of Turks and Russians. Aprox. 32000 Turks got the german citizenship in 2005, only aprox. 5000 Russians.<br />
We also got a lot of people from Poland, Montenegro, Israel and the Ukraine (which isn't Russia anymore).<br />
<br />
Still: the ratio Turks-Russians in Germany is around 5:1 or so, so it is easily understandable why Nokia didn't choose Russian.<br />
<br />
If you're talking about those who got the german citizenship only, they're GERMANS now. So they (should) know how to speak German. Still...much more Turks, Croats, Bosniacs, Italians, etc. over here. I think Russians outside Russia/Ukraine/etc. think they're
 more important than they are, no offense meant. Just relax and don't blame Nokia for your little personal problems. Or did I request Suaheli from Nokia on my phone, just because I'm doing business with Africa? LOL*

            Since Windows 98 is absolutely not a problem to add ANY input language in ANY localized version of the OS. I do know that Symbian OS has at least the same flexibility options.<br />
<br />
Once again: I do not pretend to have any other MENU language - I simply do not need it. But the possibility to choose more INPUT language is simply and quickly to add, that is what I am asking for.<br />
<br />
Maybe your statistic research is right, I do not want to argue with you. More than that, this is exactly I expected as an excuse option: "Marginal request". But no, it is not. The device would probably have higher customer interest when the free input would
 be represented.<br />
<br />
Your advice to use laptop instead of E90 is highly appreciated, but it is not unique enough to be accepted "as is". ;-) The idea of E90 as well as previous communicators was to give the customer an option to leave her/his laptop at home and make a 1 or 2 day
 business trip as lite as possible in every meaning of the word "lite". I have 2 laptops already, 1 Panasonic for traveling and IBM Z61p Workstation as a desktop replacement. I should say that Panasonic, while being one of the best travel-oriented devices on
 the market, with its almost 2 Kilo travel weight and about 1 minute power-up/power-down time is completely insufficient as a communicator replacement. In addition to it you need a businesscard-scanner and a digicam, you are constantly out of power and so on.
 It is or will be the same story with UMPC. The only option until now was HTC/Qtek 9000, the most powerful and well-equipped device on the market. But it is completely useless as a phone and its camera is a disaster, so I switched to E90 because of its awesome
 usability as a phone, a digicam and as a communicator simultaneously just because I HATE to carry on 12 hours a day here and there a 5 Kilo bag with laptop, phone, camera, cables, batteries and other damned stuff around. I am just SICK and TIRED of this and
 I dreamed about the device that can make free from all that - for YEARS!!!<br />
<br />
I remember my conversation with Nokia people at its CeBIT Stand in late 1990-es - the concept was already here, but the materialization of my dreams took Nokia R&amp;D almost a decade. And now, when it is already in my hands, it lacks such a damn little thing to
 be as perfect as possible! ;-)<br />
<br />
I am not that crazy - "perfect" does not mean really perfect. Of course there are and there would be minor and major bugs with later fixes and improvements. Because of the possibility of fixes and improvements I insist on one of the most critical for me. I
 understand as well, that it needs neither additional research nor hardware changes. All you need to to do is a little software module to be added and/or replaced. The Occam Razor Rule is still in my mind. ;-)

            I am just simply asking is there any fix to overcome this problem. In this globalization era we do need more languages just than three cause they make big impact on business sometime people prfer to give contract to ppl who can speak their language and
 communicate.<br />

            Well, that´s an advantage of Windows Media 6 smartphones !!!!!<br />
<br />
I was playing with a Dopod 730 and that´s a real wordwide phone, you just set the country were you are and voila, you got the local language menu and input !!!!<br />
<br />
But as a phone I like more my E90, of course I agree with you and would like to have more languages available.

<h2>            Access Denies Changes to Database</h2>
                    <p>I have a database that wasn't designed by me. It has around 90 forms, 15 queries, 10 tables, and 10 reports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have copied it onto my desktop, from my works network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot save any changes made to some of the forms.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to export them to a new database it says: Name conflicts with existing module, project, or object library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to rename the form, it just changes it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, some of the forms work fine.&nbsp; And they are setup exactly the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            I'm starting to think the database has become corrupt.&nbsp; You might try creating a new blank database and importing everything into it.&nbsp; However, will I would bring all the Objects in together, I would try one form at a time.&nbsp; This way the&nbsp;problem form should
 show by erroring out when trying to import.

<h2>            Manage Full Access  - Office 365 Additional Mailboxes</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We have a hybrid Exchange 2010 / Office 365 E3 setup.&nbsp; Some users have full access to some mailboxes other than their primary.&nbsp; I want to revoke access to several of these, and I cant seem to get them to disappear under the users profile in Outlook 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The users in question have had their mailboxes moved to office 365.</p>
<p>I have used the following command to remove the "customer support" mailbox:-</p>
<p>Remove-MailboxPermission "customer support" -User "Jane Doe" -AccessRights FullAccess -InheritanceType All</p>
<p>get-mailboxpermision -identity "Jane Doe" shows the user has been removed...</p>
<p>But the mailboxes stay under her main mailbox in Outlook 2013</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Depending on how the mailbox is added in Outlook, it might not disappear automatically. Try to remove it from Account settings. If it's not listed there, obtain the Autodiscover.xml and check it's listed there as an "AdditionalMailbox" entry. If it is, you
 will probably have to rely on support to remove it server-sider. You can also try re-adding the permissions and removing them again to see it if makes a difference.</p>

            Set up a <a href="http://www.delicious.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Delicious account</a> for yourself, then Import your favorites into Delicious. Then install the MyMobileBookmarks application (found under the Social category) to your phone, input the Delicious name you set
 up for yourself into the software options and then you can access them from both your computer and your windows phone…You may actually prefer using Delicious &amp; this application to manage your bookmarks in the future, since you can add tags to your booksmarks
 in Delicious, rather than loading up the Bookmarks in IE.

<h2>            Can&#39;t create support tickets or view previous support tickets</h2>
                    <p>For the last several months, we have been unable to create support tickets on the portal or view previous support tickets. I was on the phone with Microsoft support about it this morning, and they suggested we post to the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had created a ticket this morning. When I went to view it, it wasn't there; there were no tickets at all showing up. I was able to get a call back by going into "classic view" and selecting the option to have someone to call me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The call-back request is now the only support request showing up. No global admin, not even the test admin created while on the phone with Microsoft, can see previous tickets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Good afternoon! Sorry to take so long to get back to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We started having a problem putting in tickets at least several months ago. I had tried to put in a ticket about something but couldn't. Since it wasn't urgent or even important (probably was going to ask why Planner didn't work then also), I let it go,
 thinking that it was a temporary glitch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I finally tried to use Planner again and it still didn't work, I tried to create a support ticket again. Once I did, I wanted to verify that it was there. It wasn't. That's when I did the call-back request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft technician I talked to had me create a new global admin as a test to see if another admin could view the tickets. The test admin and our other global admin could not see anything other than the ticket that was created when I did the call-back
 request (which I could see also). They did select the "all tickets" view, not just selecting their own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems the only way to get help now is to use the "please call me" option. In addition, all previous tickets are gone. The technician did not know what could be causing the problem; he said he works on Exchange. I told him it's probably a web programming
 issue and asked him to let the people who create the web site know, but he suggested I ask the forum.</p>
<p>

Let us call you</strong>, as shown in the screenshot in my initial reply.</p>

<p>Good morning! The tickets were created over a year ago, but I am not sure when. They were probably created using the old admin center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry, I didn't understand at first that "let us call you" is the only option available on the new admin center. I misunderstood what you said.

<p>Everytime I try to open up my Microsoft Word I get the following message:</p>
<p>"Your AutoCorrect file, (asian characters)MSO 1033.ad, could not be saved.&nbsp; The file may be read-only, or you may not have permission to modify the file."</p>
<p>Why do I get this message?&nbsp; What can be done to fix it?</p>
