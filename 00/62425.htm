<h2>            Surface Pro 4 - Crashes &#47; Freezes</h2>
                    <p>Hi All;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping someone can help me. I've had a surface pro 4 (i7) for about 2 weeks now, and when it works I love it. But I seem to be having an awful lot of problems with freezes and crashes on the machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My machine will freeze / crash multiple times in a day, depending on how often it goes to sleep / how active I'm on it. The problems generally seem to be with sleeping.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran a dump file reader and and I've seemed to find a common (though not exclusive) cuplrit:&nbsp;</p>

The crash took place in a standard Microsoft module. Your system configuration may be incorrect. Possibly this problem is caused by another driver on your system that cannot be identified at this time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Anyone have any suggestions? Anyone else seeing the same? I did some googling to try and though I see some people posting similar errors there doesn't seem to be any solution and it doesn't seem to be happening
 as often as it is for me.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply, I've installed the Surface Platform installer and even tried looking at the display drivers but they appear to be up to date. Will the Platform installer automatically look for updated drivers for everything or do I use it somehow to
 do that? I don't see an executable to run anywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So we'll see if that helps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thing that I noticed, and this may be some of my problems. It looks like at times when I think the tablet is "locked up" if I plug it into the dock it's not locked up at all. What's happening is the display on the tablet itself is becoming disabled.
 So when you try and turn on the device when it's not connected you have no screen so to the user it looks like it's locked up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I plug the machine into the dock I get my login form on one of the monitors. Going into "Display Settings" I see my two monitors but no third option. If I unplug and re-plug the tablet in then the main display comes back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>-Ed</p>

            <p>Hey Ed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am pretty much on the same boat as you are. Bought my surface pro i7 16GB 256 last week of Jan. Pretty much installed all the firmwares and updates whenever and whatever they are available. Again as you said when it works I really love it. Having said
 that most of the time it works. But yes I too encounter freezes/system hang like once in three days. No specific reason as well completely random. I reached out to MS support twice&nbsp;and they did reinstall all my drivers again. But this seems not to have fixed
 it. Seems like a generic problem going on here with pro 4 devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Didn't had a chance to take the dumps but will look into the event/system logs.</p>
<p>I really do not want to give away such a beautiful device because of freezes :(. Looking for help as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Abhi</p>

            <p>Hi Abhi;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found a workaround for some of the issues: Turn off sleep. It appears the surface has a problem with sleep (as opposed to Hibernate) which causes it not to wake up properly. If you set your machine to only hibernate it eliminates the crashing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And because these all have SSD drives and fast processors the time difference to "boot" in hibernate vs. sleep is negligible. Still annoying though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the other issues I raised I've found small workarounds for, though the resolution issue on multiple monitors is still the biggest (now that freezing has been avoided).&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks Ed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I too figured out the same the sleep is not doing good with these machines. I changed my power node to not do anything when I close the lid. Also boot time is so fast that shutting down and restarting is a piece of cake now. However even after doing
 that I encountered system freeze/hang couple&nbsp;of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reading over some more forums I realized the all the updates that we installed corrupt OS files. Having incorrect OS files also may lead to crashes/freezes.</p>
<p><strong>http://www.lovemysurface.net/issues-with-surface-tablet-try-fixes/</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Using scan mechanisms mentioned above system was never able to automatically repair my corrupt files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I did followed the below instructions to get</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>http://blog.jamesbayley.com/2015/12/19/how-to-fix-corrupt-windows-10/
</strong></span></p>
<p>It restored health of my OS and finally I got to a point where I have zero integrity violations. Scan passed through.</p>
<p>Was at a point to return my surface pro 4 but am happy to find this solution. As its been only a day I am not being too optimistic so will use heavily and wait for few more days to deduce anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps even more to resolve our issues.</p>

            Well Ed this hung for me again and had to do the restart :(. I saw the system health through sfc /SCANNOW and its 100%. So even after 100% of restored health it froze/hung on me. This is sad. I still have 13 days to go before my warranty expires on this.&nbsp;Keeping
 my fingers crossed&nbsp;to get a fix by then!

    <title>cannot turn off recent files in start - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> duavago  say:</h3>
<h2>            cannot turn off recent files in start</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to turn of the recent files in the Start menu (e.g. when writing the name of an app, the recently opened files appear; since this last win10 update, when you click the arrow on the right of the app's name).</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) So I turned off jump lists (in Start &gt; Settings &gt; Personalisation &gt; Start &gt; show recently opened items... &gt; OFF);</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) then I went to File Explorer &gt; View &gt; Options &gt; Folder Options &gt; General &gt; and turned off "Show recently used files...", "Show frequently used folders...", and cleared the File Explorer history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then recent files in Start seemed to be gone, BUT as soon as I opened a couple of files (in this case with VLC and MS-Officce apps) the recent files list was back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple extra notes:</p>
<p>a) Right clicking a recent file's name in Start and then "Remove from this list" removes all but one file (whatever file was the last to be "removed"), and in that last file the only thing that gets removed are the other options that appear when you right
 click; the last item remains there until opening another file (then, the un-removable file gets removed and replaced by this last file). Repeating the steps above does not remove these from the recent list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b) Disabling the App's history (e.g. vlc) changes nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>c) the files in \Users\xxxxxxxxxx\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Office\Recent are not the same that appear in Start menu some_App's recent files (only those opened since steps 1) and 2) show up).</p>
<p>
</p><p>d) \Users\xxxxxxxxxxx\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent Items gets populated with folders and files after steps 1) and 2) are performed; manually deleting the entries does not remove then from Start menu recent files in some_App.</p>

<p>So... after some more fiddling I seem to have found a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Group Policy Editor (Win+R, "gpedit.msc") &gt; User Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Start Menu and Taskbar, I enabled "Do not keep history of recently opened documents" and "Remove Recent Items menu from Start Menu".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;<span>\Users\xxxxxxxxxxx\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent_Items still gets populated with recent items, but only momentarily.</span></p>
<p><span>A few last items were resilient, but rebooting the system got rid of them.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Shouldn't this process be a lot easier?</p>

    <title>Why ALWAYS-ONLINE DRM is BAD. Why we hate it&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edragonxx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why ALWAYS-ONLINE DRM is BAD. Why we hate it&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Last 5 days has been hard for Xbox One players. Specially for them who like to buy digital games and likes to play with friends or use apps from cloud system. Because something went really bad, and we are not able to play our games or use upload studio app
 or other apps. And this is VERY GOOD EXAMPLE why always online DRM's are very very bad, why players hate these systems. Because if you force us be online all the time, and then something happens with internet connection, does not matter is it your side or
 Microsoft side, same effect - we can not use our console!<br />
<br />
THIS IS THE MAIN REASON WHY WE HATE IT, WHY ALWAYS ONLINE SYSTEM IS BAD!!! Thank you Microsoft that you made good example to these too who 2 years ago was supported you with always-online DRM! I hope everyone understands now clearly why these DRM's is a really
 really bad idea?!<br />
<br />
And this is the reason why you should buy your games on physical discs, not digital versions. First physical media is always 20% cheaper (after 6 months even more than 50% cheaper) than digital versions from Xbox Store. And when Xbox live is down, you are able
 to play your games on physical discs. But you can not play your digital games.<br />
<br />
Thank You again Microsoft that you made so good example for us all why we should not buy digital games, and why we always need to be against always online and other stupid DRMs! Thank You!</p>

<p>When Microsoft talked about always online DRM the fineprint read that always online required a single login every 48 hours since issues usually never last longer than 4 hours it wasn't that bad to be honest. But this was dropped before release.</p>
<p>As for playing games offline you can do so if you go to your network settings and select "Go offline" there are a few limitations and some games won't work, more info on that in the link below</p>

<p>But I agree with you that physical is cheaper (most of the times) and personally I prefer a physical copy</p>

    <title>Why is my Bioshock 2 Game missing some sounds&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cyber_shadow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is my Bioshock 2 Game missing some sounds&#63;</h2>
                    Hello again! I previously got a problem of mine regarding my game Bioshock 2 here and I am grateful but it would seem that I have run into a small performance issue. As previously&nbsp; stated in my last question I have been able to play and beat the game Bioshock
 2 with no seen problems on my part. For some reason now though after downloading the most recent patch (via the message from in game client), I've noticed that either some of the games sounds are missing or just are not playing. Mostly I've noticed that when
 the flying bots shoot their gun I can only hear the sounds of it SOMETIMES when I stand really close to them. I've also noticed that when I got the telekinesis power-up and you get to the first part where you get to throw the gas tanks or whatever they are
 at the bad guys below, I've noticed that as funny as it may sound but when I threw the "bombs" there was no explosion noise. But I suppose my mine problem is really not being able to hear if my guard bots are shooting at something. Is there a fix for this?
 Does anyone else have this problem? <br />

<h2>            Win 8 &#40;Pro&#41;&#58; How to enable the Acer LED Screen eDisplay Managemt software&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just upgrade from Win 7 to Win 8 (Pro).</p>
<p>I am using an Acer LED Screen that come with a software called Acer eDisplay Management.</p>
<p>This software when operating under Win XP (Pro) it allows to user to reset the screen with ease.</p>
<p>However, under both Win 7 and Win 8, I notice that this software is disabled. The user need to use Display Adjustment at the Control&nbsp;Panel to make only two settings, i.e. Gamma Level and Color saturation. Other adjustment such as contrast, focus, clock etc
 had to be made using the screen button. This is&nbsp;task is more tedious. </p>
<p>May I know if there&nbsp;is a way to enable the software?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Checkpoint system question</h2>
                    
<p>Does anyone know&nbsp;if it will have checkpoint AND save anywhere systems or ONLY checkpoint? I hope they didn't do away with save anywhere, I hate checkpoint systems. Worst thing if you reach one with little health or armor. I remember in F.E.A.R. 2s' sled
 fight...they had a checkpoint right in the middle of the fight (worst placement for a checkpoint EVER! Middle of a fight? Really?) and I reached it with VERY little health and no pickups left either. I had to do the last brutal part of the fight perfectly
 to survive it, took me MANY tries from the checkpoint save. Thing with F.E.A.R. series was that you could only go back to&nbsp;the last checkpoint reached, thus I was hosed. I eventually got past it but it was frustrating. I could see something like this finishing
 a game if you can't get past it. If there is no save anywhere system, I hope they at least let you select from the last several checkpoints instead of only the last one reached.</p>

<p>It's 2012 already! It shouldn't be so hard to save games yourself. I also hate check-point systems in games. Sometimes in a whim I like to play something else, "did the game save? what if it didn't? maybe I'm close to another check point?" ARGH! Frustrating!</p>

<p>I agree. &nbsp;I have been burned really bad by the checkpoint save system in games. Got burnt the worst on COD2 on the D day level on veteran. Spent 5 hours battling through that level up to the mortars. Then it autosaved the very second before a mortar landed
 on me. &nbsp;So I guess we will see. </p>

<p>Yeah, I feel that pain CAM! That's what made the F.E.A.R. 2 sled fight so brutal for me. I had something like 6 or 7 health left, no more health packs laying around, and the guy in front of me pretty much took his shot JUST before I reached the checkpoint
 but it didn't hit until immediately after. Must have reached the checkpoint in that split second between his firing and the bullet hitting me. The sled is in motion, you don't advance on your own to the checkpoint at that part of the game, the moving sled
 reaches it over the course of time once the sled is set in motion. So...load up/BAM I'm dead/f***. Load up/BAM I'm dead/f***. Over and over. I tried everything, shooting immediately, dodging left, right, straight ahead, backward, diagonally, jumping and ducking
 and he got me almost EVERY time. And if I got past him, I still had 2 or 3 minutes of hard fighting before the end of the sequence (with, remember, 6 or 7 health) and the next checkpoint, so often I would get past the initial guy only to be taken out by someone
 after him. Of course, that would mean loading up at that guy already in the act of shooting me. load up/BAM I'm dead/f***. Load up/BAM I'm dead/f***. God, I still think about that and get mad sometimes.</p>

<p>OK, the answer is that we get BOTH save systems &nbsp;:-) &nbsp;The bad news is that you cannot turn off the auto saving, thus you will get pauses every now and then while it saves., It's not so bad though, I'll gladly take that inconvenience as long as I can save
 anywhere. Life is good.</p>

    <title>Recruitment&#58; Team Forerunner - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spartan i043  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recruitment&#58; Team Forerunner</h2>
                    
<p>We are the founders of the Halo rings. We destroyed the flood and restored humanity. We lived and thrived before anyone. We are the earliest Halo players. We are Team Forerunner.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey! Spartan I043 here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning sound cool? Keep reading! I am&nbsp;currently in the process of recruiting for my clan Team Forerunner in Halo.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, I will be gone for a week, so contact one of the co-leaders if you wish to join. The names are listed below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We play&nbsp;every Halo that was ever&nbsp;made:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Halo: Combat Evolved (PC)</p>
<p>2. Halo 2 (PC)</p>
<p>3. Halo 3</p>
<p>4. Halo 3: ODST</p>
<p>5. Halo Reach</p>
<p>6. Halo Wars</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will also&nbsp;expand to the upcoming Halo:&nbsp;CE Remake and Halo 4.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ABOUT TEAM FORERUNNER:<br />
Team Forerunner is a clan where winning and losing don't count, where skill doesn't matter, where cussing hardly exists, and where fun is always in the game. If you cuss up storms, only care about winning, and are unsporting don't bother reading on or sending
 us friend requests. We DON'T want players that cuss up storms and we DON'T want players that are unsporting and only want to win. We want players that want to have fun, we want players that are good sports and we'd prefer players that don't cuss (we don't
 mind if a you can't help throw a cuss word in every now and then). We currently have about 70 awesome, official players in Team Forerunner! Team Forerunner only cares about having fun and if we win great. . . if we lose, oh well we have our chins held high
 ready to move on either way. We are very strict on players who only want to win, who are unsporting, and who cuss up storms (We banned two members because they were both cussing up a storm and one of them only wanted to win and was unsporting). Most of Team
 Forerunner's members rarely ever cuss (which is really nice) and we try to help each other rank up, complete challenges and become better players. Both guys and gals are welcome to join our clan. KillJoyseries89 made&nbsp;our websit &nbsp;where you can view more of
 Team Forerunner's information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TEAM FORERUNNER RULES:<br />
1. Player must respect the leaders/co-leaders: Spartan I043, Iron Hawk II, Jakeylakes, Reydaitso, fishiesDONTswim,&nbsp;crazed so, and&nbsp;junglecatz81&nbsp;(So far only two members have disrespected us and I don't want it to happen again)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Player must be a good sport whether it's win or loss. (In other words, have fun whether you win or lose)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Player must have a mic and must communicate to the team. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Player must be willing to participate in ALL Halo Reach game modes. (Slayer, Capture the Flag, Headhunter, Invasion etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Player must change their emblems to Team Forerunner's official emblem (No armor or gamertag changes are required, however if you join our clan, I ask that you put "Team Forerunner" into either your motto or bio so that way when our new members look at
 my friend's list, they will know who is in our clan and who isn't)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I allow ALL ranks to join so I will allow you to join whether you are a Recruit, Inheritor or anything in between. Currently our highest ranked officer is a Field Marshall and our current lowest ranked officer is a Warrant Officer (again these are official
 Team Forerunner members). And we have many ranks in between, so you should be able to fit right in!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TEAM FORERUNNER INFO:<br />
Players can also list a specific preference in which class they will be assigned. (All-Around, Heavy, Long Range, Close-Quarter, Vehicle Operator, etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An Octagon backround with the Champion Star in the middle is the Team Forerunner emblem. The Colors are Steel (Backround Color), Silver (Primary Emblem Color), and White (Secondary Emblem Color). I no longer require the service tag to be changed, because
 it is hard to recognize teammates with the same service tags.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As said above I am trying to make Team Forerunner as fun as I possible can, and if there are any recommendations let me know. We also try to have clan battles every weekend, so if your clan wants to battle ours, feel free to contact our Clan Battle Organizer
 Jakeylakes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TEAM FORERUNNER CONTACTS:<br />
You are more than welcome to contact any of the leaders/co-leaders listed above, but for the most part you will want to send me messages. You can contact me multiple ways:<br />
1. Xbox Live Gamertag: Spartan I043 <br />
2. Right here in the forum<br />
3. Send me a private message</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TEAM FORERUNNER MEMBER NEWS:<br />
We now have our very own clan meeting room! We hold meetings&nbsp;every other&nbsp;Saturday. You can come to these meetings and find out more about us if you wish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, When you join Team Forerunner, don't only send me a friend request, but also send Iron Hawk II (Team Forerunner Leader), Jakeylakes (Team Forerunner Co-Leader and Clan Battle Organizer), Reydaitso (Team Forerunner Co-Leader and Secretary of Treasure),
 fishiesDONTswim (Team Forerunner Co-Leader)&nbsp;crazed so&nbsp;(Team Forerunner Co-Leader), and junglecatz81 (Team Forerunner Co-Leader)&nbsp;one. This way they will know you are wanting to join or have already joined. You can try to contact one of them if I'm not online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Iron Hawk II writes:<br />
"Hey guys, I am proud to be a Team Forerunner leader. I hope you have the best experience possible playing Reach in our clan.
<br />
This clan was built by Spartain I043 and myself and we want other Reach players to play to win, but also be good sports about losing because we will most likely not win every match. This has been a great experience for me. I hope to see you on the battlefield
 soldier. Iron Hawk II, signing out.<br />
PS: I appreciate my fellow clan members to be my friends and also if it isn't too much to ask, I would like a good rep. Oh! And one more thing I would appreciate as little language (cussing/swearing) as possible."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jakeylakes also writes:<br />
"Hey guys i'm Jakeylakes one of the members of Team Forerunner. I would just like to give you a heads up display of how great this clan is and I highly recomend that you join. Team Forerunner plays for fun, Team Forerunner accepts anyone who's willing to join.
 These past few weeks have been awsome, I have played so much now and my ranks are soaring through the roof because I can actually play Reach and enjoy. Team Forerunner has lots of members and there all fun to talk to. If you consider becomeing an honarable
 member of Team Forerunner all you need is a mic, contact Spartan I043( our team leader- also give Iron Hawk II respect aswell) or alteranativly you can contact me and i'll talk with Spartan I043. Many Thanks Jakeylakes Team Forerunner"
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ArmorLock4Noobs also writes:<br />
"I'm a new member myself, this is a great clan to join. Team Forerunner may put fun first, but don't let that fool you into believing we are not a serious clan. I have been in 4 clans spanning the past 7 years on XBOX Live and I am impressed with the level
 of professionalism on Team Forerunner. "</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other quotes by my members:<br />
1. "Team Forerunner is a VERY fun clan!" -Capt Dewy/ispartan365 <br />
2. "Team Forerunner puts the Team in Teamwork!" -Crazed So<br />
3. "I never plan to leave Team Forerunner!" -Untaimed Spirit<br />
4. "Finally a clan where winning doesn't matter!" -burningclod<br />
5. "Team Forerunner's guys are GOOD!" -SILENTxkiller</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONCLUSION:<br />
Believe it or not this is our (Iron Hawk II and me) first time running a clan as well as being in a clan. We must be doing a good job or our clan members wouldn't be saying these things. Personally we love to have fun, but we can get very serious (especially
 when it comes to recruiting and cussing players with unsporting attitudes). If you want proof that these guys have fun in Team Forerunner just send them a message and ask. They will tell you how much fun they have. We guarentee you'd have fun as well. If you
 want to join, but may be nervous if you were to want to quit and not disappoint me, don't worry about it. We don't force anyone to stay, nor do I force anyone to leave. It is completely up to you. We ask that you really think about joining. We have so much
 fun as a group and we want to share our fun with YOU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Team Forerunner is a clan where you want to find friends, play with mature yet fun guys that rarely cuss, have VERY GOOD sportsmanship, and have the teamwork spirit, then Team Forerunner is the clan for you, because Team Forerunner wants you to have a
 Halo Reach experience that you will NEVER forget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Questions and comments needed answered quickly about Team Forerunner should be sent to Spartan I043, Jakeylakes, Reydaitso, fishiesDONTswim,&nbsp;crazed so and/or junglecatz81. Iron Hawk II is online when possible (not frequently) so only send him messages if
 necessary. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On behalf of Team Forerunner we hope that you join (quickly).</p>

<h2>            Controller Player indicator&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Back in the old day's there was a Input Port 1 and Input port 2 for Player 1 and Player 2. Is there a indicator to know which controller is player 1 or player2 player3 etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ps3 controller has led lights and can also switch controller player port in the Controller system menu. was wondering if Xbox One had something like that?</p>

<p>With Xbox One, there is no 'player 1' or 'player 2' until you start a game and designate each player into a slot. On the home screen, anyone can take control through Kinect's recognition abilities and be the 'dominant' profile, even if controllers are swapped.
 As such, the controllers don't indicate those player slots because the controllers can be changed at any time.</p>

<h2>            lost access to all settings and admin rights</h2>
                    I am running windows 10 and my computer recently started becoming lazy, it would take ages to restart or shut down. Recently i lost access to all settings and admin rights. Nothing seems to work so far, windows explorer keeps hanging and restarting when
 i right click any file. More so, the recycle bin cant empty and when trying to install setups i get an error message that windows cannot find the file with that path and i should type the name correctly. Installed soft-wares work properly though the new windows
 10 apps have disappeared completely. Anyone with knowledge about such please help.

Are other applets working properly?&nbsp;I would suggest you to run a SFC scan and check if it helps. One the search bar type sfc&gt;Right Click to run as Admin&gt; type SFC /Scannow&gt;Enter</p>

            <p>After the upgrade I have seen the Windows update applet on the control panel. But some times later, I don't know exactly how the windows applet has disappeared.</p>
<p>I am not sure if there was any corruption during the upgrade to have any issues to get this removed.</p>
<p>Other applets are working fine as of now. But is that Windows update applet removed by Microsoft itself to utilize Update from one point i.e. PC settings?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Lenovo PC Mouse and Keyboard Lagging - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johneng0591  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Lenovo PC Mouse and Keyboard Lagging</h2>
                    Hello! &nbsp;I have a Lenovo Thinkpad that was purchased in November 2015. &nbsp;I previously had an issue where it was not installing updates, so I reinstalled Windows 10 and that fixed that problem. &nbsp;Everything was working great on the laptop until last week when
 the mouse and keyboard began lagging. &nbsp;When explorer is open and is selected, the lag goes away, but when no windows are open and it is only on the desktop, the lag is bad enough that I am unable to select icons to open programs. &nbsp;Also, when typing in word,
 I am having the same lag issue. &nbsp;When I pull up performance, I can see that a lot of memory is being used; however, it is from default Windows programs. &nbsp;Also, the CPU seems to be running high. &nbsp;I have done a virus scan and malware scan and have not had any
 luck. &nbsp;Please help! &nbsp;I really need this to work on school and for work. &nbsp;Thank you!

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a similar issue with my Lenovo Ideapad after upgrading from windows 8.1 to 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had an issue where the track pad would be gittery and slow when the default OEM realtech audio drivers were installed. This was not an issue in Windows 8.1 before the upgrade. I un-installed these drivers and let Windows 10 use it own. The problem went
 away after this. I happen to see this solution in the forums so that is why i tried it. Good luck.</p>

<p>Hi Kinezier,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us in the forums with this question. If you haven't already done so, I would recommend checking out our&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/game-titles/minecraft-windows-10-edition-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Minecraft:
 Windows 10 Edition FAQ page</a>&nbsp; to see if there may be any further troubleshooting to attempt regarding your audio issue in-game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may also be worthwhile in checking out the Minecraft forums to either see if anyone else has a solution or to post a question there yourself, as the friendly folks on that particular site have far more knowledge regarding in-game settings.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.minecraftforum.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Minecraft
 forums</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Give the troubleshooting a try and let us know the results.</p>
<p>I hope that this helps out.</p>

<h2>            How do I adjust Windows ClearType to render in grayscale&#63;</h2>
                    How do I adjust Windows ClearType to render fonts in grayscale?<br />
<br />
I have the need to produce presentations in Windows that will look good on any monitor/projector.&nbsp; I thus need to adjust Windows ClearType to render in grayscale (as opposed to RGB or BGR).&nbsp; This will also help in cases where LCD displays are rotated by 90°.<br />
<br />
I can set ClearType to render properly for my laptop's monitor, but when I connect to a wireless projector, or a VGA adapter, then the settings don't always display correctly on the attached device.&nbsp; I don't want to setup on a new device every time; I just
 want to change Windows ClearType to render in grayscale (like it was in Windows XP).<br />
