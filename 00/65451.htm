<h2>            Update Error 8024402</h2>
                    As of the last four or five days I've been getting a flag saying cannot install updates. Error&nbsp;8024402F. Nothing&nbsp;I've&nbsp;tried will fix it so far. The windows Update screen tells me there have never been any updates to my computer which is clearly nonsense
 as this is a three year old Toshiba Tecra with OEM Windows 7&nbsp;Professional.
<div>I've tried installing Explorer 9 as on some blog it was highlighted as a missing Active X component that needed MS Explorer but neither that or any of the other fix it sub routines seem to have any effect. Help gratefully&nbsp;received!</div>

                    <p>MS Streets and trips has been working under Win 10 until the Anniversary update. Now the system crashes when the USB cable for the Pharos GPS-500&nbsp;is plunged in, with BSOD msg "KERNEL SECURITY CHECK FAILURE"</p>

<span>
<div><span><strong>How To Find Drivers:</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong>Do not use device manager it may tell you the device is up to date but will not tell you if it is corrupt&nbsp;</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>
<div><strong>Search</strong> Google for the name of the driver, or go to the computer makers site.</div>
<div><span><br />
<strong>Compare</strong> the Google results with what's installed on your system to figure out which device/program it belongs to<br />
<strong>Visit</strong> the web site of the manufacturer of the hardware/program to get the latest drivers (DON'T use Windows Update or the Update driver function of Device Manager).<br />
If there are difficulties in locating them, post back with questions and someone will try and help you locate the appropriate program<br />
<br />
The most common drivers are listed on these pages:&nbsp;<br />

            I too had the latest driver that is available.&nbsp; Plugging the GPS puck in started causing the BSOD after the update to Windows 10 Anniversary Edition.&nbsp; I've searched everything and found no solution.&nbsp; I finally reverted back to the previous version of WIndows
 10.&nbsp; Works again now.<br />

<h2>            skype notification sounds not playing</h2>
                    <p>i have made sure that all notifications are turned on and up to full volume, check all settings for skype. When a call comes through there is no sounds and we miss the call. When we make a call the sounds all come through the speaker so they work properly.
 Still can hear during call. I have ios 11 and newest version of skype. Running out of ideas.

<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 has various editions, Home being one of them. There is no plain vanilla Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />You can look into below to see various editions

            Hi Daniel.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you're referring to how it is listed in the Media Creation Tool, that is because it includes both Home and Pro in the same installer, and will either offer you the choice of your licensed version, or detect it on it's own.    If you have a Windows 8/8.1 embedded Product Key it will also force that version for which you were licensed in Windows 8 (usually Home) but I can help you change it to Pro if you have another license to use for that.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Daniel
<br />
<br />Windows 10 comes in a few different Editions - Home - Home Single Language - Pro . . .etc.
<br />
<br />On the Media Creation tool, you may be offered just Windows 10, if that is the case, then on the next Window you should be offered to install either the Pro or Home Edition
<br />
<br />If you want to install a specific edition of WIndows and you are not offered that option, you can force the Installation media to give you that option
<br />
<br />After you create the installation media on a USB flash Drive
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop, choose New - Text Document 
<br />
<br />Paste the text below into that document 
<br />
<br />[EditionID] 
<br />Core 
<br />[Channel] 
<br />Retail
<br />
<br />Then choose File - Save Aa, at the bottom of the Save As dialog, change file type to 'All Files' then save that file as ei.cfg (note you must manually add the cfg file extension) 
<br />
<br />Then copy that ei.cfg file into the Sources folder in your USB Installation Media 
<br />
<br />Then when you begin the Installation, you should be asked which Edition you want to install . . .

<h2>            Call Of Duty&#58; Black Ops Map Pack issues-suggested fix</h2>
                    
<p>I recently had problems after downloading all the map packs for COD black ops. at first we thought it was a problem with the download but that wasnt the case. If u are having the same troubles and do not have any corrupted files on ur hard drive, try getting
 your game disc re-surfaced. most game stores do this for a very low price. I had it done and have not had any issues since.</p>

<p>This is because despite the maps being a download, the key game data comes from the disc.&nbsp; If the disc is scratched or damaged your downloaded maps won't work either.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is no way of tracking it, however if you believe that your gamertag maybe being used that was on that console you can delete it via xbox.com or contact Xbox Support via phone or through the web chat.

<p>Unfortunately you cannot track it yourself, because of IP address relays ect... you lack the tools.</p>
<p>But the police can.</p>
<p>if you have registered your xbox that was stolen then you can ask Microsoft to console ban it assuming that your serial number is listed on the registry.</p>
<p>so you will probably need the original account information, gamertag, email, you know hard proof it is yours, and maybe police report to send in to xbox.</p>
<p>Microsoft should be able to track it as well, because game stops have to check the consoles they get to make sure consoles are not marked as modded or banned.</p>
<p>so your serial number should pop up as well, who knows, maybe instead of console ban being listed when checked it would say stolen call police lol, that would be a hoot.</p>

<p>when im signed in with my actual gamertag 'wnuk100proof' i get a Runtime Error if i try to view a forum, forum post or some of the advertisements/news items on the xbox.com home page. this has been happening for over a year now. i had to create this silver
 account so i could post this thread. i searched the forums a while ago and found a thread with other people who were having the same problem and they said to change your live id to a new one but that didnt help. this only happens when im signed in with my
 real account and happens regardless of the browser or computer im using. i posted the error below.</p>

 were these on the same network, or at entirely different locations? Let me know, thanks!

<p>i knew this was going to happen. i thought i made it pretty clear that its NOT a problem with my computer or browser. i have 3 computers and 2 separate cable modems/networks in my house. 1 computer is hooked up directly to 1 of the cable modems without a
 router and the other 2 computers are connected to the other cable modem with a router. plus ive tried logging in at friends houses and my account doesnt work on ANY of them. i have the same problem regardless of the browser IE, firefox or chrome.</p>
<p>i fail to see how either of these replies have anything to do with my problem. for the past year ive ONLY had this problem when im logged in with my ACTUAL GAMERTAG but if i log out or use any other gamertag i have no issues. are you saying my network is
 causing just my real account to not work? or that im having the same exact problem with temp files/cookies on multiple broswers on multiple computers? im sure you have to ask but im not an idiot and its not a temp file issue. this is the reason i waited a
 year to post this and was just hoping at some point ms would resolve the problem.</p>

            I would recommend trying to manually update the driver.
<br />You will need to get the driver from the AMD site.

            First of all, Check for BIOS updates.
<br />Completely remove everything using DDU and install the newest copy of the driver available.

<br />You can head to the manufacturer of your device to get the newest driver.

<h2>            Can&#39;t create new folders when clicking on shortcuts under &#34;This PC&#34;</h2>
                    I added two shortcuts to the "This PC" category in the Explorer sidebar (at least I think it is "This PC", it says my computer's name there.)&nbsp; When I click these links, I am unable to create a new folder, either by UI button, or keyboard shortcut.&nbsp; If
 I navigate to the same folders from C:\, I can create folders fine.&nbsp; If I click the usual Windows shortcuts (Music, Pictures, etc.) I can also create folders fine.&nbsp; This is really annoying.&nbsp; Is there any way to fix this?<br />

            <p>Simply not true.&nbsp; As it says in the wiki ONLY builds below 10049 need an ISO and those builds have expired.&nbsp; ALSO you can make your own ISO for any build by using the ESD file that was downloaded when you upgraded to the current build</p>

<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Updates &amp; Security  - Windows Security
<br />
<br />Then go to Virus &amp; threat protection - Virus &amp; threat protection settings

    <title>XBOX One Chat Adapter &#38;amp&#59; Turtle Beach Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> test f0r ech0  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBOX One Chat Adapter &#38;amp&#59; Turtle Beach Issue</h2>
                    
<p>I have the Turtle Beach X41 headset from my 360 days. &nbsp;They run off the optical out port. &nbsp;I have been concerned because they will be sending game audio to the headset as well as the new controller/adapter sending audio. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I got the adapter today and updated the controller. &nbsp;The TBs are running off of the optical out port, which is set to Bitstream, and the Bitstream is set to DD 5.1. &nbsp;The audio is excellent when not using the adapter. &nbsp;As expected, both audios are present
 once the adapter is plugged into the controller and I plug the headset into the adapter. &nbsp;If I turn down the TB audio, then I am just hearing the stereo audio coming through the controller / adapter (kind of defeats the purpose). &nbsp;If I turn the mix to 100%
 chat and 0% game audio on the adapter, and then turn up the TB audio on the headset, my friends get an echo from their chat. &nbsp;Anybody else having this type of issue with 3rd party headset?</p>

<p>I have no idea how you are set up, but you should not be getting any game audio from the CHAT adapter. Sorry I can't be more help, but all I can say is something is wrong with your setup because game audio is not supposed to come through the controller at
 all. I bought a chat adapter that was a modified version of the standard headset (off eBay) for my X41s and I get only chat through the controller and only game audio through the optical.</p>

<p>Actually the chat adapter that they are selling as of today does send both game audio and chat audio. &nbsp;There are even two buttons on the adapter itself that you can use to adjust the game audio vs chat audio percentage. &nbsp;The new Polk headset and the two
 new Turtle Beach X1 headsets get all game and chat audio through the new stereo headset adapter that was released today.</p>
<p>I imagine that your modified version of the adapter is actually a much better solution for 3rd party headset users, because it was modified off of the chat microphone and adapter that came with the X1. &nbsp;It was designed to just deliver chat audio back and
 forth.</p>
<p>Now that Microsoft has gone down the road of both game and chat audio coming through the controller and adapter, it has changed the playing field. &nbsp;It is great if you use a headset that doesn't have any other audio signal coming to your headset.</p>
<p>Also, I did look through the link above. &nbsp;It is where I got the idea to turn game audio to 0% and chat audio to 100% coming through the adapter. &nbsp;Thanks for the idea though.</p>

<p>So when I use these with my astro a50's I should turn the game volume all the way down and chat volume up. I may just end up modding my original adapter.</p>

<p>Yep. &nbsp;If you use the MS stereo adapter, you'll need to two the chat button (person image on it) until it beeps to set game/chat balance all the way to chat only. The volume up/down buttons simply increase/decrease the combined volumes, keeping the balance
 constant. My buddy and I took a bit getting rid of echoing in his Tangos last night, before we figured out how this works. We have only been able to minimize (not eliminate) the chat static issue by moving the mic around, but it still gets staticky with loud
 voices.</p>

<p>The chat adapter pulls game audio and chat to the headphons. I'm using a pair of Bose headphones with an inline mic. Works a charm with headset adapter. No wire to console. Its wireless. Just plug the 4pole 3.5mm plug into adapter, and I get game audio and
 chat. If you dont believe me, do some research. </p>

    <title>After upgrade, Windows 10 computer will not accept Remote Desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> synthdang  say:</h3>
<h2>            After upgrade, Windows 10 computer will not accept Remote Desktop connection</h2>
                    <p>My desktop computer ran Windows 7 Ultimate, and I used my laptop and Remote Desktop to connect to my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After upgrading to Windows 10, my desktop computer is no longer accepting Remote Desktop connections.&nbsp; I've researched everything and can't explain why.&nbsp; Here are some details:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Windows 10 is set to "Allow remote connections to this computer."&nbsp; I am not requiring NLA.</p>
<p>* My network is set to Private</p>
<p>* Remote Desktop is allowed through Windows Firewall for Private network connections.</p>
<p>* I ran netstat and I can see that port 3389 is open and listening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;netstat /p tcp /a | findstr 3389<br />
&nbsp; TCP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.0.0.0:3389&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gateway:0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LISTENING</p>
<p>* I've tried connecting via local IP address (192.168.0.100), the computer's name (Gateway), and via the Internet IP address, which is forwarded to my desktop computer on my router.&nbsp; All used to work, none are working.</p>
<p>* I've tried connecting from two different computers (Windows 10 and Windows 7) and via my Android phone, no connections go through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to connect via my Windows 10 laptop, I immediately receive the message, "This computer can't connect to the remote computer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would certainly appreciate some help with this.&nbsp; Everything worked properly (for years!) until I upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; Absolutely everything else is working great in Windows 10, except for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Dan</p>

    <title>More folders in Users than users on the system&#33; Safe to delete - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mandseason  say:</h3>
<h2>            More folders in Users than users on the system&#33; Safe to delete some&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This question is in two parts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. </strong>I have three users signed in on my laptop (Win10, 64-bit). They're all me for various reasons. They are named
<em>Mand Season; Mand; </em>and <em>Mog. </em>Settings can see all of these but no others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However in my Users folder (C:\Users), there are seven user folders:</p>
<p>- <em>Mand Season, Mand, </em>and <em>Mog, </em>the ones I see in Settings and when logging in;</p>
<p>- <em>mandS, </em>which I think dates back to before a recent system reset;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;<em>Mand.DESKTOP-LC1BS17 </em>- this one created itself and holds files that I thought were in Mand;</p>
<p>- and finally, <em>Public </em>and <em>TEMP; </em>fair enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the files within each user folder, I only want to keep things in Mand Season,&nbsp;Mand.DESKTOP-LC1BS17, and TEMP. I've copied everything I want from those folders onto a portable hard drive so I have them even if my fiddling with Windows eats them.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Am I safe to simply delete the other user folders? (See my question 2 as neither of these seems to be "top dog".)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.a. </strong>Why do some things end up in TEMP, and why did Windows create a new user (Mand.DESKTOP-LC1BS17) when I was already signed in as one of the users it already knew about?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong><em>Mand Season </em>is the one I think of as "me", my default. But whenever I need to give administrator authority for anything, it wants Mog to allow it. In Settings, all three of my "visible" users have administrator status, but no
 matter which I'm in, Windows always asks Mog's permission.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I did the system reset and went through the initial setup of Windows (choosing UK and British English and so on), I tried to sign in with my usual Microsoft account
<em>(Mand Season) </em>but it told me I couldn't because I had no internet. (My internet connection was fine but it wanted me to be logged in before it would connect...!!!) Therefore I created Mog thinking of it as a quick fix that I'd delete as soon as I had
 internet set up and could sign in as myself. But now Mog seems to be the only authority that Windows recognises, so I'm nervous to delete Mog.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will I lose all control if I delete this user that Windows thinks is god?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>(I don't even know if it will let me delete the folders or otherwise remove the surplus users - haven't tried yet!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Grateful for any help. I'm sick of this muddle. :)</p>

            Hi Mand.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What's likely happened at least once is that your Account became corrupted which is way too common in Windows 10, so it will start with a Temporary Account which is named either that or a variation of your actual User Name. 
<br />
<br /> Check in each one at C:\Users for files to rescue before deleting at Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users.
<br />
<br />Since there are obviously some problems with the install, I do go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />What I'd also do at this point is install Media Creation Tool from this link, choosing the button to Install Tool Now and then open the installed app and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  This is especially important with those problems since there's a new feature to reset your password from the Sign-in Screen for the many people we help who've been locked out and can't get in, often when account is corrupted.  
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the latest version (which you need anyway) and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If these do not help then report back any verbatim error message or behavior.  
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi, these extra user profiles are created during a Windows 10 update.
<br />
<br />When Windows 10 performs a major update, your user profile is copied to a temporary profile and once the update completes, the profile is copied back. 
<br />
<br />What happens sometimes is that the process of copying the profile back does not complete and you end up with extra profile(s) or you might even end up signed into a temporary profile and not be able to find your files . . .
<br />
<br />Make sure you have a copy of all your files
<br />
<br />You can safely delete these 2 profile folders:
<br />
<br />Mand.DESKTOP-LC1BS17 and TEMP
<br />
<br />They were created by Windows 10 Update       
        </p>

If these do not help then report back any verbatim error message or behavior. <br />
<br />
I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Just a couple of questions before I go ahead -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Can I just delete the user folders I don't want, before doing any of the steps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- And must I really reinstall Windows all over again so soon? I wiped the laptop and did the complete reinstall less than a month ago. Is this likely to keep being required?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Oh, and *if* I can't sign in as myself again this time round, is there a way of aborting the install so I can try again (and again) until it does work?</p>

            I gave you the most stable way to Upgrade to the newest version which you need anyway, and to bypass buggy Windows Updates and Update Assistant.  You take control of it yourself by running from the Media Creation Tool and within about an hour you're at the new version with most problems solved.  
<br />
<br />You cannot just delete User account folders as they are System Files.  Did you even bother to look if they're listed in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users which is where you delete them?  Make sure to check their folders first as they may have old files of yours still there when it started into a Temp account because yours was too corrupt to start.  
<br />
<br />I'm frankly surprised that you'd have these problems after a Clean Install.  Did you follow the steps to properly clear the drive of all partitions first to get it cleanest, then do similar to what's in this gold standard Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> ?

<p>I'm frankly surprised too. I was forced into a new Windows after the laptop came back from repair - the manufactuer didn't point me to that article, of course. Without a crystal ball was I supposed to know that article existed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it's needed anyway, it ought to be the default / most obvious way of updates happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I take it (from your tone) that I should always do this extra-stable method, rather than ever letting Update do its thing. Good to know. Us plebs can't know these things until you patricians mention them - so I'm not going to apologise for wasting your time
 by not already knowing it..</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, *as I said in the first place*, I did indeed bother to look in&nbsp;<span>Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users. That's why I titled this question as I did. To quote from my original question:</span></p>
<p><em>"Mand Season; Mand;&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Mog.&nbsp;</em>Settings can see all of these but no others."</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This is my first time digging into Users. Be patient with us ignoramuses, please. Just because some of us are brainy and interested doesn't mean we've spent our lives learning computers and keeping up to date in the
 field. (Just for example, "Clean Install" is a new term to me.)</span></p>

<p>OK, I'm as far as your last step, Media Creation Tool. It's 22% downloaded as I type. Fingers crossed this goes perfectly, but if not I now have the wiki link you give, and I'll be back here if I need to - even though what you said on Tuesday is not true
 ("Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes"; it's hard to feel free to ask even the most intelligent of questions after having one's head snapped off).<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>You cannot just delete User account folders as they are System Files. Did you even bother to look if they're listed in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users which is where you delete them?</blockquote>
<p>I had no trouble deleting the users from C:\Users. It wanted System permission only for the Public folder, but allowed me to empty it, whereas for Temp and all the others it wanted no more than administrator permission. So I did it that way for those that
 didn't show in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users (which if you remember was the reason for my question in the first place).<br />
<br />
Then I followed all the steps you gave me, even though Windows had performed an update spontaneously when I started up my laptop yesterday. (No errors found apart from a handful of inaccurate registry entries.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile I STILL want to know the answers to my questions from Tuesday:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Must I really reinstall Windows all over again so soon? I wiped the laptop and did the complete reinstall less than a month ago. Is this likely to keep being required? - In other words,
<strong>must I go through these steps every single time a Windows update comes round</strong>, to avoid problems? If so, why don't MS change the way updates happen? Automated should MEAN automated.</li><li>If I can't sign in as myself again this time round, <strong>is there a way of aborting the install so I can try again</strong> (and again) until it does work? ...Or any future time. I'd like to know , anyone.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I don't understand the reason for your last question:<br />
<em>"I'm frankly surprised that you'd have these problems after a Clean Install. Did you follow the steps to properly clear the drive of all partitions first to get it cleanest, then do similar to what's in this gold standard Clean Install which should get

No, I didn't do anything to clear partitions or search for any gold standard install method. I received my laptop "as new" after it was repaired, switched it on, and went ahead following the prompts. I'm surprised you expect people to do otherwise.<br />
<br />
I'm also interested what you meant by&nbsp;<em>"...should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem"</em>? I ask because it very much looks as if
 you're blaming me for the problem. I didn't cause it, I encountered it.</p>

            The User folders you deleted must have been old or abandoned because the system wouldn't let you delete those which were active System files.
<br />
<br />
You can do the Upgrade installs from Windows Update if you want, when they are pushed. I was only giving you more reliable methods that can avoid problems some users experience with Windows Update.
<br />
<br />
You can also roll back the Version Update, even if it won't sign-in, from the booted media which doesn't require password, via the Repair Your Computer menu, under Advanced Troubleshoot Options &gt; More &gt; Go back to old Version.
<br />
<br />
As to the Clean Install you said you had just completed a reinstall and didn't want to have to do one again. So I merely asked if you had done the most basic things which make it a true Clean Install, the first of which is to clear all partitions off the drive,
 from which the term "clean" derives. I did not say you needed to do another, was not told that what you were referring to is receiving a new laptop since you had said you just did a reinstall. I was only trying to help you as I have countless others as this
 is my specialty. If you don't want a Clean install or care about one, then that's up to you and I would help you anyway.
<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.

            Hi Mand.  
<br />
<br />In re-reading my above post it seems I didn't succeed in reassuring you that this is likely nothing you caused.  If I was too brusque I am sorry and want to try to help you better.  
<br />
<br />This could very well be due to the factory install which comes preinstalled.  These are easy to corrupt and can cause issues.  Windows 10 developers recognized this by including for the first time in Windows 10 an automated Start Fresh that reinstalls Windows while leaving out the Factory Bloatware which is at fault there.  You can read about it here:  <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use-the-fresh-start-feature-in-windows-10-creators-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have performance problems then short of that you can go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then you can  run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />All of the above should help allieviate the corrupted accounts issue it appears occurred here, short of having to wipe the drive to do the more daunting Clean install.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps (better).  Know that I'll be here to help as much as you need, answer any questions and try to be clearer.

<p>All is fine now as far as I can tell, the update using the link you first gave completed without any glitches that showed, and I only have one User folder now (plus of course Public).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really puzzled why you thought i was complaining about the tutorials you're so proud of, which I didn't know existed.</p>
<blockquote>As to the Clean Install - for which I am the author for ten years of tutorials on this which have been used by millions without a single complaint, and who unquestionably have the best installs of Windows
 in the world - you said you had just completed a reinstall and didn't want to have to do one again. So I merely asked if you had done the most basic things .</blockquote>
<p>You gave a lot of help, I merely had a couple of further questions which somehow offended you. And that still puzzles me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do realise that if a person doesn't understand an explanation, the fact that the explainer has received past awards doesn't mean *today's* explanation is working for *this* person? The number of awards won in the past makes no difference to your words'
 effectiveness in the now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>... which wasn't the case with me, anyway. I did understand, and had *further* questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NB. My complaint wasn't about brusqueness - which describes tone or manner. It was the content of your reply: taking further questions (which you had invited) as criticism of the answers you had already offered, and responding with insult. At least I assume
 your snideness was in response to something perceived.&nbsp;I had said or implied nothing personal at all. And believe me, strangers asking questions on this forum are interested in Windows, how it works and what to do - not in you - not even in *who* wrote which
 guide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose I'm flattered that you took me to be more of an expert than I have ever claimed or wanted to be, whom you could expect to be more advanced knowledge.</p>

            I feel terrible that you're taking words I intended to be kind and helpful so wrongly.&nbsp; It seems there's nothing I can say to help you without it being misconstrued and turned back on me, so I don't think I can help you any longer.&nbsp; Please know this goes

<h2>            Credit Card banned after Account theft</h2>
                    
<p><span>Recently, my account was stolen and MSP were purchased. I contacted German support about this and they took care of the whole incident. I also have a Windows Phone and I realized I can't buy any content with my credit card on there. When I contacted
 support about this problem, I was informed that due to the account theft, my credit card was banned from all Microsoft sites for life. Is this information correct? If so, how am I supposed to buy content on the Windows Phone now? Getting a new credit card
 is not as easy as it sounds. Thanks for your help.</span></p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
The reason why you’ve a VHD file is because you’ve created a system image backup. A system image includes Windows and your system settings, programs, and files. You can use a system image to restore the contents of your computer if your hard drive or computer
 ever stops working. When you restore your computer from a system image, it is a complete restoration; you can't choose individual items to restore, and all of your current programs, system settings, and files are replaced.<br />
<div>You wouldn’t be able to restore VHD files using backup and restore center. You can mount the image by following the steps below.<br />
<div><strong>Method 1: </strong>Steps to mount <strong>VHD </strong>files in <strong>
Windows 7<br />
</strong><br />
a. Open <strong>Start </strong>Menu, right-click on <strong>Computer </strong>and click
<strong>Manage</strong>.<br />
<br />
b. Click on <strong>Disk Management</strong>.<br />

c. Click <strong>Action </strong>-&gt; <strong>Attach VHD </strong>and specify the external hard disk location on your computer.<br />

<h2>            Notifications turned off by group policy</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a new lap top a <strong>month ago</strong> which at the moment runs windows 8.1. &nbsp;I now use the Mail app and Panda internet security. &nbsp;All until this week was going well.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was browsing the internet when a message (and voice) flashed up stating my computer was infected and to phone an 0800 number (I am in the UK). &nbsp;I restarted my lap top and during the evening ran &nbsp;a number of malware and anti virus software and
 a deep scan on Panda. &nbsp;Some files were found which I deleted</p>
<p>This morning &nbsp;I got a <strong>Explorer.exe system warning unknown hard error&nbsp;</strong>which came once. &nbsp;I updated my panda security to 2016 and touch wood despite the system warning all is fine.</p>
<p>However I then went into the Mail app and despite the notifications being set I don't receive any. &nbsp;If I go onto settings in the app it is greyed out at the bottom and hovering over states it is turned
<strong>off in group&nbsp;policy. &nbsp;</strong>Going into PC setting it is clicked on.</p>
<p>I have searched various forums and read something relating to the registry and gpsvc policy editor &nbsp;I searched for this and don't appear to have it.</p>
<p>Can I get my notifications back or should I just upgrade to Windows 10 and everything will be fine? &nbsp;I am still learning 8.1 and changing files in the OS terrifies me! &nbsp;I'm still recovering from the malware 24 hours ago!</p>

            <p>Hi Helena,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would be able to fix the issue with both by upgrading to Windows 10 or even when you continue using 8.1 with the following troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Run app troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><p>In many cases, the Windows Store will automatically notify you if there’s a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, or if you're unable to open the Store, try running the
<strong><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Apps troubleshooter</span></a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Follow the suggestions provided in the article below and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Kindly ignore app troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Troubleshoot problems with an app</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Run System File Checker tool</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>X</strong> and click
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type the following command and press <strong>Enter</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>sfc /scannow</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Do not close this Command Prompt window until the verification is 100% complete. The scan results will be shown after this process is finished.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            <p>HI</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night after carrying out another Panda cloud cleaner clean and the lap top restarting, the notifications started again! &nbsp;I still felt something was wrong so with the help of a local PC doctor we tried a system restore. &nbsp;For some reason there were only
 4 &nbsp;restore points - from the last 12 days only. &nbsp;The 2 earliest wouldn't &nbsp;work so tomorrow as we think there is still the remains of a virus on the machine and I've only been using the machine a month, we will restore it to factory defaults. Will my Emails
 be saved as I also sync to my gmail account but use the mail app</p>
        </p>

            I upgraded to Windows 10 a week ago - much better than 8.1 but I now can't get my printers to work!&nbsp; Seems to be a problem with the USB connection
