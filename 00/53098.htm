<h2>            problems with money sunset deluxe</h2>
                    <p>My version of Ms money quit working last week. When I tried to open it, I kept getting the message that it had stopped working and I'd be contacted if a solution was found. I had no desire to change to a more complicated program when all I need is an electronic
 checkbook that I can use to keep track of finances and balance my accounts. I read about the sunset deluxe version and decided it would be perfect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded it and installed it several times but I still get the same message that microsoft money has stopped working and nothing happens. What do I need to do to get money sunset working?</p>

            Hi. There may be some help here: <a href="https://forum.gameloft.com/viewtopic.php?t=409304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://forum.gameloft.com/viewtopic.php?t=409304</a>
<br />
<br />The community manager says to try the following: 
<br />
<br />1. Check if you have a strong and reliable internet connection.
<br />​2. Close other apps before you start the game.
<br />​3. Turn off the device for a couple minutes.
<br />​4. Check if you have the latest game version.
<br />​5.Make sure you have at least 400-500 MB free memory
<br />6. Reinstall the game if you have your progress linked to MSN/Google+/Game Center.
<br />
<br />After this, if nothing helps, you may want to try to restore back to before your PC updated and broke the game. 
<br />
<br />Select the Start  button, enter control panel, and then choose it from the list of results.
<br />Enter recovery in the Control Panel search box.
<br />Select Recovery &gt; Open System Restore &gt; Next.
<br />Choose the most recent app, driver, or update on the list of results, and then select Scan for affected programs. You'll see list of items that will be deleted if you remove this restore point. If you're OK with the deletions, select Next &gt; Finish. Or, if needed, select an earlier restore point before selecting Next &gt; Finish.

            Just drag-and-drop. &nbsp;Note that emails should usually remain <i>inside</i>&nbsp;the email program. &nbsp;Emails are stored as records in a database, and the email program is most&nbsp;efficient&nbsp;and capable of reading that database. &nbsp;If you pull the email out of the program,
 the email becomes orphaned and can be corrupted. &nbsp;It also cannot be searched or sorted for finding later.
<div><br />
<div>You can create folders <i>inside</i>&nbsp;the email program, usually by right-clicking the Inbox and choosing "New Folder".</div>

    <title>downloading free Rayman Legends demo requires my credit card details - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> risa2000  say:</h3>
<h2>            downloading free Rayman Legends demo requires my credit card details</h2>
                    
<p>I wanted to check out the new Rayman Legends demo, which seems to be available for download for free, but when I went into download dialog it complained that I have no valid payment method set and asked for my credit card details. Apparently without those
 I could not access the demo.</p>
<p>I am a bit confused what does it mean. Will I be charged for something (maybe later on) even though the demo is free? If not, why is Microsoft asking for credit card details? I have not needed credit card on my xbox live (free) account so far and deliberately
 avoided to enter any credit card details just to avoid some "incidental" charge.</p>
<p>The download page also said that the demo is available only on the first console and on the second one only if I physically transfer it there myself and only with my account logged on. I guess there might be some mistake in classification, I would expect
 the free demo will not be limited by consoles, nor will require credit cards.</p>

<p>Are you attempting this on your console or Xbox.com? The site isn't setup to use the new local currency system and for some reason that interfere with trying to "purchase" free content and adding it to your download queue. Simply browse to the demo on you
 console and it'll work just fine. Or it could be that the demo is only available to users with a Gold membership.

<p>mattreptar: You were right! I tried to schedule demo download from xbox.com web site. Trying it directly from console gives no such problems and the demo seems to be downloading all right.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I think it is so wrong to be requesting payment details for a free demo download. Why when a service has been paid for and a free demo available should Microsoft have the right to ask you to enter payment options?
</p>
<p>I wanted to queue a free demo not get my credit card out, it is things like this that make me lose trust with Microsoft.
</p>
<p>Sort it out, as it is out of order. If you start all these shenanigans on the Xbox One then mine will be pretty quickly swapped for a PS4.
</p>
<p>Not sure why Microsoft think they can take advantage of their customers, you are just agitating your customers, ruining your brand and encouraging consumers to go to your rivals.

<p>Umm, Capelli. &nbsp;Did you even read what was posted above you? &nbsp;Until the currency switch is updated on the website, just do it from your console. &nbsp;No credit card needed for the demos.</p>

<p>Silky: While I agree that Capelli probably read into it "too fast". He has some good argument. For users who are not aware of this "problem" and who face the same situation it could give exactly the impression Capelli describes (it was for me in my case).
 I agree with him that Microsoft should anticipate this and should not have even allowed this to happen (by planning the switch differently). Collecting credit card details, especially today, when few big companies face leaking data, is not something you would
 expect to be thrown around carelessly and unnecessarily as in this case.</p>

<p>TrustySix50842 -- It's a bug in the Games Store backend. &nbsp;In todays world where technology is expanding quicker than people can learn how to&nbsp;implement&nbsp;it properly bugs happen. &nbsp;Microsoft is working on a solution so ethically and morally they've done nothing
 wrong. &nbsp;Also remember that Microsoft has never been hacked and chances are they will never experience any significant intrusion. &nbsp;Honestly I'd be willing to wager some good money on Microsoft having a better defensive network than the Pentagon does. &nbsp;They
 certainly have a better one than many government sites including the White House and the DoJ which have been hacked several times this millennium alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumers also have to be more aware of their rights with financial institutions, anything billed to a card--even&nbsp;your banking card--as "credit" is Federally protected against fraudulent charges.&nbsp; If on the extremely slim chance someone broke through the
 numerous layers of security and encryption that Microsoft has then all it takes is one card to the card issuers to have those charges removed.</p>

<p>Hey folks,<br />
<br />
There has been a lot of good information provided and a great work around too. Still, I can definitely understand where Silky and Capelli are coming from and I know several people who don't like having cards attached to their account.<br />

<p>Silky... what is the currency switch thing?</p>
<p>As for me... </p>
<p>I try to download the demo from my console it says I require an XBox Live account - which I have since I'm logged in and posting here.</p>
<p>I try to download the demo from the website and it asks for credit card information... and I don't have a credit card at this time. I do have PayPal, but that doesn't seem to be an option.</p>
<p>So, what am I to do?</p>

    <title>Keeping the same partition drive letters after Sysprep &#40;Server - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skiddins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keeping the same partition drive letters after Sysprep &#40;Server 2008&#41;</h2>
                    Hi, a colleague and I are trying to Sysprep a Windows Server 2008 (NOT R2) machine for a customer.<br />
<br />
The unit has an LSI RAID card with three Seagate 600Gb hard drives in RAID 5 configuration.<br />
<br />
He requires three additional partitions as well as his main 40Gb&nbsp; C: partition and they require specific drive letters.<br />
<br />
However, whenever we go through the sysprep process and clone the machine, when the image is installed onto another identical machine the drive letters change.<br />
The partitions are the same sizes etc and are named correctly.<br />
<br />
We have tried copying the line from the registry using Regedit referring to MountedDevices and putting the lines back in after Sysprep has completed.<br />
We did this by keeping Regedit open while sysprep was running.<br />
However, after reinstalling the image the machine had simply added additional almost indetical lines but with the new drive letters (not the letters we required)<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any idea how to solve this?<br />
Thanks<br />

            Hi,
<br />Writing this for ease.
<br />1. Type in Folder options in Search. Open-File explorer options. Alternatively, type in control folders in run dialog box and Press OK.
<br />
<br />2.
<br />In the General settings, under Click items as follows, choose Single-click to open an item (point to select) or Double-click to open an item (single-click to select), and then tap OK.
<br />
<br />Done.

<h2>            Battleborn Platinum Packs</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a $19.99 platimnum and a $4.99 pack on 1/2/19. I didn't receive the Platinum and they charged my account for it. I attempted to get a refund and received a email stating i won't receive one. Can't they just add the points to me in battleborn,
 i don't even want the money back? I understand the game is old, if it doesn't work properly anymore shouldn't it be removed from the xbox marketplace?</p>

<h2>            How to select the HDMI output device as the audio playback device for Windows Media Center </h2>
                    
<p>Media center audio output</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to set up my windows media center to output windows media center through a separate audio device than the default audio device.</p>
<p>In this case, I have hdmi output which I want to be the output for windows media center and my realtek analog to be the default for everything else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my overall question is how do i make windows media center not require the default audio device.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Andrew</p>

            Method 1 is unhelpful. All it does is change the default sound device in the system, what the user is specifically trying to not do.
<div><br />
<div>Method 2 doesn't have any effect at all on Media Center.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The answer appears to be no, Media Center only works with the default audio output device.</div>

            Hi shadows_8 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Looks like I have a negative news for you. Please bear with me.
<br />
<br />Generate following output
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click on either Powershell (Admin) or Command Prompt (Admin) 
<br />Copy below and paste into Powershell / Cmd windows and Enter 
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />
<br />Look for the words KMS (Key Management Server), GVLK (Generic Volume License Key ). If KMS/GVLK appear - It is a volume license key used by organizations and is managed through Key Management System hosted on a centralized server. Hence, you can not use it. The key is not a valid key to be used. It is a counterfeit license. You will have to buy a new license for Windows and use that.
<br />
<br />If KMS/GVLK don't appear, post the output here of Powershell script.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<br />
<br />Most likely your PC should be running Windows 10 Home, you are somehow using the volume licence version of Windows 10 . .. 
<br />
<br />1.
<br />Do you know the history of your PC or version of Windows? 
<br />
<br />Is your PC second hand or was Windows reinstalled by a PC Repair Shop?
<br />
<br />
<br />2.
<br />Is there a Windows sticker on the casing of your PC and if so, what exactly is printed on that sticker?

<h2>            Remote Procedure Call Cancelled - No solutions working - Server 2012, Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I've been all over the internet looking for a solution to this. Everywhere I go offers a different solution, but nothing is doing anything for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the problem:</p>
<p>I've got a client that has 19 loaner laptops for employees. On those 19, we want to allow employees to log in locally instead of logging in to the domain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially, I applied a Group Policy Update to the OU for these devices. This update included policies enabling local login, remote administration exceptions, WMI, enabling guest accounts, and a couple completely unrelated. I also made sure that RPC services
 were automatically running on these devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time I ran the update, I solely had the local login policy enabled. For this update, 5 of the 19 devices succeeded. After I included the other policies, I had 10 succeed. 8 of them have the remote procedure call cancelled error. I think it was
 code 800707 something or other. The other 1 isn't currently connected to the domain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even now, however, guests still can't log in locally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I won't be back at the client's office until Tuesday, June 7. So until then, I can't give a whole lot of information. I'll get whatever I need then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me if you know the actual solution. I've been all over Google, so please don't just refer me to something you just now looked up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>

    <title>suspected Family Safety&#160;related black screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rmdeq  say:</h3>
<h2>            suspected Family Safety&#160;related black screen</h2>
                    <p>I've been having a problem on both my desktop and Surface Book. I've been trying to narrow it down, but can't quite get the reproducible steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the scenario that I think happens. I'm logged into the computer working, and the kids want to use it. I lock the computer and let them login to one of their accounts. They either play Minecraft (desktop) or Power Director (Surface Book doesn't have
 Minecraft). They use their time, maybe they request an extension,&nbsp;maybe I grant one or not, but eventually they time out and their app is still running. I think if I go to the computer and immediately login to my account, it's fine, but if I wait "some period
 of time", the screen goes black and nothing I can try fixes it: the computer is comatose. I have to hit the&nbsp;reboot button, or the two&nbsp;finger UEFI boot on the Surface Book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While comatose:</p>
<p>1) On the Surface Book, I can attach and reattach the keyboard using the keyboard button as much as I want, but neither Ctrl-Alt-Del nor Windows-Ctrl-Shift-B do anything. Keyboard lighting is responsive to key touches.</p>
<p>2) On the desktop, I was able to unplug my 3DConnexion Space Mouse and I heard the telltale sound that a&nbsp;device got unplugged but plugging or unplugging any devices after that&nbsp;made no sound. My Xbox One Controller wouldn't attach when I press the big silver
 button. I tried unplugging everything but the mouse and keyboard, still black. Nothing on keyboard responsive including the key&nbsp;combos above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took a look at the&nbsp;logs on the desktop, and&nbsp;here's what appeared odd.&nbsp;Before I rebooted, the computer had been sitting for about two hours. The last log entry was about an hour and a half before the reboot. A little before that, the&nbsp;Application Log had&nbsp;some
 entries:</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>The NVIDIA OpenGL driver has not been able to initialize a connection with the GPU. This might be due to out of memory error, an exhaustion of system resources or too many graphical applications running. The application will not render correctly.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>A little bit after that, javaw.exe running on&nbsp;my child's account had an APPCRASH. This is basically Minecraft crashing. But about seven minutes after that, my chatty Antivirus&nbsp;software reports that it's still running. Then, that's it,&nbsp;no more log entries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of&nbsp;course, the APPCRASH doesn't&nbsp;apply to the Surface Book because it doesn't have Minecraft and might not even have Java for Windows. The video on both the desktop and Surface Book are NVIDIA (different cards)&nbsp;and their drivers are as up to date as Windows
 Update wants them to be. The Surface Book is up to date with the latest Windows 10 Pro Build 1607, and the desktop is running Windows 10 Pro Build 15002.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this black screen reboot needed when using&nbsp;Family Safety with an NVIDIA GPU and time expired?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you experiencing the same issue when Family Safety is turned off?</li><li>Is this the first time you have encountered an issue with Family Safety?<br />

            <p>1. I am disabling Family Safety as of today to check.</p>
<p>2. This is the first time I've encountered a potentially crashing issue affecting my work-in-progress with&nbsp;Family Safety, but I have reported other issues.</p>
<p>3. No intentional changes. They both 'Check for Updates' regularly say I cannot say absolutely that this wasn't caused by an update. It didn't "seem" to occur six months ago, but only recently have they&nbsp;started Minecraft and video editing on either computer.</p>

<p>It happened again today with the Surface Book.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I know last night my son was using the Surface Book&nbsp;(Family Safety is not limiting his time) and it was plugged into the Surface Dock and charging like it normally is. He walked away from the computer, still logged in, and I think&nbsp;Paint and Chrome were running.&nbsp;Neither
 of us&nbsp;used the Surface Book after that yesterday. It spent the night plugged in and likely charging the whole night.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>This morning, I unplugged the Surface Dock power cable to move it somewhere else. The video was working, it put up my picture and I used Windows Hello to login. But, once I logged in, the screen went black except for a mouse cursor. If I detach the screen
 and rotate it, the mouse cursor would rotate.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>If I plug it back into the Surface Dock, it is sending signals to my external monitors, but that signal is a black screen. I can detach and reattach the screen all I want.&nbsp;I haven't seen the mouse cursor since plugging&nbsp;it&nbsp;back into the Surface Dock (might
 be coincidence).</div>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the following key sequence because I think it would Shutdown if the keys were responsive:</p>
<p>Ctrl-Alt-Del</p>
<p>Up-Arrow</p>
<p>Enter</p>
<p>Down-Arrow</p>
<p>Enter</p>
<p>Enter (because other users are probably logged&nbsp;in)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, the computer&nbsp;does not shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;used the two-finger salute and rebooted the Surface Book. I looked into the logs, and the Surface Book was running most of the day but not showing anything but a black screen. The power state it had been in was 'connected standby'. One of the things I
 saw in the logs was a 'mini port' crash, which seemed to occur around the times I was plugging and unplugging the Surface Dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Investigating this, I found a piece of software I didn't have called "Microsoft Surface Dock Updater". I had thought "Check for Updates"&nbsp;would get me Surface Dock firmware, but it doesn't&nbsp;and that firmware was out of date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll run it with the updated Surface Dock firmware for a few days and see if the Surface Book black screen goes away.</p>

            <p>It happened again tonight on the Surface Book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past month, I had gone back to using Family Safety, but think this problem might more be related to "two users" and it is probably irrelevant that one of them is managed under Family Safety.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My son turned the SB on and was using it for over an hour. At one point, I extended his time, using the normal click on a link in Family Safety generated email. At some point, he was still using it, I was away and his time expired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hours later, I went to login because I wanted to use the SB. Windows Hello put up his name and his background (since he was the last one to use it this is normal). But, the iris recognition lights didn't come on right away, so I walked away to do something
 else. When I came back, the computer had gone to sleep again. I pressed the normal power button to wake the SB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got something totally different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time, I got a blue screen that&nbsp;had the little Windows "eye" icon at the top, and a message that said "Sorry,&nbsp;something&nbsp;went wrong. Please try again later". Except, when I first got this message,&nbsp;the message was blinking very rapidly on the blue screen,
 and the icon was also changing slightly. I tried to&nbsp;record a video with my cell phone, but by the time I could get to my phone and set it up to record video,&nbsp;the message remained but the blinking had stopped. The message remained even after I detached the
 keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I pressed the power button to turn off the screen, and then pressed the power button again. I got a blue screen - just blue. I can disconnect and reconnect all I want, and the blue screen seemed to respond to rotation when I had it disconnected, but no text
 and no way of getting passed the blue screen. I eventually did the two finger salute to shutdown the SB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked into the System log, and within the hour before this failure, the system entered Connected Standby, then left Connected&nbsp;Standby because of a AC/DC Display Burst (???), then reentered Connected Standby.&nbsp;If it matters, it's internet connection at
 all times today was through a USB cellular modem and the SB was plugged in all day and the battery is at 100%. I don't know what Power Settings my son had it on, but I had it on one I call "Overnight Process" which is a copy of the "High Performance" default
 modified to never go to sleep. I don't know if because he logged in first it chose a different Power Setting, but that's what mine and his appear to be. How are Power Settings determined in multiple user scenarios? Are they per user? Neither of us appear to
 need Admin permission to change it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else I can find in the log that would help? After I post this, I'm going to reboot, log in as him, just to check what power profile the SB has if I'm not the first to log in that day.</p>

            <p>I am a little surprised I only have two Power Plans on the SB: "Overnight Process" and "Balanced". My "Overnight Process" does have an action for pressing the Power Button to cause a "Hibernate", whether on AC or DC, but my son asserts that when he ran out
 of time, he clicked the family safety option to "Switch User or Shutdown" and walked away from the computer at the login screen. He did not press the Power Button (or close the lid).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, presumably Windows Hello sat there for some period of time looking for an iris to read. But, after that, I don't know what happened. The cellular modem probably remained connected (because he has no way to disconnect once he's locked out), but because
 this is a follow-on report to these black screens when the cellular modem wasn't being used, I'm tending to discount&nbsp;the cellular modem&nbsp;as being the source of this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Windows Hello require a network connection??? If it had one but then loses one, could that cause the "Something went wrong" error (which I usually attribute to lack of network connection, although I realize it's not necessarily so).</p>

    <title>Reliable Functionality - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Reliable Functionality</h2>
                    Intune vs Defender ATP vs Bitdefender Endpoint Security and Anti-Malaware Suggestions needed please?!!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I paid for a year of bitdefender gravityzone endpoint security less than 6 months ago, After the last couple of months of Windows updates, (Windows 10 Pro functions really well for me other than security now) Bitdefender seems to be conflicting with Windows
 10 Pro. I like Bitdefender and think their product is great, but has Windows Defender evolved to the point of being the most secure option for me as a Windows 10 Pro customer or is 3rd Party Security still the most advanced option?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I had no idea of the existence of intune until now, tried to run the download trial, will not work with my paid subscription of Office365 through godaddy that I paid a lot of money for as well. All respect to godaddy, my services through them are excellent.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I prefer to use all Microsoft products on Micrsoft Windows as much as possible, so as a new Paying customer of Windows 10 Pro and wanting the best option for my personal and business digital needs, I have to share in utter confusion beyond common sense that
 this is the most difficult experience in security and reliable functionality I have ever experienced PAYING $ for (I purchased W10 Pro instead of using the free version) that always is forcing me to "Reset" my PC to truly function again without a glitch. All
 the repair tools offered repair like a Band-Aid after ANY ussue it seems. I am not an IT Pro. This is why I actually pay for the services instead of trying to get free or unauthorized software.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To be fair, Windows 10 Pro is by far, hands down, the BEST Windows OS I have ever used since XP! ( I did not like Vista thru 8) W10 Pro is only OS that has interested me beyond iOs. Sorry, I will always love Apple, so I am REALLY giving Windows 10 Pro a
 chance here as a customer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love the Windows 10 Pro interface and how fast it works!! I provide feedback the best I can to help you improve Windows for me and the rest of all users. I am loosing a lot of time constantly having to deal with software working and then conflicting.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand Windows 10 is new territory and I am patient so please keep small businesses in mind as you continue to fix the upgrades. Most is being fixed already so I mean this constructively as a customer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am counting on Windows 10 to be a viable tool for my business as a small micro-company in the 21st century. I'll never be a big corporation, just one of the many small new types of coexisting businesses that rely on Digital Medium to make my tiresome
 business happen. The world needs big and small business to thrive realistically. Thank You.

<h2>            Can&#39;t maintain&#47;hold a wireless connection &#40;Windows 7 Professional&#41;</h2>
                    I have a Dell Latitude E6510 with Windows 7 Professional; it has been running for a few months without any real problems. Two nights ago after being wirelessly connected to the internet on my home network the internet connection dropped. This had happened
 about 2 weeks prior and nothing worked, restarting, troubleshooting, etc. - but the next day it was fine (it happened twice within the two week period until two days ago.) I am now entering day three of not being able to maintain a wireless connection on the
 machine. I know the signal is being broadcast b/c another computer is able to connect and maintain it's wireless connection. The latitude will connect, keep the connect for a tiny while, anywhere form seconds to maybe a minute or two, then drop it (sometimes
 I get the yellow triangle but that is infrequent) and then re-initiate it. I have checked that I have current drivers and they are up-to-date. This is a very frustrating problem. My wireless adapter is the Intel Centrino Advanc

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Some of the 3rd party applications can leave after uninstall running processes in the background that keep interfering with Network's traffic.</p>
<p>Download, and use this free application to examine what running in background.<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx</a></p>
<p>If you find residual processes related to the “Junk” right click on it. Click propertied and image tab, find the file the is running it, and try to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Make sure before you delete that it is not a Windows original file.</p>
