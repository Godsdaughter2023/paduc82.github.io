<h2>            Can not open multiple File Explorer Tabs in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I need to open multiple views of my file explorer as I need to transfer files to folders and I can not open multiple file explorer instances to do this easily. &nbsp;Sometimes it works and then it doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally I can just right click with my mouse and open multiple views of the file explorer but in the upgrade to windows 10 this is not working very well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help please?</p>

    <title>Windows XP Compatibility Mode missing on a fresh install of Windows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows XP Compatibility Mode missing on a fresh install of Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    So, I just did a fresh install of Windows 8 Professional (got a nasty little bug that was wasting resources left and right) and came to notice, this time around, Windows XP Compatibility Mode is now missing from my options in the list. It's required to
 use a program I use often and, before the reinstall, the program worked without a problem (obviously when I had it set to compatibility mode). Is there a way to bring back XP compatibility mode in Windows 8? I should add, the previous install was an upgrade
 from Windows 7 to Windows 8.

    <title>Unable to connect to Facebook, Twitter using people app. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to connect to Facebook, Twitter using people app.</h2>
                    <b>Original Title: </b>Windows 8/ 8.1 People App<br />
<br />
I am having problem with the Windows 8/8.1 people app. I am not able<br />
to connect to Facebook or Twitter. This is a problem that has been<br />
happening for some months now. I have tried every workaround posted.<br />
Some things were a brief fix and some just didn't work at all. I<br />
thought that maybe with the 8.1 update, things would have been fixed<br />
but to my surprise, it wasn't. Still the same thing. I am able to see<br />
updates on the live tile while in metro UI but when I go into the<br />
actual app.............nothing. Can someone please help. I like the<br />
layout of the people app better than the new Facebook but if it's not<br />
working, why is there.

 troubleshooter, I deleted the app and added it back, I changed my password, I synched the licenses. I did everything. Some things only works temporarily.

<p>It works great on my Windows Phone 8 but since March or so I have been unable to see status updates or to post updates through the People app to Twitter or Facebook. It started for me when I installed those individual apps and then uninstalled them.

            <p>All,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm not sure if the issues I experienced are the same as yours. I was able to see the Facebook and Twitter feeds from within the People app. I just wasn't able to chat with my Facebook contacts through the app. I only had the option of chatting via Messenger
 or SMS, which then opened the Skype app.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, here's a fix that worked for me. Just for good measure, make sure the People app is closed. I hope this fix works for you as well:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>-Open the Store app, swipe in from the right and select "Settings" then "App Updates."</p>
<p>-Although yours may say "Yes" to "Automatically update my apps", chances are there are updates waiting for Facebook, Mail/Calendar/People and others. That's another bone worth picking with Microsoft.</p>
<p>-Click the "Check for updates" button and select the apps to update.</p>
<p>-Just for S&amp;G's, once the updates are complete, go back and click the "Sync licenses" button.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now open the People app and let the syncing update/complete. Click on any contact that's on Facebook. See if you can select Facebook as an option under "Send message". If so, click on "Facebook" and the Facebook app should open right to the messages window.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>*Just a side note - this issue was happening on my ultrabook and tablet but not on my laptop. On my laptop, I was able to chat with my Facebook contacts. I couldn't remember what I did differently. I may have simply updated the apps as well or just removed/re-added
 my Facebook account.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

<h2>            External HD not recognized at all in 8.1</h2>
                    <p>HI,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My USB 3.0 external hard drive worked fine on my Windows 8.1 x64 desktop but suddenly stopped being recognized (or mounts). The same ext. hard drive works on another computer (W7 x64). The USB ports on the W8.1 x64 desktop work fine as they can mount other
 devices.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here is what happens now on the W8 x64 machine. After I plug it, the ext. HD shows up in Device Manager/Universal Serial Bus controllers for about 1 minute and then disappears. During that one minute, the ext. HD doesn't show in Explore nor opens in AutoPlay
 (something it has been doing for several weeks, even after I installed W8.1).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I followed all the tips and fixes of this blog post (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/usbcoreblog/archive/2013/11/01/help-after-installing-windows-8-1-my-usb-drive-disappears-or-file-transfers-stop-unexpectedly-r-a-post-title.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/usbcoreblog/archive/2013/11/01/help-after-installing-windows-8-1-my-usb-drive-disappears-or-file-transfers-stop-unexpectedly-r-a-post-title.aspx</a>)

<p><br />

<p>Hope anyone can help!!</p>

<h2>            Is Audio Supported Over HDMI&#63;</h2>
                    I connected my Surface via HDMI to watch some movies on the home theater system, but I'm only hearing sound through the Surface speakers. How do I get audio to go through HDMI so that I can use my nice home theater sound system?

            <p>Hi all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found probably a solution. When I connected the HDMI I only heard the sound in the surface and at the sound devices box the HDMI option won't appear, so I get in into Device Manager and Right click on my Surface and Scan for HW changes, then the sound
 starts to listen on the Home Theater. I expect this probably works in most of cases like me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p><span>Hi All,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue was posted to the Service Health Dashboard (SHD) as incident LY80242 starting at September 30, 2016 05:21:00 PM (UTC). The user&nbsp;experience of this incident is:</span><span>
</span><span>Users are unable to dial in to conferences using phone numbers beginning with country code +86. The issue originally affected only numbers in the following format: 861058224xxx. A suggested workaround is: Change any instance of a default dial-in
 number in China in their user base to a Hong Kong or other dial-in number outside China. For additional information see Set the dial-in phone numbers for meeting organizers that are included on invites (<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-the-dial-in-phone-numbers-for-meeting-organizers-that-are-included-on-invites-32954439-d365-4125-872f-b37466ecb035" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-the-dial-in-phone-numbers-for-meeting-organizers-that-are-included-on-invites-32954439-d365-4125-872f-b37466ecb035</a>).
 After the configuration of the users has been changed, ask them to restart their Skype for Business and Outlook clients. Once their clients have been restarted, users should either reschedule all their existing meetings using the Meeting Update Tool (http://aka.ms/meetingmigrationtool),
 manually reschedule them to reflect their new default phone number or join their meetings via a number from any country other than China that is listed in the “Find a local number” link on their existing meeting invites. Tenant administrators can view current
 information and updates on SHD at the link here</span></p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If&nbsp;you are experiencing a similar issue and do not see an SHD post, please let us know by sharing your tenant information via Private Message (PM) as this may indicate either a scoping issue or an independent problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I will be closing this thread for further posting in order for affected&nbsp;customers to easily identify the information here. You may subscribe to this thread or refer to SHD for the updated information. I will also post back here once the issue has been

<h2>            Invisible Hack is not being dealt with on MW3</h2>
                    
<p>I have been playing against the same player who is using the invisible hack on MW3 for the last 7 days in a row. i have filled several complaint against this user, and choose to 'avoid this player' only to keep ending up in the same lobby as him every single
 night. so clearly these report and avoid functions don't work.<br />
<br />
I would also like&nbsp; a full refund and a written apology from Infinity Ward and Micro$oft for the stress and inconvenience this has caused me. why should i pay money for poor quality service and none existent report functions ?</p>

<p>ok, so the last bit i can dream on , but the first bit i can retaliate with , as in .. if i dont get this issue resolved, or if you dont stop this&nbsp;(MOD REMOVED)&nbsp;with hack lobbies and invisible hacks i am moving to the Sony network.</p>

<p>how ironic is it that the hacks become rampant in the build up to Ghosts....</p>

<p>I honestly wish you luck with this but I doubt you will have much to be honest. This game has been broken for an age hasn't it?. , As has WaW. IW/Activision/Treyarch don't seem to give a hoot about players having a poor experience on their games. So long
 as your wallet has already been opened they are happy. I have not played it for a long time but when I last did it was still broken.<br />
<br />
I had a similar complaint with World at war. I was dropped into a modded lobby and lost my stats, it ended up being in the -millions xp. I sent them several E mails and eventually got a reply. Sorry there is nothing we can do. This is after buying the game
 and all the map packs to go with it, and there is nothing they can do?..<br />
<br />
Well fixing their products would be a good start, but hey that seems far too much to expect. they have had years and nothing has changed, That kinda says it never will change.
<br />
<br />
I understand MS has no influence over stand alone companies, but any game that is left to be modded like these games have been should be removed from the service entirely. Maybe that would push dev's into attempting to fix these issues. &nbsp;We wont let it on LIVE
 until it is up to standard and people can do what it is they paid to do. play the game they bought, not the modded version of it.<br />
<br />
Mods don't seem to be so prevalent in newer titles, touch wood. But it is still poor that older ones are left to rot even though they likely raked in a great many millions of revenue..&nbsp;</p>

<p>See thats the whole point. Ms dont care if they did they would stop modders when they sign into live and not let them go into multiplayer games. That right there would be awesome but they dont have people that work there think like us. Also they are way
 understaff to handle the load now with so many people on live. I would love to play games and make money doing so and ban people for it. Its a perfect job for me. To me if MS is paid and psn is not and both have the same playerbase then why are we still with
 ms?????</p>

<p>This is why I no longer play any MP games like COD, BF tec... it is a waste of your money and my money to try playing MP games when you know there are players groups of players, clans, busters groups etc... all they do is hack these games, accounts, etc...
 XBL/MS really could care less about what you need or want its all about the money and if these hackers help MS/XBL to turn profits so be it ... Here's a good idea "Don't play in MP and longer and save your money."</p>

    <title>48-Hour Xbox Live Gold not working properly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laxative payne  say:</h3>
<h2>            48-Hour Xbox Live Gold not working properly</h2>
                    
<p>I have a 48 hour Xbox Live Gold card I found and used because my Gold ran out a few weeks ago. I've been using XBL Free. I entered the code correctly, but now it seems like it won't use that code.
<br />
<br />
I'm still on XBL Free. The 2-day trial shows up in my membership list, but I can't select it most of the time. To be able to select it I have to press something weird like License Transfer. Even when I do select the membership, I get error and status code 8C210003.<br />
<br />
What's going on? I only bothered to renew my membership to play the newly-released Battlefield 3 beta. If Xbox doesn't want me on Gold, I guess that won't be happening.</p>

<p>well 2 things first and foremost</p>
<p>read the back of the CARD</p>
<p>this card does not provide full gold membership</p>
<p>to be in the battlefield 3 beta you must be an active gold</p>
<p>48hour trials only function as a temporary multiplayer functions</p>
<p>no party chat or gold exclusives</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>48hour trials cannot be stacked meaning you must wait till the other card expires before using the new one</p>

<p>what if you have disk read errors from zero date, tried reset suggested by support, was a hit after a dozen tries now a miss on all attempts, support now has great way of bumping you out of queue and directing to unprintable service requests</p>

            Ya I've found the solution. There is a program named credwiz.exe in the following path:&nbsp;C:\Users\....\AppData\Roaming\Adobe. I did use Ccleaner to turn it's autostart servcice off but it didn't work, so I decided to delete the .exe file, then the annoyed
 error has completely disappeared

<h2>            Tropico 5 Freezing since July 2016 update</h2>
                    
<p>Since a late July required update Tropico 5 freezing on random auto-saves, accompanied by occasional scrambled images, especially on the Build menu. Installing the oydate fixes the freezing, but locks you out of all DLC you purchased.</p>
<p>If anyone else is having this problem PLEASE contact Calypso media directly, either via Customer service or on the Tropico 5 international forums. They need more information from as many players as possible to reproduce and fix the problem!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Just saying - it has been over a month and no fix from Klaypso. In order to get a refund you need to first contact Calypso, and then, once you have proof of the abysmal customer service there you can take it to Microsoft support and try to get a refund.
 Good luck!</p>

<h3> jaxs22  say:</h3>
<h2>            NAT setting strict on sparks Huawei HG630b Home Gateway</h2>
                    
<p>I am bounced from Xbox customer support to Spark to Huawei in bankok or where ever they are, today I phoned spark again and told then I cant afford an extra $13 per month on top of my ph account for a static IP, and that the service was provided for me on
 the grounds they said it would be better for gaming on my xbox one, the tech then tried to sell me their premium service who could try to fix the issue for $15 per month, I was getting pretty annoyed by this stage so now am trying to ask for one of their supervisors,
 does anyone else have the same issue with this spark supplied modem?</p>

<p>Hi I live in </p>
<p>Invercargill Southland New Zealand</p>
<p>Huawei HG630b Home gateway </p>
<p>We have My Xbox one console and a Xbox 360 both connect wireless and one Xbox 360 wired</p>
<p>I have tried connecting my Xbox one via Ethernet cable, tried port forward but they don't have settings for this Huawei, I have contacted my isp, and Xbox support and Huawei, but have gotten no where. I cant afford the static IP as my ISP will charge another
 $13 on top of the $120per month, they also offered their premium service for another $15 per month on top of my $120 per month.</p>
<p>Don't know if the UPnP is enabled or not</p>
<p>when I go to play multiplayer games I get the warning that my Nat is set to strict and I may not find people to join Nat is constantly strict, now</p>
<p>My ISP is Spark New Zealand formally Telecom New Zealand, I have had this problem ever since upgrading from the old copper service to the ultra fast fibre network, and this Huawei was the modem they supplied, as my old one is not capable of functioning with
 the new service.</p>

<p>If I am reading that correctly you have 3 consoles attached to the gateway and if that is the case you will probably never get it to work properly. &nbsp;Those gateways are not designed to handle multiple consoles. &nbsp;ISPs provide the least expensive equipment
 that will handle their basic service. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Would you be able to get a simple internet modem and provide your own gaming router? &nbsp;With that configuration you would not need a static IP address. &nbsp;The ISP would just provide you a single IP number and your router would manage all inside network traffic
 using UPnP. </p>
<p>Also, could you disconnect all the consoles except the One and see if it will connect then? &nbsp;If not check the network connection services and get all the specifics provided and post back. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know. &nbsp;Good Luck! </p>

    <title>Which version of Windows 10 should I upgrade to if I&#39;ve been - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jf000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Which version of Windows 10 should I upgrade to if I&#39;ve been running 64-bit Windows 7 with 2GB of RAM&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am currently using an old laptop that came with 64-bit Windows 7 pre-installed. I have 2GB of RAM. It's never been a great computer, but now that I have reserved a Windows 10 upgrade, I am interested in doing a clean install in order to perhaps extend
 the life of my old laptop just a little longer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Taking into consideration my small amount of RAM, should I upgrade to the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows 10? As I understand, and this understanding is quite rudimentary, 64-bit effectively "unlocks" the use of more RAM, but does running 64-bit Windows
 with only 2GB of RAM harm performance? Should I have been running 32-bit Windows 7 this whole time? Or is it effectively a wash?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should be noted that I don't use my computer for anything strenuous; just internet and low-end (say, pre-2007) gaming. I also was not planning on purchasing more RAM since I plan to upgrade laptops in the next few years anyways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>First you need to upgrade your computer. since it has Windows 7 64-bit installed on it, it'll &nbsp;put Windows 10 64-bit on there. If you do a clean install before hand Windows 10 won't activate. Then you'll be able to do a clean install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I'm not sure if it's possible to go to 32-bit after upgrading and doing a clean install, I would stick with 64-bit. If the computer was running fine with Windows 7 64-bit on it, It should work fine with Windows 10 64-bit on it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, same here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does the form include last contacts to whom I sent an e-mail and some subjects if this is a Skype account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another problem: i used my corporative e-mail which no longer exists on MSN and when MSN was discontinued I decided to use this Skyoe account which had another e-mail address. I used to change its password at least once each two years. Can't I use the former
 e-mail, which I do have access, to recover my account?</p>

<p><span><span>I recommend that you run Disk CleanUp or cCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software. cCleaner comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this tool
 as like any registry cleaner it can lead to the creation of very difficult to resolve system errors</span></span></p>

<h2>            Why can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t we buy a new power supply without sending the old one&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have spent hours with the chat and phone support to explain my case and no-one has been able to help me; or answer this simple question.</p>
<p>I don't have my old PSU, whatever the reason is (eating by dog; mistakenly put in the garbage, stolen, lost...). Why can't I PURCHASE a genuine PSU? Of course I don't want an exchange covered by the warranty (for which it makes sense to send the failing
 unit), I just want to be able to PAY for a NEW GENUINE PSU.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a day one customer and think it's really a lousy customer service. What am I supposed to do now according to Microsoft????</p>
<p>A supervisor even tried to make me believe that if it's stolen, then it's the police station where I file the case that has to contact Microsoft for the replacement request. What the hell are you playing right now Microsoft seriously?</p>

<p>Thanks Got Cobol; </p>
<p>unfortunately, it doesn't work anymore like this. You do have to ship your old one even if you select "Eligible Accessories (Select an accessory not shown)" and want to pay $35 for it :(</p>
<p>They say it has changed recently to prevent fraud...</p>

<p>interesting, when I got a second PS end of feb. there was nothing about returning the original. &nbsp;I ordered one because mine was loud, and did not want to do the mail in and wait thing so just got a second one since I had read many noise issues for people
 were solved with replacment.... oh well.... &nbsp; wonder how its fraud if you pay for it.</p>

<p>On the phone with Service Center. They are telling me they can't sell me a power supply without me mailing my old one back. I told them I no longer had the old one. They suggested I buy one on Amazon. When I told then there were no OEM ones there, and my
 understanding was that a non-OEM one would void my warranty, I was hung up on.</p>

<p>That's ridiculous you can't buy a power supply from them. That's utter crap, specially when we can't use a non-OEM one without voiding our warranties.</p>
<p>I'd keep calling them back, over and over. Till someone pulls thy head from thy rear and figures this out.

<p>The reason you can't buy a MS Power brick is simple. At least simple to me. You can thank all the people that committed fraud and lied to get a free xbox one console. So when all those people got those new consoles they came with nothing but the console.
 Consequently someone that might ACTUALLY have a problem like this is SOL so to speak since others have ruined the exchange program. IMO it's really to prevent those that have console only from getting what is needed to have a working system.</p>
<p>So a reminder to all don't "throw" away your faulty accessories if you want to get them replaced. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I called back and got a lot more helpful person. Finally after back and forth and supervisor discussions, came up with solution. They said that new process for cases where you no longer have the item, order replacement online as usual, but instead of mailing
 in original, you can mail in a COPY of the receipt, proving you made the original purchase.</p>

<p>Thank you all for your comments. I obviously had no luck since none of the 10+ people I talked to /chatted with suggested I could mail in a copy of the receipt proving I made the original purchase - which makes some sense if there was fraud thanks to which
 people would get consoles without accessories. I'm will contact them again and try that!</p>

    <title>Where&#39;s my free Windows DVD Player&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sporc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where&#39;s my free Windows DVD Player&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Before upgrading to Windows 10 Pro I had Windows 8.1 with Media Center included (that I bought for about $10 a few years ago). I read that Windows 10 wouldn't have Media Center and for those who had Media Center installed they would get Windows DVD Player
 free. I was okay upgrading to Windows 10 because I haven't used the Media Center in a while and thought "Windows DVD Player I guess is an ok payoff for those of us who bought Media Center". So I upgraded to Windows 10, went to download my FREE Windows DVD
 Player app and turns out it's going to cost me $15? That doesn't seem free to me. I thought Windows 10 was going to be better than Windows 8.1, but it seems Microsoft has just removed normal apps that use to come with Windows and is trying to make more money
 off them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look at it as though, Microsoft stole 10 dollars from me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Way I look at it is this, you got a few options.</p>
<p>1. Give me my Free App</p>
<p>2. Give me my Media Center back or at least make it a separate app that we can get free for those who bought it.</p>
<p>3. Credit my account 10 Microsoft Dollars</p>
<p>
</p><p>The choice is yours.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the fast response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Media Center on my PC when I first installed Windows 7, then upgraded to Windows 8, then finally to Windows 8.1 and had to buy Media Center for $9.95 a few years back. One of my computers is eligible for the free Windows DVD Player app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The current PC I'm typing on now, does not have a DVD drive, the PC next to my TV is the one that has the DVD drive that had Media Center on it. I searched in the Windows 10 store for Windows Media Player App and the ones that show up are:
</p>
<p>Windows Media Player Install $2.49</p>
<p>Media Player HD for Windows 8 for $1.99</p>
<p>Media Player HD for Windows OS for $1.99.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see the free one... But I don't know why you want me to download that instead of Windows DVD Player...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This information helps me. I don't have any other queries to let you know. I'm happy you assist us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're Welcome</p>

            <p>I paid $15 dollars last night and the app I downloaded won't play my DVD's. &nbsp;I will do a search for what you suggested, but I would love to figure out how to get my money back for the one that doesn't work. &nbsp;I am very frustrated right now with the fact that
 I can't play DVD's and am hoping my DVR still works with the upgrade. &nbsp;Hopefully you can help me with this. &nbsp;Thank you.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem, the store app broke the dvd player and now Microsoft wants me to pay $15 for it.</p>
<p>I will not buy any thing from the store until Microsoft fixes this.</p>
<p>I'd be afraid I would have to pay for it again</p>
<p>
</p><p>we have the mediacenter key why not jut ask us from the store and verify it. </p>
<p>we paid for mediacenter for the dvd codex we shouldn't have to pay again just because Microsoft broke it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>unacceptable. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft gives it, then breaks it, then takes it away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>is windows 10 really free?</p>
<p>i'm beginning to wonder.</p>
<p>i'll keep my windows 8.1 dvd ready to go back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the is just one of the many bugs i'm trying to fix, wifi, file corruption, broken zune, corrupt profiles, store app and its apps, and more</p>
<p>I think vista didn't do this bad.</p>
