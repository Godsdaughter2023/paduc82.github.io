<p>I know UBISOFT doesn't have the license rights anymore for Naruto as evident from both Broken Bond and ROAN as the dlc and stuff for both titles are gone, NARUTO ROAN used to be a digital download, was this the case as with midway and other related games
 that when the license or company etc doesnt have a contract with MS etc that the content is yanked?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So in other words did Naruto ROAN get yanked off the GOD (games on demand) Catalog due to UBISOFT not having the rights anymore since Cyberconnect/Namco Bandai has put out Shippuden Storm 2.</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to uninstall and reinstall Skype again. Nothing.</p>
<p>I already rebooted my phone. Nothing.</p>
<p>Given that I just reinstalled Skype I assume that I have the latest version anyways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it may help to know that, if I go to "Settings", "Contacts", "Automatically add friends" and chose to&nbsp;"Automatically add friends", I get this failure message... Skype: unable to change "Automatically add friends" setting.</p>
<p>I've tried many times already, always same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to get some serious support from anyone in Skype or Microsoft?</p>
<p>It's hilarious that not one single Microsoft company provides any customer support service whatsoever!!!!!</p>

</p><p>Great, so, how come I just downloaded it and I have got version 7.46.0.596?</p>
<p>And if this is not supposed to be the latest version, how do I update it to the new version given that I do not see any such option either in the Skype app or in Google Playstore?</p>

            Windows 7 doesn't HAVE a "local settings" folder - least not here it doesn't.<br />
<br />
I suspect that these folders you are trying to open are JUNCTION points, not real folders - probably left over from a previous Vista install.

            <p>Hi Brian, </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you receive Windows Update error 80240fff, you might need to restart Background Intelligent Transfer Services.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1</strong>: Initially, I suggest you to run Windows Update troubleshooter to fix the problem. It makes sure that your computer is connected to the Internet, and checks to see whether your network adapter and Windows Update services
 are running correctly. </span></span></p>
<p><span>Follow the below steps</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows + X </strong>and select <strong>Control&nbsp;panel.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In the<strong> search box, </strong>type<strong> troubleshooter,
</strong>and then click <strong>Troubleshooting. </strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Under<strong> System&nbsp;and Security, </strong>click<strong> Fix problems with Windows Updates.</strong></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 2</strong>: </span></span></p>
<p><span>Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>R </strong>
key, and type <strong>services.msc </strong>in the text box.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Locate <strong>Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS)
</strong><span>from the list. </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right-click the <strong>Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS)</strong> service, and then click
<strong>Properties</strong>. </p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">On the <strong>General</strong> tab, next to <strong>Startup type</strong>, make sure that
<strong>Automatic (Delayed Start)</strong> is selected. If it isn't, select it, and then click
<strong>Apply</strong>. </p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Next to <strong>Service status</strong>, check to see if the service is started. If it isn't, click

<h2>            Dual Booting Windows 8.1 with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After installing the 14295 build of windows 10 today I found that I couldn't boot to my windows 8.1 anymore. The system gives me error code 0xc0000225 Your PC/Device needs to be repaired. A device isn't connected or can't be accessed. You'll need to run
 recovery tools.&nbsp; If you don't have any installation media (like a disc or USB device) Contact your PC Administrator or PC/Device manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>there are options at the bottom of the screen they are</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press Enter to try again</p>
<p>Press F8 for Startup Settings</p>
<p>Press ESC for UEFI Firmware Settings</p>
<p>Press F9 to use a different operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pressing enter just comes back instantaneously to the same screen</p>
<p>Pressing F8 just blinks the screen</p>
<p>Pressing Esc takes me to my BIOS</p>
<p>Pressing F9 takes me back to my Choose an operating system screen I get every time I boot up</p>
<p>
</p><p>What troubleshooting can I do if I can't get into the recovery environment for windows 8.1 or the startup setting to restart in safe mode if that will even work if it can't see the disk</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be a UEFI issue if it can't even see the drive!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get into windows 10 recovery tools</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well the diagnosis got worse and worse and now I need a motherboard replacement</p>

<h2>            Trendware TEW-432BRP 54Mbps Wireless Router Reboots with Windows 7 64-bit OS laptop system connected via wireless interface</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a trendnet tew-432brp 54 mpbs wireless router configured with my desktop PC running Windows XP connected through LAN port.&nbsp;The trendnet router is running version 4.1&nbsp;firmware.&nbsp;The wi-fi interface used to work fine with other windows xp laptops. Now,
 when I tried to connect new HP DV6-6155TX (running 64-bit Windows 7 home basic OS) to the same trendnet router through wi-fi interface, the trendnet router continuously resets/reboots after every attempt. When I disable the wireless adapter in the laptop running
 Windows 7 64-bit OS, the wireless router stabilises and is able to connect to internet via the desktop PC. Could someone help to find out the right driver (either trendnet firmware upgrade) or the Windows 7 driver to support this trendnet router...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t see how to create a checkpoint using Restore</h2>
                    <p>In Windows XP I could create my own checkpoint using the Windows restore program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not see the capacity in Windows 7. Is that correct and if so why not. I like to have that</p>
<p>&nbsp;feature so when I make a change that does not work I'm able to use that checkpoint&nbsp; when things were</p>
<p>working right. Same goes when the system is working right and for some reason things do not work I'm</p>
<p>able to use the restore using&nbsp;(that previous checkpoint I created&nbsp;-the backup of the operating system) &nbsp;when things were working okay.</p>

Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using the default Mail App that comes pre-installed in Windows 8, there are several ways to select multiple Emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. You can select <strong>1 email</strong> and then press and hold the <strong>
Ctrl</strong> Key&nbsp;while you&nbsp;<strong>click the other emails</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. If the emails you want to select are in order, you can select a group of emails by
<strong>clicking the first email</strong> and then <strong>press and hold the Shift Key</strong> and click the
<strong>last email</strong> in the group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. If you want to select <strong>All emails</strong> in a folder, <strong>click any email in the folder</strong> and then press
<strong>Ctrl+A</strong> to <strong>select all</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you select the emails, you can press the <strong>Delete Key</strong> to remove all of the emails or
<strong>Right Click</strong> the <strong>selected emails</strong>,&nbsp;click the <strong>
Move</strong> Icon on the toolbar and then <strong>click the folder</strong> where you want to move the emails.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            &#34;Safely removing devices&#34; not working in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Good day, for some reason my "Safely remove device" on the task bar doesn't work or I'm not really sure. It works in my laptop though but in this PC it doesn't. When "safely remove" a device, the menu that usually pops up, doesn't show now. &nbsp;Here's a sample
 in a video that I recorded:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://youtu.be/5qmqaX5PX6A</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, all my drives are set on "Quick removal" in order to not lose any data that I have in my drives, but it's sometimes annoying cause I really want my drives to focus on performance more. I'm not really sure if it's just me cause I haven't found
 any on the internet yet and have just decided to post it here instead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If possible, I don't want to refresh my PC. Please help :)</p>

            Hi Raymond,<br />
<br />
I am having the exact same issue with my two hotmail accounts and received the same messages as xxxxxxxxxxx.<br />
<br />
Can you look at my accounts and find a solution too?<br />
<br />
One is *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and the other: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.<br />
<br />
My other hotmail account works fine.<br />
<br />
I am using the latest version of Windows Live Mail as I checked.<br />
<br />
I uninstalled and reinstalled WLM and Live Essentials but that didn't work.<br />
<br />
They used to work when I 'synced' them and had to do that every time I opened WLM but then it stopped working altogether<br />
<br />
Please help!<br />
<br />
If you suggest removing my account and reconfiguring after tweeking it, please explain how to do that so I can recover it as it was.<br />
<br />
Won't I lose all my folders if I delete it? I don't want that to happen as I have many folders.<br />
<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When i am on the internet i can send and work etc in it, but i also have it loaded on outlook and now it keeps bringin up the 4402 error message.<br />
<br />
I did send a whole lot of business emails which may have seemed like junk mail as the nature of my business is lingerie and adult accesories so maybe it is suspicious of something, but its all legit :)<br />
<br />
<br />
How do i reset my hotmail in microsoft outlook to go back to normal sendign and receiving then?<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

<h2>            Update KB3206632 won&#39;t install</h2>
                    <p>Hello there. &nbsp;I, too, am having trouble installing this update. &nbsp;The update tries, then reverses itself - with several restarts in between and the whole procedure of trying to install and undoing itself taking about 40 minutes or so. &nbsp;(And they said Windows
 10 was faster-booting than previous versions!) &nbsp;It is frustrating because this didn't happen until this so-called "cumulative" update was issued.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1"><strong><em>DEC. 30/16 - PLEASE READ BELOW AT THE END OF THIS THREAD - I FINALLY WENT TO MICROSOFT AND THEY FIXED IT FOR ME.</em></strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, and to no avail, I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Downloading from Microsoft (once) and running the update troubleshooter several times. &nbsp;It says it has repaired problems with the Windows Update Database being corrupted</li><li>Downloading (once) and running the update as a standalone directly from Microsoft with the internet turned on</li><li>Running the troubleshooter and then running the update with the internet turned off</li><li>Checking to see if I could defer this update. &nbsp;In my version of Windows 10, this does not show up as an option</li><li>Reading this forum to see what else I can do myself without too much problem as I am just an ordinary person and not a computer-savvy one. &nbsp;The more I read the more I know that I don't know anything</li></ul>
<p>So . . . . . . . I have made copies of my logs as suggested in previous posts about this error by moderator, Gerry, and here's the link to them:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>(this file has been deleted - it's not an issue any more)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This is indeed frustrating to me, as I am sure it is for the hundreds of other people experiencing this problem. &nbsp;I hope somebody can help solve this problem and tell Microsoft what it is so everybody can get this fixed. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Happy holidays for whatever your beliefs are this time of years, and thank you! &nbsp; &nbsp;

            <p>I really don't know how to mess with the startup types. If it DID happen, Microsoft's update fixit thing did it. &nbsp;If you think that's what happened, then that's what happened &nbsp;. . . . . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I was doing the scan, Windows again hijacked the computer and rebooted while I wasn’t looking.&nbsp; Another 40 minutes of the loop.&nbsp; Frustrating.&nbsp; Anyhow, this is what the scans found:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The other scan showed:</p>
<ul>
<li>No component corruption store detected.&nbsp; The operation completed successfully.&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>So I rebooted as instructed and ran the other log.&nbsp; It is in the folder to which the link has already been posted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not familiar with OneDrive, and think I deleted the other 2 logs, so I have run them again and they are also in the OneDrive file.</p>

            <p><span>Hello everybody and thank you for your interest in this question. &nbsp;I know there must be hundreds of you who are suffering from the same problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Yesterday I contacted Microsoft via their chat option (had to google it but I finally found it). &nbsp;I was told they were aware of this problem and were doing their best to fix it.&nbsp; First they ran scans then concluded that the update was "stuck". &nbsp;(I
 knew that already - that's what the problem was in the first place.) &nbsp;Doing that took about 2 hours.&nbsp; They ended up giving me a "patched" edition of Windows 10 and assured me it would be OK following the installation. &nbsp;When it finally finished loading and
 checked for updates (about 4 hours later), Windows was still trying to install the update so I had to contact them again. &nbsp;(I’m in for about 6 hours so far).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>They then gave me another download of Windows 10 (this took a couple of hours all told) which ran overnight. &nbsp;(I’m in for about 8 hours not counting me sleeping of time now).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;I contacted them again and they finished it up. Windows still needed to update but they assured me that the looping update wouldn't be an issue. &nbsp;All told it took about 10 hours of my time and a helluvalot of Microsoft tech time to fix my problem
 including 2 downloads of Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The first person who looked at it told me they were aware of this problem and are trying to solve it. &nbsp;The second and third person who looked at it told me they'd "fix it for free this time". &nbsp;I told them each that they SHOULD fix it for free seeing
 this problem stems from a cumulative update and the previous ones it replaced installed just fine for me. &nbsp;Both of them tried to sell me their fix-it plan for about $149USD a year (would you like fries with that?), to which I replied that if I had enough $$$
 that I'd simply buy another computer that WOULD run fine.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Anyway, thank you, Gerry and others, for trying to assist. &nbsp;As for everybody else, good luck.&nbsp; Perhaps you should contact Microsoft.</span></p>

                    <p><strong>Cannot add Microsoft account to more than one Windows 8 PC</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I made my work email into a Microsoft account and proceeded to add it to my Windows 8 PC, this was no problem but it was not until I tried to add the account to my Surface Pro I began to get the error message above:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You can't sign in to your PC right now. Go to account.live.com to fix the problem, or try the last password you used on this PC."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I proceeded to go to account.live.com but I could not find any reason for this to be happening, to try and&nbsp;figure out whether this was an issue with my Surface or an account issue I tried to add the same account to my Windows 8 laptop. This resulted in the
 exact same error message, I have run the Microsoft accounts trouble-shooter but this says my account is fine and I have deleted my synced settings from the cloud on skydrive.live.com but this made no difference either. I have also deleted and re-added the
 account from the Surface/ laptop, checked the local security policies on both devices &nbsp;and changed the password but none of these made any difference I continue to get the exact same error message when trying to add the account. Can anyone help me with this
 issue?</p>

<h2>            Surface Book Samsung drive not identified as SSD via a third party disk fragmentation software</h2>
                    <p>Re: Surface Book 256 with discrete graphics Model U3E1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed disk fragmentation software to use with external drives; not the main internal SSD drive. However, the software did not identify the internal drive as an SSD which concerns me for performance, manageability, and software compatibility reasons.
 When I then ran hardware specification software, it could not identify the interface, device type, firmware version, or any other key info that normally is displayed for any type of drive (hard, hybrid, SSD, etc). It is registered as not supporting SMART.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the driver or inf file is incomplete or incorrect. None of the software I use knows this drive is an SSD using NVMe interface. It clearly is a custom drive created for Microsoft since I can't find any info regarding this Samsung model: NVMe SAMSUNG
 MZFLV256</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop works very well overall despite a few initial issues as updates and new drivers were applied. I need to know if anyone else has seen this issue or if Microsoft is aware.</p>

            <p>A little late, but here is some information. Most likely, the defragmentation software you are using is not set up for NVMe drives yet. Looking though the Surface Pro 4, I see that the drive is a Samsung M.2 SSD. This is a very new type of storage device
 that uses PCI Expres lanes rather than a SATA controller like traditional drives. The advantage is that it is much much faster than SATA connected drives. Today's SSDs can saturate the SATA controller completely, meaning that the drive is faster than the physical
 connection can handle and so the bottleneck lies in using a connection meant for slow spinning hard drives with super fast &nbsp;flash storage. To alleviate this, M.2 uses up to 4 PCI Express lanes, and Intel Skylake processors (the generation of CPUs Microsoft
 uses in the SP4) actually have these 4 PCI-E lanes dedicated to the M.2 connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This gives you a few benefits - the CPU can talk directly to the SSD, bypassing any intermediary controllers or interfaces. The SSD has its own direct line and does not have to wait it's turn when delivering data. It also has many more lanes to deliver data
 on simultaneously. All of this adds up to huge advantages (current high speed SATA SSDs are very refined and can push 600Mbps, while M.2 drives are still young yet can push over 4x that).</p>
<p>
</p><p>TLDR; The surface pro 4 uses a new interface for its SSD that your defrag software probably cant handle yet - so it is defaulting to a basic disk hard drive. Windows 10 knows it is an SSD and handles it as such.</p>

                    <p>I have a Windows 10 Home system which was upgraded (after much trouble and about 20 attempts - the free upgrade just kept failing until one day to my surprise it worked) from Windows 7. The Windows 7 system was several years old, but bang up to date and

 Options in Settings/Updates it rather ominously tells me in red that "Some settings are managed by your organisation". Now this is a little bit ominous because I am the organisation! The system runs Windows Defender and Malwarebytes and they show no problems.
 This is a home PC with only myself as the user (although as well as me it also has an ASP.NET account defined which is password protected - heaven alone knows what the password is because I have never created this account - I can only assume this is some sort
 of hangover from the Windows 7 days. My own account is an administrator one).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned above I have tried all sorts of suggestions from various forums to try and get round this problem with no luck. I am now wondering whether the "settings managed by your organisation" issue mentioned above may be at the heart of my problem,
 so I was wondering if anyone has any idea on whether or how I can do a global reset of permissions such that I as the administrator get back global control of this machine - then perhaps the updates (including the Anniversary Update) would install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>

            <p>Far too little information provided...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Provide the Manufacturer and full model number of your device, so we can find out if Windows 10 drivers are being provided for your old device and, if so,&nbsp;their compatibility with the Anniversary Update.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Provide the Version and Build number currently running on your device. Your "Some settings are managed by your organization" indicates that, either, the device is currently registered in the Insider Program or you have been mucking around in the registry

            <p>That wasn't a very helpful reply was it. Not very polite either - I don't recognise "mucking about" as a technical term, obviously you have a high opinion of yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't go into all the details of the machine because my question was specifically about how to reset permissions in Windows 10 (any machine) rather than how to do the Anniversary upgrade on my specific machine&nbsp;- I have asked the question about doing the
 Anniversary upgrade to no avail in other entries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine is&nbsp;a Dell XPS **** and has been successfully running Windows 10 following the upgrade from Windows 7 offered by Microsoft. There doesn't appear to be any issue with device drivers since it is running Windows 10 successfully, albeit an old version
 - furthermore it does not spend long enough in the Anniversary Upgrade process (5 secs or so) for drivers to become an issue in my opinion. It passes all the tests done by the&nbsp;Windows 10 Anniversary upgrade preprocessing stage (and many months ago by the initial
 Windows 10 install, even though it would not initially complete the upgrade). The upgrade starts and then immediately terminates without an message - 2 automatic reboots are involved and then we're back at the starting position.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Winver says it is Windows 10 Ver 1511 Build 10586.633 (it is refusing to install the last 2 updates following this level).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible the machine did run an insider version although I'm very doubtful because of all the issues I had trying to get any Windows 10 upgrade done - I have used insider versions very successfully on a number of other machines but almost certainly
 not this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that some suggestions in forums are popular is unfortunately not an indication of their general effectiveness - some are complete rubbish. I haven't done a clean install on Windows 10 (I have no reason to believe&nbsp;it would not go straight through)
 because like some other folks I have a&nbsp;number of programs on this system which would be difficult to reinstall and&nbsp;I would rather not go through the hassle of doing that just now&nbsp;- I can manage well enough with that machine as it is for now if I have to although
 I would prefer to keep it up to date if only for security reasons. At some point in the future I can wipe it if that becomes necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having explained all that I would like to go back to my initial question which was about how to get round the "Some settings are managed by your organisation" message - any thoughts?</p>

            It is possible that an in-place upgrade would set the registry entries back to default, clearing the "Some settings are managed by your organization" message. However, it is probable that this will be stopped by the same error that is stopping the update.

Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers community forum.<br />
<br />
This error occurs when either of the following conditions is true:<br />
The Windows Boot Manager (Bootmgr) entry is not present in the Boot Configuration Data (BCD) store.<br />
The Boot\BCD file on the active partition is damaged or missing.<br />
To resolve this problem, use the following methods in the order in which they are presented.</p>
<p>Method 1: Repair the BCD store by using the Startup Repair option<br />

Click Repair your computer.<br />
Click the operating system that you want to repair, and then click Next. <br />
In the System Recovery Options dialog box, click Startup Repair.<br />
Restart the computer.</p>
<p>Method 2: Rebuild the BCD store by using the Bootrec.exe tool<br />

If the Bootrec.exe tool cannot locate any missing Windows installations, you must remove the BCD store, and</p>
<p>then you must re-create it. To do this, type the following commands in the order in which they are presented.</p>
<p>Press ENTER after each command.<br />
Bcdedit /export C:\BCD_Backup<br />
ren c:\boot\bcd bcd.old<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many reasons why Picasa Error Source Unavailable Destination Full happen, including having malware, spyware, or programs not installing properly. It scans and diagnoses, then repairs, your damaged PC with technology that not only fixes your Windows
 Operating System, but also reverses the damage already done with a full database of replacement files.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Let's try the below methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2: </span></span></strong><span><span><span>Perform a
</span><strong><span>clean boot</span></strong> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>to disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called Clean Boot.<br />

<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Note: </span></span></strong><span><span><span>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> A clean boo</span></span></span><span><span><span>t is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when

<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span><span>Install all the pending updates after logging in to Microsoft account and check.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> I would suggest you to <strong>run Microsoft security scanner</strong> to make sure that computer in not infected by malware.</span></span></p>

<h3> johnmaris  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t install .NET Framework 4.6.2 &#40;HRESULT 0x800f0922&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello and good day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My friends have asked me to download a software but it requires .NET Framework 4.6.2 and so I decided to install it. However I encountered a problem whereas after installation and it asking for a restart, Windows Update "fails and reverts the changes" back
 to the way it was before, therefore uninstalling 4.6.2 After 4 days of continuous search and download in Google to no avail, I've decided to install .NET Framework 4.6.1 thinking it's not working due to me "skipping" 1 version ahead. I was able to install
 it successfully and didn't ask for a restart but after that, I couldn't install .NET Framework 4.6.2 anymore. It gives me: "HRESULT 0x800f0922". I've been stuck to this problem for a week now, and I figured after so long of not being able to fix it myself,
 I'd ask here. Does anybody know a solution for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My windows update is up to date and I'm using Win8.1 64-bit. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-DISM</p>
<p>-Installing .NET during a Clean State Boot</p>
<p>-Installing it on Safe Mode</p>
<p>-Deleting some files</p>
<p>-Changing something from msservices</p>
<p>-Windows Update Troubleshooter/Diagnostic</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please note I made a System Restore Point before I did any of these so I guess it's safe to say my PC is still back on the way it was before all this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
