    <title>No sound coming from Xbox - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No sound coming from Xbox</h2>
                    
<p>I just got my xbox 4 weeks ago, and everything has been working fine since I got it. I have a Sony bravia 40" 1080p 60Hz HDTV. my xbox is connected to my TV through an HDMI cable and an HDMI audio adapter.</p>
<p>I turned my xbox on today. usually it takes maybe 2 seconds for my TV to recognize the signal coming from my Xbox and show the xbox start logo, but this time it took a good 20 seconds. when it finally did show up, the picture was 640x480, in a letterbox,
 much less than the normal 1080p i usually get out of it. I also noticed there was no sound. I went into the system settings and changed the picture back to 1920x1080. I then went into the audio options and tried turning it to digital stereo and then to the
 third option (I forget what its called) but no luck. I tried connecting my xbox to the TV through a different HDMI port, using a different HDMI cable altogether and then without the HDMI audio adapter, but still no sound. The picture, which I changed to 1920x1080,
 is still the same, though, but i don't actually think that its true 1080p, because usually it will say on the top of my TV in an info bar when I switch inputs something like "1920x1080, 1080p" and now it only says "1920x1080, 60Hz".
</p>
<p>I really dont know where to go from here. this is really strange because I cant remember any changes I have made to my setup or options that have caused this, it just seems to have come out of the blue.</p>
<p>Can anyone give me some advice on how to proceed next? I would really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>So after digging really deep, I found out that the Display Discovery feature that you guys have implemented into the Xbox is to blame. It, for whatever reason, switched my display over to DVI instead of HDMI. DVI cannot relay sound, so that's why I didn't
 hear anything. After turning off display discovery, I just needed to go back into display settings and change my resolution back to 1080p. Microsoft, please look into this issue. A few other people I have talked to have had the same problem, so while its not
 a big issue, it is definitely worth looking into for the next system update. </p>

            <p>A change was made to support that on the server side a couple months ago.&nbsp; So if you're running Spotlight on your lockscreen on current-ish versions of Windows 10 you should see that information.</p>

            Thank you for your reply, however I do not see any information on the Spotlight images&nbsp; - all I see are advertisements for your Groove Music, not a description of what the image is / where it was taken.

            <p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The images in Windows Spotlight are randomly pulled from Bing. To get the details about a particular Spotlight image, right-click it, and click
<strong>Properties</strong>. It should show you the image's description.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further information.</p>

            This solution doesn't work - when I start my computer,&nbsp;the Spotlight image is on the screen but you cannot right-click on it, because Windows is asking for my password.&nbsp; Once I enter my password, then the Spotlight image screen disappears.

            <p>Hi Scott - to see the lock screen image when you are signed in press the Win Key + L... Also check in the lock screen Settings&nbsp;that all extra&nbsp;items (such as tips etc.) are turned off.&nbsp;That may be why you are getting the unwanted ads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly you could try resetting your network. That can stop 'Spotlight' from running correctly. Go to settings - network and internet and at the foot of the page select 'reset network'. This takes a few minutes and you may need to check associated network
 devices (other pc's - media streaming) are accessible afterwards.</p>
<p>If (after a restart) you are still not receiving spotlight information the problem is most likely to be update related. Zachd touched on that in his reply. - Cheers, Ric.</p>

            I tried all of the suggestions you provided, to no avail - I don't have any problem seeing the Spotlight Image - my issue has been there's no description as to what the image is, and&nbsp;where it was taken.&nbsp; By example, today I have an image of a forest in
 the snow, but no description as to which forest it is / where the photo was taken - same with all the other Spotlight images - what are the images and where is the&nbsp;location&nbsp;that they were photographed?&nbsp; If Microsoft doesn't provide this information, then consider
 this as a suggestion that they should - to label each image with a description of what it is and where it was taken.&nbsp; Thank you.

            Ric, thanks for your reply - I recall when I first installed Win10 that I too received the descriptions, but no longer - I know my internet connection is wide-open and not throttled - I also see that the screen shot your sent me was from 3-months ago,
 unless you date is wrong in your computer.&nbsp; I've tried everything everyone has suggested and checked to see that I do have the latest update.&nbsp; Unless you or someone else has the obvious solution, I get it's not going to get resolved....

            <p>Yes that screenshot was taken on that date so that I had a point of reference to when I first started receiving the info (which was after a network reset - something I chanced upon when dealing with a completely unrelated issue). I agree - it seems there's
 no definitive solution. Zachd really knows a lot more than I do about this - perhaps in due course he can suggest something else, - or maybe it will just start up again after a monthly update. This has been reported by other users. &nbsp;Hope it reappears for you
 sometime... until then there's always the reverse image search tool as a fallback, which seems to have a fairly good hit rate. I'll include the link again here for ease of access.&nbsp; - R.</p>

            <p>I've had the same issue you are reporting. I noticed that the photo description stopped appearing from the moment I turn the PIN access ON. Just turn it OFF deleting your saved PIN and the description will show up again on the lock screen. Hit Windows+L
 to check. </p>
<p>I would really like Windows to fix this. The PIN access comes very handy but the photos are very nice and I'm always curious about their background.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So just to be clear you are only using the LTE CPE B593u-12 and no other router?</p>
<p>Could you access the LTE CPE B593u-12 and look at the WAN/Internet/4G/LTE connection and tell me if the ip address starts with 10 or 192 or 172?</p>
<p>Just to be clear this is the WAN ip address not the LAN ip address which will &nbsp;be 192.168.1.X</p>
<p>Please do not post the whole ip address just confirm the first few digits thanks</p>
        </p>

<p>It is, thank you :)</p>
<p>Unfortunately that confirms what I thought would be the case. Your Internet provider is using "private ip addressing" instead of "public ip addressing" this means that they are already NAT'ing within their network &nbsp;before the connection gets to you, then
 the router NAT's it again meaning a "double NAT"</p>
<p>There is nothing you can actually do yourself (config wise) to resolve this, you really need a "public ip address" from your ISP. Could you contact them to find out if they can supply a public ip address instead of the 10.****** address they are supplying?</p>

<p>[/quote]You can't get Infections accidentally, there are several steps you must take to enable them. So if you enter a lobby with these cheater you wont get infected, just leave and report them. Make sure to power off your console, as many of the infection
 lobbies will also be stats altering ones, and they can do that without any input from yourself.</p>

            This didn't help, still adding them and I'm up to 26 now. How the heck can I get rid of them, they won't stay disabled and can not be deleted.&nbsp; Great job, Microsoft.

<p><span>Dear all,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have finally solved the problem. There are two ways of solving it. I will explain both of them carefully.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>PROBLEM: After the update of the system, the screen is black, only the cursor can be seen, and also the wifi icon on the left part of the screen, appearing and disappearing.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>SOLUTION 1:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This solution works, I have tried it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You have to start the system from the scratch and install all of the updates proposed but one: KB3033055. But pay attention: this update is proposed two different times:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The first one, as a part of a very loooong list of updates; in this moment, it has to be accepted and installed, and no problem will happen.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt">
</p><p><span>Later, this update will be proposed in a short list of six optional updates. At this moment, you have to accept all the rest of the KBs, but not KB3033005. Since it is an option, you can simply skip it but not selecting it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After installing all the updates but KB3033055, you have to restart the system and try to find more updates, which can be installed with no risk. I’m writing this comments on February 27th, and every update prior to today is OK but KB3033055.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now my system is ready, steady, smooth and functioning. Everything runs perfectly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After updating everything but KB3033055, the system has 42 GB free (my table is a Surface RT 64 GB). Probably there will be more or less 15GB in Surfaces RT 32 GB.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Even though somebody stated that the February update solves the compatibility problem with KB3033055, I have tried to install KB3033055 AFTER February update and the black screen comes back again. Since I don’t need it, I won’t try it (maybe later,
 or in another life…!!).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>SOLUTION 2:</span></p>
<p><span>Maybe you don’t want to start the system from the scratch. Or maybe you did it and later, without paying attention, you did install KB3033055 and the black screen problem reappears.</span></p>
<p><span>This solution is inspired by the solution proposed by the user called <em>
timpeq</em> in this thread: </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfwinrt-surfupdate/surface-rt64-update-kb3033055/6f38b3b1-82ff-4ef0-bcfa-4416c8ccf79f</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">(Timpeq&nbsp;replied on&nbsp;February 13, 2018. I have not been able to follow his instructions (maybe you will), but some of them have been useful.)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You have to follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Turn off the Surface by pressing the on/off button for some fifteen or twenty seconds.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p></li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Once you are sure that the Surface is off, press the side button (reduce volumen), and, without releasing it, press the on/off button for one or two seconds. When the Surface logo appears, you have to release the volume button
 immediately.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p></li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The Surface will start in a safe mode, and the “Wait” message can be read after the Surface logo. If not, turn it off and start again the process.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p></li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Then, you have to go to the Command Promt (by this way: Troubleshoot, then Advanced, then Command Promt).</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p></li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The system will ask for the Bit Locker code. That code is a long code (8 numbers of 6 positions each, separated by “-“. Like xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxx, obviously each x is a number. If you don’t have
 the code, you can get it in this url:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Please, note that you have to login with your Microsoft ID and password to get your Bit Locker code.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p></li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Once you enter the Bit Locker code, you have to select your user (it will appear in your screen), and use your password.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p></li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The Command Prompt will appear (you know, the classic black window with the prompt letter, which in my Surface is: X:\&gt;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p></li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>You have to write this command. Do it VERY CAREFULLY, taking into account that even blanks are important.
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Even though you see it here in two lines, everything must be written in only one line, without any space between "remove-" and "package": ".../remove-package
 /packagename..."</span><span>:</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>X:\&gt;dism /image:c:\ /remove-package /packagename:Package_for_KB3033055~31bf3856ad364e35~arm~~6.3.1.19</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I don’t know if this command Works for all kind of Surfaces RT, but it is valid for Surface RT 64 GB.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Important: For typing ~ , you have to press AltGr + 4, and then spacebar.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Important: There is a blank space (spacebar) among \ and / in: “image:c:\ /remove-package”.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p></li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The Surface will uninstall KB3033055. Wait until the percentage of uninstalling is 100%. It will take some minutes. Be patient, it looks like nothing is happening when it arrives to 99,5%, but you have to wait. Don’t touch anything
 and don’t restart.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p></li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>After the uninstallation (when the porcentage gets to 100%), write “exit” and press enter:</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>X:\&gt;exit<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>[and press enter]</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p></li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>After that, you can continue with the start process. Your Surface will come back to life again. Like magic!!</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p></li></ol>
<p><span>I have tried both solutions on my SURFACE RT, and both of them work.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck.</span></p>

            Please try these steps and check after each step. If these don't work, let me know. I will provide further troubleshooting steps.
<br />
<br />A. Change Power Management setting for devices which can wake the computer
<br />Type cmd in Windows Start Search box &gt; Right click on cmd &gt; Run As Administrator &gt; Type following &amp; Enter: powercfg -devicequery wake_armed
<br />It will show the list of all devices which can possibly wake up your computer
<br />Now, you need to make a decision which all devices you want to make changes to to handle this problem
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager
<br />Locate a device from the above list say Keyboard
<br />Under Power Management tab &gt; Check the box next to Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power. If this already checked, uncheck it &gt; OK &gt; Check it again &gt; OK
<br />Do it for other also.
<br /> Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />B. Get int to the BIOS setting of your computer (For how to - Look up internet for your computer make and model)
<br />Resume from S3/S4/S5 by PS/2 Mouse should be enabled
<br />Resume from S3/S4/S5 by Keyboard should be any key
<br />
<br />There are three other actions which you can undertake
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />3. Perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repai...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

<p>I've had a similar problem since upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10, several years ago. In my case, when trying to wake the PC from sleep, the screen remains black and the computer shuts off and restarts. (It is possible the restarts happens because
 the PC is set in the BIOS to start upon sensing power.) </p>
<p>
</p><p>Having an older Dell desktop (~2010 Dell Studio XPS 9100; Intel X58, Tylersburg platform) combined with a current version of Windows 10 might be the problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over these years, I have tried everything mentioned above, and many other suggestions -- so far, nothing helped.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, using Hibernation is an alternative but, if I'm not mistaken, bringing the PC back from Hibernation takes far longer than sleep mode. I can't imagine I'm the only PC user (who used sleep mode for 25+ years) who is deeply disappointed that MS cannot
 figure out how to make this basic feature work under Windows 10 -- not even several years after it has been out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm willing to try whatever else you might offer. Thank you.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Scammed again&#63;</h2>
                    Ok on Jan 5 was my birthday and my family bought me a Microsoft gift card. I redeemed it the same day immediately , but&nbsp;I did not use it until around Jan 12-30. So when&nbsp;I did&nbsp;I bought Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 for the Xbox 360. Please keep
 in mind i was trying to buy it on the console itself but was only showing the demo and the addon so&nbsp;I was doing it on the app. When&nbsp;I bought it, it said play on Xbox one. I was very mad and looked like a kid who kept getting
<p>[<strong><em>Mod Removed-Profanity]</em></strong>. I tried to get a refund but the day after they emailed me with this&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey there Jay, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you are running into these problems with your purchase. I would advise that you go ahead and respond to the email that was sent out to you regarding the refund. Let them know what exactly happened to see if they can overturn their decision.
</p>
<p>Just be sure in future instances to pay closer attention to the game that you are purchasing. Usually when you are purchasing 360 games you will be redirected to the "Marketplace" instead of buying it through the Microsoft Store.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps. </p>

<h2>            windows 10 upgrade stuck at loading desktop</h2>
                    I just ran the upgrade to Windows 10 on my Surface Pro 1, logged in for the first time after the restarts, now stuck with desktop continuously reloading/flashing and nothing works except ctrl-alt-dlt but I haven't tried anything yet because I don't want
 to mess anything up. Is this a known issue and how do I get past it?

            <p>I had the same problem as well. &nbsp;HP Spectre x360 (supposedly a computer that was tailored to windows 10...go figure).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update hung for a bit at the "This is taking a bit longer than usual" screen. &nbsp;Then when it was finally done the desktop loaded, but the background was black. &nbsp;Nothing on the desktop could be clicked. &nbsp;Also, the desktop would continuously reload every
 few seconds. &nbsp;Ctrl+Alt+Delete worked and I was able to restart in Safe Mode (hold Shift as you click Restart).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer would not let me restore using a system image I had created (what good are system images anyway...the computer NEVER lets me use them like it is supposed to). &nbsp;So I had to resort to resetting the computer. &nbsp;I chose the option to reset the PC,
 but keep my files and apps. &nbsp;I hoped the computer would reset itself to the factory installed Windows 8.1, but it did not. &nbsp;Instead it reset itself back to the beginning of the Windows 10 installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time the installation went very fast, and did not even encounter the "things are taking longer than usual" screen at all. &nbsp;The desktop loaded just fine as well and was no longer black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know what went wrong the first time, and I have even less of a clue about why it worked during the reset. &nbsp;However if I had to guess I would say that there had to be either some sort of graphics driver issue, and/or perhaps Norton Internet Security
 was interferring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that while I do have my files from before the update, I no longer have Norton Internet Security or Microsoft Office installed on my PC. &nbsp;I had both of these before and the Windows 10 update FAQ said that they would remain installed after updating.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am quite sure that by "resetting" my PC in safe mode, I probably wiped out MS Office and Norton (the only two pieces of software I had installed). &nbsp;And since the Windows 10 update happened to work flawlessly the 2nd time around, I'm guessing Norton was
 screwing with it the first time.</p>

<h2>            How do I control Windows 8&#39;s access to the boot menu&#63;</h2>
                    I've set up my PC to dual boot Windows 7 and Windows 8 but 8 seems worse than previous versions in its cavalier attitude to rewriting the boot menu (BCD). On several occasions, it seems to have rewritten the boot selection to boot Windows 8 rather than
 the default of Windows 7 - it doesn't even stop and ask!. Is there an option to tell Windows to ask before changing the boot sequence? I am fed up with using EasyBCD to fix things!

            I'm quite happy with the text menu, After all, you only see it for a few seconds so I don't really see the point in having a graphical boot menu. In fact, I'd prefer it if Windows gave me a bit more information rather than hiding everything in (or behind)
 'pretty' graphical interfaces.
<div><br />
<div>Regarding my problem, it seems that when Windows 8 "encounters a problem" (without saying what it is), it then "attempts to fix it" by making itself the default boot menu option and suppressing the prompt so there's no time to choose another option. Hitting
 F8 during POST will bring up the text menu, but I'd still like to know if there's some way to tell Windows 8 not to do this as it doesn't do anything to fix a startup problem.</div>
<div><br />

            <p>I also found that once Windows 8 has booted up, clicking Restart from the 'power button' on the login page with SHIFT held down will boot into the graphical startup options menu where I can check the startup settings. It's also available under the advanced

            <p>What annoys me is that after almost every windows update or if I run&nbsp;Windows 7 for a while&nbsp;I get almost the same sequence when Windows 8 goes to restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. PC attempts to restart going straight to Windows 8 boot (Windows&nbsp; 8 icon)</p>
<p>2. "Your PC ran into a problem..." either PROCESS1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED or IO1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED - rarely KERNEL_INPAGE_ERROT.</p>
<p>3. PC reboots. Sometimes offers the text startup menu; since I'm trying to get back to Windows 8 I select that.</p>
<p>4. "Your PC ran into a problem..." as before.</p>
<p>5. PC reboots. If given a choice, I select windows 8.</p>
<p>6. PC displays&nbsp;Goldfish icon that&nbsp;was used with the Consumer Preview, then puts the blue Windows icon on top of it. Displays "Diagnosing your PC"</p>
<p>7. Displays "Attempting repairs" - this can take up to half an hour!</p>
<p>8. PC reboots, briefly displays Windows icon, then displays a blue screen offering to do a system restore. I choose not to do this.</p>
<p>9. I finally get the&nbsp;graphics startup&nbsp;options menu and choose "Boot another operating system"</p>
<p>10. The choices are Windows&nbsp;7 or Windows 8 so I choose Windows 8.</p>
<p>11. Windows 8 boots, apparently normally. After login, it asks if I want to send details of the problem to Microsoft, so I do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I'd like is more detailed information of what it's looking at when it's "Diagnosing your PC" and what it's trying to do when "Attempting repairs".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dual boot set up has Windows 7 on disk 0 and Windows 8 on disk 1. When Windows 8 installed it apparently failed to set up the boot menu (which I fixed with EasyBCD). Of course, what I can't tell is whether Windows 8 wrote a boot record to disk 1 and 'sometimes'
 uses that boot code and hence gets confused.</p>

            <p>Hi Derek,</p>
<p>If you would tell if your Win7 and Win8 installations are UEFI/GPT or BIOS/MBR I could point to some documents on Windows boot sequence and other topics so you would have a better understanding what is going on until OS is up and running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usually Windows boots from first hard disk - boot related files for Vista and later are:</p>
<p>1. boot manager (\bootmgr)</p>
<p>2. \boot folder with BCD inside</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a Win 8/Win 7 dual-boot setup it is always Windows 8 bootmgr which is in control.</p>
<p>Windows 7 boot manager cannot boot Windows 8.</p>

<p>Avoid&nbsp;using EasyBCD v2.2, hopefully they will update the utility to work correctly with Windows 8 BCD store.&nbsp; Just use the built in BCDEdit feature of either Windows 7 or 8 to switch between graphical or legacy boot modes.&nbsp; I caused my own problem by using

            This is a BIOS/MBR setup. I'm not sure the PC supports UEFI.
<div><br />
<div>If you look at my profile you'll see I've worked in IT for nearly 30 years so have a pretty good understanding of how he boot sequence used to work. The trouble I find with Windows 8 is that in continues the Microsoft trend of hiding information. What
 I'd like to see is a log of information regarding the boot up which records the point at which it fails and I'd rather not have to analyze a dump file to get it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you can point me at the right documents I'd be interested in taking a look.</div>

            <p>I am afraid there are no Microsoft documents regarding boot and startup you would not know being so long in IT.</p>
<p>On boot problems I always used boot logging to show last module loaded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that in Windows 8 Microsoft&nbsp;has implemented automatic repairs&nbsp;of startup&nbsp;errors.</p>
<p>There are&nbsp;other paths to go - you boot recovery DVD/USB and do manual fixing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usually last installed software is the cause of problems if you have not altered system&nbsp;registries or system files.</p>

            Hi Ghyde1 , what application were you using to unzip rar files?
<br />
<br />For some reason your Windows has set a file association with Internet Explorer
<br />
<br />To reset the file association, right click a rar files, choose Open With - choose another app, check the box marked 'Always use this app to open rar files'
<br />
<br />Then if you cannot see the old app you used to open rar files, click 'More apps'
<br />
<br />Again check the list, if it still does not appear, click 'Find another app on this PC' and,navigate to find the app

    <title>How do I &#34;promote&#34; my child to an adult&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kewldawg  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I &#34;promote&#34; my child to an adult&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My child just turned 18 a few weeks ago, and is now away at college.&nbsp;&nbsp; I noticed that under my Family, he is still shown as a Child.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I "promote" him to an Adult?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is for Windows 10, and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NOT X-box</span> (I see many answers for X-box, and only X-box).&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Article posted on how to do this, is in error (not kept updated?).&nbsp; I mean, the Article refers me to "Security &amp; Privacy" ... "Manage my child's account permission" (from in account.live.com), but when I go there on the website, the
<strong>ONLY</strong> option offered in "Manage my child's account permission", is to forward me over to the "View your family settings" page, and there is no "Edit" option offered for my child on that page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can't be all that of an unusual request.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why isn't there a simple "click-here" to turn any Child account into an Adult account?&nbsp;&nbsp; As the adult owner of the family, I should be able to do just that.</p>

            <p>No I haven't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you mean the solution is to completely delete his Child account, and create a totally new Adult account for him?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess that makes sense, but honestly, I though there might be a way to keep his account (settings, options, password, etc), but simply "promote" him.&nbsp; Or that Microsoft would automatically promote him from Child to Adult based simply on his age (which
 is one of the pieces of info collected with the Microsoft account).</p>

<p>This is a borderline troll reply. &nbsp;This is not a nit-picky philosophical conversation so the response in that vein is irrelevant and only possibly serves to start an argument. And the technical "answer" offered here plainly ignores the original question
 and everything clearly stated to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OP is exactly correct to expect what he is asking, if one bothers to understand what is being asked, which (once again) is "how to promote" someone's account so it becomes unrestricted -- as an adult (determined by date, as everyone recognizes) -- but
 still part of the family. &nbsp;Removal is an obvious option that has been previously discussed and discounted as not part of this query because it doesn't fulfill the criteria of keeping the account in the family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People who do not want to contribute to, or learn from, the solution can move along because there's nothing else to see here.</p>

<p>OK, @srfreeman, now we might finally be getting somewhere. &nbsp;I'm sorry for misjudging you, I didn't realize that you may actually know how it operates, but you might also want to work on your cold open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll break up the following text across 3 posts for readability (if that helps anyone wade through this in-depth discussion) ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1/3:</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your response, it looks like we can agree that the implicit goals in this vein are/have been to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) obtain the how-tos for the original question<br />
</p>
<p>2) failing #1 (e.g., if that direction is simply not possible right now), obtain the correct how-to for an alternative that gets as close to the original intent as possible</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) also failing #1, gain the following:</p>
<p>3a) an understanding how the program operates (such info has been poorly lacking up to this point), including what we lose in settling for #2 over #1, *and* an understanding for what the truth of the program does actually allow for, instead of what's been
 previously assumed</p>
<p>3b) an explanation re: why the program does not allow for #1 ... this is the "why does this work the way I want it to?" question.</p>
<p>This is also important. Since the implementation apparently doesn't match either desired usage and/or common-thought on the make-up of families, knowing "why" diffuses some frustration and may prevent some from defecting to other products who define things
 closer to desires/common-thought, a.k.a., this aids in determining who has their "stuff" straight here)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; --- e.g., one of the things I don't want to hear is that MS implemented a broad identity &amp; security solution (i.e., Family) across multiple platforms (Win10, Xboxes, websites) in a distributed/non-centralized manner where in which exact platform
 "XYZ" is changed/created actually matters and causes different reactions elsewhere ... and, if so, that MS has no plans to fix such a mess. &nbsp;I mean, I want the truth, but I also hope they aren't that dim.</p>
<p><br />
4) potentially requesting changes to the program, after #3 is considered against the new frame of reference and subsequent forecasted usage (and thanks for the suggestion on where that might happen)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think we agree so far, that all of this has been largely unspoken but still wrapped up into this thread, right? ...</p>

            2/3:<br />
<br />
Now, I don't know if an "Insider" is an authoritative source for determining that #1 (original question) has failed (and I'm not inclined to let go of #1 until it has clearly failed). &nbsp;I note that the OP is also an Insider and still asked the question, so that's
 probably not a determining factor. &nbsp;But, for the sake of argument -- until someone with a "Microsoft" tag comes along here -- @srfreeman, I will consider that your latest post may be authoritative on this matter. That means, we are to understand that the only
 2 concepts in the MS Family structure is "parent" and "child."<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this parent/child only concept doesn't jibe with some things I've seen leading to my finding this thread. &nbsp;For example, I've seen questions where users claim they have, say, 4 adults in the same Microsoft Family. &nbsp;If the concept is only parents
 (limit 2?) and children, then how could they be doing this? &nbsp;And also places that a MS responder posted a link that clearly contains wording to "promote" a child up -- while the links don't work anymore, it seems that it did at one time. This could be just
 a linking issue and it is still possible, or not, if the current supposition is true. &nbsp;All of this just introduces doubt that the strict parent/child concept being offered here as fact is 100% true.<br />
<br />
Still, if I assume this offered binary to be true for now, that opens up a can of worms that may lead to #4 (a change request). &nbsp;Part of the source of this query/problem/frustration is that users out here like us recognized that families are not only made up
 strictly of "parents" and "non-adult children." &nbsp;Obviously, there are "adult children," such as this thread's example. And there may be other adult family members in the house, such as my mother (adult non-child to me) or maybe my 23yo autistic brother who
 lives with us and games but can't handle seeing violence. &nbsp;So what folks like the OP and myself are trying to do going-in without program knowledge is map a family made up of "adults" (who need no restrictions) and "other-than-full-adults" (who may need varying
 levels of monitoring/restrictions), against what is now ostensibly implemented only as "parents" and "non-adult children" -- and if you are neither, you are out of the family (according to MS).<br />

<h3> kathryngowka-weiss  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 Anniversary update software exception eaccess violation</h2>
                    I use an older software CAD, which worked with XP-SP3.&nbsp; I was able to use it with Win 8, 8.1 and 10.&nbsp; But, with this recent Anniversary Update, as it opens,&nbsp; a message regarding "Exception EAccess Violation in module (software exe file) @ 0016004C, etc."&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I tried the troubleshooting to make changes for XP-SP3, and even with Win8, and running it as Administrator.&nbsp; I'm out of ideas as to what to do.&nbsp; I even installed the latest WDK- Windows Driver Kit.&nbsp; I've re-booted several times.&nbsp; Still no luck.&nbsp; Any ideas?<br />

            I tried the clean boot, before I saw your reply, and several other methods.&nbsp; I decided to just revert to the pre-Anniversary version of Windows10, since it was less than 10 days old.&nbsp; I need the software program more than I need the Anniversary version.&nbsp;
 Everything works just fine now, as it did before the Anniversary update.&nbsp; Since the software is very old, I could not find a driver that would help.<br />

            <p>I was hoping you would tell me how to mark it "metered," but&nbsp; I did research it.&nbsp; It won't work for me, because I do not use this laptop with WiFi.&nbsp; It has a "hard" cable connection to the modem.&nbsp; And there is no "metered" option for a cable connection that
 I could find.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 DisplaySwitch &#40;PC Project&#41; incorrect outputs for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> son9ne  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 DisplaySwitch &#40;PC Project&#41; incorrect outputs for multi-monitor setup</h2>
                    <p>I have a dual boot setup with 3 monitors so this issue is a bit more limited. Windows is a gaming OS only so I may just have to deal with this limitation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me first specify that this issue did not persist on Windows 7. This is unique to Windows 10 only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When using Winkey + p to select an projection type, I am presented with the options:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>PC screen only</li><li>Duplicate</li><li>Extend</li><li>Second screen only</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>This is expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My issue is when I want to switch to a single monitor (<em>PC screen only</em>). For some reason, Windows 10 has reversed the order of my outputs so what is identified as the primary output (not to be confused with the
<em>main display</em> option in display setting, this has nothing to do with that) this is now my 3rd monitor. This is problematic because my 3rd monitor is in Portrait mode so this really is a pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So when I select<em> Second screen only</em>, I am then put on my 2nd monitor, which is off to the side. With 32" monitors, this starts to hurt my neck when I use that option. Plus it's not correct and is just a work-a-round and not a valid solution IMHO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a Windows 10 issue and is not a graphics card issue. This worked just fine on Windows 7 and in Windows 10, Nvidia Control Panel shows the correct order and number for each monitor. (1 is my primary and 3 is my 3rd monitor which is portrait), my POST
 screen is also on the correct monitor, and Linux is identifying the monitors properly... This pretty much concludes that Windows 10 is the issue here and I don't think there is much to defend this.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Are there any options to reprogram which&nbsp;project option goes to which monitor? In any other OS the order is correct. Windows 10 has it backwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this issue with Windows 10 so that I can select&nbsp;<em>PC screen only&nbsp;</em>and have it be the correct monitor?&nbsp; I think Microsoft needs to push a bug fix for this&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's&nbsp;<span>SoN9ne, not sure why Windows wants to cute the name off... even in the OS... very annoying.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span>Your response is not what I am referring to.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue has to do with what Windows is calling "PC Project" this is why I provided the details I did above. This has nothing to do with arranging my monitor setup. I am very clear on how to setup my monitors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your attempt to resolve my issue but your response has nothing to do with what I reported. 2 completely different things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I explained how PC Project does not work properly and that the ID of the monitors has changed in Windows 10 since 7 (reverse order). This ID has nothing to do with my monitor setup. Windows is recognizing my primary display, that my BIOS recognizes properly,
 as monitor ID 3. This is relevant due to PC Project which is using these IDs to "Project" to the correct monitor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>e.g.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>If I select&nbsp;<span>PC screen only, this would only have monitor 1 active</span></li><li>If I select Second screen only, then monitor 2 and maybe 3 would be active and Monitor 1 is not</li><li>Extend will allow all monitors to behave as normal</li><li>Duplicate mirrors the display of monitor 1</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is that since Windows 10 recognizes the primary monitor as Monitor 3 (Win7 recognizes it properly as 1) then when I select&nbsp;<span>PC screen only, the incorrect monitor is in use.</span></p>
<p>Given that my 3rd monitor is in portrait mode (Win10 identifies it as monitor 1) when I select&nbsp;<span>PC screen only then I am on the portrait monitor and NOT my main monitor. This all worked on Windows 7 with no issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before the suggestion even gets made, to simply re-order my monitors from where they are plugged in on the graphics card is NOT a proper fix. This issue is a Windows 10 issue and should be addressed properly by Microsoft.
 BIOS recognizes the proper monitors, Linux identifies&nbsp;the proper monitors. WIndows 7 identified the proper monitors. Windows 10 does not. I'll just add this to the myriad&nbsp;reasons Windows 10 is a horrible OS.</span></p>

    <title>Sobre Far Cry 4 &#40;post recreativo&#41; Vers&#38;&#35;227&#59;o X360 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> agarius  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sobre Far Cry 4 &#40;post recreativo&#41; Vers&#38;&#35;227&#59;o X360</h2>
                    
<p>Eu confesso que para mim, jogar video games é uma forma de me divertir mais eficaz do que assistir filmes, fugir um pouco da realidade e fazer coisas que no mundo real eu não teria coragem ou dinheiro para fazer; caçar Animais Selvagens com Arco e Flecha
 e me tornar um Libertador de um Povo Cativo é uma dessas coisas... haha<br />
<br />
Pois bem, finalmente pude colocar as mãos em Far Cry 4. Após ótimas horas, dias e até meses jogando Far Cry 3 e completando todas as conquistas, eis que conheço o sucessor de tamanho e igual sucesso.<br />
<br />
Minha versão é de Xbox 360 e ainda me custa acreditar que o console está aguentando rodar isso. Quantos detalhes, que vegetação! Que vastidão! Quantos animais espreitam e quantas coisas acontecem aleatórias enquanto vaga pelo mundo. A princípio, o mapa parece
 ser do mesmo tamanho do FC3, mas quando se libera os mapas que revelam os colecionáveis e as missões paralelas, é melhor segurar o queixo... são centenas de coisas para se fazer!<br />
<br />
Comecei a jogar ele no sábado passado e não cheguei nem nos 35% do jogo e olha que estou jogando todos os dias e fazendo tudo que me aparece no mapa.&nbsp;<br />
Outra vantagem também é o fato de agora você poder jogar em modo coop com um amigo. Com exceção das histórias principais, todo o resto pode ser feito em dupla, o que torna o jogo ainda mais divertido.<br />
<br />
Sinceramente, recomendo para aqueles que ainda tinham dúvidas, pois é de fato um excelente jogo para se gastar muitas horas. Além do que, invadir uma base inimiga montado em um Elefante e Atirando com lança-granadas não tem igual! :D<br />
<br />
Ponto Positivo:<br />
Gráficos excelentes para X360, mas ajuda mais se instalar o jogo na HD para diminuir o tempo de renderização.<br />
Excelente dublagem e tradução de textos.<br />
Quantidade incrível de tarefas para passar o tempo.<br />
Variedade em veículos, métodos de exploração (você pode explorar nadando, andando, correndo, com veículos terrestres, aéreos, marítimos, voando com wingsuit e até com escalada) e eventos aleatórios (desde briga entre dois tigres até um Rinoceronte invadindo
 um vilarejo e tocando o terror).<br />
<br />
Ponto Negativo: <br />
Os diálogos de muitos NPC's se repetem cansavelmente, principalmente do locutor da Rádio Kyrat Livre (rádio local que toca em veículos) e alguns transeuntes não chegam a completar sua "historia" já emendando em outra.<br />
É muito fácil conseguir todo o dinheiro possível para comprar cerca de 80% das armas em menos de 10 horas de jogo.<br />
A trilha sonora em alguns momentos atrapalha ao ouvir os sons do jogo.<br />
Devido a vastidão do jogo, os loading são bem demorados, em alguns casos um pouco mais de 1 minuto.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>Pois é cara Far Cry 4 é super épico, na época que ele foi anunciado que estava em produção no começo de 2014, eu logo cancelei minha compra do 3 e fiquei na espera do 4 muito ansioso! foi falado que ele não seria uma sequência direta do 3, então fiquei mais
 confiante ainda</p>
<p>Mas apesar de ele ter cenários hipnotizantes, acho que ele teve bastante erros em questão de polimento. Nas versões da Old gen, se você subir com o Teco Teco as árvores viram papel olhando lá de cima, isso tenho que confessar ficou um pouco... né tosco
</p>
<p>O enredo dele é muito inferior ao do 3, é muito simples a história, mas em compensação ao vilão carismático que o jogo tem, isso vai sendo deixado de lado com o tempo
</p>
<p>Pra ser sincero, não consegui acreditar como não deixaram ele como pelo menos um dos candidatos ao jogo do ano de 2014, deixaram até Hearthstone mas não deixaram ele! kkkk mas pelo menos ele foi melhor shooter do ano, menos mal</p>
<p>Muitos reclamaram na época, muitos criticam inclusive pelo fato dele não ser inovador e parecer mais um Far Cry 3.5, de fato, ele realmente é muito parecido com Far Cry 3 com algumas exceções claro, mas Far Cry é uma franquia tão boa que um jogo assim não
 iria simplesmente acabar com a série, essa série é uma dos melhores FPS atualmente</p>
<p>Far Cry 4 é um ótimo game apesar de ter seus defeitos, cenários, trilha sonora, vilão super carismático a p0rra do jogo inteiro eu nunca tive coragem de matar ele, sério, cara realmente é muito carisma ehahueheau
</p>
<p>O personagem que controlamos (Ajay Ghale) é uma vítima do jogo inteiro e é obrigado a fazer tudo o que pedem pra ele, se isso é ruim ou não.. hmm considerando o final que nos proporcionou.. você verá que valerá a pena fazer tudo o que pedem, ou não</p>
<p>10/10 - GG bom jogo</p>

<p>Entre 3 e 4 ainda prefiro o 3, a história é muito mais épica e a jogabilidade de ambos é praticamente a mesma. Uma coisa que eu mais gostei do 4 foram os grapples espalhados pelo mapa, infelizmente não tem em todo lugar, mas tem bastante, e ficar balançando
 nessa bagaça é muito legal, principalmente em coop que é possível fazer isso voando. Eu estava buscando platinar ele, cheguei a ficar no 950G até que veio a DLC do Yetis e mudou de 1000G pra 1250, então nem fui em busca dos 50 faltantes, não pretendia comprar
 a DLC mesmo. Tirando isso, que é comum em jogos da Ubi, (com W_D foi a mesma coisa, cheguei nos 1000G e veio DLC..) o jogo é ótimo, mas não é bom pra quem procura uma boa história.</p>
<p>Só uma observação: O jogo é a mesma coisa na nova geração, tirando umas texturas mais bonitas, não deixa de ser o mesmo jogo, então o post é válido pra qualquer versão xD</p>

<p>Em questão de história, realmente o Far Cry 3 é de brilhar os olhos, poderia ser &nbsp;o roteiro de um filme facinho. Já o 4 nos prende muito mais pela exploração e pelo terror que dá pra fazer hahah Cara, ontem joguei algumas tarefas em modo coop com um amigo
 e foi muito bom, invadirmos uma fortaleza do De Pleur no modo Difícil com aquele "mini-helicóptero" e flechas flamejantes, depois saltamos com o Wingsuit e começamos a usar lança granadas e metralhadoras-leves. De Pleur enviou Helicópteros fortemente armados
 e virou o caos. Foi Épico demais. O jogo é muito divertido, mas de fato, como o Leonardo disse, o Far Cry 5 precisa mudar a fórmula. Se contarmos, esse lance de "salvador" de um povo já está presente no Far Cry 3, Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon (outro excelente título
 para quem tem mais de 25 anos) e agora no Far Cry 4.</p>
<p>Seria interessante voltar o jogo para um modo mais survival, e chocante: Algo do tipo "Uma garota (a protagonista) é sequestrada e levada para um país distante da Europa para ser prostituída; ela consegue fugir do cativeiro e agora precisa encontrar o dono
 de todo um negócio envolvendo comercio de mulheres e venda de órgãos, para se vingar.</p>

<p>Acho que comprarei o FarCry 4 então! </p>
<p>O negócio é se divertir e tocar o terror mesmo... </p>
<p>Não conheço grande parte dos jogos e sagas, e ainda estou me habituando com o Xbox.
</p>
<p>Se tiver outros jogos que são essenciais, clássicos, épicos, manda aí que quero ir atrás.</p>
<p>Consigo tirar várias dúvidas com vocês por esse fórum...</p>
<p>Obrigado, galera!</p>
