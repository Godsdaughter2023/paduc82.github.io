<h2>            Windows 7 - How to perform an incremental back-up</h2>
                    I posed a question yesterday wanting to know about performing an incremental back-up with Windows 7 and received the reply “Try scheduled tasks and write a copying script” which seemed helpful at the time but I am a novice and was unsuccessful.<span>&nbsp;</span>
 If someone could please provide me with a Step-by-Step on how to perform an incremental back-up with Windows 7 it would be greatly appreciated.<span>&nbsp;</span> Thank you!
<p>This is what I wrote yesterday:<span>&nbsp; </span>As a photographer I need to constantly back up my photo files.&nbsp; With Windows7, when I perform an incremental back-up from the source drive to the back-up drive an error message pops up stating “there is not enough
 disk space” to perform the action.&nbsp; Previously, I had WindowsXP and was able to perform an incremental back-up by using the “skip over” option and not just “overwrite all of the files” option.&nbsp; Does Windows7 have a “skip over” option when backing up?&nbsp; Please
 inform me on how to perform incrementally back-ups with Window7 with the issues I am having.&nbsp; Thank you!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>If I am going to delete the old backups will I miss some of my files?? Because my original backup says 120 GB and next backup says 15 GB, is that means I will have 15 left once I delete the old backup.. When the full backup will be taken after

<p>How often are you backing up? How often are you performing a full backup versus the incremental backups? What is the size of the storage you are performing the backup to?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on how often you perform the backups, I would perform a full back up once a week / month (depending on incremental frequency and storage limitations). Once you perform the next FULL backup you can delete all old full and incremental backups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you delete the full back up and leave only the incremental backups you will not be able to restore the full data. The incremental backup only backs up data that has been changed since the last full backup.</p>

            I do not find Windows 7 Backup intuitive, there is inadequate information provided to allow me to understand the process and control what is happening and the scheduler is missing some obvious options that would be helpful.
<div><br />
<div>For example, Widows 7 backup 'documentation' provides the following statement: "<span>&nbsp;Backup will create a new, full backup for you
 automatically when needed.</span>" &nbsp;What does this mean? &nbsp;"when needed"? &nbsp;I would prefer to have an explanation of the design of the backup routines describing when/under what circumstances a full backup will be taken, rather than the&nbsp;uninformative&nbsp;"trust
 me, you don't need to know" statement provided by Microsoft. &nbsp;Please advise what "when needed" means - we are intelligent people, we like to know what is going on and what you think is appropriate for us (and would prefer options to control this ourselves).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Will the backup work in the background backing up (incrementally), all changed files, even when I'm using the PC? &nbsp;What about the files which have changed but I have open/am using at the point the backup commences?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Next, I have set up a daily scheduled backup. &nbsp;On testing, this appears to work only when my PC is running and has not gone into sleep mode. &nbsp;But I cannot be certain that I will have my PC running at the moment I have chosen to backup 9a set time each
 day). &nbsp;And if I leave my PC for 10 minutes and it (correctly), goes into sleep mode, then it won't backup! &nbsp;So I have to either be using the PC moments before or at the exact time my backup is scheduled to start - then I don't know if the files I have open
 will be backed up (previous question).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Of course I can choose &nbsp;"Backup now", say at each time I switch on my PC or each time I switch it off but there are reasons why these are commonly inconvenient times for many users because you either want to get something done (why you turned on the PC
 in the first place and we don't know if a backup will be successful&nbsp;if you have files open), or you are about to rush out with the laptop, so don't want to wait for the backup to run/complete before shutting down. &nbsp;So the option appears only to be to remember
 to run "Backup now" at some convenient point when you know you won't need the PC for a period of time. &nbsp;But the whole reason for having a scheduler is to ensure regular backups are taken and you don't have to rely on your memory to protect your valuable data.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Additionally, when I chose "Backup now", it did a FULL backup, not just an incremental backup. &nbsp;So if I choose to "Backup now" at a time convenient to me, when I know my PC will not be in sleep mode or when I don't actually need to be using it, then it
 will both take longer and will quickly fill up my backup disk if it takes a FULL backup each time I initiate (daily), the manual request.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Perhaps the options of "Backup on turning on the PC" and "Backup on requesting to shut down the PC" BOTH with an option to override and say "not this time" should be added to the scheduler options? &nbsp;Perhaps a "Do you want to backup now" prompt should be
 offered every time you switch on or prepare to shut down your PC IF you have set an automated backup schedule and a backup has not been&nbsp;successfully&nbsp;taken in the 'period' (day/week/month, depending on the frequency you have selected)?</div>
<div><br />
<div>All these options should be INCREMENTAL backups with some PROPER ADVICE as to when (time/appropriateness), we should create a new full backup and start the incremental process again (not a Microsoft "we know better than you, trust me, its time to do a
 full backup" only offer). &nbsp;And when the advice is provided that its time/appropriate to take a new full backup, the user should have the option to override the suggestion if they feel they don't have time to allow a full backup to run, whereupon they will
 be continually provided with the reminder/advice at switch-on /shut down until they choose the full backup option.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Providing more information, more options and more user control is really not difficult - many backup programmes do all these things already. &nbsp;Come on Microsoft, lets have a better backup programme with more options and user control, or at least more information
 on how the current backup actually works.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;Thanks</div>

            You are of course right. &nbsp;Window7 is quite good but the backup program medieval. &nbsp;Microsoft hopefully can do better, if not they don't deserve our business.
<div><br />
<div>I own a Mac and a recently purchased windows 7 computer. &nbsp;I'm quite pleased with the PC but find the backup as you note dysfunctional and unintuitive.</div>

            The program does do backups, and I have yet to restore a file, thank god. &nbsp;However, since I alternate between two USB network disks, I never know how the original base files and the incremental files are managed. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I have read all the available online forums and blogs on it, and have come to believe that each backup SET is independent of the other SETs. &nbsp;I.e, If I just leave the last SET and delete all the previous ones, I am still in possession of a fully functional
 set of backup files. &nbsp;Can anyone confirm that?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Which leads me to my next question: &nbsp;When I change disks weekly, does the backup deem necessary to do full backups or does it still do incremental ones, and how does that work, as SteveSE19 points out?</div>

            Yes - it should not take 10 hours to do a back-up like it took me last night.&nbsp; There is also the factor of getting incremental back-ups only via the scheduled ones, assuming that is the only way to do them incrementally.&nbsp; Not only does your computer need
 to be on at those times, the external drive used to back-up needs to be connected - which negates the practice of having THAT in a different location.<br />

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>As a first step of troubleshooting, I would suggest you to check the updates history to see if there are any updates that have a failed status
 and let me know the description of those updates. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Step 1: Check the update history</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/See-which-Windows-updates-are-installed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/See-which-Windows-updates-are-installed</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Let me know if the description of the updates that have failed status.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Step 2: Manually try installing the updates from Microsoft Download Center</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to the Microsoft download website, type the "KB" number of the update into the download search box, and then click Go.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the list of search results, click the Knowledge Base (KB) article link to go to the download page. If there's more than one
 listing, look for a link that goes to the Microsoft Download Center.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there are multiple versions on the download page, find the appropriate one for your computer. Click the Download button, and
 save the update to your desktop.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When prompted, click&nbsp;&nbsp; Open to install the update.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Step 3: Run Windows Update Troubleshooter</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Step 4: The update is not installed successfully, you receive a message, and the computer restarts when you try to install an update in Windows
 Vista and Windows 7</span></span></span></p>

            Thanks that worked for me although I did not need to go to the Microsoft download website.&nbsp; I checked the update history and there were a few that had failed to update.&nbsp; It said there that there were updates waited to be downloaded so I clicked on that
 and then selected the updates clicked down the bottom. I think it may have said next or download now.&nbsp; It took me back to the update page where I selected to update.&nbsp; That fixed the problem.&nbsp; I did them one at a time incase there was a particular one that
 was causing problems but they all updated fine and my computer restarted normally

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />Regarding the issue, I would like to let you know that controlling Windows updates is somewhat difficult in Windows 10, but you can see the options here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />If you have Windows 10 Pro , Methods 4 and 5 are the best way to resolve this as Windows would always ask you to before downloading updates.
<br />Note: This is a non-Microsoft website. The page appears to be providing accurate, safe information. Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.
<br />
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

            Please note, Microsoft's approach to updates is very different that earlier releases. They are basically mandatory because of Microsoft's past history with customers sometimes failing to install important updates.
<br />
<br />See options for managing how and when Windows Updates are installed.
<br />
<br />Option 1:
<br />
<br />Set your Internet connection as metered:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows-10-data-usage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Use Active Hours and Restart options:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windows-update-behavior-using-active-hours-and-restart-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windo...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 3: 
<br />
<br />Use Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update:
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />Option 4:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Windows Update
<br />Select it then right click it
<br />Click Properties
<br />Under the General tab, choose Startup type to DIsabled
<br />Click Stop
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Option 5:
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                           net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />                           net stop cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                           net stop bits
<br />
<br />                           net stop msiserver 
<br />
<br />
<br />Option 6:
<br />
<br />Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro which can pause updates for up to 35 days or block them for a year.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation
<br />Click the link ‘Go to the store to upgrade or enter a product key’
<br />Click the $99 button to make your purchase (the price might vary by region or depending on the edition you are upgrading from or upgrading to).
<br />Follow the on screen instructions to make your purchase.
<br />Within 5 to 10 minutes, your system will be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro, your personal files, apps and settings preserved. 
<br />You won’t get a product key, you get a digital license, which is attached to your Microsoft Account used to make the purchase.

<h2>            problem with touchpad since downloading windows 10 today.</h2>
                    <p>I have a dell inspiron N7010 and downloaded windows 10 this morning, now my touchpad doesn't scroll, shrink or widen my screens. I've written several posts here and nothing so far works, the error i'm getting while trying to uninstall synaptics touchpad
 is: </p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a problem starting C: Program files\Synaptics\SynTP\SynISDLL.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>if someone can't get this resolved i'll have to resume windows 7 again. this is getting extremely frustrating since Microsoft should have resolved this issue before it was set live to the public. please advise on how to fix or should I go back to what I
 know works? </p>

            no, I spent the whole day following everyone's directions and NOTHING worked, then they say that the supporting drivers are not yet available, then why waste everyone's time, I'm so pissed, I always buy Microsoft products, but not anymore. if their going
 to offer a new better system, it should work on all computers without gliches, how unprofessional. I went back to windows 7. I bought a printer today and it better work on windows 10 when I get a new computer. WASTED TIME with NO WORKING SOLUTIONS

<h2>            Explorer.exe keeps checking second drive every 10 minutes</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a primary ssd drive with windows 8 installed and a secondary hdd drive for storage purposes. I want the second drive to sleep when not in use, which is most of the time. The drive stops spinning just as I want but every 10 minutes it starts again
 without any action by me.</div>
<div>Also, there is no location included to indexing in these drives.</div>
<div>When I checked what was accessing the drive using Sysinternals Process Monitor, it showed me that explorer.exe was accessing the drive (there are no explorer windows open)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way to stop this from happening?</div>
<div><br />
</div>

            I have a similar problem with explorer. I have about seven other drives and i find that some of them are being used by explorer.<br />
<br />
Like my M: drive. It has about 800GB of Music on it. I find Explorer.exe listed in Performance Monitor -&gt; Disk section, hundreds of times, with files from the M: drive. It is using 90 to 100% of that hard drives bandwidth. this goes on for a long time at random
 times. (long scans of the drive). What is explorer doing.<br />
<br />
I do not have WMP open and i don't think it is updating the library as it should be up to date. When i do open WMP it only takes less then one minute to update the library.<br />
<br />
I can not explain what explorer is doing or why it is doing it. Maybe it is indexing it, but then why does it do it three times in a number of hours on the same day.<br />
<br />
Win 8 X64 with MC<br />

<h2>            How to stop Windows 10 update in progress</h2>
                    <p>Hi I am having trouble with a Windows 10 Update (Update for Windows (KB4040724) it won't get past 4% - It stopped after I did a restart, so I did a manual download and install. Everything is working fine except the update is back trying to download even
 though it has already been installed.</p>
<p>Q : How do I stop this download, and get the system to recognise that it has been done?</p>

<p>Hhmmm. The folder might've been telling you that a file is open as it's trying to force install an update.<br />
<br />
Let's consider deleting the folder while your PC is in <strong>Safe Mode</strong>.<br />
<br />
Starting your PC in <strong>Safe Mode</strong> can help you troubleshoot problems on your PC while using a limited set of files and drivers. Here's how to set your PC in
<strong>Safe Mode</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>I</strong> key from the keyboard to launch
<strong>Settings</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select<strong> Update &amp; Security</strong>, then <strong>Recovery</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click the <strong>Restart now</strong> button under <strong>Advanced startup</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select<strong> Troubleshoot </strong>when you get into the <strong>Choose an option
</strong>screen.<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>Advanced options</strong>, then <strong>Startup Settings</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Restart</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>4</strong> or press the <strong>F4</strong> key from the keyboard after your PC restarts to start your PC now in
<strong>Safe Mode</strong>.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If deleting the folder in Safe Mode didn't work, let's perform a <strong>Clean Boot</strong> to make sure that no application is causing the issue.
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clean Boot</a></strong> helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when running or installing a program in Windows 10.<br />
<strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</em><br />

            Hi <strong>T H 3 D 4 R K 4 C 3,</strong> <br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Thanks for posting on Microsoft Answers!</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>1. DRM issue:</strong> <br />
You can reset the DRM on the computer and verify if it resolves the issue:<br />
To reset the DRM system on the computer, follow these steps: <br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Verify that the Show hidden files and folders option is turned on. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
<strong>Windows 7 </strong><br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Start Windows Explorer. To do this, click Start, type userinit.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click Organize, and then click Folder and Search Options. <br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click the View tab. <br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click the option beside SHOW HIDDEN FILES AND FOLDERS - click Apply - click OK<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Locate the DRM folder on the computer. Typically, the DRM folder is located in the following location.
<br />
Note In these paths, drive represents the drive on which Windows is installed.<br />
Windows 7 <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Windows 7 x86-based versions</strong> <br />
drive:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\DRM <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Windows 7 x64-based versions</strong> <br />
drive:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\DRM<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rename the DRM folder to DRMbackup. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click the DRM folder, and then click Rename. <br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Type DRMbackup, and then press ENTER. <br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Close Windows Explorer.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you receive an <strong>“Access denied”</strong> error message when you try to rename your DRM folder, start the computer in safe mode and log in as the computer administrator.
<br />
<strong>To do this, follow these steps: </strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Restart the computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured to start multiple operating systems, press the F8 key when the Boot menu appears.
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Select the safe mode option when the Windows Advanced Options menu appears, and then press ENTER.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Reset the DRM security component. To do this, visit the following Microsoft Web site, and then follow the steps to upgrade the DRM security component:
<br />
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/FWLink?LinkID=34506" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/FWLink?LinkID=34506</a>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> :<br />
When you access this site through Internet Explorer on a Windows 7-based computer, you may receive a
<strong>"user account control"</strong> popup message that requires that you enter the administrator password to continue.<br />
<strong>Note </strong><br />
If you are running Windows 7 x64 and the Upgrade button on the site listed earlier in this step appears dimmed, you will have to start Internet Explorer by using an account on the computer that has Administrative privileges in order to continue.<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sign in to the Zune Marketplace. Then try to play a song to verify that the issue has been resolved.
<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Restore the setting of the Hidden files and folders option. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Windows 7 <br />
0.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Start Windows Explorer. To do this, click Start, type userinit.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click Organize, and then click Folder and Search Options. <br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click the View tab. <br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click Advanced Settings. <br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Under Hidden files and folders, click Do not show hidden files and folders, click to select the Hide Protected Operating System files (recommended) check box, and then click OK.<br />
<br />
<strong>2. For Recording issues:</strong> <br />
Let us try the following troubleshooting steps.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> <br />
Before you go any further I would recommend you to transfer the recorded files to a safe location on the computer.<br />
This will also delete all of your scheduled recordings, so you will have to re-schedule them.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1. Rename the recording.xml folder.</strong> <br />
1.&nbsp; Right click on "Computer" and select "Manage".<br />
2.&nbsp; Under "Services and Applications" you will see "Services" Open "Services" and stop "Windows Media Center Scheduler Service" and "Windows Media Center Receiver Service".<br />
3.&nbsp; Open up the following directory "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\eHome\Recording".<br />
4.&nbsp; Shut down both of the Media Center services in #2 above and quickly rename (or delete) the "Recording.xml" and "Recording.xml.bak" (the Media Center Services restart for some reason and you can't properly delete the recording schedule data without having
 them shut down).<br />
5.&nbsp; Start the service "Windows Media Center Service Launcher" (this will start both of the other services correctly).<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2. Lets try the following fix to register a missing portion of media center</strong>
<br />
1. Click on Start and type cmd.exe in the search bar.<br />
2. Right click on cmd.exe in the programs pane.<br />
3. And click on Run As Adminsitrator.<br />
4. In the elevated command prompt type the following commands and press Enter after every command.<br />
<br />
regsvr32.exe atl.dll<br />
cd \<br />
cd windows<br />
cd eHome<br />
ehSched /unregServer<br />
ehSched /service<br />
ehRecvr /unregServer<br />
ehRecvr /service<br />
ehRec.exe /unregServer<br />
ehRec.exe /regserver<br />
ehmsas.exe /unregServer<br />
ehmsas.exe /regserver<br />
exit<br />
<br />

            I have exact same issue I can watch regular live TV for example CBS, History Channel etc but "Copying Prohibited" when trying to watch a premium channel like HBO or SHOWTIME. I am not trying to record, although I think the playback buffer for live TV may
 give that appearence. I tried everything on your list still same issue. This started about week ago, I went and looked at update history and do not see anything updated recently. Is it possible it is the provider implemented some change, I am using Comcast
 cable. I find it a little strange that this is failing on Windows 7 x64 HP touchsmart machine with a standard cable top box, but it does work on&nbsp;machine in living room that is Windows 7 Sony VIAO x86 that has the Comcast HD box with DVR. Is it a x86 vs x64
 software issue or is it possible that the cable box is sending some signal phohitbiting recording (which I think the live tv buffer thinks it is recording)? Maybe I am reading to much into the message.<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions

<p>This workaround solution for playback DOES NOT WORK for me. Using the above technique on Win 7 x64 machine to try to fix playback (not the original box), and using Win 7 x32 on the original box that recorded the broadcast (and I clean installed Win 7 x32
 on). The original recording MCE version was XP MCE 2005.</p>
<p>Also, in safe mode, the step to jump to the link and run the DRM s/w upgrade FAILS. Rebooting back into normal mode, the DRM upgrade on that same web site RUNS and installs without complaint. However it doesn't work either, even after reboot.</p>
<p>I have tried working with Microsoft tech support directly on the issue, and they could not get it working, after many hours of effort over multiple sessions. The final recommendation was to download some freeware player, which DID NOT WORK.</p>
<p>So there is no solution to this problem.</p>

<h2>            installing software driver error code 1 - device instance name is invalid</h2>
                    
<p>I have a developed a driver for a usb device. I am able to install the device, using my driver, on XP and Vista, but not on Windows 7. When trying to install it on Windows 7, I get "installing new hardware" then "device driver software was not successfully
 installed". When I go to device manager, and look in the details of the properties of the device, the install error says "device instance name is invalid".</p>
<p>Any ideas of what does that mean and why it is working on Windows XP and Vista but NOT Windows 7?</p>
<p>Any ideas how to go around it?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>CRM 2015 Installation Error - - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drew mcfarland  say:</h3>
<h2>            CRM 2015 Installation Error - Microsoft.Crm.Setup.Shared.AnalyzerBase&#43;CollectAction</h2>
                    <p>We are having a problem installing Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2015.<br />
<br />
The installer made it through all the Wizard screens, and got to the Install step and ran partway through the actual installation process then stopped complaining that the current user did not have access to enough Active Directory permissions (even though
 the wizard steps had said we had permission).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the installer completely cancelled, we can no longer install the program and get an error that "Action Microsoft.Crm.Setup.Shared.AnalyzerBase+CollectAction failed".
<br />
<br />
We get that error when we try to start the installation process again, or try to uninstall the partial installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have found online that for the older versions of CRM (2011 and 2013) that there was a registry entry that had to be removed to get past this issue, but the GUIDs are not the same for CRM 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know what the GUID is for CRM 2015, or a better way to solve this than editing the Registry?</p>

            Hi Senna, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a fellow user in the Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />It sounds like your Steam audio settings aren't configured correctly. Here's a link to the Steam audio troubleshooting article - see if it helps:

            Hi, it says in the Steam's Troubleshooting Article that after uninstallation, you need to go back to the general tab and change it to disable, do I just leave the driver uninstalled or do I do something after?

                    <p>I got banned for I’m assuming saying kys. The problem is kys can mean many things and in my case it meant kiss your self so if saying that’s is against the rules I would love to know. But if I got banned because some kid decided to interpret it in the worst way that’s not it my fault at all and if Xbox is just going to keep me banned because of this then they are absolutly retarded. So I would&nbsp;love to be unbanned I a am sorry i tried congratulating a kid an it turned into me getting banned</p>

    <title>Is Qualcomm Atheros AR9485 Wireless Network Adapter really compatible - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexmonta  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is Qualcomm Atheros AR9485 Wireless Network Adapter really compatible with Windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have the same problem with my Lenovo G505s laptop. I've had this problem forever and I constantly have to reset my network adapter in order to play games or use social media. I could not find a working update to the driver and even if I did it will not
 allow me to install it. I tried to update it once with one that people have said worked and it said "windows has determined that you are already using the best driver for this device" or something along those lines. I am using the same Qualcomm Atheros driver
 as you guys. I have tried uninstalling the driver and checking for hardware changes but this rather than fixing it, caused me to have to reset the adapter more often for some reason. I'm going to try it again and then restart rather than check for changes
 but I don't think it will make a difference. I'm going to try the DNS solution too. I've already checked lenovo's site once and found nothing but I will check again. Does anyone know how to get around the windows pop up to install older versions of drivers?
 I've found some that are supposed to work but windows still wont let me install them.

            Okay the reason that I had to reset my adapter more often may not have been the driver. I had to reset the adapter one way or another but part of the problem after uninstalling the driver and having it automatically reinstalled/updated was that around
 the same time that I uninstalled it, someone in my family unplugged the wifi extension that covered the dead zone in my room. This problem had been around both with and without the extension but it gets worse with less signal. None the less I looked on lenovo
 and found a driver update that I had not seen before. I installed it and so far it is working great. For the first time ever I have 5 bars in my room. Normally I get 3 sometimes 4 bars here when the extension is plugged in and it often disconnects but now
 the connection seems to stay. I'm going to put it to the test with SWTOR and Facebook (the two things that seem to give the adapter the most problems) and I will tell you if it works properly. Thank you all for your advise and help and for a

<h3> charlie58  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting &#34;match not found&#34; error on email addresses- can&#39;t send emails.</h2>
                    
<p>Using Windowsmail, I get the error message "match not found" on one address. When I delete the one email I get the same error on another. Had to give up and not send email with several addresses. How can this be resolved? Broader question - I've seen some
 posts indicating problems with Vista and Windowsmail, and I used to use Outlook Express without many problems. Should I upgrade to Vista and load Outlook Express? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><span>Hi Charlie58,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Which anti-virus software is currently installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As of now, I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Disable your anti-virus software and then test the issue</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software</a></span></p>
<p><span>Note:<em>Running the computer without firewall or the anti-virus software is a potential threat to the computer; make sure to enable the security
 software after completing the troubleshooting steps and after identifying the issue.</em></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: I can receive, but not send, e‑mail messages</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Troubleshoot-problems-with-Windows-Mail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Troubleshoot-problems-with-Windows-Mail</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3: Rebuild Windows Mail message store</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists beyond these steps, then try re-building message store.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Do not forget to backup your message before you rebuild
 the message store.</span></p>

<p><span>I wouldn't suggest you to load Outlook Express on Windows Vista.</span></p>

<h2>            App&#47;program windows open in random sizes and locations</h2>
                    <p>I prefer to have my app/program windows open "maximized" but recently they've been opening at less-than-maximized sizes (and sometime locations), if I'd used them at those smaller sizes sometime in the past. This happens mostly with MS Office applications,
 especially Word and Excel, but Outlook seems to be unaffected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a similar problem years ago and the solution then seemed to have something to do with clearing out a window-size cache, but I can't remember the details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 Pro, v. 1607, and the Office 2010 Pro suite.</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>MS Word</strong> and
<strong>MS Excel</strong> right after booting up your computer.</p>
<p>2. Maximize both windows.</p>
<p>3. On your keyboard, press and hold the
<strong>Ctrl</strong> button and click on the <strong>X</strong> button on each of the windows to close them.</p>

<p>After performing the steps below, all other applications that you open should be in maximized size.</p>

    <title>AOE3 cannot create log files, and will not run. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> graff1067  say:</h3>
<h2>            AOE3 cannot create log files, and will not run.</h2>
                    
<p>I have installed AOE3 on my machine. The Game is stored on an external HD which is pretty much brand new and has yet to give me any problems. Whenever I attempt to run The Game i Receive the following error message "Cannot create log file. Ensure that you
 have full rights in the directory where Age of Empires III resides, and that you have available disk space. \n Erroe: Access is denied."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am the only user of this computer, my account has full Admin access and there is over a terabyte of space on the drive. I do not knopw why there is any problem running this game - especially as all other files on the drive work just fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Delete the log file, "Age3Log.txt", that could give this error message from <strong>
My Documents\My Games\Age of Empires 3</strong> "folder.<br />
<br />
Try removing that file as administrator and then login.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Activation Successful</h2>
                    <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep getting this pop up on a client PC that brings up "Windows 7 Activation was successful." It pops up every 30-45 minutes and we can't seem to get rid of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I manually entered in 2 different product keys with the same results. Windows says it's activated and genuine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any solution to this problem? Is there anyway to hide this annoying pop up?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This module seems to be related to Canon Printer Software. Try uninstalling the printer and reinstalling it.</p>
<p>If you do not have a Canon printer, use Msconfig to check startup programs and disable any entries for this program which you find.
