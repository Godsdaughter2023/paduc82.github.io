<p>Try buying a new Windows Phone 7 or 8.</p>

                    <p><strong>Original title</strong>:Printing Issues in IE9 with Canon Mx870 (printing from map webpages i.e.google maps)</p>
<p>I'm having trouble&nbsp;printing from IE9 when I try to print maps from any of the map web pages such as google maps, bing maps, yahoo maps, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am getting the following error:</p>
<p>Windows cannot connect to the printer. The local print spooler service is not running. Please restart the spooler or restart the machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everytime this happens, I have to restart my computer and printer to get the printer back. I seem to be able to print other web pages just fine and I am able to print from applications such as Word and Adobe.</p>
<p>I have Windows 7 64-bits, IE9&nbsp; and a Canon MX870.</p>
<p>Other people seem to be having the same problem so I know it's not just me...it has to be&nbsp;IE9 and I really hope you get this fixed soon.</p>

    <title>Emails are missing after renaming address - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chasb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Emails are missing after renaming address</h2>
                    <p>My account was a Hotmail address. I also had an Outlook alias. I wanted to change my account to the Outlook alias. Per the instructions I deleted the alias and then went to rename my email address. I got the following message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a temporary problem with the service. Please try again. If you continue to get this message, try again later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried a few times and the message repeated each time. Later I tried to login using my Hotmail account, but found that I had to use the new Outlook address. But all of my emails were missing. I now had a single "Set up your new inbox" email from Outlook
 Team as if this were a new account. I also noticed that the Hotmail address had not been added to my aliases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then renamed my address back to the original Hotmail address. Again I had the temporary problem message, but again the account login had been changed. I was able to log in with the Hotmail address and all of my emails were available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried using a different computer and using Chrome with the same results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then read a community question that reported that it worked after unlinking accounts. I unlinked my two other accounts and tried to rename again. This time I got the message that my address had been changed to Outlook.com. But my emails were still missing.
 I again only had the single "Set up your new inbox" email as if it had switched to the Outlook address I had failed to create previously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also found that this time the original Hotmail address had been correctly converted to an alias.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thinking that I could get my emails back the same way I did before I attempted to undo the rename. I removed the Hotmail alias (possibly this is where I went wrong) and renamed the account back to the Hotmail alias. This worked in that I returned to the
 original Hotmail address, but all of my emails are still missing, except for a "Your new Outlook address is ready to go" email from Outlook Team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am looking for help in recovering my emails for my Hotmail address and preferably renaming to an Outlook address.</p>

<span>Hello ChasB,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>By upgrading to Outlook.com, you are only upgrading the user interface of Hotmail to the new user interface; hence all your emails should still stay in your Inbox. However,
 if your emails were over 270 days old, you may have lost them due to inactivity in account even before you renamed the account.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If you had Self-recovery of emails turned on in your account before rename, you can try to recover some of the deleted messages yourself. Please visit this
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>link</strong></span></a><span>
 for the steps on how to do this.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If you chose to rename your account to<b> @Outlook.com</b>, a prompt would have asked you&nbsp;<b>Where do you want to save your emails?</b> You will have the
 option to create a new folder for your old account or save the emails in the Inbox of your renamed account.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If you chose to create a new folder, the default name of the folder will be the name of your old account and the folder will appear in the left pane under
<b>Folders</b>. And all your old emails will be stored in this folder.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Regards,</span></p>
        </p>

            <p>Thanks for the response, but I don't think it applies to my issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had upgraded to the Outlook.com interface some time ago. Shortly after it was released.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use my account daily so inactivity is not an issue with missing emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I say emails are missing I mean that all emails and all folders are gone. It is as if this is being treated as a new account that had not existed before. There are no deleted emails that can be recovered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My original questions describes four attempts to rename my account. The first and second times I was getting the "temporary problem" message and I was not asked "Where do you want to save your emails".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The third time, after unlinking other accounts, the rename appeared to work, but again I was not asked "Where do you want to save your emails". The system seemed to create the requested @outlook.com address with nothing in it but the new inbox email. Possibly
 the system is using the @outlook.com that was partially created during the first rename attempt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fourth attempt where I tried to revert back to my original @hotmail.com account also appeared to work. This was the only time I was asked "Where do you want to save your emails". Technically this worked in that it put the single, new inbox email from
 the @outlook.com address into my inbox as requested. But again the problem is that my original @hotmail.com account's emails and settings are gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that helps explain more details. I see that there are a few other questions with the same issue of losing emails after renaming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I'm still looking for a recovery of my @hotmail.com account before I tried renaming it.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Based on how you described your issue, it appears that there had been multiple changes/renaming attempts. If you just recently renamed your account, I suggest that you wait for another 24 to 48 hours for the information to synch. If the issue persists after
 48 hours, feel free to post back to this forum for investigation.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</span></p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>That does make some sense, but it has now been over 48 hours and nothing has changed. I also checked with&nbsp;a different browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a&nbsp;few points I want to highlight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One is that when I originally tried to rename I received the "...temporary problem with the service..." message. But the account was still changed and I had to undo to get my emails back. This appears to be a bug.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This seems to be related to having linked accounts because the rename&nbsp;appeared to work&nbsp;(although with missing emails) after I unlinked accounts. This also&nbsp;seems to be an error (possibly known).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And&nbsp;when the rename appeared to work I was not asked where to save my original emails. It was as if the system looked at my original account and did not find any emails so it did not ask that question. Admittedly that's purely a guess on my part. I am wondering
 if that is related to the account being created even though the "...temporary problem with the service..." message was shown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that said the basic problem is that I had errors when renaming my account's address and I am now missing all emails and folders from prior to the rename.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Not to overload anyone with information but I thought I'd rewrite what had happened. Technically it's just restating what I'd written earlier but in a step by step form. Hopefully it can be useful in understanding and resolving the issue.</p>
<p><br />
Initially my account was setup as follows:<br />
The address was @hotmail.com.<br />
There was an @outlook.com alias.<br />
I had two separate, but linked @outlook.com Microsoft accounts.<br />
The interface was using Outlook.com.</p>
<p><br />
In all of the following steps I use the same @hotmail.com and @outlook.com address each time.</p>
<p><br />
On Monday, November 26, 2012 around 7:30 PM Eastern time I did the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Removed @outlook.com alias.</li><li>Renamed account from @hotmail.com to @outlook.com.</li><li>This message was shown: There's a temporary problem with the service. Please try again. If you continue to get this message, try again later.</li><li>Pressed Back and tried renaming again. Received same message.</li><li>Pressed Back and several minutes later I tried renaming again.</li><li>A login prompt was shown. (Possibly because @hotmail.com account was no longer valid? Or there was a timeout?)</li><li>I did not receive the message that the rename had occurred.</li><li>I was not prompted for where to save my @hotmail.com emails.</li><li>My @hotmail.com login did not work. The new @outlook.com did work.</li><li>All @hotmail.com emails and folders are missing. The inbox contained a single email, "Set up your new inbox" from Outlook Team. (As if this was a new account instead of a renamed one.)</li><li>The @hotmail.com address was not converted to an alias.</li><li>When I check my linked accounts by clicking on
<p><br />
At this point the only difference from my initial configuration is that the @outlook.com alias does not exist. And I can't restore it because I've maxed out my aliases for the period.</p>
<p><br />
Maybe I should have left my account as is but I wanted to change my account to an @outlook.com address. And I had successfully renamed other accounts. And I found
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/liveid-profile/renaming-microsoft-account-email-address-theres-a/25a5c660-e18d-41ec-ad90-c3e900054cd6">
this</a> in the Microsoft Community which sounded like a solution. In a way it was a solution, but something still went wrong.</p>
<p><br />
On Tuesday, November 27, 2012 around 8:00 PM Eastern time I did the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>I removed the links to my other Microsoft accounts.</li><li>Renamed account from @hotmail.com to @outlook.com.</li><li>This time I received the message that the rename had occurred.</li><li>I was still not prompted for where to save my @hotmail.com emails.</li><li>The @hotmail.com address was converted to an alias.</li><li>All @hotmail.com emails and folders are missing. The inbox contained a single mail, "Set up your new inbox" from Outlook Team, just like it did in step 10 from yesterday. (Am I missing my emails because it's re-using yesterdays @outlook.com account which
 hadn't worked?)</li><li>Although there are similar situations in the Microsoft Community I don't find one with an answer.</li><li>In the hope that it will work like yesterday I try to undo the change.</li><li>Remove the @hotmail.com alias.</li><li>Rename account from @outlook.com to @hotmail.com.</li><li>I again receive the message that the rename had occurred.</li><li>This time I am prompted for where to save the @outlook.com emails and I choose Inbox. (This is the only time I've had this prompt.)</li><li>The @outlook.com address was converted to an alias.</li><li>The original @hotmail.com emails and folders are still missing.</li><li>The single @outlook.com "Set up your new inbox" is in the inbox per my answer to the prompt about where to save.</li><li>There is a new @hotmail email, "Your new Outlook address is ready to go" from Outlook Team. (This is the only time I've gotten the email indicating that a rename occurred.)</li></ol>
<p><br />
This is now my current configuration:<br />
The address is @hotmail.com.<br />
There is an @outlook.com alias.<br />
All @hotmail.com emails and folders prior to Tuesday's rename are lost.</p>
<p><br />
One other note, if a rename is also supposed to transfer settings like "Sending/receiving email from other accounts" then I have also lost that. (Although it's easy enough to recreate.)</p>

            <p>I just noticed something very unexpected. I have a Windows Phone that was setup with my original @hotmail.com account. When I renamed and lost my emails online I had disabled syncing with the idea of keeping my original inbox emails accessible from the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just finished reviewing those emails and decided to allow it to sync to the new inbox emails. The phone synced without error, but the inbox emails on the phone did not change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had only been syncing the inbox. So I went to another folder and enabled syncing on it. Which the phone had no problem doing and I can see the emails that are in that folder. A folder and emails that I cannot see online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is telling me that the phone is still connected to and is able to read the emails from my original @hotmail.com account. It can even send emails from that address. But any emails sent to that address are going to the new @hotmail account. And to clarify,
 the original @hotmail account from before the rename and the new @hotmail account from after the rename are the same address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This makes me believe that my emails from before the rename are still accessible on a parallel account or alternate server or something. Which still leads me to the question of how to get these emails back into the account I can see online or restore my
 original account and transfer my new emails into it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is slightly confusing I think, but I hope it helps.</p>

<h2>            Auto populate text from one slide to another</h2>
                    <p>We have a template that is being used by people in the office but one of the main complaint was having to type the same information in on different slides. Is there a way on the master slide to create a link between two slides to have the information carried
 over?</p>

<p>The only objects that act even close to that are the footer and date fields (<strong>Insert&gt;Header&amp; Footer</strong>). To use them, you would place the footer or date on the slide layout in the position where you need the information to appear. Then in the
 Insert&gt;Header &amp; Footer dialog, you would edit the Date and/or Footer to have the information you want to appear, then click on
<strong>Apply to All</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make the Date field display information other than the date, choose the Fixed option in Header &amp; Footer, then type in whatever text you need instead of a date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's as close as you can get. But I imagine you're looking for something like Word's Content Controls, which are not found in PowerPoint. Others have had the same idea, here is a suggestion to that effect in the PowerPoint User Voice forum. You can add
 your vote. Microsoft uses these votes to prioritize new programming: <a href="https://powerpoint.uservoice.com/forums/288949-powerpoint-for-windows-desktop-application/suggestions/33103534-references-to-fields-values-like-word-cross-refer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>John's summed up the main answers, but a couple other sorta "outlier" ideas that might help in some cases:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Type the text into a cell in a SAVED Excel worksheet, format it to taste, then copy it and Paste Special/Link it into PowerPoint on any slides where you want the text to appear.&nbsp; When someone updates the text in Excel, PPT will update it on your slides
 then next time the presentation's opened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) It might suffice to create a new layout with the repeated text on it.&nbsp; Any slides that you apply the layout to will inherit the text.&nbsp; Update it in the layout and it'll update on any slides based on the layout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to have lots of different bits of text updated this way, let us know. There may be other options.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please be informed that Hotmail does not have a computer alert when you receive an email. However, if you are signed in to Windows
 Live Messenger, you will receive an email notification or an alert that you have received a new email. A small box will appear on the right lower portion of the scree saying that you have an unread email message.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You will get the sound when you receive a new mail only with email clients like Outlook, Windows Live Mail etc.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Open Control Panel from the Start menu.</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
b. Make sure you are in Classic View. <br />
c. Double-click Sound.<br />
d. Go to the Sounds tab. <br />
e. Highlight New Mail Notification in the Program Events list. <br />
f. Use the Browse button to find the .wav file. <br />
g. Click OK.</p>

<h2>            2013 pivot table assigns AM&#47;PM to calculated 00&#58;00&#58;00 value -- didn&#39;t do this in 2010</h2>
                    <p>In my 2010 pivots this was never an issue, but not that our company is using Excel 2013, I'm having issues with a calculated time value that now when selected has Excel adding Hour/Min to my value that should just come across as 00:23:00, for example. I've
 tried using the Field Setting features and Format Number etc -- nada. Before in 2010 it would just bring the value across and all was well with the data, but now Excel add the Hour/Min breakout and this kills my formatting. Values are set to [h]:mm:ss in the
 data source table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insight is greatly appreciated!</p>

</p>
<p>What's happening in the worksheet is the date/time fields that are queried from the database have a formula that runs against them to calculate the TTD (time to deliver) value. These are [h]:mm:ss values as it's a 24 hr needed value. Historically, I created
 a pivot of these and one of the tables is the TTD/Method view that is just a simple table that shows all TTD values, no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In 2013, however, when I add the TTD value to the pivot Excel adds Hour and Minute along with TTD (making it only Seconds). What's same formulas etc as used in 2010, but different results on pivot formatting.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an admin for my Office-365 account, but when I try and access OneDrive I get the error below:</p>

<h2>            OneNote cursor stuck</h2>
                    So recently my cursor for onenote is stuck as a combination of the classic cursor, but it also has a plus sign at the tip. I can't seem to get it to change even with some of the solutions of moving it to a neutral space and bringing it back, or disabling
 hover pointing. Does anyone have any ideas?

<h2>            Office 2010 keeps losing keyboard shortcuts</h2>
                    Hi there. I'm having a problem with my ms office 2010 that it's driving me crazy. On Word 2010 px it keeps losing keyboard shortcuts for select all, cut, copy and paste (maybe there's more, but that's what i have found). Even if i reassign them through
 options, they'll eventually get deleted again. Any suggestions?

            Same thing for me -- these are custom shortcuts that I use while working as medical transcriber. It infuriates me. Plus MS Word keeps having all kinds of problems like horrendously slow to open, to close, and also randomly replacing the normal.dot template
 without me asking which affects all my Autocorrects too. Why does Win 10 and MS Word not get along???

<h2>            Consolidate Office 365 Account Subscriptions</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in a position where a number of individuals within a small business have their own subscriptions for Office 365. The company would now like to subscribe to Office 365 and pay for each user within the business. My question is, how can the individual
 accounts be consolidated with the company account? One single business account is far easier to manage.</p>

<p>Hi dknox,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for writing back and letting us know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Excel gives the prompt with <strong>Did you double-check the formulas in the totals</strong> is due to the Macro in the Excel spreadsheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c1e100e-5d58-4eb0-a66a-68fe8501d1ee?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c1e100e-5d58-4eb0-a66a-68fe8501d1ee?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we test by disabling the macro’s, it doesn’t give a prompt during closing the spreadsheet. So, we suggest you remove the above macro and check the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Chitrahaas</p>

                    <p>Dear MS, I'm your fan since the '80 but sometimes you make me feel sad. After pushing us to use GPO as much as we can for several years, you decided to remove such feature from Office 2013/2016. Why do you do such things? Why do you make us feel so sad :-(?</p>

            <p>Hi Neha, thanks for the reply and links.</p>
<p>My initial Post is based on https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc179176.aspx where you can find the following warning:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>You can use Group Policy to manage the following versions of Office 2013: </em>
<br />
<em>•Office suites available through volume licensing. For example, Office Standard 2013.</em><br />
<em>•Individual Office programs sold through retail stores or through volume licensing.</em><br />
<em>If you buy Office as part of Office 365, your license plan determines whether you can use Group Policy to manage your Office programs. The Office Applications Service Description lists which Office 365 plans support Group Policy.
</em><br />
</p>
<p>I don't have Volume, I don't buy individual Office programs (who does?), I don't have 365. Result: i don't have GPO.</p>
<p>GPO was available on Office 2010 with no exclusion. GPO is available on Office 2013 only under certain conditions.</p>
<p>Please let me know if I'm wrong. Regards.</p>

            Hi Neha, it's "Home &amp; Business" and "Professional". I've a little box with a Card and a "Product Key" printed on it. I've downloaded Office from MS Portal after logging in and typing the "Product Key". This kind of Office is neither 365 nor Volume. This
 kind of Office, AFAIK, has the GPO removed.<br />

            <p>I don't have only "Home &amp; Business". I also run "Professional". Both editions were provided with GPO support till 2010. No GPO support on neither of them since 2013.</p>
<p>So, I'm correct. And this is unfair from MS.</p>
<p>You know the reason? I know... let's see if we agree. Let me know your opinion: why did MS remove GPO?</p>

<h2>            Word 2008 &#47; 2011 hangs up when turn on track changes</h2>
                    I have recently changed from PC to a new iMac with MS Office 2011(all patch were installed).<br />
I am happy with that unless I turn on track changes.<br />
It hangs up 3-4 times per day and the cursor turns into rainbow ball.<br />
Only thing I can do is to force quit and let all modified data gone...<br />
Auto-recover doesn't help me as it loads the version which I saved.<br />
<br />
After I turn off track changes, it won't hangs...<br />
I asked my colleagues and they all suffer from this problem when using Word 2008.<br />
Only what they can do is press save every few minutes.<br />
<br />
I can not provide any sample as all documents are confidential and usually more than 200 pages.<br />
<br />
I am thinking of using PC again as this function made me disappointing.<br />
<br />

            <p>It sounds like these documents have been abused by Tracked Changes that have never been released. What's going to happen real soon, either on the Mac or the PC, the document will corrupt and a lot of work lost.</p>
<p>Here's what I would do ... make a backup copy to work with and then open it and accept or reject ALL changes.&nbsp; Save the document and start fresh, don't turn on track changes. Instead when you're done with the edits, run Compare Documents (Tools &gt; Track Changes
 &gt; Compare Documents) and it will produce for you a document showing the changes that have been made.</p>

<h2>            how do i recover unsaved OneNote files after having upgraded to OneNote 2016&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Friends</p>
<p>
</p><p>After using MS .jnt since mid-2000s I "upgraded" to MS OneNote ...without investing the time to as much as learn how to save each document.</p>
<p>Mea culpa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently my computer was upgraded and along with that upgrade came MS OneNote 2016.</p>
<p>70 unsaved notes disappeared!</p>
<p>Oddly: I've found my original unsaved 10 documents from the first day I began using OneNote.</p>
<p>So... since those 10 weren't saved but they survived I have hope that my other 70 notes also survived.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've followed every step I have found from googling my question.</p>
<p>I'm running Office 8 and searched for the "embedded" OneNote program in case they are all there but search only reveals OneNote 2016 on my computer.</p>
<p>Nothing has shown up when I "search" (am I searching for the right thing?)</p>
<p>In my OneNote 2016 program (3-notebooks: 2 are empty and one is my original 10 aforementioned documents)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ty in advance, TC</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing the terminology would've been "in-place" upgrade, though I don't exactly know.</p>
<p>I was unable to find the "Windows.old" folder as prescribed by the directions on your link.</p>
<p>After attempting to manually find the files (following instructions) I attempted the other, automated solution.&nbsp; That produced zero results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's also been more than 28-days since the upgrade.&nbsp; Maybe even 2-months or so before "googling" my issue and discovering this forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what remaining options may be available.</p>
<p>I don't understand how 10 Notes made the transition while another 60 or so did not.</p>
<p>

HTC P4550 Kaiser TyTN II and WM 6.0 version. I nowhere found how to change the font size. (The way Menu- Setting -Sytem -Screen and giving max fonts don’t influence on the phone used fonts).
</span><span><span>I am affraid Microsoft mobile creators (software engineers) didn’t think about &nbsp;“older” WM users, with a little poor eyesight.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<p>I am betting there is a registry key or something you can change.&nbsp; But it sure isn't obvious.</p>

<h2>            How-To Create Distribution group in On-Premise AD with DirSync and no On-Premise Exchange Server</h2>
                    
<p>I would like to create a powershell script that creates three distribution groups based on a prefix and owner/member given by me as input any time the script is run, I would also like to add the input user as owner and member of the group.</p>
<p>I would like to add the group to our local AD and assign proxyaddress and email attributes and then sync it to O365 with our DirSync.</p>
<p>I have a PS script that worked from our On-Premise Exchange server, but that server is now defunct. With that script I could run it and then run the DirSync Start-OnlineCoexistenceSync and all was well.&nbsp; I have figured out what commands to run with MSOL,
 but I want the groups created in our local AD and synced, not in MSOL only.</p>
<p>The existing script that ran from the Exchange server is:</p>
<p>param([string]$GpName,[string]$GpMgr)<br />
Add-PSSnapin Microsoft.Exchange.Management.PowerShell.Admin</p>
<p>TRY<br />
{<br />
&nbsp;$GpName = $GpName.substring(0,$GpName.IndexOf(" "))<br />
}<br />
CATCH<br />
{<br />
&nbsp;Try<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $GpName = $GpName.substring(0,$GpName.IndexOf("-",3))<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Catch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $GpName = $GpName<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } <br />
}<br />
foreach ($arg in $args)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; echo $arg<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />
foreach ($GpExt in @("_DrawingQuestions", "_FabricationIssues", "_ShippingNotice"))<br />
{<br />
$GpAlias = $GpName -Replace(" ","") <br />
$GpAlias = $GpAlias + $GpExt<br />
$GpDN = $GpName + $GpExt<br />
$emAddy = "$($GpAlias)@BankerSteel.com"<br />
#echo "GPName = $($GpName)<br />
echo "GPDN = $($GpDN)"<br />
echo "GPAlias = $($GpAlias)"<br />
echo "emAddy = $($emAddy)"<br />
#echo "GpExt = " $GpExt</p>

<p>New-DistributionGroup -Name $GpDN -DisplayName $GpDN -Alias $GpAlias -OrganizationalUnit "bankersteel.local/MyBusiness/Distribution Groups" -SAMAccountName $GpDN -Type "Distribution"<br />
Start-Sleep -s 20<br />
#Enable-DistributionGroup -Identity $GpDN -Alias $GpAlias -DisplayName $GpDN -PrimarySMTPAddress $emAddy
<br />
Set-DistributionGroup $GpDN -RequireSenderAuthenticationEnabled $False<br />
Set-DistributionGroup $GpDN -ManagedBy $GpMgr <br />
Add-ADPermission -Identity $GpDN -User $GpMgr -AccessRights WriteProperty -Properties "Member"<br />

<p>Hi RobMcFaden,</p>
<p>Since our forum focuses on Office 365 for Business online services, about creating distribution groups via PowerShell script in your local AD and sync it to Office 365, I will recommend you post a new thread in
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/scriptcenter/en-US/home?category=scripting&amp;forum=dpmpowershell%2Cscriptexplorer%2CITCG&amp;sort=relevancedesc&amp;brandIgnore=True&amp;searchTerm=ow-To+Create+Distribution+group+in+On-Premise+AD+script" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Script Center</a>&nbsp;to check if the requirement could be met with PowerShell Script. You can get dedicated support about the PowerShell script from there.</p>
<p>Your understanding will be highly appreciated.</p>

<p>It is most likely that your screen protector (or anything)&nbsp; is covering the sensor window located between the front camera window and call speaker ( top right corner of the phone screen). There are 2 sensor windows(one for light and proximity) next to each
 other so make sure the screen protector doesn't cover either one of them. Good luck.</p>

<h2>            Activation Problem&#59; Word 2007.</h2>
                    <p>Hi. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed Word 2007 on my new laptop however it won't activate because this is the fourth time it has been installed. Once previously on my old laptop and also on two family PCs. Is there anyway it can forget my old laptop (the first installation)
 so that I can continue to use MS Word? As it is, my family can use the software that I have paid for but now I can't!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

            Office 2007 or Word 2007 is no longer supported and there are no security updates, you would need to use phone activation&nbsp;

<p>No</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Word is a full-blown wordprocessing package which is available stand alone or as part of the Microsoft Office Suite. &nbsp;It is not free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wordpad is a very very simple program which allows you to process words, but with very few bells and whistles. &nbsp;It comes as part of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to write the odd letter, Wordpad will probably do you.</p>
<p>If you want to write business documents and letters then Word is one of your options</p>
<p>If you want to write a novel then neither will do you.</p>
