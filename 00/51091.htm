<h2>            Window apps comes back after Deleting</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to get apps like Solitaire, Candy Crush, Twitter, 3D builder, Get Office, Get Skype removed on some of my companies computers that are not network joined.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have right clicked in start menu, uninstalled. </p>
<p>Gone to apps and features, uninstalled. </p>
<p>Used PowerShell commands like Get-AppxPackage -allusers PackageFullName | Remove-AppxPackage</p>
<p>And they keep coming back. Why?!? How do you get them permanently deleted?</p>
<p>Also annoying is sometimes its in start menu but not in apps &amp; features and vise versa...Never consistent</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking for a way to remove them without having to sign on as the user, but everything I try after a restart the same day or sometimes the next day they are back
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also where can I find GPO instructions to get these blocked on the start menu or uninstalled or hidden?</p>

                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have installed a freeware scenery addon. It is clouds scenery. Because i am not satisfied with fsx clouds. After that i lost my 777's display. Also i had installed a freeware dx10 scenery fixer. I thought it may be the reason for losing displays of 777.
 So i completely uninstall fsx and installed again in a different directory. After that too i am facing the same problem. I am feeling very sad now. Because i want to become a 777 real pilot in my feature. So kindly help me to resolve...&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Don't be sad - we are here to help! &nbsp; A few questions first:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp; After you reinstalled FSX, is it working well in its vanilla state (i.e. without any addons or fixes)? &nbsp; Always make sure the Sim has no problems from the beginning, otherwise anything you add on or change will only add to your problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp; Is your B777 a paid or freeware version? &nbsp; If you purchased it, which company produced it? &nbsp;Was it working well (i.e. its appearance, displays, etc.) before the instrument panel went black?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp; Generally, an improvement to a scenery item (in your case, clouds), will not affect anything else, unless that addon was not written properly. &nbsp; I can give you my cloud fix, but not now as these other matters need attention first. &nbsp;However, if something
 else has been tampered with, then there will be problems. &nbsp; Have you altered anything in the B777 folder in your Sim Objects?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. &nbsp; For now, don't worry about the clouds addon or the Dx10 fixer, just concentrate on running FSX properly. &nbsp; You will need to do a few flights first to make sure it is working well. &nbsp; And remember to add that HIGHMEMFIX=1 entry in your fsx.cfg.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if your FSX is running well, I would make a complete backup of the FSX folder to an external device: you will need up to 15 Gb of space. &nbsp; This is so that you can take files from there and replace any files that may have become corrupt or lost in your
 working FSX. &nbsp; This is not for reinstallation purposes - that needs to be done from your DVDs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After backing up your FSX and you know that it is running well, you can install your B777. &nbsp; Now make sure that everything is looking as it should and let me know.</p>

            <p>Hello Chriso,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy to see you again! Hopefully my display issue is resolved. I just install the Acceleration then my issue was resolved.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again I uninstalled the FSX because I have planned to install the FSX at its old directory. That means newly installed FSX was in some other directory. Because I don't want to merge the old FSX and newly installed FSX files. So I choose different directory
 for installation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After my query in the community I have installed the Acceleration version. I hope that will not work. But amazingly I get back my displays! I was very happy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have uninstall my FSX. Tomorrow I'll install FSX at its old directory that is "Program files (x86)/Microsoft games/Microsoft Flight Simulator X".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually I flew LIRN - LIMC with a 737 along with DX10 fixer and the clouds too. But it was a nice flight. No issues on it. obviously I didn't satisfied with my scenery in the case of DX10 and the cloud and sky and sun addon too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to buy a Blu-ray disc, after I can backup the FSX. Even before installing the DX10 and installing the cloud addon. I tried to copy the old scenery, texture and effect. But after that also I got the same black display.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways after I install FSX, in fact I am installing tomorrow, I'll inform about its performance. After that Please give me your cloud addon. I really unsatisfied with the FSX default weather. Definitely I'll consider buying REX clouds and PMDG 777. But
 in this condition I cannot buy these ones. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing FSX newly, I'll add&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">HIGHMEMFIX=1 entry in fsx.cfg.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Many thanks for your replay. Have a great day :)&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Your installation and uninstallation frequencies are getting confusing! &nbsp; You shouldn't have FSX installed twice, even in different directories, as there are implications in other programs and registry. &nbsp; Anyway, I see that you are now removing it altogether
 and reinstalling. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't done so already, when you remove FSX, remove it first using its DVD or through Uninstall program. &nbsp; Then type FSX in your Search box at Desktop and search of any remnants of FSX in your system. &nbsp; All those files need to come off too. &nbsp; Then
 do your fresh install. &nbsp; It is also better to install FSX to the root of your drive (in my case C:\FSX) and not to Program Files, but if you want to install it in Program Files, that's okay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once FSX is running well (i.e. no freezes, CTDs, and aircraft/scenery looking as they should), then back it up. &nbsp;The best way is to back it up onto an external hard drive, then you can use this drive to back up Windows as well (either with a system image
 or via file history). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't use DX10 as a few problems occur. &nbsp; A fixer for DX10 is available (I think it's called Steve's DX10 fixer) and that works but requires a number of changes in certain files. &nbsp; To that end, I'm happy with DX9 and I don't notice any scenery enhancement
 with the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FSX default weather has never been any good, even when using the real weather option, it doesn't always translate into the actual weather in the areas you are flying in. &nbsp; Some payware weather addons will be far better, but all these will require more CPU
 cycles. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have to install my FSX into the program files directory because I have my hundreds of freeware addons and world of ai aircraft there. I see that it is not deleted during FSX uninstallation. So I want to back it up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too not happy with DX10 sceneries. So I am getting back to DX9 again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have initiated my backup process. It will be finished off in sometimes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time I am searching for a better weather fixer. Anyway if my scenery and weather is fixed, then I don't expect anything apart from that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll tell you about my FSX performance and backup process after the installation of FSX.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>It is good that your FSX is now running well. &nbsp; The following is freeware (therefore, freeware quality). &nbsp;It is for your clouds. &nbsp; It enhances the default clouds, particularly cumulus. &nbsp; Follow the instructions closely, especially when it asks you to backup
 a particular file, (or you can take a copy of the file you've saved in your FSX backup) - so you can reinstall it if you need to remove the addon. &nbsp; I can't take you to the Forum that I am a member of, since you need to be registered to use their File Library,
 so I've given you Simaviation's site for download:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://simviation.com/simviation/?ID=63&amp;page=18&amp;mark=3329 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(scroll down to Oscar Clouds V3).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you need to see a short video of the clouds before downloading, you can go here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q7l1WdLo4M</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well Chaaru, I think that these matters about enhancing FSX would fall outside the scope of the Microsoft Forum. &nbsp; You may want to join a Simulator Forum to get advice and help for the addons suitable for your system and budget. This Forum doesn't provide
 a Personal Message facility nor can one share email addresses. &nbsp; MS Forum Admin may want to clarify this. &nbsp;So see how you go.</p>

    <title>Change the Xbox One and Xbox 360 Dashboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xbox assassin48  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change the Xbox One and Xbox 360 Dashboard</h2>
                    <p>I'm sick of this dashboard we have on the 360, and I'm sure many other people are sick of it too. The dashboards were so original from 2005 to 2010, until Windows 8 was brought to the Xbox 360 in 2011, which we never asked for, and it hasn't changed since. Minor changes in the texture were made but the layout hasn't changed at all. This dashboard is too slow compared to the previous dashboards, and it lags a lot. Even a lot of people are complaining about the Windows 10 dashboard on Xbox One. Where is the originality??? What I'm asking for here is, change the dashboard to an older dashboard which everyone loved, and that could be either Blades or NXE. As for Xbox One dashboard, I'll leave that to the Xbox One community.

            <p>Hi Rosey21. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><br />
Thank you for posting query on Microsoft communities</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Please follow the steps mentioned below if you are using a finger instead of mouse.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If there's text on screen, you can press it and it will highlight. To highlight multiple words, the two end circles can be dragged along to select all the text you want to include. It can prove fiddly, so on a Web page try to zoom in (by pinching the screen
 with two fingers) to make life easier. <br />
Once something has been copied, you can paste it using the clipboard option that will appear above the onscreen keyboard.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Please follow the steps mentioned below for highlighting the text if using keyboard.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
a) You will need to place the cursor at the very beginning of the word or phrase that you're trying to highlight, before the first letter. This can be done using your mouse.</div>
<div><br />
b) Once you have confirmed that the cursor is in front of the first letter of the word/phrase that you are trying to highlight, hold down the "Shift" key and keep it held down.</div>
<div><br />
c) Now begin to press the right-arrow key, while keeping the "Shift" key held down. You will see that with each tap you give the right-arrow key, you will highlight one character per tap. If you have to highlight a large amount of text, keep the right-arrow
 key held down while you're holding the "Shift" key down.</div>
<div><br />
d) Repeat this motion until you have highlighted as much text as you need to.</div>
<div><br />
Hope the above information helps.</div>
<div><br />
Do get back to us in case you need further assistance.</div>

            <p>I would suspect the unwanted pictures are in your <br />
Temporary Internet Files folder. When you access <br />
sites on the net that include graphics and pictures, <br />
they are loaded into this folder so you can view them.<br />
<br />
If you would like to view the contents of your<br />
Temporary Internet Files folder...try these steps...<br />
<br />
Go to...Start / Control Panel / Internet Options / <br />
General tab / Browsing History section / Settings <br />
button / View Files button.<br />
<br />
Or...open an IE window and go to...Tools / Internet <br />
Options / General tab / Browsing History&nbsp;section / <br />
Settings button / View Files button...<br />
<br />
Also you could go to...Start / Run...and&nbsp;type or Copy/<br />
Paste &nbsp;the following command:<br />
<br />
%USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files<br />
<br />
Then press...Enter...to launch the Temporary Internet Files folder.<br />
<br />
To clear it up...try deleting your Temporary Internet Files.<br />
<br />
Running Disk Cleanup should take care of it.<br />

Also, on an Internet Explorer window...you could<br />
go to...Tools / Internet Options / Delete Files / OK.<br />
<br />
Do it again and check, "Delete All Offline Content" / OK.<br />
<br />
Delete Cookies Button / OK.<br />

            <p>At a too good to be true price like that, it is indeed not legal. They are likely reselling MSDN licenses.</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys </p>
<p>They are genuine Microsoft product keys, they are actually retail licenses, but it is intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN) or TechNet for IT Professionals who pay a subscription fee. The main purpose
 is for evaluation purposes. The great thing about them, unlike trial Microsoft software, MSDN or TechNet keys don't expire. Because the agreement under which the subscription is provided is a single license, none of the software should be distributed outside
 of it. Even though its $50,000 worth of licenses, it is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites. Microsoft licenses
 it in good faith that customers won't do so, but I guess human nature wins out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case, what probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons. Somewhere
 along the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused and blocked the key from further use.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Flight Simulator Battle for Europe and Windows 7 -- Joystick - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zeilmann22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Flight Simulator Battle for Europe and Windows 7 -- Joystick problems</h2>
                    
<p>I have tried downloading everything I can find from Microsoft and my Logitech joysticks (Attack 3 and Extreme 3D Pro) on my brand-new computer -- HP Pavillion P6000 series, 6 GB, Windows 7, loaded.&nbsp; But my joystick remains dead, dead, dead, even though Control
 Panel indicates they are working perfectly.&nbsp; I keep trying Options in the game itself, and it keeps asking something like, "Do you want to change joystick setting from xxxx to yyyy [lots of gibberish letters]?&nbsp; I have tried saying yes, no, joystick enabled,
 joystick disabled, and on and on.</p>
<p>What a shame!&nbsp; This is a beautiful game, far superior in my view to the later Combat FS 3 Battle for Europe (which works OK on my new computer, by the way).&nbsp;&nbsp; Can anybody help?&nbsp; Thanks</p>

1.&nbsp;Were you able to use that joystick without any issues earlier? <br />

<p>If a joystick device fails to respond, it might not be installed correctly.</p>
<p>Make sure the device shows up on the Input tab. If not, reinstall the device according to the manufacturer's instructions. If it's a USB device, unplug it and then plug it back in.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You might want to monitor your computer's performance by using resource monitor<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<b>View CPU utilization and other performance information</b><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/View-CPU-utilization-and-other-performance-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/View-CPU-utilization-and-other-performance-information</span></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>There could be a third party software conflict causing the issues to occur. I'd have you put your machine in a&nbsp;<span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a></span> state to eliminate third party software conflicts.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Note:</b> Follow step 7 in the above link to restart your computer as usual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>The issue could be related to Virus/Malware, I would suggest that you download and run a full system scan using Microsoft Safety Scanner and check if that helps.<br />
<strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner<br />
</strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a><br />
Note: <br />
Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.<br />
The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.<br />

            <p>Hello EleftheriosXenidis,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;When the CPU usage is at 100%, did you look in task manager to see what is using the most CPU in processes?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Also, have you ran a full scan with your antivirus or ran any malware removal, as Naman R suggested?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Please let us know status.</p>

<h2>            Xbox one, and PS4</h2>
                    
<p>IM not going to start this off like every other rant thats been going on the net for the last few days, but im going to bring up a point , that im realy getting concernd with.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I realy dont want xbox to fail, i dont like there polocies, and i dont like
 drm, but id be a hipocrit if i screamed about it, because im a avid STEAM user, and thats what steam is a huge drm farm , with all there games, i cant trade, sell or use the property once ive bought it.</p>
<p>Now my concern is the same thing that happend to the video game market, what i mean is before Game Stop we had Electronics Boutique, Funco land, Babages, and many others out there im not bringing up off the top of my head, but heres what happend slowly they
 all dwindled away due to hostile takeovers , and or bad buisness and they were bought out because they were a sinking ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now take Xbox One , if microsoft botches it, and this goes down weve got two options , well 3 if you count the PC , but NINTENDO
 and SONY are our only choices and like Game Stop, both of them will control basicly most of the way games are sold, NINTENDO not being much compitetion for sony, i can see a scary trend evolving and us having to put up with a monoply in the making.</p>
<p>Its not a good prospect for gamers as a whole, now I know there is no way there are going to be a total loss of sales on the Xbox Ones behalf, hell in my friends complex and surounding areas i know 20 people alone that plan to buy it just for Halo, but rather
 than scream about the problems with the system, lets just sit back and relax, see what happens and all these people getting red in the faces and screaming DRM DRM DRM and Internet conection might end up changing there mind.</p>
<p>Only thing im not sure of is the conect, and i swear to god the playstation 4's camera looked like a copy of the conect ( or was it just me ) so cameras im just going to pleade the fifth on and not say a word past what ive said there is enough flames out
 there already.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But im curious as to what these anti Xbox One people realy think will happen if the box does a circle drain down the toilet like they think they want, do you or they think they will be realy happy with the result.</p>

<p>A console monopoly would be bad. Ideally both consoles should sell well to keep competition going but last thing we want is xbox to fail. This would give Sony a video game monopoly next gen. Nintendo doesn't count because that machine is not really next
 gen.</p>
<p>I remember&nbsp;that generation when Sony ps1&nbsp;dominated. One type of game dominated, crappy linear Japanese games. Forced me to give up consoles and move to PC just so I could play western RPGs and shooters.</p>

<p><span>Hey StreetStyle ,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to AMD, your graphics card is not even compatible with Vista. Only the Radeon 9500 video card or above are supported under
 vista. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the release notes here:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://support.amd.com/us/kbarticles/Pages/737-26590HowdoIfindtheDriverformyProduct.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.amd.com/us/kbarticles/Pages/737-26590HowdoIfindtheDriverformyProduct.aspx</span>
</a></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your card supports DirectX 8.1 whereas Windows 7 require DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My suggestion would be to upgrade your card.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please check Windows 7 system requirement here and ensure that your computer meets the requirement to run Windows 7.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Update &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;. This time it deleted my DvD - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Update &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;. This time it deleted my DvD Drive ... completly</h2>
                    <p>Well this is new and old at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The newest update not only caused older programs working the same day not to work, this is a common issue .... BUT ... Wait for it ... now we have something NEW.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update deleted or hid my DvD drive. &nbsp;This machine is less than a year old &nbsp;and has been quite reliable. So you might understand my confusion on how it just overnight quite working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I &nbsp;looked up and tried the tricks I know but I could find the drive. Fortunately I could press the button and the non-existent drive spit out my dvd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I simply plugged in my portable and that works flawlessly. Problem identified? NOT so fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday when the drive disappeared I rolled back to a previous save point a couple of days ago. (NOTE to any reading ... make sure you do a Restore Point for any update that works ... just saying)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drive didn't come back so figure will have to replace the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well last night as I logged out ... I get notification of an update. I let it run and this morning I boot up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I do is check to see if my old program works, once burned ..or is that 3 or 4 or 5 ... nvm&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It didn't. I did the ever popular MS reboot ... sometimes that makes the world right. Not this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I go to my restore, and I go back further to a restore point I created. It was a quick restore, 10 minutes or so ... and guess what.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer now has its DvD drive back and working and my old program purrs like a kitten.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WTH his going on. I dread updates and what would cause this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am seriously considering doing a fresh install of Windows 7 pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its too bad but this has to stop. I ACTUALLY like Windows 10 when it behaves itself. &nbsp;Sadly that is not often enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions on what to do now. Back to back of the same updates have caused program issues and taken a drive away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP.</p>

</p><p>I appreciate the thought maybe I didn't make myself clear. The drive worked perfectly after the restore. it is working fine now. it was not the drive nor the driver. For some reason the update caused the DvD to become invisible. The system is new and the
 drivers are updated regularly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the thought. If the driver had corrupted restore would not have changed the driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again thanks for the thought and the response, both are appreciated.</p>

    <title>Fail to unmount &#40;eject&#41; attached USB drives or mounted ISOs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danny fedor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fail to unmount &#40;eject&#41; attached USB drives or mounted ISOs</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with "safely removing" attached USB drives. This problem might have been triggered when I unplugged USB drive without clicking on safe remove in Windows 10 (I'm not 100% sure though). When I now attach USB drive, Windows 10 correctly detects
 it and allows me to access it. When I however click on "safely remove", nothing happens. No warning about "drive busy", but also no unmounting, and the system still shows drive letter and the drive itself is still accessible. The same thing happens if I click
 on the drive letter and choose eject. Same thing if I go through "Computer management" and choose "eject". The system completely ignores the command.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I manually unplug the USB drive, Windows seems to not notice and still lists its drive letter and sometimes after clicking on it, even the directory structure and files as if the drive was still attached. Usually after a wile the drive ceases to be accessible,
 but its letter remains in the system. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I&nbsp;again attach the same USB drive (or any other for that matter), I can't access it however. The system does not create any other drive letter and doesn't allow me to access it through the same one. However, it seems something IS going in the background
 because quite often if I try restart or shutdown the computer afterwards, it hangs on the screen with "Restarning" or "Please wait for the System Event Notification Service" (the latter usually when I do the shutdown). I have to manually turn off the PC in
 such a case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens with all the USB ports and all USB drives. Other USB peripherals (mouse, keyboard, USB dongle for 4G internet) seem to work properly. It doesn't seem to be a hardwer issue, since in Linux (which I have in dual boot) everything works flawlessly
 and there's no issue with USB drives whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have flashed BIOS just to be sure, but to no effect. I also tried to uninstall USB hubs through Device manager and install drivers anew, but again no help. Yesterday I upgraded Windows 10 to April 2018 version, but the issue has carried over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect the issue resides not specifically in USB controllers, but perhaps in the part of the system which handles unmounting of volumes. The reason is that when I use standard Windows 10 mechanism to mount ISO image by double-clicking on it, it gets a
 separate letter attached, and I can see files it contains (as I correctly should). However if I click on this virtual drive and choose "eject" in order to unmount the ISO image, it again does nothing. The drive letter remains attached and the contents of the
 ISO file remain accessible. If I restart or shutdown Windows, it again hangs as in previous case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded two programs providing virtual drives -- Daemon Tools and OSFMount. I tried to mount the ISO image with them. Both mounted the image correctly. When unmounting the image, they both froze however. Restarting Windows failed again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is my personal believe both those programs call some system service or suchalike in order to unmount the virtually created drive. The same service is called when I try to safely remove USB drive or when trying to eject "ISO drive" created by Windows 10
 when accessing ISO image through Explorer. That service or its part either might not start properly, or is broken, or some garbage in registry might cause it some trouble or I don't know. In fact I'm not sure there is such a unified service or a system call
 or even if there is, if it indeed is the root cause of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore I'm looking for help -- if someone may sense where the problem lies or even how to fix it, please let me know.</p>

<p>Poisé, eu precisava saber de alguém que ainda joga ele no Xbox 360. Mas entendo que possa estar meio antigo

<h2>            Memory_Management appears often, and then the PC restarts</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to Windows 10, my PC often shuts down without a warning with the error code "Memory_Management".</p>
<p>There is no specific time it will happen, it can be right after starting up the PC, or in the middle of the day after I've been working on it a few hours.</p>
<p>It is a&nbsp;stationary computer, and I haven't experienced any trouble at all, back when it was running Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have an idea as what this could be?</p>

            <p>The link worked great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were several different blue screen errors with no third party driver shown as causing the crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may indicate a hardware issue such as the motherboard not being totally compatible with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However there was a KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED (1e) stop error where the process that crashed was the PSANHost.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PSANHost.exe is a Panda process and Panda drivers appear to be dated from Feb 2015 so may not be totally compatible with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might suggest to uninstall, at least temporarily, Panda and see if that helps. Use just Windows 10 built-in antivirus (Windows Defender) and firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I would suggest to uninstall,&nbsp;at least temporarily, Daemon Tools as it's driver (dtsoftbus01.sys) can be problematic.</p>
