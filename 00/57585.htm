<p>------------------</p>
<p>Once you have installed it, all you need to do is change the product key located on the Certificate of Authenticity (COA). Lets take a look at how to do that.
</p>
<p>Click Start, right click Computer</p>
<p>Click Properties</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset1_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d461%26amp%3bh%3d145" /></a></p>
<p>Scroll down to Windows activation.</p>
<p>You will notice it displays a time until Activation but be completed. Also the Product ID indicates it is using a default key, this is only for the 30 day grace period allowed until you must activate Windows 7.
</p>
<p>Click the link, <strong>Change product key</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset2_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d455%26amp%3bh%3d398" /></a></p>
<p>Enter the product key located on the COA sticker located at the bottom or (sometimes in the battery compartment of your laptop), you can also find it at the top or side if its a Desktop computer.&nbsp; It looks something like the following:</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/image2.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fimage_thumb2.png%3fw%3d438%26amp%3bh%3d156" /></a></p>
<p>Proceed to enter the product key and click Next</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset3_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d460%26amp%3bh%3d403" /></a></p>
<p>Wait while Windows attempts to activate.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset4_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d459%26amp%3bh%3d402" /></a></p>
<p>If all goes well, within a minute, you should see this screen. </p>
<p>You can further confirm Windows 7 is activated by checking the Windows Activation status:</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set5.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset5_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d468%26amp%3bh%3d98" /></a></p>
<p>Notice Windows 7 now displays OEM within the Product ID to indicate the product channel it is licensed from. Please note, this also works with Windows Vista if you are still running that version.</p>
<p>If you are unable to activate Windows 7 using the Change product key method, you can try phone activation and speak with a call agent who will assist with reactivating Windows 7:</p>
<p>How to activate Windows 7 manually (activate by phone)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1) Click Start, and in the Search box type:&nbsp;&nbsp; slui.exe&nbsp; 4<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2) Next press the ‘ENTER’ key<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3) Select your ‘Country’ from the list.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4) Choose the ‘Phone Activation’ option.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
5) Stay on the phone (do not select/press any options) and wait for a person to help you with activation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
6) Explain your problem clearly to the support person.<br />

<h2>            Bluetooth not showing up in my device manager</h2>
                    I've been trying to connect my wireless headphones to my laptop that runs windows 10 only to find out Bluetooth isn't displayed on my device manager. I had no button to turn my Bluetooth on or off the laptop only has the f12 button for wireless connectivity.
 The Bluetooth options are available when I search for Bluetooth settings yet when I try to connect something , it can't find any devices or I'm told to turn on my Bluetooth and this might solve the problem. I've tried everything with regards to what's available
 online so far and no joy , also having difficulty finding the driver need to install in hope to get it working, Any help appreciated&nbsp;

<h2>            how to turn off face detection in win10</h2>
                    <p>I don't mean the windows hello. It's nice to use it when signing in.</p>
<p>The camera automatically detecting my face when I use my computer. If it can't find me, the screen would be shadowed, and blacked, and finally the computer would sleep.</p>
<p>How can I change this? I don't want to sit properly while watching a long movie. Sometime I just want to stay computer opening and playing music when I just left two meters away and do some homework.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And what's the point of the setting of after how long without touch the computer would sleep in power plan? If my face don't show up for two minutes the computer would sleep anyway.</p>

    <title>Family Safety no longer works - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Family Safety no longer works</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft Family safety used to work on my Win10 PC, but it no longer works for about 2-3 weeks. I no longer receive any reports of my kids activity, and when I log-in to MS to look up things online - there's absolutely nothing. As if they did not use a
 computer for the last 3 weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's weird, though, is that time limits still work, and my kids can even ask me for more time, and I can grant them more time, and this works. It doesn't show up in the history, though - no apps, no time, no websites. Website filtering and app filtering
 no longer works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what happened? Was there an "update" that broke Family Safety?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most importantly - any idea how to fix this?</p>
<p>

            <p>Geethu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. Unfortunately - it does not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I mentioned, I've set-up Family Safety a couple of months ago - when I upgraded to Windows 10. I created email accounts for my kids (IMHO: nonsense) and set up a family with myself as a parent. This was working pretty well for over a month:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;- time limits were generally working</p>
<p>&nbsp;- internet restrictions were working even for Opera (we don't use MS browsers as a rule).</p>
<p>&nbsp;- app limits were OK, but my sons actually never tested them</p>
<p>&nbsp;- reporting was great - each week I was receiving email for each of my sons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- requesting more time was the ONLY thing that did NOT work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, suddenly, all of the above stopped working EXCEPT time limits. What's more interesting - now requesting more time works correctly. Internet limits, app limits and reporting are completely off, like these features never existed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We did not install ANY new software in the last month - only MS updates. I bet one of them broke Family Safety.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if there are any settings that are incorrect, or "web filtering is not setup correctly" - is there a way for me to find out? From my perspective all is correct - I did not mess with anything there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

<p>
</p><div>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and will guide you in the right direction.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Going forward, web browsing limits and web browsing activity reporting will now only apply to Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer.</strong> Until now, our family settings have worked on other browsers, but the companies that provide those browsers
 frequently make changes, which can break the technology we created for their last version. Since we don't know about those changes before they happen, we can't fix those breaks fast enough to keep kids protected. Therefore, we will focus on making family settings
 work seamlessly for Microsoft products and services, including Microsoft’s web browsers, Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer. We still provide web browsing limits on Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer, and will only report web browsing activity from those
 browsers. We’ve extended that protection to Windows 10 mobile devices, too. <strong>
To keep your kids from using browsers not supported by Family, choose Block where you see those browsers in each child’s Recent activity.<br />

            <p>There have been lots of issues with Family Safety not working.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you're not completely broken, one possibility is to log into the child's account, click on their account picture or image, and select
<strong>Make Changes to my account in PC Settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> See if the <strong>
Verify </strong>option is highlighted.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that something can cause the local account to need to re-authenticate with&nbsp;the cloud based account.&nbsp;&nbsp; And while the protected account can continue to login, all the family safety stuff which is tied to the cloud
 account simply goes idle.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that this situation occurs and no notification goes out to the parents of the child account is a major design flaw.&nbsp;&nbsp; And it's not as if people stumble into account management on a regular basis, let alone the minor child.</p>

            Hi,
<div>Thanks for asking this question in Microsoft Community!<br />
<div>I understand that you need to extend the record time on Windows XP.<br />
<div>I would suggest you to refer the following steps and check if it helps.</div>
<div>To increase the maximum recording time in the Sound Recorder utility: </div>
<div>a. Make sure that you have installed a functional microphone, and then start the Sound Recorder utility.
<br />
b. Click Record, and then let Sound Recorder run for 60 seconds.<br />
c. After Sound Recorder stops recording, click Save As on the File menu, and name the file Blank.wav.<br />
d. To increase the maximum recording time in Sound Recorder, click Insert File on the Edit menu, and then insert the Blank.wav file that you saved in step 3. When you do this, the maximum recording time is increased by 60 seconds. You can repeat this step once
 for each additional minute of recording time that you want to add. For example, for a 5-minute recording time, insert the Blank.wav file five times.</div>
<div><br />
To make Sound Recorder use the extended length of recording time automatically: </div>
<div>a. Right-click Start, and then click Open.<br />
b. Double-click the Programs folder. <br />
c. Double-click the Accessories folder. <br />
d. Double-click the Multimedia folder or the Entertainment folder. <br />
e. Right-Click Sound Recorder, and then click Properties. <br />
f. Click the Shortcut tab. <br />
g. In the Target box, press the END key, press the SPACEBAR, and then type the location of the Blank.wav file.<br />
<br />
For example, if the target is "C:\Windows\sndrec32.exe", and the location of the Blank.wav file is C:\Blank.wav, the new line in the Target box is "C:\Windows\sndrec32.exe C:\Blank.wav"<br />
<div>The next time you start Sound Recorder, the Blank.wav file opens automatically. After you record your new .wav file, you can click Delete After Current Position on the Edit menu to remove the extra blank space in the file.<br />
<br />
Note: When you finish recording and editing your new .wav file, save the file with a new file name.<br />
Hope it helps. For any further Windows related assistance, feel free to contact us and we will be glad to help.<br />

XP Sound&nbsp;Recorder is limited to 60 seconds.<br />

The freeware Audacity may be worth a try.<br />

<h2>            Task Manager has unknown publisher and failing Updates</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I've noticed that when I open Task Manager it says that the publisher is unknown. Looking on some forums most say to do an sfc /scannow. This yields the result -</p>
<p>"Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to Windows Update and that has error 0x800b0001 and 0x80246007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run the Windows updater troubleshooter states "An error occured while troubleshooting: A problem is preventing the troubleshooter from starting" Error code 0x800B0003.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, trying to manually install updates has error "Installer encountered an error: 0x800B0001" Unknown trust provider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, when updating Virus and Threat Definitions they haven't been successfully updated since 27th Deccember 2018. I get error code -2145124318</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 Pro 1803 OS Build 17134.472</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks all!</p>

</p><p>I've done that and it completed successfully but I'm having the same issues. Also, I've noticed that Windows Store Apps and built in ones have a exclamation mark in a circle and when I try to open them I get:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to provide you with a quick resolution, please reply to this question:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&
</span></p>
<p>I’m glad to provide you with these steps which will help you to troubleshooting the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The STOP 0xC000021A error occurs when either Winlogon.exe or Csrss.exe fails. When the Windows NT kernel detects that either of these processes has stopped, it
 stops the system and raises the STOP 0xC000021A error.</p>

            That advice is peculiar and I suspect further assistance you offered <i>will
</i>be needed since for that message, I don't think one is going to get past step 1 in the article you posted (could be wrong though).<br />
<br />
Notice the difference in the status message that the OP posted <b>0xc0000135 </b>
is not the same as the status message in the the KB article you posted which is this:
<b>0xc0000034</b><br />
<br />
I have in my notes several reasons you might see a message reported by the OP:<br />
<br />
STOP: c000021a {Fatal System Error}<br />
The Windows Logon Process terminated unexpectedly with a status of <b>0xc0000135</b> (0x00000000 0x00000000).<br />
The system has been shut down.<br />
<br />
(Note that those are zeros and now ohs)<br />
<br />
None of the examples I have for the message reported by the OP involve winlogon.exe or csrss.exe, but I do know the messages you will get it either are missing or corrupt:<br />
<br />
If the winlogon.exe file is missing, you will get this message:<br />
<br />
STOP: c000021a {Fatal System Error}<br />
The Windows Logon Process terminated unexpectedly with a status of 0xc0000034 (0x0000000 0x0000000).<br />
The system has been shut down.<br />
<br />
If the winlogon.exe file is corrupt, you will get this message<br />
<br />
STOP: c000021a {Fatal System Error}<br />
The Windows Logon Process terminated unexpectedly with a status of 0xc000012f (0x0000000 0x0000000).<br />
The system has been shut down.<br />
<br />
If the csrss.exe file is missing, you will get this message:<br />
<br />
STOP: c000021a {Fatal System Error}<br />
The Session Manager Initialization System Process terminated unexpectedly with a status of 0xc0000034 (0x0000000 0x0000000).<br />
The system has been shut down.<br />
<br />
If the csrss.exe file is corrupt, you will get this message:<br />
<br />
STOP: c000021a {Fatal System Error}<br />
The Session Manager Initialization System Process terminated unexpectedly with a status of 0xc0000020 (0x0000000 0x0000000).<br />
The system has been shut down.<br />
<br />
Let's hope further assistance will not be needed.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can try to delete the printer from safe mode and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1:</span></p>
<p><span>You can refer to the following article to boot in safe mode:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Start your computer in safe mode</a><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Step 2: To remove Printer.</span></p>
<p><span>You can refer to the following article to remove the printer.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Add-or-remove-a-printer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add or remove a printer</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>After deleting the printer, you can boot in normal mode and try installing the Canon printer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

</p><p>Hello Karen,</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>No. It was not the first time AKG NC60 was on it but I did not use it for more than 5 minutes at first time. But since I decided to do some sound editing, I gave a serious test this time. I notice that the background noise was severely noticeable. Initially,
 I thought it was the way original sound (a few test video clips from the Dolby Atmos app) recorded. But it was the sound system on SB2 that causing the sound of pops, cracks and some hisses. But when I select the "Windows Sonic for headphone" option, the problem
 disappears. When a wired headset was used, the sound was great as well. I was able to
<span>enjoyed sooooo much </span>in latter two options. But with the "Dolby Atmos for headphone" option, it was terrible. I tested on other laptop from Dell. it sounded GOOD on all options.</li><li>Yes. My built in speaker works well (not loud enough though).</li><li><span>I tested on other laptop from Dell, it sounded GOOD on all three options (a wired headphone, Windows Sonics for headphone and Dolby Atmos for Headphone).
</span>I used the LG BT wireless Headset and the results were the same. Terrible on SB2 and great on the Dell laptop. I definitely think it is the SB2 sound card/driver.</li><li>My OS is the latest one available from the Windows Update. WIndows 10 Pro, 1809, 2/5/2019, 17763.437</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you'd be able to find a solution for this issue which it seems that others have them too. Maybe replacement of the sound card? Updated Driver? whatever the solution is... will be welcomed.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

</p><p>I have had many idiopathic issues with blue tooth and the Marvell wireless blue tooth chip on my Surface Studio 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solutions to issues include switching to mic/mono option in audio. disconnecting and reconnecting etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to be manifold, sometimes I think it's the Dolby drivers, which come and go as they please. Sometimes I have Dolby as an option, other times it just disappears as if it isn't installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other times it looks like it is the Marvell wireless/blue tooth which sometimes have issues when both wireless and blue tooth are working hard .. ie downloading, typing/mousing both use blue tooth and then 24 bit APTX audio (Sony MH1000X - Surface Headphones)
 seems to beat the Marvell into submission.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have heard from other users of Blue tooth issues like this being related somehow to the power saving and device wake-up interactions and settings and that turning power saving off helps. Your device being a mobile device probably has those settings by
 default.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't say that there is an answer, I honestly think Windows 10 has a hard time orchestrating all the demands made on this one poor chip, or a combination of OS and drivers out of whack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything suggestion to fix the window store app not working. NOT ONE THING WORKED! So either you all are having a different issue then me, or something seriously has to be wrong for so many&nbsp; of you to have this issue.&nbsp; I have even tried the
 lovely troubleshooter that you have on here. It can't even detect a problem. So you need to figure out the problem and fix it for everyone! Thanks. I am so pissed off right now too.

            I have tried powershell, wsrest.exe and all the ones I could find. I now have it opening but it will not sign in. No matter how many times I try to sign in, nothing happens. Which is why I really think it needs to be fixed. So much frustration can drive
 you crazy and not want this Windows. I have know many that have gone back to their old one because of the issues you are having.

            <p>Nope nadda, did not work. The fixing thing even says that using the powershell thing to fix it, actually breaks the windows app. As there is a bug in that version of Windows 10. So it did not work. I've just about had it. If they have a bug in their program
 they should be much quicker at fixing it then this. Sighs </p>

<h2>            XP backup utility, no floppy</h2>
                    I just did a backup of my entire XP system to an external hard drive. However, I did this using the backup utility on XP, which requires a floppy disk right at the end. I don't have a floppy disk drive! The backup file seems to have saved saved onto my
 ED. Will this be enough if I have a massive computer failure? (My laptop's on it's last legs, so I really need to be assured I have a reliable backup:/)

            Probably not the best idea...<br />
<br />
If you are using/relying on the built in NT Backup to backup your system, that is primitive technology (obviously - since it wants a floppy).&nbsp; If you have a disaster (even a minor one), you are going to have a big problem trying to recovery your stuff.<br />
<br />
If you want to make a backup, it makes sense to use <span style="font-style: italic">
modern</span> technology - and that technology is not built in to XP.<br />
<br />
There are lots of popular options for third party XP backup and imaging software(s).<br />
<br />
A popular one folks seem to like is from <a href="http://www.acronis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Acronis</a>.<br />
<br />
With that (free 30 day trial) you backup, make a bootable CD or bootable USB (that's modern, huh?) and use that in the event of a disaster.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
They used to have a totally free version - maybe not anymore - just the trial, then you have to buy it, but it is well respected.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
It is so much more robust than the XP backup, it is laughable.<br />
<br />
Many other options if you do a little Googling...<br />
<br />
Here are some products that LemP suggested might be appealing:<br />
<br />
Macrium Reflect<br />
Paragon Backup and Recovery<br />
DriveImageXML<br />
<br />
Some disk cloning softwares to Google:<br />
<br />
Acronis True Image Home 11<br />
Easeus ToDo Backup<br />
Paragon Drive Copy&nbsp; or Partition Manager Personal<br />
Casper<br />
Norton Ghost<br />

<p>Solutions</p>
<p>To solve this problem, try the following solutions.</p>
<p>Solution 1: Check the Xbox Live service status</p>
<p>If you see any alerts here, wait until the service is up and running and try again:</p>
<p>Xbox Live Core Services: &nbsp;up and running </p>
<p>‎01‎/‎12‎/‎2015‎ ‎08‎:‎20‎:‎38 &nbsp;</p>
<p>Solution 2: Test your Xbox Live connection</p>
<p>1.Scroll left from Home to open the guide. </p>
<p>2.Select Settings or say “Xbox, go to settings.” </p>
<p>3.Select All Settings. </p>
<p>4.Select Network. </p>
<p>5.Select Network Settings. </p>
<p>6.Scroll right and select Test network connection. </p>
<p>If you get the "Everything is good" message, try to sign in to your Xbox Live profile. If you don't get this message, try the Xbox One Network Connection Error Solution.
</p>
<p>Solution 3: Remove and re-add your account</p>
<p>1.Remove your account from the console. Here’s how: a.Scroll left from Home to open the guide.
</p>
<p>b.Select Settings or say “Xbox, go to settings.” </p>
<p>c.Select All Settings. </p>
<p>d.Under Account, select Remove accounts. </p>
<p>e.Scroll right and highlight your account to select it. </p>
<p>f.Select Remove. </p>
<p>2.Restart your console. Here's how: a.Scroll left on the Home screen to open the guide.
</p>
<p>Note Double-tapping the Xbox button will open the guide from any other screen on the console.
</p>
<p>b.Select Settings. </p>
<p>c.Select Restart console. </p>
<p>d.Select Yes to confirm. </p>
<p>Note If you're unable to access the guide or if the console appears to be frozen, press and hold the Xbox button on the console for 10 seconds, until the console turns off. After the console shuts down, touch the Xbox button on the console again to restart.
</p>
<p>3.Re-add your account to the console. Here's how:</p>
<p>a.Scroll left to open the guide and select Sign in. </p>
<p>b.Scroll down to Manage accounts. </p>
<p>c.Select Add new. </p>
<p>d.Enter your Microsoft account email address and password, and then select Enter.
</p>
<p>e.Verify the privacy settings you've set for your account. These apply to any Xbox One console that you sign in to.
</p>

<p>g.On the Choose a color screen, select the color for your Home screen to differentiate between you and others using this console.
</p>
<p>h.Select Next. </p>
<p>i.When you're reminded of the gamerpic that's associated with your profile, select Next.
</p>
<p>j.Select your sign-in preferences. </p>
<p>Solution 4: Remove all accounts on the console </p>
<p>If you have a large number of accounts saved to your console, remove all of them and restart the console before re-adding your account as outlined in Solution 3 above. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If, after removing all accounts and re-adding yours, you still cannot sign in, you will need to restore factory settings on the console. Please read and follow the instructions found here very carefully. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Warning Restoring your console to the factory default settings erases all accounts, apps, games, saved games, and settings. Anything not synchronized with Xbox Live will be lost. Your console syncs with Xbox Live automatically when it is connected with the
 service. </p>
<p>If you're still experiencing the issue, contact Xbox support.</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Usually when you install Windows 10 all the drivers for the hardware gets installed with the operating system files. If you are facing any issues with the drivers installation, then I would suggest you to go to the device manager and right click on the device
 so that you will have the option to upgrade the drivers. If you are still facing the issue, then you can download the drivers for that particular hardware from the manufacturers website and install in compatibility mode. Also check with the computer manufacturer
 to see if there are any updated drivers for Windows 10.<br />
<br />

            This isn't a helpful reply and is the same received when talking to MS frontline support.&nbsp; Of the two options available, both do not work with the controller or wireless headset.&nbsp; To say we should download the drivers from the manufacturer when the manufacturer
 is Microsoft is insulting to your customers.

            <p>After messing around with this for some time, I have gotten mine to work, partially. The controller connects and works with my Steam games, but does not work when attempting to play XboxOne games on my Desktop. The indicator on the remote shows that it is
 connected to the adapter properly, but there is no response from any game/applications running on my PC from my XboxOne.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps I used to get the controller working with Steam are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press Windows + X</p>
<p>2. Click device manager.</p>
<p>3. Find your unrecognized device</p>
<p>4. Right click it and select "Update driver software"</p>
<p>5. Browse computer manually</p>
<p>6. Click "Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer"</p>
<p>7. Choose the Wireless Xbox driver that has the latest version.</p>

            If you select Xbox 360 peripherals then click next, I chose the wireless receiver for windows 10 with the latest update - I think it was sometime in 2015. As soon as I selected that and pressed next my controller finally connected.

    <title>Unable to configure PS3 controller on Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kurtwessman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to configure PS3 controller on Windows 8</h2>
                    I am unable to configure my Playstation 3 controller on my Windows 8 computer. The system says that the device is ok, and properly installed. Some programs, such as Joytokey, are able to detect it, but others, like Motioninjoy, are not able to. I have
 also tried installing it on another usb port, with no luck. Any help?

            <p>Hi Kurt, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting the query in Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you say that "<strong>Some programs, such as Joytokey, are able to detect it, but others, like Motioninjoy, are not able to</strong>" I would say then the issue may be with the program Motioninjoy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore I would recommend you to re-install the program Motioninjoy and make sure it is the latest one and see if the PlayStation 3 controller works properly.
</p>

            It's not just the program. My computer cannot configure the controller through Device Manager.. My computer recognizes the controller, but I cannot use it.

<p>Hi, I have the same issue, before (like a week ago) I had ove 100fps all the time (maybe 90fps at a demanding moment), however, at some point for some reason now the game struggles to get 60 fps,and before that was done easily,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started monitoring with MSI afterburner and the problem is the gpu usage is about at 50%, and thats probably why it has so low fps, i tried using the stable driver for gears of war (382.53), but is even worse. I really dont know how to solve it, oh and
 also i did windows reset, but still the same crappy thing, so i guess rip gow 4 streaming and move on.\</p>

<p><span>Microsoft has received reports that some Bluetooth devices cease to work while engaged in a 2.4GHz WIFI connection. Similarly, there are reports that Bluetooth devices function normally until they switch their computer from a 5.0 GHz WIFI connection
 to a 2.4GHz WIFI connection.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Many WIFI access points or hotspots are 2.4 GHz connections.<span>&nbsp; </span>
So, for example, you may experience this issue if you connected to a WIFI hotspot, or if your wireless router automatically switches to a 2.4 GHz connection to maintain a proper connection.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In this case, switching back to the 5.0 GHz network does not fix the issue.&nbsp; Furthermore, a new Bluetooth device cannot be paired once in this state.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>These scenarios are related to a known issue for <strong>Intel Driver version 19.30</strong>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Intel has fixed this issue by releasing updated driver versions 19.50+.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To resolve this issue, install the updated Bluetooth driver.<span>&nbsp; </span>
If you do not have an Intel Wireless Bluetooth driver, and your Bluetooth is not working, try the troubleshooting steps at

<h2>            Map App Crashes at the start on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>The first time I have launched Map App has worked fine, now everytime I try to launch the App crashes instantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The error</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Faulting module name</span>: <em>twinapi.appcore.dll</em>, version:

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What I have tried <strong>with no result</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>-Check drivers and update to latest stable version drivers</p>
<p>-Check the system files integrity with sfc /scannow and dism tools and everything seems ok</p>
<p>-Clear App cache and temp files</p>
<p>-Remove and reinstall Map App</p>
<p>-Disable third party services</p>
<p>-Create another account to check if the App works in the other account (but same issue)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestion? Searching on the forum seems that other people in past have faced this issue and has been suggested a Microsoft App troubleshooter ("<em>AppsDiagnostic.diagcab")&nbsp;that unfortunately not supports final release of Windows 10.</em></p>
<p>All other apps works, also apps that use maps themselves(.g. Meteo App) &nbsp;so probably there is something wrong in this App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Siimilar problem reported also for the preview version of Windows 10:</p>

            <p>I had the same problem and I was able to resolve the issue with Microsoft by doing the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to&nbsp;the registry (RegEdit in the search)</li><li>Add ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES Read privileges to&nbsp;the groups below.&nbsp; To do this Right-Click on the folders named below and then click on Permissions.&nbsp; Click on Add, and then type the word 'All' (make sure the location is set to your local computer for those
 on a domain) and click Check Names and it should automatically pull up ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES group.&nbsp; Click OK and then make sure to give that group Read Permissions.
<ol>
<li>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</li><li>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt; HARDWARE</li><li>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt; DRIVERS (If you have this folder)</li><li>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt; SAM</li><li>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt; SECURITY</li><li>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt; SOFTWARE</li><li>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt; SYSTEM</li><li>HKEY_USERS</li></ol>
</li><li>Then on your windows installation drive, e.g., C:\, right click on "Program Files" folder&nbsp;and go to the Security tab, click on Edit,&nbsp;and again add (if its not there already)&nbsp;ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES group&nbsp;but this time you are giving it the following permissions
 (defaulted but check anyways), "Read &amp; execute", "List folder contents", "Read".&nbsp;</li><li>Click OK and it will chug through applying the permissions.&nbsp; You might get a popup with permissions errors&nbsp;for a few folders (most likely for Windows Defender) but just click&nbsp;continue several times and you'll get through it.</li><li>That's it, you should now be able to open up all your apps.</li></ol>
<p>Just a note, some of the registry folders already had the ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES group but some didn't so you're just finding the ones that don't have that.</p>

            <p>I had the Maps app crashing after upgrading to the full release of Windows 10.&nbsp; I am not big on messing with&nbsp;registry settings/permissions as was posted.&nbsp; Instead, I opened PowerShell, ran Get-AppXPackages to see what was installed.&nbsp; I scrolled down the
 list until I saw the Microsoft.WindowsMaps app.&nbsp; I copied the PackageFullName: which on my machine was Microsoft.WindowsMaps_4.1506.50715.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe.&nbsp; I then ran remove-appxpackage Microsoft.WindowsMaps_4.1506.50715.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe</p>
<p>
</p><p>After it finished I went to C:\Program Files (make sure you are viewing hidden folders)&nbsp; went into the WindowsApps folder which doesn't directly allow you in.&nbsp; Have to click on the security tab link in the popup window.&nbsp; Then change the owner of the folder
 to something like Administrators which should include your own account.&nbsp; Once it is done you should be able to get into the WindowsApps folder where you will see all your installed apps.&nbsp; I scrolled down and found the file for the Maps app and deleted it also
 emptying the trash.&nbsp; After that I went to the Store app and downloaded the Maps app again.&nbsp; It installed and is working just fine now.</p>

            <p>I decided to log out and back in after step 2, either something about that, or something I inadvertently did caused the user profile service to quit working so I was unable to log in. Still didn't work after a full on reboot. I had to use system restore
 (shift F8 while PC is starting up) to log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Probably the first use of System Restore on windows 10!-<br />
<br />
Hoping we can get a better fix to this!</p>

            If you log into safe mode and load up the programs that are crashing what error comes up? &nbsp;I found that when I was in safe mode I actually received a permission error that I never saw in regular mode. I know there can be more reasons for the app crashing
 then just the fix I posted for. I've also seen people have success by taking ownership of the Program Files folder.&nbsp;
