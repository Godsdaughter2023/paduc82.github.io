<p>Hey there Profane,<br />
<br />
That definitely is an odd issue.<br />
<br />
A couple questions to help clarify:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you able to use those apps with a different profile on your console? </li><li>Are you connected to Xbox Live? </li><li>Have you ever been able to access those services? </li><li>You get that message with just the xbox video app </li><li>Can you use other apps like Xbox Music or Youtube, etc? </li></ol>
<p><br />
<br />
Please let us know and we'll work from there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Same thing is happening to me when I try to stream something from my phone to the Xbox I had no problems until today.</p>
<p>To answer a few questions above:</p>
<p>1. I can use all my apps with different profiles.</p>
<p>2. yes I am connected to Xbox Live</p>
<p>3.as I stated before I had no problem streaming until today</p>
<p>4. I get the message whenever I am trying to stream a video</p>
<p>5. YouTube video works and so do all my other apps</p>

<p>The apps were down for that time being and the store is still down it will not let you buy things. This may be due to the fact that the marketplace is switching to currency instead of points apps should be running by now only the store is down still.</p>

            Do you have two-factor authentication on your account?
<br />If so then you’ll require an app specific password which is entered instead of the account password. 
<br />If you don’t then many have had success by setting this up &amp; then disabling it.

    <title>Windows 10 with Epson Surecolor p800 printer - User-designated sizes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alwarfield  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 with Epson Surecolor p800 printer - User-designated sizes won&#39;t work</h2>
                    My p800 printer ( about 16 months old) worked fine with Windows 7, and still does. I use the network driver, so my port is the EPFCA994:SCp800 Series. I can print sizes that Epson includes in the driver from the Windows 10 computer just fine. When I define
 a size that is not included and save it, that works while I'm in the driver, but when I go back to the Photoshop print dialog, the paper size defaults to letter size. I have tried re-downloading the driver and reinstalling several times - same answer. I can
 access the file on my Windows 7 laptop and print it using the same driver, over the network to the same printer. User-defined sizes work that way, so I can print, but it is much slower than it was when I had a Windows 7 desktop and 4 GB of ram. My new computer
 has 32 GB of ram but this problem means I can't use roll paper or 7x10 note card paper, etc. I spent a day calling and trying to talk to Epson techs, but they had not heard of this problem, and said they may try setting it up

            Hi,<br />
<br />
It is possible that we are facing a compatibility issue between your printer's driver and Windows 10. We highly recommend that you contact your printer manufacturer for further assistance on this matter.<br />
<br />
Thank you.

<p>I contacted Epson support as suggested. The tech there looked at my setup with the Windows 10 computer and Epson SureColor p800 printer via remote access. She also watched while I went through the setup of a print using a user-defined size. It was as I had
 described: the user-defined size was not transferred to the print setup and the driver settings that were saved were lost. She asked me to reinstall the driver, which I did, with the same results. Then she said that she set up the same printer with another
 Windows 10 computer, and the driver transferred the user-defined size information and acted normally. This means that it is my computer that is causing the problem. She had no ideas about what that could be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possibilities include interference due to an antivirus program ( I have Norton 360), a port setup, or maybe a setting in Windows 10.&nbsp; I deactivated Norton and the problem was still there.&nbsp; It could be a Windows setting, but what setting would that be? Another
 possibility could be the driver update program I have. Maybe it made improper changes to drivers.</p>
<p>I now have both a USB connection and a network connection to the printer. Both have the same problem when user-defined sizes are involved. I also tried using Publisher 2016 with a user-defined size and the same thing happened.
</p>
<p>I need more ideas about how to fix this problem.</p>

<p>Since the last reply considerable progress has been made on this problem. Through contact with Epson techs The problem has been narrowed down to my computer. It is not a Windows 10 or Epson driver problem. Those have been ruled out by demonstrating successful
 user-defined size usage with a separate system. It also has been shown that either a USB or network connection have the same problem if they are both on my Windows 10 computer. It has also been confirmed using Microsoft Publisher with a user-defined size.
 The failure to transfer saved user-defined sizes to the print dialog is a constant. I believe it is due to a setting on the computer. It may have been changed due to a registry editor through Norton, or a driver updater program.
</p>
<p>Hopefully that will trigger a response from someone who knows more about that than I do. Meanwhile the only way I know to resolve it is to delete the operating system and reinstall it clean. Any other suggestions?<br />

<p>I don't pretend to have a lot of knowledge here, but I ran into this same problem on a new PC with Win 10 that I am moving to and this is how I fixed it. Hope this helps you if you are still having a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I checked the Epson driver security settings against my old PC from the control panel I noticed that my user account (which is an admin account) was missing the check mark on "Manage this printer" on the new PC. I checked this box it to match my old
 PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The real solution however is in the way I then forced the custom settings down to the user account to be available in the Adobe and other applications from my user account. Basically I set the custom settings up from the control panel version of the driver,
 exported the settings. Next I went to an application, opened the print setting panel and imported the settings to make them available to my user account. Details follow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, launch the Epson P800 print settings box from the Control Panel (go to Control Panel/ Choose Devices/ Choose Printers/Choose Epson Printer/Click on Manage.) Click on Printing Preferences - this opens the Print Settings box. Make any default changes
 here that you want (it comes up as "glossy, I always print on Luster or Matte, so I choose luster here, made my additional changes such as "Mode: No Color Adjustment". Click OK. These will become your new defaults. Close the panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, open the panel again, confirm your default values are still there and and set up your custom settings using the Save/Del button to designate a name for the setting. Before you close this second panel, click on EXPORT and export the setting using

</p><p>Third, go to Photoshop and open an image. Select File/Print to open the print panel. Make sure Epson P800 is selected and click on "Print Settings". Up comes the now familiar panel. Click on the Save/Del button and at the bottom of the new window, click
 on IMPORT. Navigate to the .ssf file you just exported and click "Open". The setting will appear in the list at the top left. Close this window and check that the saved setting is now available from the top "Select Settings" drop-down. This should now look
 familiar to you. Repeat for each setting you want to bring in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These settings will now be available to any application that this user has access to. I know this is a lot more work initially then the way it used to work, but short of uninstalling a lot of stuff and trying figure out what was conflicting to cause the

<p>I don't pretend to have a lot of knowledge here, but I ran into this same problem on a new PC with Win 10 that I am moving to and this is how I fixed it. Hope this helps you if you are still having a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I checked the Epson driver security settings against my old PC from the control panel I noticed that my user account (which is an admin account) was missing the check mark on "Manage this printer" on the new PC. I checked this box it to match my old
 PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The real solution however is in the way I then forced the custom settings down to the user account to be available in the Adobe and other applications from my user account. Basically I set the custom settings up from the control panel version of the driver,
 exported the settings. Next I went to an application, opened the print setting panel and imported the settings to make them available to my user account. Details follow.</p>

<p>Lynne,</p>
<p>Thanks for the post. I did try to use your steps. First, the setup of Control Panel on your Windows 10 computer seems to be a lot different from mine. The Control Panel has the Device Manager, and the Devices and Printers section. The only way to get to
 the Epson driver was to click on it in Devices and Printers. I did that, and looked for the "Manage This Printer" section under the user account - it was also an administrator account - and set anything I could that would give permissions to control the printer.
 By itself that didn't help with my problem. I found the Printer Preferences there, and went through the setting of the default preferences, then reset them to the user-defined size of 17x25", saved that, and then set up the driver to print on 17x25 paper.
 Saved that setting in the driver, and exported the setting to My Documents. All that does is make it a little faster to change the driver to the settings needed for a user-defined size. The real problem is that when I click OK in the Epson Driver and that
 takes me back to the Photoshop print dialog, the 17x25" size does not get transferred to the print dialog. Instead, the default of 8.5x11 size paper is still there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You must not have had the same problem I did, because the solution in your post didn't even mention what happened when you click OK and go back to the print dialog. There are 2 other things of interest here. One is that I got an error when I tried to import
 the setting into the driver. It said the setting was not the correct type. All that would have done was save a little time. But in addition to not transferring the paper size, the saved information in the driver was lost when I clicked OK. Going back into
 the driver showed that neither the paper size I created, or the job settings were there. It was as if I had never saved any information in the driver. And that always happens, even if I use another application (Paint) besides Photoshop to create user-defined
 sizes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can still set up user-defined sizes if I access the printer via another computer on the network. Even though that goes through the same printer which is attached to the Windows 10 computer via a USB cable, I don't have the problem if I go through my Windows
 7 laptop. It's a lot slower, given the slowdown of going through the network, and the much slower laptop, but it still works.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Epson p800 printer developed a mechanical problem, and I obtained a new one. It is also on the same Windows 10 computer. I can still access it via the network, but it still has the same problem if I try to print user-defined sizes directly. I tried uninstalling
 Norton software and the same problem persisted. So it is either some setting, or interference from a program loaded onto the computer. For now all I can do is be happy that I can still get my work done. Never mind that my 32 GB of Ram does me no good if I
 have to use an old laptop to do my printing.</p>

<p>The configurations need to be defined using the print setting panel that is accessed from the control panel, not the one you use when printing from photoshop. These are exported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You then go to the print settings panel accessed from photoshop and import the .ssf files one at a time. They should now be available from photoshop printing. From your description above I don't see that you imported the settings into the application level
 print settings panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The first time I attempted to import .ssf files it failed because my user account did not have permission to manage the printer, hence changing permissions in the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry this didn't fix the problem,they sounded very similar.</p>

<p>Question,</p>
<p>Why is it necessary to set the set the driver for user-defined sizes in Windows 10 from the Control Panel? I don't have to do that if I access the same file on the Windows 10 computer through the network on a Windows 7 or 8 computer and can simply create
 the user-defined size there. The settings on the Windows 7 or 8 computers are not lost when I go to the Photoshop print dialog.
</p>
<p>The problem I am having is not setting user-defined sizes, but that when the user-defined sizes or job specifications are saved in the driver on the Windows 10 computer, that information is lost when I go back to the Photoshop print dialog.</p>
<p>I tried setting the driver up from the Devices and Printers section of the Control panel. That's the only place I can get access to the driver other than the Photoshop print dialog. (Actually there are other ways too - like Paint, but it doesn't work there
 either.) I also tried changing permissions, and I do have permission to manage the driver.
</p>
<p>Maybe the permission to manage the printer isn't the problem for that. (I can export them but not import them.) But importing the settings will only make it easier to set user-defined sizes in the driver, it won't stop the settings from being lost when I
 go back to the Photoshop print dialog. No matter how I set the driver for user-defined sizes, that is lost in Windows 10 - but apparently only on my computer. I may eventually have to take it to where the computer was built and take the printer with me. Maybe
 they can figure out what app/program/setting is causing this problem.</p>

<p>So far I have not taken the computer to the company who built it. I will at some point if I am not able to determine why I have the problem. Thanks for the link. I may want to take that step.</p>
<p>The updates on the computer are current.</p>
<p>The version of Windows is 10.0.16299, Build 16299 (Windows 10 Home).</p>
<p>
</p><p>New firmware was installed (Epson) in the last few days. I checked to see if the settings in the driver were transferred to the Photoshop print dialog after setting to a 17x25 inch user-defined size. None of the saved changes in the driver were transferred
 (the default size of 8.5x11" was there instead), and the driver settings made in that process were not there when the driver was opened up again. All that is consistent with the problem, which still is present.&nbsp;

<p>Thanks for the update on the current status of your concern. Since the firmware was already updated and the issue still persists, we recommend that you get in touch with the developer of the photo editing software that you have to verify why the user-defined
 settings are not importing correctly to their application.</p>

<h2>            Multiple Google Chrome Processes Running and using a lot of CPU precentage</h2>
                    <p><em>Original Title: Multiple Google Chrome Processes Running on Windows 7 PC</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>All of a sudden I have a dozen Google Chrome processes running. The only program I had on my computer was a Google toolbar and Google Earth maps.</p>
<p>I un-installed both of those and rebooted and did nothing. I looked in my programs to un-install Chrome but it is not there. Chrome is eating up a lot of CPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I open the file Location (c)&nbsp;from my task manager there is a logo that looks like chrome but it says Demenfwgprun.exe beside it. Could this be a virus? I have never downloaded chrome before as I always use Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to delete the file when I turned off/unplugged my internet connection. But then when I restarted the computer it came back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I delete Google Chrome when I cannot see where it was ever downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            If the system BSOD (rebooted) we need the DMP files, if it did not we need the event viewer logs<br />
<br />
We do need the actual DMP file as it contains the only record of the sequence of events leading up to the crash, what drivers were loaded, and what was responsible.<br />
<br />
You may be able to get the DMP files without crashing by booting into safe mode (F8) with networking.<br />
<br />
If you are overclocking stop.&nbsp; (chances are if you dont know if you are, you are not)<br />
<br />
To enable us to assist you with your computer's BSOD symptoms, upload the contents of your "\Windows\Minidump" folder.<br />
<br />
The procedure:<br />
<br />
* Copy the contents of \Windows\Minidump to another (temporary) location somewhere on your machine.<br />
* Zip up the copy.<br />
* Attach the ZIP archive to your post using the "paperclip" (file attachments) button.<br />
&nbsp;*Please upload them to a file sharing service like Skydrive or"Rapidshare" and put a link to them in your reply.<br />
<br />
<br />
To ensure minidumps are enabled:<br />
<br />
* Go to Start, in the Search Box type: sysdm.cpl, press Enter.<br />
* Under the Advanced tab, click on the Startup and Recovery Settings... button.<br />
* Ensure that Automatically restart is unchecked.<br />
* Under the Write Debugging Information header select Small memory dump (256 kB) in the dropdown box (the 256kb varies).<br />
* Ensure that the Small Dump Directory is listed as %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
* OK your way out.<br />
* Reboot if changes have been made.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please also run MSinfo32 and upload the output as well.<br />
<br />
To run MSinfo32 please go to start&gt;run&gt;MSinfo32<br />
Go to "file" "save" and upload the saved file with the DMPS<br />
(Instructions for XP, Vista, Win 7, Win 8)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Please provide us with your Event Viewer administrative logs by following these steps:<br />
<br />
<br />
Click Start Menu<br />
Type eventvwr into Search programs and files (do not hit enter)<br />
Right click eventvwr.exe and click Run as administrator<br />
Expand Custom Views<br />
Click Administrative Events<br />
Right click Administrative Events<br />
Save all Events in Custom View As...<br />
Save them in a folder where you will remember which folder and save as Errors.evtx<br />
Go to where you saved Errors.evtx<br />
Right click Errors.evtx -&gt; send to -&gt; compressed (zipped) folder<br />
Upload the .zip file here (if you can) to skydrive or a file sharing service<br />

That isnt a true crash just the video system getting confused and recovering.&nbsp; It will list which in event viewer.<br />

You wont have anything in minidump<br />

    <title>Windows Live Mail removes all line breaks while pasting message text - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> informer9  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live Mail removes all line breaks while pasting message text</h2>
                    Whenever I copy and try to paste HTML text into new message or reply all line breaks are being deleted.<br />
<br />
This is happening with the last 2 or 3 versions of Windows Mail.<br />
<br />
I have upgraded to the newest version today and still PASTE option removes all line breaks.<br />
<br />
<br />
For example. <br />
<br />
I copy text below:<br />
<br />
<b><br />
"Sample text with 2 enters<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Sample text after 3 enters"</b><br />
<br />
<br />
When I paste the text into the message I get text without 3 new lines:<br />
<br />
<b>"Sample text with 2 enters<br />
&nbsp;Sample text after 3 enters"</b><br />
<br />
Paste option works fine for other apps like notepad, microsoft word, etc<br />
<br />
Only last few versions of WLM are removing line breaks.<br />
<br />
Please help. It is very annoying to edit every text after paste command.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To help you with your issue, I suggest that you repair your Windows Live Mail as a workaround. To know how to do it,
 please follow these steps:<br />
<br />
1. Click on<strong><span> Start</span></strong> button.<br />
2. Go to <strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong> and click it.<br />
3. Click on <strong><span>Programs</span></strong> then
<strong><span>Programs and Features</span></strong>.<br />
4. Look for the Windows Live Essentials 2011 program.<br />
5. Hover your mouse to the <strong><span>Windows Live Essentials 2011</span></strong> and right-click on it.<br />
6. Click <strong><span>Uninstall/Change</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>7. Click on
<strong><span>Repair all Windows Live Programs.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<div>Thanks. That works in plain text mode but that does not solve my problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I normally use PASTE function to paste ready to use Replies.</div>

<div>This is MAJOR issue which should be fixed. I have WLM on 3 computers. All new versions have this problem.</div>

            <p>This is an FAQ. The problem is that different HTML editors have different ways of converting line breaks into HTML, i.e. what code is generated when you press the
<em>Enter </em>or <em>Return </em>key. Some of the possibilities are:</p>
<ol>
<li>A&nbsp;line break code &lt;br&gt; or &lt;br /&gt;</li><li>A paragraph code &lt;/p&gt; ... &lt;p&gt;</li><li>A divider code&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt; ... &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p><br />
These all have different effects on the way HTML will be displayed in the viewer. There may be different styles pre-defined for the different elements, and some of those styles may not be available in another HTML editor, which has then to find a workaround
 to try and reproduce the text in a manner as close as possible to the original. For example, the style definition for &lt;p&gt; in the original editor may include padding to produce white space before or after a paragraph, while the &lt;div&gt; doesn't.
<br />
<br />
Windows Live Mail has a simple HTML editor with limited formatting capability. To keep thins simple, when you paste HTML markup from another application, all &lt;p&gt; and &lt;div&gt; tags are reproduced as &lt;div&gt; and assume the default style as specified at Options &gt; Compose.&nbsp;
 Empty &lt;div&gt;s may be removed or replaced by &lt;div&gt;s containing a single non-breaking space.<br />
<br />
I don't know what you normally use as your HTML editor, but I see that when you paste into the editor at this site, each rendered 'paragraph' in fact consists of two &lt;div&gt;s, the first containing the text and the second containing only a line break tag &lt;br /&gt;:<br />
</p>
<div>
<blockquote>&lt;div&gt;I normally use PASTE function to paste ready to use Replies.&lt;/div&gt;<br />
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />
&lt;div&gt;I use it over hundred times a day and text which I am pasting includes links and html.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;<br />
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</blockquote>
<br />
<br />
WLMail&nbsp;uses Internet Explorer as its viewer. This means that changes in IE&nbsp;may affect the way that messages are displayed in WLMail.
<br />
<br />
In order to have some control over how a prepared text will appear when included in a mail message, it's best to use only those formatting options available in WLMail (i.e. font face, size, colour, bold etc., lists) and to use newline (usually
<em>Shift-Enter</em>) instead of paragraph (<em>Enter</em>) to begin new lines.<br />
<br />
If you're using MS Word, then it's quick and easy to use <em>Find/Replace </em>(Ctrl-H) to change paragraphs (^p) to newlines (^l) in your prepared texts. Note that all 'paragraphs' will then assume the paragraph formatting of their predecessor. If you want
 to change this, e.g. to apply indents, then use paragraph (<em>Enter</em>) to start each new one with different paragraph formatting.<br />

            Thanks for that. Could be a great lead to follow ;)<br />
<br />
I have never used any 3rd party editor or other software to format messages. I write them directly in WLM.<br />
<br />
I am using Windows Live mail from the very beginning. I have started using first version on Windows XP and continue to use it on Vista and Windows 7 moving my database from one machine to the other.<br />
<br />
I keep email database. Everything was written in Windows live mail and not edited anywhere else. Before 1 year ago I could COPY any message from SENT ITEMS and PASTE into new message or reply with exactly same format.
<br />
<br />
Now there is the problem to use those old messages written in WLM.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to edit html format template of IE, WORD or WLM to make all those old messages PASTE properly??<br />
<br />
Is there a chance that Windows has changed COPY/PASTE format options over the years?<br />
<br />
Is there a way to EDIT COPY/PASTE features to influence the html code?<br />
<br />

            <blockquote>Is there a way to edit html format template of IE, WORD or WLM to make all those old messages PASTE properly??</blockquote>
<br />
No. If you do use Word, there is in recent versions a 'filter' in the <em>Save </em>
dialogue which will strip out some of the extraneous HTML that would otherwise be retained.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Is there a chance that Windows has changed COPY/PASTE format options over the years?</blockquote>
<br />
Not that I know of. But the behaviour of WLMail has changed, particularly&nbsp;from&nbsp;WLMail 2009 to 2011, and other changes may have arisen from updates to IE.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Is there a way to EDIT COPY/PASTE features to influence the html code?</blockquote>
<p><br />
No. <br />
<br />

<p>Thats real pain and a huge problem for me.&nbsp; Its still not solved. Im sure windows, wlm or IE has some option that I can change to repair it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I paste my html mainly from previous WLM messages which I gather for years. I copy all replies and paste them as new emails.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Everything is fine : links, colors, fonts, etc but line breaks are going crazy.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>They are being removed and then I need to add many new lines to the message before I send it. Its annoying :(</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am sure that problem is within WLM because I have made a simple test.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I created new message and written some text with many line breaks. Sometimes 2 new lines, sometimes 3 between sentences. When I copy this text and paste to a new message - there are no new lines at all :(&nbsp; Everything is line under line with no spaces between
 them.......</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Today I have installed a software DITTO which is clipboard manager saving all COPY moves into a list. That software doesnt support html buy only rich text and installing it fixed my problem partially.&nbsp;&nbsp; Line breaks are working fine but html is not being
 copied cause the software doesn support it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>That is why I had to remove the DITTO and after restarting WLM html copy is working again but line break problem returns.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>That means that small program installation changed something in my system. <br />
</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode with network network function to repair Windows..
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

            Hi William 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Unlike majority of the default Windows apps, Cortana can not be disabled through Powershell. Microsoft wants people to use Cortana. 
<br />
<br />If you want to completely turn off Cortana, then you will need to resort to a registry fix (Note - It is recommended that you create a backup of your registry before modifying so that if you commit some mistake, you will be able to restore - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756/how-to-back-up-and-restore-the-registry-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756...</a> ) 
<br />
<br />Windows Key+R &gt; Type regedit and Enter 
<br />Go to the key - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt; SOFTWARE &gt; Policies &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows 
<br />See if you have a directory named - Windows Search 
<br />If not, then right click on Windows folder &gt; New Key &gt; Give the name Windows Search 
<br />Click Windows Search &gt; In the right-hand side pane, right-click in the empty area and choose New &gt; DWORD (32-bit) Value. Type AllowCortana &gt; Enter 
<br />Double-click AllowCortana, and type in 0 under Value Data. 
<br />Reboot your computer

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This error message: <strong>“Your PC can’t project to another screen. Try reinstalling the driver or using another video card.”</strong> can be caused by certain issues on the video card’s driver. There are instances when
<strong>Windows</strong> performs an automatic update on the drivers but the updates were not fully installed, causing your devices to malfunction. We highly suggest that you uninstall and reinstall the video card driver on your computer by following the steps
 below:</p>

<p>3. Right-click the device and click <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Click <strong>OK</strong> to confirm the removal of the driver.</p>
<p>5. After the uninstallation is done, reboot your computer and it should automatically reinstall the driver.</p>

    <title>Recording with OBS and Windows 10 Game Stream - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cody h.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recording with OBS and Windows 10 Game Stream</h2>
                    Last night I wanted to see what would happen if I used the Windows 10 Xbox stream and recorded with OBS. At first glance it was awesome, being able to have Halo on my nicer monitor instead of my **** TV. When I went back to watch it though the game sound
 was amplified and there was a single echo. (I didn't change any of my OBS setting so the game sound shouldn't have been louder). I'm assuming that OBS recorded the game sound from my tv and from the game stream. I'll be looking for a work around, but if anyone
 else has a suggestion let me know. Also it should be noted that my Mic and party chat were not echoing, only the actual game sounds from HALO.&nbsp;

<span>I would check the status of the Print Spooler Service.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Click on the Start button and select Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Services. Locate Print Spooler in the list. Check that it has started and that the StartUp type is Automatic.</span></p>
<p>
<span>I suspect that it has stopped and that just starting it will not solve the problem.</span></p>
<p>
<span>You may need to show hidden files. Type Folder Options in the search box above the Start button and select View, Advanced Settings and verify that the box before "Show hidden files and folders"
 is checked and "Hide protected operating system files" is unchecked. You need to scroll down to see the second item. You should also make certain that the box before "Hide extensions for known file types" is not checked.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Now access Windows Explorer and select c:\windows\system32\spool\printers. Normally this folder should be empty but there is a problem when files with “spl” and “shd” extensions stick there. Delete
 the files and restart your computer. This may resolve your immediate problem.</span></p>

<h2>            The fastest internet speed I can get is 26mbps when using a 50mbps connection. Could my ethernet card be bad&#63;</h2>
                    <i>internet speed</i>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I just changed to high speed connection(cable,50mbs). The fastest I can get is around 26mbs.That is when I disconnect the wireless router and plug directly into the modem.&nbsp;Spent 2 hrs on the phone&nbsp;with the cable tech and he checked everything he could
 and could not find a problem. I hooked my wifes laptop up and it pegged the meter on speed 50mbs+ download and2.o upload. I have run the windows troubleshooter and it can't find a problem. My computer and my wifes laptop both run windows 7. Could my ethernet
 card be bad? &nbsp;Even at this speed it is faster than anything I ever had before but if I'm paying for it I would like to use it. any suggestions would be appreciated.</div>

 it then promptly closes the programme. And I dont get a solution. I don't recall an update occurring before this began so I dont know what set this off.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade for Sony Vaio VPCSB3C5E</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello there, Windows 10 upgrade for Sony Vaio vpcsb3c5e. I need some help please!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am confused. Should I upgrade or not? According to Sony, I shouldn't as critical errors occur (blue screen) on models with hybrid graphics (http://sony-eur-eu-en-web--eur.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/81930).
 But at the same link Sony also states that 'The following compatibility results are based on tests conducted on 31/07/2015, with Windows 10 build number 10240. Since Microsoft is regularly updating Windows 10, the below compatibility information may not be
 fully up-to-date or accurate after this date'. Today we have 15 May 2016.... Is the above information up to date? I do not know.....
</span></p>
<p><span>According to Windows I should upgrade as my system meets the requirements and it is scheduled to be upgraded very very soon !!! So, please advise me if I should upgrade to Win 10 or not.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your help ....</span></p>
<p>
