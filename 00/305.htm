<h2>            Asha 210 Dual Sim Assistance.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,<br />
Let me write you about a "pretty" (I think I'd better to define it sad) story I faced regarding the last mobile I bought (I should have used my money to buy something else), an Asha 210 Dual Sim: since the very first days this device&nbsp; had problems when using
 the bluetooth connection with my headset BH-118 (and also with a BH-218). I often couldn't hear the person who was calling me: sometimes pressing the volume key I could solve the problem for that call, sometimes I had to disconnect the call,&nbsp; sometimes I had
 to switch off the phone and then switch it on again.<br />
After about three weeks I was unable to use it since when depressing the start call key the device reset itself, so I brought it to a Nokia service center explaining both the problems (the call key and the bluetooth one). After a fortnight I got it back: the
 first problem was fixed, but not the bluetooth one. The repair form stated that they have updated the software&nbsp; but it wasn't true because, when I brought the phone to the service center, the software version was 6.09 and when I got it back it had the same
 version, in fact, it was the last one!<br />
When I wrote my complaints to the Italian Nokia support forum, I was contacted by a moderator and later by a member of the Nokia European contact center who told me to bring again the phone to a service center, letting them know which one it was. So I did and
 after two weeks I brought home a new device. Well, I thought, they have realized that the phone was defective and swapped it with a new one! But I was wrong: the problem was still present. After some other E-mails to Nokia European contact center, I brought
 again the phone to the service center and I got it back in a couple of weeks with the repair form stating again "software update" but&nbsp; the software version was the same – 6.09. I tested it with BH-118 and it didn't work, but with BH-218 it seemed to work (but
 I slightly tested it).<br />
After having&nbsp; sent&nbsp; another&nbsp; E-mail to the European contact center I was contacted by phone and then by email, and they told me to bring to the service center both the phone and the BH-118. So I did. After two weeks I got a new BH-118 and a week later my Asha
 210 was back with the repair form writing "BH-118 is not compatible with this device type".<br />
At this point I was thinking that some technicians were not skilled enough to make their work: I had to bring my phone 4 (four) times to the service center, I got a new phone and a new headset (to substitute a perfectly working device) before someone realized
 that the devices were not compatible. It sounds unbelievable (but it is the naked truth). But ,please, stay tuned, the story continues.<br />
At this point I sent another E-mail to the European contact center asking if BH-218 and BH-609 are compatible with Asha 210 Dual sim: the answer was: yes, they are compatible. I made some tests and... the problem was still present with BH-218.<br />
Once again I sent an E-mail to the European contact center and once again I was told to bring my phone to the service center. After two weeks I got it back with a repairing form stating; "no fault found". Since I wasn't completely drunk when testing my phone
 with headset, I couldn't believe that it had no problems.<br />
I wrote again to the European contact center explaining the situation and asking what could I do to solve the problem without continuing to go to the service center to bring the phone and to take it back unchanged: the answer was "we are sorry for your disappointment
 and we are still here to give you our support if it is in our possibilities". But... It seems to me that making a phone work should be in their possibilities (am I wrong?).<br />
Nokia (or Microsoft?) doesn't want to spend money to correct the bug in the phone firmware, does she? maybe it's a too cheap model or she sells so few items and nobody ,except me, uses this phone with a bluetooth headset.<br />
<br />
After I wrote all this matter in a post on the Italian forum, hoping to hear some Nokia responsible&nbsp; writing me what he thought about the matter, I was contacted again by a moderator who asked me some informations in order to pass my complaint to someone who
 would take in charge of if. So I did.<br />
After two weeks I got from Microsoft European contact center a mail informing me that they were compelled to close my case.<br />
The mail was signed by the same person who wrote me more than half a dozen mails in the past months (but the signature was by Nokia care).<br />
By the way I bought my phone on January 11th and I am not still able to use it after about 10 months.<br />
At this point I think that I spent more money going all that times to the service center and back home than buying a new phone of another brand. And this is what I will do in the future!<br />
In other words: NEVER AGAIN NOKIA!!! Or if you prefer Microsoft!<br />
Is Nokia/Microsoft happy for loosing customers?<br />
By the way, after the last reply(?) I got, nothing more happened: exactly what I can define a deafening silence!<br />
Many thanks&nbsp; to all the people who had the patience to read my story and excuse me for my poor knowledge of the English language.<br />
Best regards<br />
Fabio.</p>

<p>The Nokia Care Centre should have called this a ‘refurbishment’ rather than calling it an ‘update’ of the software/firmware, as

like yours</a>&nbsp;quite often. As you noted already, I have no idea why this happens either. Please, do not waste any additional time with that service and go for do-it yourself workarounds:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which network operator do you use in Italy? </li><li>Did you try a SIM borrowed from a friend, using another network than yours? </li><li>Did you try a Bluetooth headset borrowed from a friend, a non-Nokia one? </li></ol>
<p>I do own a Nokia 210. However, I do neither own a Nokia BH-118 nor a Nokia BH-218. Instead, I am using a Sennheiser EZX 80. Because I am not able to reproduce your issue yet, I have some more questions so I am able to reproduce this here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this happen always: Both incoming and outgoing calls? </li><li>If this happens with incoming calls: With which button do you accept the call?

<p>Hi Abi99,</p>
<p>First of all thank you for your message!</p>
<p>I am using Tim, but I own also some Vodafone sim cards so I made my tests with 2 Tim or 2 Vodafone cards in my 210. I found the problem with all sim cards (no matter if using the 1rst or the&nbsp; 2nd slot).</p>
<p>I only tested BH-118, BH-218 and another one (I don't remember BH-606 or BH-609), since the first two are the best type for me (an earpiece, a wire and the headset body with a clip in order to wear it), I also have more older headsets: BH-203, 208, 606 &amp;
 609 and a Jabra BT-200 but I don't like very much wearing the complete body or or in my ear.</p>
<p>The problem appears to me randomly on received call only (if I receive 10 calls maybe it appears once on the tenth, maybe four or more times without apparently a logic or even it doesn't appear at all).</p>
<p>In my test I used to answer the calls all three possible buttons (the headset one, the central joystick one or the left-phone one): all three ways led me to both have or not the problem.</p>
<p>When noticing the problem I tried some do-it-yourself solutions (use the volume keys on the phone, use the right function key on the phone twice - pass the call to the phone and then to the headset again - and drop the call and start the call again - of
 course I mean I was using another phone to call the Asha 210): the result was always random. In a few cases I first tried switching off and on the headset with no result so I had to switch off and then on my phone.</p>
<p>One strange behaviour is that when a call arrives I can alwais hear in the headset the ringing tone, but after answering the call I may face the problem.</p>
<p>I didn't noticed the problem on outgoing call, but I can't be sure I will not face it with more tests.</p>
<p>At present I am using my BH-118 with an Asha 200 without problems at all.</p>
<p>I hope I gave you all the informations you need.</p>
<p>Thank you very much and best regards,</p>
<p>Fabio.</p>

<p>That is the cause for Nokia to fail. If an interoperability issue does not happen always, you overchallenge the support of Nokia (why ever).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it happens again, try to note down more about your environment, for example: Was Wi-Fi turned on? If yes: Where you at a certain location? If yes: Was Wi-Fi connected to an access-point? If yes: Is that Wi-Fi access point ‘hidden’.&nbsp;All that could be related
 to Bluetooth Adaptive-Frequency-Hopping (AFH). Menu » Settings » Connectivity » WLAN.&nbsp;You have to find some sort of a pattern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because I am an end-user like you, I cannot invest the time to try and try again. I need an always&nbsp;situation&nbsp;as well. However, I would not invest much time into that issue because there are rumors&nbsp;Nokia&nbsp;Serie&nbsp;40 development has ceased completely. If this
 is a permanent software bug and you do not find a workaround yourself, you wasted a lot of time and energy. If you need a&nbsp;Nokia&nbsp;with full keyboard and Dual-SIM, the&nbsp;Nokia&nbsp;200 is your only alternative. What is missing compared to your&nbsp;Nokia&nbsp;210?</p>

<hr />
<p>I always made my tests with Wi-Fi turned off (except for a couple of tests I made using VoIP).</p>
<p>My test environment was always the same (and 90% of the tests were at my home between my Asha 200 and my Asha 210). Also mobile data are always turned off in my Asha 210.</p>

<p>Well, I already have an Asha 200 (and I'm using it since the 210 is not usable with this problem. I bought the Asha 210 for two (and then three) reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wi-Fi</li><li>WhatsApp</li><li>VoIP</li></ol>
<p>But I soon realised that WhatsApp fills up nearly all the internal memory and VoIP has not a good voice.</p>
<p>So now I am using two phones: the Asha 200 and a N79 with WhatsApp and Sip Voip setting installed.</p>
<p>In any cases I I were able to make the Asha 210 working correclty I will remove WhatsApp and not use VoIP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will make in a few days some tests using my Jabra BT200 headset and If I'll get it with another headset borrowed from a friend of mine.</p>

<p>Yes, it works, but it is very very slow (for example to update my preferred contacts it takes some minutes, on the N79 less than 5 seconds - with the same contacts) and often takes some minutes to notify a message. When I activate the application I also
 have to wait for the downloading of the message. The only advantage is the keyboard: the N79 has the standard phone keypad and writing is not so easy even with T9 activated (it sometimes happens that a verbal form in italian is not recognised by the dictionary).
 In this case I prefer to write an SMS from my Asha 200 to the N79 (I have plenty of messages available I can hardly finish them) and then copy the text and paste it into WhatsApp.</p>

<p>Well, to be precise the problem is a sort of "tic" I regularly hear. I use Messagenet (since it gives me a free landline number - axailable for all places in Italy - so I can be called by anyone even without a PC or a VoIP phone.</p>
<p>I noticed it calling the 5000002 number of messagenet to hear date and time: the same number from my N79 and my VoIP phone don't have that problem.</p>
<p>I dare say I have no idea of where the codec settings in the Asha 210 are placed (but maybe you will find the right place).</p>
<p>Apart from that VoIP is good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back to the original problem I just made some quick tests using the Jabra BT-200 headset: I coupled the devices and the first calls were mute, I turned off and on the Asha 210 and the problem disappeard (but to tell the truth I forgot in the first call to
 turn off Wi-Fi and turning it off was not enough forcing me to turn off the device).</p>
<p>Tomorrow I will make some more tests also to verify the behaviour with Wi-Fi off and on.</p>

<p>Minutes? Mhm. Yes, the Series 40 client is very low standard. Anyway, I bet you know: Did you consider the
<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=2497&amp;idPhone2=3717" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia E6</a>? It is based on Symbian/S60 like your Nokia N79, offers a full keyboard, and provides WhatsApp and VoIP as you are used to. Many sell their Nokia Belle devices right now on eBay because their contract ended after two years. You might be able to
 make a real bargain. Although the specifications between&nbsp;those two devices sound similar, the difference is believable.</p>

<p>For that, we have to create a (WB)XML configuration manually. To find the easiest way in your case to do that: How did you configure your Nokia 210 for Messagenet originally.</p>

<p>Well, I'll give a look to the manual, but there is one thing I dislike: it has touchscreen. I also had a look to the E71 and I thought it could be good for me, since a friend of mine owns it I think I can give a look to the menus and verify if it is possible
 to use VoIP.</p>

    <title>HELP&#33; Outlook for Mac doing a crazy horizontal resizing when - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> officemacuserca  say:</h3>
<h2>            HELP&#33;  Outlook for Mac doing a crazy horizontal resizing when trying to move emails to a folder</h2>
                    <p>Using Outlook for Mac (Version 15.12.3)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I want to move an email from my inbox to a folder I am doing the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shift-Cmd-M</p>
<p>
</p><p>This brings up a search box where I can enter the name of the folder I want to move the email to (as it should).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is where the problem begins, and it is one I have never seen with prior versions of Outlook for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as I type a letter in the search box it starts to populate the results with possible folders. The problem is that the box then immediately starts to resize itself horizontally so that in a second or two the box is wider than the screen. &nbsp;This seems
 to clearly be a bug in the software as it looks like it keeps trying to add blank columns to the right of the possible folder options and the search box tries to resize to accommodate these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This process appears to repeat again and again as after a little while the box goes back to normal width and immediately starts to expand again beyond the size of the screen so the text is not even visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior versions of Outlook just kept this box the same size and displayed possible folders to choose from. &nbsp;Given what is happening now, this function is unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else seen this issue? &nbsp;Any ideas how to correct it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PLEASE NOTE: &nbsp;I know that I can also click on an email and drag it to the appropriate folder (manual process). However, I have a lot of nested folders and a lot of emails so this would be a very time consuming and cumbersome process compared to doing the
 "shift-cmd-m" command and typing in the first few letters of the folder I want to move to. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any possible ways to fix this short of MSFT hopefully correcting the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            I have just updated to 15.12.3 and experienced exactly the same issue as you describe. I assume it is a software bug but it is annoying it has not been picked up as it is a fundamental part of outlook.

            <p>I can't get a screenshot - it happens very quickly all the width re-sizing.</p>
<p>Yes I have multiple nested folders and circa 1,000 of them</p>

            <p>I suspect the resizing occurs due to Oulook trying to display the long paths of nested folders but can't be sure without seeing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you open QuickTime Player from the Applications folder, you can create a screen recording of this problem. Once you've recorded the problem as a video, you can scrub through it frame by frame and copy a frame using Edit &gt; Copy. You can then open the Preview
 application from the Applicatons folder and choose File &gt; New From Clipboard to view the image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Save that and post it here. It will be easier to explain to developers if they can understand what you're seeing.</p>

            <p>Sorry for the slow reply. &nbsp;I cannot take a screenshot of this for the simple fact I cannot send an image of my email inbox to a public forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try to describe it, which is hopefully very straightforward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on an email (do not open, just highlight it)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hit Shift-Command-M&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will bring up a square box that has a search bar and the text "Type the name of the destination folder in the Search Box."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type a single letter (to provide them most possible folder options).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I start typing this box will begin to display potential options for folders. These are displayed in a column width equal to the original width of the box. Immediately after these begin to populate the width of the box begins to expand until both sides
 of the box are no longer visible on the screen. &nbsp;During this process the width that actually includes the text with the folder options remains fixed, it simply slides off the screen to the left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I do have nested folders, it looks like the entire address of the folders is displayed in the text box so it does not appear to be an issue where there are so many nested folders that the destination is too long to display (I think mine go 2-3 deep
 at most).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also worth noting - after about 20-30 seconds the box will resize to the original and then immediately start to expand horizontally again - it seems to do this more rapidly the longer I just let it run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note - I tried expanding the box vertically so that every possible folder option could be listed to see if the issue was that there were more options than could be displayed. &nbsp;I had the same issue when I did this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also worth noting - I typed in a second letter which left me with two folder options - the width resizing started to happen again but in this case it just sort of bounced back and forth without continuing to expand across the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I had to guess I think the issue is that this search box has extra columns that are not supposed to be there - they are blank but for some reason are expanding which is why the width is expanding (again, watching this happen you will see that the column
 with the actual folder options remains fixed in terms of width - this gets pushed to the left as a bunch of blank space is added to the right of the text).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems like a very fixable bug.....</p>
<p>

            If you have successfully setup the phone on the computer, and PC Suite identifies the phone, then you can use Image Transfer found inside PC Suite to transfer the images.

    <title>VLOOKUP not working properly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            VLOOKUP not working properly</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am trying to perform a VLOOKUP between two spreadsheets (both columns are of type GENEREAL but contain data that is a number). I keep getting the "#N/A" result. I have used VLOOKUP many times and have encountered this error before (it seems random). If
 I double-click in a specific "Table-array" cell, the corresponding VLOOKUP value evaluates correctly. I have over 900 rows of data though so this isn't feasible to do 900+ times. I have tried changing both the lookup-value column and table-array columns to
 Text, Number, and General but get the same "#N/A" result until I double-click each specific cell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>When you have a question about a function, it would be helpful if you show us how you are using the function. A concrete example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jim wrote: "If I double-click in a specific "Table-array" cell, the corresponding VLOOKUP value evaluates correctly".</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple thoughts....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. The cells that you double-click and re-enter might contain values that are type text, even if they look like numbers. You can confirm by verifying that&nbsp;ISTEXT(A1) returns TRUE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that's is true, you should be able to correct the immediate problem by select the column of data, and using Data &gt; Text To Columns to correct the values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not work, you might have to build a parallel column of formulas of the form =TRIM(SUBSTITUTE(A1,CHAR(160),"")), then copy the parallel column and paste-value over the original column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. The cells that you double-click and re-enter might contain the result of calculations that are infinitesimally different than the values in the lookup table. You can confirm by&nbsp;verifying that MATCH(A1,B10,0) returns #N/A, where B10 is presumed to be the
 lookup table value that should match.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the case, the best solution is to explicitly round the original calculation to the precision that you require. For example, =ROUND(expression,2) for dollar amounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, build a parallel column of formulas of the form =ROUND(A1,2), then copy the parallel column and paste-value over the original column. Change 2 to the precision that you require.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If neither works for you, I suggest that you upload an example Excel file that demonstrates the problem to a file-sharing website (e.g. box.net/files), and post the public/share URL in a response here. Test the download URL first, being careful to log out
 of the file-sharing website. (If you use box.net/files, ignore any preview errors, and just download.)</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Mappoint Software Questions</h2>
                    
<p>Two questions in Microsoft Mappoint:</p>
<p>1. The Zoom In and Zoom Out feature, is there a way to be able to size the map view yourself, to an in between magnification?&nbsp; For example if my magnification is 400X, then the next size over is 150X, then the next view over is 48X, is there a way I could
 get a magnification/view of 225X or 80X? rather than simply the default views?</p>
<p>2. I work at a catholic hospital.&nbsp; We use an index called the CNI-community needs.&nbsp; the community needs is an index that determines how destitute a certain zip code or region is in terms of the people in poverty.&nbsp; A 1= low poverty, need, 5 being the most
 needy/poor.</p>
<p>Each zip code is assigned a CNI.&nbsp; I have loaded this data into an excel spreadsheet and imported it.&nbsp; My color coded data map and frequency table is by CNI values.&nbsp; The darker the color of each zip code, the more poor and destitute the zip, the higher the
 CNI.&nbsp; Conversely, the lighter the color, the less poor and needy, the lower the CNI value.</p>
<p>And while the map turns out pretty nice, and I like the color coding/shading, it is too much clutter because of all the zip codes.&nbsp; Is there a way to keep the color coding for each CNI by zip, yet NOT display the zip codes on the map?</p>
<p>I have Mappoint 2009.</p>

<h3> andrewm1428  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems&#47;conflicts with Microsoft word 2016</h2>
                    <p>So I've been using MSword 2016 through an office 365 subscription for a while without issue, however following my hard drive dying and getting it fixed I've found a few issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I picked up my laptop from the repair shop it seems the copy of windows 10 they'd installed had come with a pre-installed version of windows 2007, this is now the default program for opening word documents and I can't change it. I've tried to change
 it in settings but it doesn't seem to recognsise word 2017 as an 'app' I'm just getting 'microsoft office word' which is the 2007 version- the issue with this is that whenever I open a document without first launching office and opening it through word 2017
 is that it then wants to install office 2007 each time I launch the program and I have to wait a few minutes. I really just want office 2016 to run as the default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other issue I have is in saving. Used to be pretty straightforward - if I click the save icon, the document saves any updates I've made to that point. Not anymore- if I close the document and reload it, then it will load the version I'd originally saved.
 The only way around it is to 'save as' and as if its a new document and manually save it over the previous version of the document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A last issue is that when trying to load saved documents backed up to the office 365 onedrive from prior to my hard drive death is that I'd copied the folders over, but it seems they are all empty, when clicked on it would say something like 'the document
 location doesn't exist' so thinking I've backed up all the data what I'd effectively done by saving the folders is to just add links to the documents and not save them. Do I have to save each document individually rather than drag over the parent folder?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any pointers on any of these is greatly appreciated. Many thanks</p>

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We completely understand all the issues you have with Microsoft Office. Just to confirm, does the Windows 2007 you are referring to is an Office 2007 or Windows 7 OS? If you are pertaining to Office 2007, possible that your PC is detecting the said version
 for your Office application. In order for your PC to recognize the Office 2016, you may need to fully uninstall the Office 2007. We can test afterwards if your second and third issue will relate to it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted for us to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>

    <title>Office 365 Service Is Listening Entries in Daily Out Log - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office 365 Service Is Listening Entries in Daily Out Log</h2>
                    <p>Hi All</p>
<p>I use Mac OSX 10.6.8 and had a problem with disk space, so I looked at the log files for large ones to clean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In /private/var/log/ the file <em>daily.out </em>is huge. It has literally hundreds upon hundreds of entries stating "Office365service is listening".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Microsoft Office 2011 from a purchased set, not the on line 365 service.&nbsp; I don't use Outlook or Entourage, just Excel and Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering what on my computer is telling Office 365 Service to 'listen" and what "listen" means in this context?</p>
<p>Can I stop the request to listen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a sample of one of the lines in the log file:</p>
<p>Thu Feb 12 14:02:58 (my name is here) Firewall[161] &lt;Info&gt;: Office365Service is listening from 127.0.0.1:1538 proto=6</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks For Your Advice!</p>
<p>Paul</p>

            <p>Since it’s a cache file it can be removed after what possibly is causing it is deactivated.</p>

<li>Go to microsoft menu</li><li>Then Feedback:<br />

</li><li>This deactivates the yes choice.</li><li>Then quit word, and all other office applications.</li><li>Then remove the folder to trash and empty.</li><li>Then use office apps as you normally would.&nbsp;</li><li>Then double check for that cache folder.</li><li>Open it and it should be empty.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>If not there may be some new entries and you will just have to empty periodically.<br />

            <p>Hi Phillip!</p>
<p>Thank You for your reply &amp; step-by-step directions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Being not so computer smart, I'm still a bit stumped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to "Feedback" in Word Preferences and "No" was already checked, so that part's done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I got to Step 7 of your list, I don't know what folder to send to the trash. Is it the daily.out file? I would not think I will be deleting the whole /private/var/log folder since bunches of the system logs &amp; other program logs are in the log folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Again!</p>
<p>Paul</p>

            Since <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">no</span></strong>&nbsp;was the answer then there would be no folder holding such information. you'll have go to the group on Office 365 and pose the question.

<p>
</p><p>I still haven't figured this out. It's making my Daily.out file huge. I manually delete the file sometimes.
<span>The "listening" goes on even if no Office programs have been opened since the last restart of the computer.</span></p>
<p>I'm starting to wonder if it is something Microsoft includes with Office 2011? I'd love to stop the listening, or at least the logging.</p>

            <p>I don't have any suggestions this is a new bug for me. &nbsp;I can see why the mod may have deleted the question. Rather than moving it to where it should be if there is such a place. &nbsp;Because you&nbsp;said you had office2011 version even though the notice mentioned
 Office 365 listening. I'll pose this in Community/Mod section and see if&nbsp;I can get someone to either answer or move to correct position.</p>

            This question came up a long time ago when Office 365 first came out. I wish I could be authoritative, but I think it has to do with validating that your copy of Office is legitimate and whether or not it is the 2011 package install or the 365 version.
 I could be wrong about this.

            <p>That's Interesting information. Thanks for taking the time to reply Jim Gordon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sure don't mind that Microsoft is "Listening" (whatever they are listening to). And I certainly do not mind if they need to validate that my copy is legitimate. That is very important to try to prevent piracy. I prefer that they do not use it for marketing,
 which is appears they do not. (I don't receive much in the way of advertisements from them.)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Caution! Crabby Complaining Ahead</span>....</p>
<p>
</p><p>My real objections are performance based. They are:</p>
<p><span>A) That&nbsp;<em>Office 365 Service</em>&nbsp;does not stop using RAM and CPU after Office is closed. I have to manually turn it off via&nbsp;<em>Activity Monitor.app</em>. It should cease when Office closes and stop using not only my network,
 but my RAM as well. It is sometimes the highest RAM &amp; CPU user on the list, even with no Microsoft programs or documents open. Personally, I'm barely squeaking through with 2GB RAM. I need all I can keep free, especially if Word and Excel are both open.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>B) The service is constantly using my internet bandwidth to "listen". <span>
&nbsp;It does not stop after Office is closed.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;(At least according to the many entries in the Daily.Out file.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Close all internet using programs and take a peek at Activity Monitor's network packet &amp; data graphs when Office 365 Service is running (and Office is closed). Tons of data is being sent. Then force quit the service &amp; you will see the graphs flat line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>C) My third objection is that it fills up my Daily.out log file by continuing to listen after I close all Office programs, thus making the file huge and very hard to sift through when diagnosing other items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder how fast Excel would calculate, or Word would format if this thing was not running? (Clicking Command-1 in Excel to format cells or Command-D in Word to choose a font takes three or four actual minutes to bring up their respective lists- And I have
 few fonts installed.)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'll bet a lot of people using purchased copies of Office think it is too slow, but are only being slowed by the Office 365 Service.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>It makes me wonder if many of us users of purchased disk copies send feedback to Microsoft's Office team, they would issue an update that turns the program off or, ideally, let us opt out of using it? But how does the word spread?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Again Phillip &amp; Jim. I sure appreciate your assistance.</p>
<p>Enjoy This Day!</p>

<h2>            Please help&#33; Can&#39;t get videos from my W7 phone &#40;HTC Arrive&#41; to my PC</h2>
                    This is driving me crazy. I have a Sprint HTC Arrive Windows 7 phone. It has a video camera. I took some videos. And now they live only on my phone!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I downloaded the Zune stuff. It "synced". Yet, nothing from my phone is anywhere on my PC! It seems to only want me to put stuff ON my phone from my PC, not take it off. I've seriously spent about 12 hours over the past three days on sprint, windows, zune
 websites.... forums, tech-guides, you name it. Going MAD!!!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It's bad enough I can't send videos from my phone (or do anything but play them) and that I have to have the Zune software to be able to "manage" them. (The Zune "Help" Guide is USELESS!!!) But this is unforgiveable....&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Apparently some mysterious Mango update coming some time this year will fix a lot of these issues, and I will wait for it, but C'MON!</div>

<h3> jeremiahsnee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Sound Output</h2>
                    <div>Throughout the history of Windows, there has been a lack of support for Sound Output. In Windows 10 it would be greatly appreciated if there was a method that allowed one to change the Sound Output of specific applications without
 having to change default Sound Output device and restart application. Windows 7 did include a large improvement by adding a default communication device separate from the default sound device.. However, there is once again a need for improvement. The final
 result I imagine would be a simple option in the sound mixer to move applications to a different device and possible allow for multiple devices to be open simultaneously.</div>

            <p>Hi jeremiahsnee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think what you're asking for is documented in the following Uservoice entry:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://windows.uservoice.com/forums/265757-windows-feature-suggestions/suggestions/6520196-let-us-bind-programs-to-specific-audio-outputs</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be great if you could add your vote and comments there. I consult Uservoice quite a bit when I make recommendations to the design team, and the more info I can point them to on Uservoice, the better they understand the demand for various features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Missing fonts in Word and Publisher 2010 when I installed it on my new computer</h2>
                    I have a new PC and when I installed Microsoft Office Pro Plus 2010, there are a bunch of fonts missing. &nbsp;I had this same Office program on my old PC, and it worked great. &nbsp;But now, when I go to open previously created files, their formatting is all messed
 up and it wants me to substitute all the fonts. &nbsp;My old PC had Vista, and the new one has Windows 7. . . Could that be the issue?

            Office doesn't include its own fonts.&nbsp; It uses the fonts already installed on your PC.&nbsp; If the font set is not what you'd expect, locate the missing fonts online and install them if its legal to do so.

<h2>            Excel can&#39;t open password-protected workbooks.</h2>
                    
<p>I am running WP7 on the Dell Venue Pro, with T-mobile as a provider. I have tried repeatedly to open excel files from my email, which are from my corporate office, but I keep getting the same message: excel can't open password-protected workbooks. There
 is no password needed to open these files, however there are&nbsp;macros and protected cells within the sheets.&nbsp;One of the main reasons I chose WP7, was to open these documents. I previously had a Blackberry that gave a similar message, but when I received an excel
 upgrade to it, I was able to view them. Do I have to wait for an upgrade again or is there some fix to this problem?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help!</p>

            Yeah, you'll probably have to wait for an upgrade, but I doubt it will come very quickly.&nbsp; Windows Mobile never dealt with protected workbooks, or files that included protected cells , and I used a third party application on my windows mobile phones to
 handle stuff like that, but there is no such third party application for windows phone 7

I am at a loss. The document is a letter. I noted you do not explain this error in your description for the program only that you might encounter it. I am using Word and Outlook 2010. I cannot figure this out. What is a "letter" type mail merge main document?

            The Microsoft public forum is not the place to discuss this. E-mail me via the link on the home page of my web site.<br />
However to answer your immediate question and perhaps get you started. A letter merge document is a merge document of the type Letters with a merge data source attached. So attach the data source and set the document type to Letters from the mailings tab of
 the ribbon.<br />

                    <p>Is the following a legitimate request or a phishing scam? I received nothing in writing&nbsp;via postal mail&nbsp;and it would seem that this person should be able to provide our Microsoft agreements to prove they re from Microsoft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;People have lost lots of money with this type of communication asking for info.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The info they want wreaks of marketing for profit, where our info is sold to vendors and we get more endless phone calls and emails. The privacy statement doesn't mention not sharing our surrendered server and software&nbsp;info just some private info.</p>

<p>Hi Ray,</p>
<p>The ‘License Verification Process’ is a voluntary survey about Microsoft licensing including Office 365. Commonly, this survey will be sent to you in an email. Sometimes it will be a call from a Microsoft agent about this survey. You may do this survey to
 help us improve our service and product.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mouran</p>

<h2>            Reward points being credited to the wrong account</h2>
                    <p data-prewrap="true">I recently purchased an xbox one from microsoft store, during which time they had a promotion running where you earned reward points. &nbsp;Years prior to this purchase my account was hacked, which we got straighten out. So every time i make a purchase we go
 thru a security verification process. Which we did this time with my purchase, everything was going to my correct email and gamer name. Until today i received notification that my reward points were posted, but they posted it to the hackers gamer name, instead
 of my correct account. How do i get this issue fixed. &nbsp;I have called the microsoft store, they sent me to xbox support, xbox support sent me back to microsoft store, finally microsoft store told me i needed to post a forum for xbox live. &nbsp;Can someone please
 help.&nbsp;</p><p data-prewrap="true">

            Seems that the link of between the reward and the hacked account is not yet replaced to the new account that you have, better call Microsoft answer desk again and have the old account deleted and your new account re-registered&nbsp;for the reward points.
