    <title>Unable to activate Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to activate Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys. I recently purchased a pre-built computer (the ABS Bearcat Barrage), and as part of the bundle, Windows 10 came pre-installed. I had no issues booting the computer and using the OS, but later in the day a watermark appeared (and has since not disappeared)
 prompting me to activate Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I go into settings to attempt this, it tells me the product key is invalid. From what I understand (or rather, what I've Google searched), this is the typical behaviour of a pirated copy of Windows. Being that I seriously doubt Newegg is out
 selling illegal software, does anyone know what the issue might be? Obviously I can use the most basic functions of the system (I'm posting from it now), but I can't update or access certain features, and I'd like to avoid the issues I know this will cause
 in the long run.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<br />To better diagnose the issue,
<br />Right click Start&gt;Command Prompt-Admin and type in the following command:
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />If you have Powershell instead of Command Prompt Run these in order:
<br />cmd.exe
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv

            You have an OEM license i.e. the license came preinstalled with the computer but it does not correspond to the Windows version installed currently.
<br />Please use the tool on the link below and try activating OS using the key supplied by it:
<br />neosmart.net/OemKey/
<br />If that does not help, I would suggest you to contact an MS representative using chat:

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What is the Edition and Status at the top of Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation?  
<br />
<br />Was Windows reinstalled by you or a shop that might have used an exploit?  
<br />
<br />Install ProducKey and run it to look for OEM-BIOS key which is the embedded Product Key from factory:  <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip</a>.
<br />
<br />Then insert the OEM BIOS key in Activation settings at the link to Change Product Key.  
<br />
<br />But if it's the wrong verison installed you'll need to reinstall it.  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks for the assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edition: Windows 10 Home</p>
<p>Status: Windows is not activated</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't done anything re: the OS -- it installed upon first boot. I can't say about a shop of any kind, though given that I purchased the PC directly from Newegg, I doubt it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the OEM-BIOS key is of course the same as the one from the OEMkey software suggested above, so inputting the new product key unfortunately hasn't resolved the issue.&nbsp;</p>

            I'm unsure. Is there a way to differentiate the single language edition from standard Windows 10? I only actually received the system about three days ago, and the OS installed on first boot. As far as I could see, there wasn't any indication it was 10
 SL.

            Does ProducKey find an OEM-BIOS key?  This is not any other key like a WIndows 10 key, it must say OEM-BIOS.  
<br />
<br />The error you get about Digital License does not normally appear when an OEM-BIOS key is inputted, only when the default Generic key for the OS version is installed and there is not Digital License assigned in Microsoft Servers. 
<br />
<br />I would contact MS Support:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/software/windows/setup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />They should tell you more about what they think has happened.
<br />
<br />Then if necessary I'd contact NewEgg and ask them why they sold you a PC with WIndows 10 which cannot activate.  This is illegal piracy.  
<br />
<br />They may have you contact the manufacturer to find out more.

<p>Very strange. Unless I'm misreading the software, it does give me the OEM-BIOS key. Here's a screen of the relevant information:&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            &#39;Remember my password&#39; not working</h2>
                    
<p>Why doesn't 'remember my password' remember my password? I even have the username and password (for my workplace's domain) in the credentials manager.</p>
<p>But if I disconnect and reconnect my (LAN) network, I get asked over and over again for the username and password, and ticking 'remember my password' makes no difference. I get asked about six times in total before it stops.</p>
<p>This annoying bug has been around for years and years - isn't it yet at least&nbsp;smart enough not to offer to remember any passwords it has had difficulty remembering in the past?</p>

<h2>            Network connection failure on two Windows 10 computers simultaneously while all other connected devices are fine</h2>
                    <p>About noon, two Windows 10 computers connected to our home wireless network failed to connect to the internet simultaneously. All other devices connected (2 iPads, 2 cell phones) remained connected to the internet without any problems. Neither Windows 10
 system can connect to the network. Bother systems were restarted, and shut down with a pause before start up. Both systems have had the wireless cards disabled and enabled. Both systems say "can't connect to this network" but still show neighboring networks
 (which are secured and cannot be accessed). Any ideas why they would fail simultaneously while other internet connected devices on the same network would still work?? Two different types of computers with two different wireless cards. The only thing the same
 is Windows 10. A laptop with 10 can connect just fine...Any ideas would be appreciated!</p>

</p><p>You might experience network or Internet connection issues in Windows for a number of reasons. Some common issues that can cause these problems are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Corrupted or incompatible drivers. </li><li>Network connection settings. </li><li>Hardware or software problems. </li><li>There's interference from other devices. </li><li>Your router and the network adapter in your PC might not work together.</li></ul>
<p>I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Run the Network Adapter Troubleshooter</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't connect to a network, there might be a problem with your network adapter, the piece of hardware that makes it possible for your PC to connect to a network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, try using the Network Adapter troubleshooter to automatically find and fix some problems. This troubleshooter will disable and re-enable the adapter and try some other common repairs. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Open <strong>Control Panel </strong>by right click on <strong>
Start</strong> Button.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>In the search box, type <strong>troubleshooter</strong>, and then click
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Click Network and Internet, and run the Network Adapter troubleshooter, and follow the instructions on
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your screen and check. </p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: Uninstall the network adapter driver and restart</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>Try to uninstall the network adapter driver, and then restart your computer and have Windows automatically install the latest driver.Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>1. Right click </strong>on <strong>Start</strong>, select <strong>Device Manager
</strong>and navigate to <strong>Network adapters </strong>&gt; the network adapter </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Right-click (or press and hold) the network adapter, and then select
<strong>Uninstall</strong> &gt; <strong>Delete the driver </strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; software for t</strong><strong>his device </strong>check box &gt; <strong>
OK</strong> to confirm you want to uninstall it.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>After uninstalling the driver, select the <strong>Start </strong>
button &gt; <strong>Power</strong> &gt; <strong>Restart</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After your PC restarts, Windows will automatically look for and install the network adapter driver. Check to see if that fixes your connection problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</p>

<p>Hi there, apologies for the slow response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>to answer the questions,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>no error messages, and ive run the troubleshooter multiple times and it cant detect the problem. ive also tried clicking the 'allow other network users...Internet connection' button under the sharing tab in the connection properties.</p>
<p>However, the computer is able to connect to the net, but a phone is unable to connect to the hotspot from the computer. it cannot acquire a IP address it seems...or that the connection is established, but no data is received/sent from the phone</p>
<p>Com is a x1 carbon (2nd gen)</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Photos - The App Didn&#39;t Start - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> k-barry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Photos - The App Didn&#39;t Start</h2>
                    <p>I have a user on a domain running Windows 10 Pro 1703 build 15063.786.&nbsp; When he tries to open image files, the Windows Store Photos app does not open and instead he receives a message "The app didn't start".&nbsp; Since then, I've found that none of the Windows
 Store apps (including Windows Store itself) will start - either the same message is shown or there is no message (the app attempts to open, creates a window and then immediately closes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using an admin PowerShell window to run the command:</p>
<p>Add-AppxPackage -register "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WindowsStore_11712.11.01_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\AppxManifest.xml" -DisableDevelopmentMode</p>
<p>This seemed to run correctly - a progress bar appeared at the top of the PowerShell window but didn't fix the issue.&nbsp; I also tried the same for the Photos app using a similar PowerShell command (using Get-Appxpackage -Allusers to find the correct product
 names first) - this gave the same result - progress bar but no fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried running wsreset.exe but this stayed on screen for about 20 minutes with no progress before I had to cancel it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at permissions, I checked that the "ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES" security principal had read access to HKCR, HKLM\HARDWARE, HKLM\SAM, HKLM\SOFTWARE, HKLM\SYSTEM and HKEY_USERS in the registry.&nbsp; I couldn't determine whether the same principal had the
 correct permissions throughout C:\Program Files\Windows Apps</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, reinstalling Windows is not really an easy option in this case; the user is constantly using his laptop and any downtime needs to be avoided if possible.&nbsp; Is there anything else that I can check or try before I take that route?</p>

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Open administrative Windows PowerShell and type following and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />If issue still persists, try creating new user account and check. Also run Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps, Good luck!

<h2>            Media Player - Application Error and Server Execution Failed</h2>
                    Hello, I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium with Service Pack 1. I've recently been having a new problem with Windows Media Player.<br />
<br />
Whenever I try to play any media file in Media Player, I get a Server Execution Failed error.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I can't even open Windows Media Player itself; I get 'The instruction at 0x6abd0a46 referenced memory 0x00000000. The memory could not be read.'<br />
<br />
I've had no problems before, and it's quite odd since I haven't actually installed anything recently; it just started up with this error, despite the files playing in every other media player I can find; just not Windows Media Player.<br />
<br />
I tried uninstalling and reinstalling Media Player; it did nothing for the error.<br />
<br />
I've also tried using Clean Boot; even with everything but Windows services disabled, I still got the same errors.<br />

            I tried both methods, but I'm still getting the same errors.<br />
<br />
In Method 1, the folder was already named 12.0 though. I renamed it to 12.0.bak, but again, it didn't help.<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Are these local media files or are they on another machine?</span>
</li><li><span>What are the exact steps taken while performing clean boot procedure?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you uninstall and reinstall Windows media player on the computer after placing the computer in the clean boot
 state and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Uninstalling the Windows Media Player:<br />
</span></b><span><span>1. Go to Start and in the search type "Turn Windows features On or Off".<br />
2. Click on "Turn Windows features On or Off".<br />
3. Browse to the Media Features and uncheck the mark in front of Windows Media Player.<br />
4. Restart the computer<b><br />
</b></span></span><span><b><span><br />
Reinstalling the Windows Media Player:<br />
</span></b></span><span><span>1. Go to Start and in the search type "Turn Windows features On or Off".<br />
2. Click on "Turn Windows features On or Off".<br />
3. Browse to the Media Features and place a check mark in front of Windows Media Player.<br />
4. Restart the Computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start
 Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>

            1) Local files<br />
<br />
2)The same steps in the clean boot link. I did it again with the uninstalling, and it ended the same way; even in Clean Boot, with everything off, and after uninstalling and reinstalling media player, it still gives the same problem.<br />
<br />
The only thing new is that sometimes it just doesn't open at all instead of giving the error message.<br />

<p>Um, it would most helpful if you'd post how to do that HERE, instead of taking a link. The command line is short, and that's all you need to do. I WILL NOT POST IT FOR YOU.<br />
<br />
Post the command line here that runs system file checker.<br />

</p><p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>When starting an .exe-file designed to control a cirquit board I get the following error window:</p>
<p>
</p><p>--------------------------<br />
Microsoft Visual C++ Debug Library<br />
---------------------------<br />
Debug Assertion Failed!<br />
<br />
Program: ...<br />
File: f:\rtm\vctools\vc7libs\ship\atlmfc\src\mfc\occcont.cpp<br />
Line: 950<br />
<br />
For information on how your program can cause an assertion<br />
failure, see the Visual C++ documentation on asserts.<br />
<br />
(Press Retry to debug the application)<br />
---------------------------<br />
Avbryt &nbsp; Försök igen &nbsp; Ignorera &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
---------------------------</p>
<p>When I click "retry" (försök igen) the .exe file don't start</p>
<p>The exe-file itself is designed 2012 with the board and has been working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read in an MS article that the Visual C++ in Win 8.1 need a fix for this error &nbsp;but I have not been able to find it.</p>
<p>I would very much appreciate &nbsp;hints on how to fix my Visual C++ &nbsp;in Windows 8.1 so I can open .exe-files in C++</p>
<p>Note: I myself is no programmer but can manage several system tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards/ Bjolen</p>

================================<br />
If you create the cutout and save it in the .png or .gif <br />
format the transparency should be preserved.<br />
<br />
FWIW...the 60 day trial version of MS Digital Image Suite <br />
has a cutout tool that makes creating odd shapes easy.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />

This might be a case of memory corruption. More often memory corruption happens because of software errors in buggy drivers, not because of faulty RAM modules.
<br />
The crash took place in a standard Microsoft module. Your system configuration may be incorrect. Possibly this problem is caused by another driver on your system that cannot be identified at this time.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Hello Edward Namalima,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. First open the pdf page you want to copy.</p>
<p>2. When the page is displayed on your screen press the prtscrn button on your keyboard.</p>
<p>3. A copy of the screen has now been sent to the windows clipboard.</p>
<p>4. Now open Paint.</p>
<p>5. On the paint toolbar, click Edit and then click Paste. The image will now be pasted into a Paint window. You may have to accept a resize dialogue if the image is larger than the current document.</p>
<p>6. Now, from the toolbar at the left of your screen click on the Select tool (the oblong dotted box). With the select tool select the full area of the table you want to copy. Once selected, click Edit again and then select Copy.</p>
<p>7. Now open Microsoft Word.</p>
<p>8. Next place the curser where you want the table to be put and then press the CTRL and V button together on your keyboard.</p>
<p>9. The table image should now be pasted into your Word document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could use the snipping tool (click the start button and type snipping tool into the search box). Select the table you want from the pdf page using the snipping tool and then open word and paste the table into word.</p>

    <title>bluetooth not showing up in the device manager &#40;windows 10&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kontrav  say:</h3>
<h2>            bluetooth not showing up in the device manager &#40;windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I was playing a game using my bluetooth controller when my laptop ran out of battery and shut down.</p>
<p>When I rebooted <strong>my controller wouldn't connect</strong>. The tray icon of bluetooth was gone, and there were
<strong>no bluetooth switch in windows' settings pane</strong>l. In the device manager it was disabled and it said that it
<strong>couldn't enable the device</strong> whenever I pressed enable. <strong>I've uninstalled the device driver</strong> and tried the automatic update to reinstall the driver but it failed. I thought maybe I needed to restart before the driver uninstall
 takes effect so I restarted the machine. This time the bluetooth device was <strong>
completely gone from the device manager</strong>. <strong>I've tried showing hidden devices</strong> but it wasn't there either.
<strong>I've tried reinstalling the original driver</strong> but my laptop came with windows 7 and the driver supplied with it said that it can't run in this OS. I tried running in compatibility mode but still nothing. I've looked up the manufacturer and downloaded
 a driver for windows 10 but the installer stops and prompts me to "<em>Activate bluetooth using wireless switch</em>".
<strong>I've tried turning the airplane mode on and off</strong> with the function keys but it does nothing.
<strong>I've tried using the install legacy driver option</strong> but the automatic search won't find anything and there's nothing bluetooth related among the devices listed. There's an option to use "disk" but it requires a .inf file which is not present
 either in the windows 7 driver nor in the windows 10 driver.</p>
<p>Oddly enough 3 bluetooth services are up and running: driver management, handsfree, and support services.</p>
<p>Not sure if it's relevant but the bluetooth works perfectly with an external bluetooth dongle.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Summery:</p>
<p>-no bluetooth switch in the setting</p>
<p>-no tray icon</p>
<p>-no bluetooth device in device manager (even when showing hidden devices)</p>
<p>-not in legacy devices list</p>
<p>-original windows 7 driver won't install</p>
<p>-windows 10 driver won't install</p>
<p>-3 bluetooth services are running</p>
<p>-external bluetooth dongle works</p>
<p>-restart doesn't fix anything</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specs</p>
<p>Laptop/motherboard: Alienware 18</p>
<p>OS: windows 10 pro (upgraded from windows 7)</p>

            It got fixed. I unplugged the UTP and went completely offline. After restarting the machine I got a notification that one of my drivers are not installed. In the notification I was offered a trouble shooter which failed but I went to the device manager
 again and the device was finally listed. I've updated the driver and it's finally working now. Not sure what happened here but it seems like the LAN connection somehow interfered with the bluetooth device unless it's just a coincidence.

<p>WDO restarts the computer in come kind of protected mode, then displays a screen with several options for keyboard layouts.&nbsp; At this point it does not recognize any keyboard or mouse inputs.</p>
<p>How should I talk to it?</p>
<p>What is this protected mode?&nbsp; What determines what drivers it uses?&nbsp; Can they be changed?</p>

<p>Yeah, I saw that one, too.&nbsp; I was really hoping to use Windows Defender Offline.&nbsp; Is there some way to configure it to work with my computer?&nbsp; Regular Windows works just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try the free Kaspersky Virus Scanning Tool.&nbsp; It was easy to use and provided some additional comfort that my computer is not infected.</p>

                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying to add a system feature, among others is NetFx4-AdvSrvs, which fails with the above error. Now digging into this I noticed I kept getting the same error when running windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried running the update troubleshooter and it found some issues with the database and fixed them, but no mater what it says no updates get installed. Searching online also recommends running sfc but it fails with: "Windows Resource Protection could not
 start the repair service". I also tried with 2 scripts that resets the windows update services but nothing. I also tried adding the registry key for servicing with the version of windows but key is already there, with correct path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now in the windows update dialog I have: KB4487038, KB4462930, KB4134661 and Feature Update 1803 amd64 2019-04, nothing gets installed, same error on all even if I download the update package.</p>

            Hi CP.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The next steps after SFC fails to run is the Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool from this link choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  This reinstalls WIndows while saving your files and apps in place; takes about an hour, resolves most problems.  
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Sounds like a directory problem, or a corrupt USB drive that's on its way to failing.&nbsp; I'd back up essential documents, make SURE they're readable, then full-format the drive and see if that resolves the issue.&nbsp; If not I'd toss it and get another.</p>

    <title>Windows XP Pro won&#39;t boot, safe mode boot hangs at agp440.sys - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows XP Pro won&#39;t boot, safe mode boot hangs at agp440.sys</h2>
                    I can't boot either Normal or Safe from disk. It hangs after agp440.sys.&nbsp; I've tried to leave it to do whatever it might be doing in the background but it just doesn't complete.&nbsp; I have a Sony recovery CD but I can't boot from it unless I want to format
 the disk and re-install Windows. I don't want to do that since it takes the best part of two days to install it plus everything else and apply all updates.
<br />
<br />
What I have done is install Windows Home on a separate disk and that's working fine. I have also recovered my backups - Yes, I have backups - but I don't have incremental backups so there are still items I need to recover.&nbsp; I can do this easily since I have
 access to the Windows XP Pro boot disk from a USB caddy and all my data is still there intact.&nbsp; I just can't boot from this disk and consequently I can't get access to all the other free software that came with the Sony VAIO.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for a resolution to the boot problem - hanging after AGP440.sys (is there something I can repair on this disk to make it boot) - and/or how to extract Windows XP Pro and/or the free software from the Sony OEM disk.&nbsp;&nbsp; Adivice gratefully appreciated.&nbsp;
 Thanks.<br />

            If you see hard drive activity while the PC&nbsp;APPEARS&nbsp;to be stuck on agp440.sys, this is a GOOD thing since it means Windows XP is conducting chkdsk in the background. Let it finish, even if it takes all night. Just check it in the morning.
<div><br />
<div>If that is not the issue, you will need to create your own bootable Windows XP Recovery Console CD, configure your PC's BIOS to boot from it, then actually boot from it, and then run the chkdsk command with the /r switch. Complete instructions may be found
 in ElderL's post from this thread:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-system/my-computer-cant-boot-from-cd-even-if-its-bootable/7ec53eb2-c239-4553-842b-f4f87356dcdf?msgId=e330a41e-31ac-4aef-95a3-5c0f96cce7d7">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-system/my-computer-cant-boot-from-cd-even-if-its-bootable/7ec53eb2-c239-4553-842b-f4f87356dcdf?msgId=e330a41e-31ac-4aef-95a3-5c0f96cce7d7</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>For simplicity, here they are:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Power failures are notorious for corrupting your NT File System (NTFS), so you need to boot into the XP Recovery Console and run chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; until it reports no errors (that may take more than one pass).&nbsp; You are on the right track though.<br />
<br />
If after burning your CD as indicated below, you do NOT see the message:
<p><b>Press any key to boot from CD...</b></p>
<p>Then you need to get into the BIOS in your system of unspecified make and model and adjust the device boot order to put the CD Drive as the first boot device.</p>
<p>If you see the same missing or corrupt message instead something is not right and you need to look at things more closely.&nbsp; Sometimes there is an option on the screen when the system reboots to press a key to select a boot device (mine
 is F11) and then you can just choose the CD/DVD drive as the boot device.<br />
</p>
<p>If anybody wants to recreate these sorts of problems for practice, just pull the plug on your running XP system 4 or 5 times and you will all the message we know and love.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<br />
Here are my standard suggestions:<br />
<br />
You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig</a></p>
<p>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>When installing ImgBurn, DO NOT install the Ask toolbar.<br />
</p>
<p>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a></p>
<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system
 again.</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt or read about the XP Recovery Console here:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/recovery_console_cmds.mspx?mfr=true</a></p>
<p>A good idea before starting things is to first verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.</p>
<p>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any&nbsp;problems on the afflicted drive.</p>
<p>Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;It will not hurt anything to run it.</p>
<p>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</p>
<p>chkdsk C: /r</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It
 may even appear to go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</p>
<p>Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer.</p>
<p>You do not have to adjust the BIOS again to boot on the HDD since the CD will not be present.</p>

    <title>A Noob&#39;s Guide To The Hardcore Achievement - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            A Noob&#39;s Guide To The Hardcore Achievement</h2>
                    
<p>This should go without saying but... *SPOILERS AHEAD*</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off, there is a fantastic guide to getting this achievement already up on these new boards. I used it heavily in my own attempts to get this achievements and if you are getting ready to make a Hardcore run it very well might be the best resource out
 there. Some of what I am going to write here is merely a reflection of that fantastic piece of work.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, this post is meant to be less a walkthrough and more of a story/guide to preparing yourself for what has got to be one of the most satisfying achievements you can get. So if you are stuck at work, got some extra time on your hands, or really enjoy
 this game so much that you actually want to read about a stranger's experience, well then, grab a few beers and let's get this thing started.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b>Noob's Guide Part 1: Preparation</b></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b><br />
</b></span></p>
<p>If you are reading this now before you've attempted Hardcore, congratulations you've made a great start in preparation. I did not do that. It was a mistake.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on your interpretation of "cheating", I see no problem in preparing yourself in every way possible before starting a game that will put hours and hours of your life on the line. It only makes sense. I am not recommending, nor do I think it would
 really work, getting the strategy guide and sitting it next to you on the couch along with your liters of Mountain Dew and Teh Pounder of pretzels (those other things, however, serve a great purpose). I think having a guide like that would be distracting anyway.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I am suggesting is that you spend some time, maybe invest in one extra casual playthrough or get your zealot mode achievement, in which you locate all of the power nodes and semi-conductors. Personally, I didn't worry too much about schematics as by
 my third attempt I realized I needed just two guns and their ammo to beat the entire game. Most of the time schematics just took up inventory space. Power nodes and semi-conductors are critical though. Some guides suggest that there are enough nodes in the
 game to upgrade your stasis, rig, one full gun, and part of another so don't waste your credits on power nodes. This is true, but unfortunately that takes an entire game to achieve. If you have extra money, and if you play smart you will have extra money,
 there is nothing wrong buying 8-10 power nodes before you reach the end of the Ishimura level. It can also be the difference in the final few chapters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are getting your zealot achievement, take the time to consider which fights gave you the most trouble. Remember them and begin to think about a repeatable strategy. There is no excuse for stumbling into a bad situation in Hardcore mode. Getting surprised
 will get you killed faster than a Team Jacob groupie at a Team Edward rally. Know where the tough spots are so you can anticipate them and then beat them. The natural temptation is to consider fights that gave you trouble as areas in which to save but I am
 going to argue that there are far better ways to save this game than just before "tough fights". I'll talk about that soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I chose not to prepare for my first playthrough and thought to myself "I owned this game on Zealot this isn't going to be bad at all." Big, big mistake. I had forgotten about that first Tripod battle and when I walked through that door into the cavernous
 room where the fight is triggered... I remembered. I remembered and I got nervous because I wasn't bringing with me an entire arsenal from a previous playthrough. And when I get nervous I start to play stupid. I begin to overthink everything and then when
 something goes wrong I tend to over-compensate, usually by burning through all of my ammo and/or stasis. Suffice to say I survived that first fight but it wasn't long until I got burned and died my first time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Preparation: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Know where the nodes/conductors are.</p>
<p>- Remember where the tough fights are located</p>
<p>- Lots of soda/beer and food. </p>
<p>- Keep a soft pillow close in case you do end up dying and feel the uncontrollable need to throw something at the TV or the dog.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b>Noob's Guide Part 2: Strategy</b></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b><br />
</b></span></p>
<p><b>Rig and Stasis</b></p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p>Obviously, health is good and you want as much of it as possible. That said, it is also one of the most expensive things to upgrade in the entire game as you will spend 6 or 7 nodes that serve no purpose but to get you to the upgrade slots. Upgrading your
 health should be done over time. The very fist node you get should be spent on that first health upgrade, but after that consider taking Chapters 1-9 to get you to that last health node. I would recommend walking into the Ishimura with all, except for maybe
 the last one, upgraded. Some strategy guides will suggest keeping your initial Rig until you get the advanced suit in Chapter 11. I would disagree with this idea simply because your Engineering Rig doesn't give you enough inventory slots. Sure, usually you
 can run back to a store but there are many times in the game where you have to run
<i>forward</i> to a store and the last thing you want to be doing is dumping items so you can pick up health packs or clean out a Node Room. I recommend buying the Security Suit upgrade (the first suit upgrade you get after your initial one) and taking that
 one all the way to your Advanced Suit. It's just 10,000 credits and you'll reap the benefits within a couple chapters in inventory slots alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stasis is key in Hardcore. It will save you over and over again. Upgrading your stasis should be priority numero uno, at least to the point where you get more than two shots and your duration is longer than 3 seconds. By the time you get to your first bench
 you should have <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">5 nodes</span>. My opinion, after spending your first node on health, invest the rest in stasis. Then, use stasis often. If you die with stasis left, your death very well could have been avoided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Gun and Ammo </b></p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p>This is obviously, to an extent, a matter of opinion. Some people are better with certain guns. In my opinion though, there isn't a better one-two combo than the plasma cutter/force gun. You have precision and crowd control along with the force gun secondary
 fire for a high damage single shot. Plus, you get the Cutter right away and can begin upgrading it early on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is very little that the plasma cutter isn't at least good at and it's upgrade tree is inexpensive and quick. It's your bread and butter weapon for 95% of the game and by now you are probably extremely comfortable with it anyway. The drawback to this
 combo is that unless you buy the DLC you won't see the force gun until the beginning of Disk 2. This isn't a real problem as it gives you opportunity to invest the majority of your extra nodes into your plasma cutter, rig, and stasis. Speaking of upgrading
 your Cutter, as mentioned in the other guide, focus on damage and capacity. Speed and reload are secondary and I tended to avoid them as much as I could altogether. I did, however, end up spending a little extra to get the special (although I'm convinced it's
 not necessary).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are only a few parts in the first Disk where the force gun would be nice, but none so difficult I would recommend spending the money and nodes upgrading a third gun (like the line gun for example... not worth it in my opinion) to make up for it. The
 force gun schematic becomes available to you right after the Tripod battle in the elevator. Purchase the gun ASAP and conserve your ammo. The force gun becomes critical later in the game but you will want force ammo to drop so it's a good idea to start getting
 it in your inventory once you can purchase the gun. When upgrading the force gun, once again focus on damage, capacity, and ALT fire. You will probably only be able to upgrade this gun about half way, so be careful where you spend your nodes not to waste any
 barking up the wrong tree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only other gun I would recommend getting is the Detonator. It needs no upgrades to be powerful and there are certain battles that simply give you detonator ammo before the start, as if telling you how to win them.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Using Your 3 Saves Wisely</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><br />
</span></b></p>
<p>Use the Disk 2 save to its full advantage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The worst feeling in Hardcore is knowing that you used a save too early and now you are forced to play too much between saves, or you won't have a save near the end. I restarted Hardcore twice because I realized I had foolishly used my saves too early.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am convinced that the best way to beat Hardcore is to wait and use your first save until after you've reached disk 2. There are only a couple of difficult fights in the first disk and only a few areas of real concern. The best strategy here is to be confident
 you can beat them, which isn't too hard to do. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Disk 1 Dangers include:</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><br />
</span></p>
<p>- Two Vacuum rooms. I hate these things. I would recommend avoiding blasting out the windows if you can, but it is far better to blast them on your own than it is to accidentally blow one open while you are standing too close. I chose to stand as far back
 as I could and blast them just to be safe. It also saves you a ton of ammo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The Train ride. The difficulty of this particular area isn't high, but there is a good chance you will be struggling for ammo at some time during this fight. Stockpile beforehand if you can, and if you do find yourself low on ammo take the train ride slow
 and use stasis to take advantage of as many limbs/spikes as possible. When you fall out of the train and are hanging upside down, you've got about 7 seconds to grab any boxes for extra ammo and then always lead off with a spike or two. Once again, stasis is
 your friend here. Use it till it's gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Church of Unitology. Not especially difficult but long and full of necromorphs. Don't go into a fight with limited health and/or ammo. There is always a store available and easy to get to at any point in this section. Become a regular. Also, there is a
 necromorph that falls in the final elevator ride up to the cutscene. I died there once. To put it lightly... I was upset. Stasis, ground and pound. Done and done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The Tripod battle in space. This is one of the few instant death sequences in the first disk. Nothing you can do but be sure about your shot and hit that canister. Never actually died here. Never actually want to.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The second fight in the room with the Pregnant necromorphs. I'm sorry I don't have a better description, but you go down an elevator and you see a dead soldier on the ground with his hologram on. There's a save station there that tempts you and when you
 make a right turn into the cavernous room you are met by one of the pregnant necromorphs. This fight is tricky not because of those guys (although, if you blow them open you are in for a serious battle) but because of the number of fast Leaper necros that
 have that devastating tail attack. Your best bet here is to kill the first Pregnant and run into the hallway where the store is located. Hole up there and be ready to use stasis liberally. There are at least 4 Leapers that will come at you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The School Cafeteria battle. The first time I did this fight it was overwhelming. It's really quite easy. If you stay in that corner where you hack the panel, simply move that stasis canister where you can easily grab it. Take care of the Pack with your
 Cutter and as soon as you see the Infector necro (winged, bat creature) enter the room shoot it with the canister and take care of it. A few more Pack will come out but you are in the clear at that point.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- First Stalker Battle. This fight is actually quite easy. Just run out to the lockers on the left until you hear it trigger the Stalkers and then run straight back into the caged ramp area where you entered the room. All of the Stalkers follow a similar
 line of attack where the peek over the boxes in front of you or on either side and then attack. Stasis isn't even necessary to take them out. The Detonator is helpful here. After this battle it is an easy walk to the end of disk 1. Well done.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Disk 2 Tips</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><br />
</span></b></p>
<p>First off, take a break. There is always a temptation to save the game soon after getting to disk 2 but that should be avoided. You will want to use that save point to its max. If you come back to disk 2 refreshed and ready to start it over again like new,
 you are in much better shape to make good decisions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Save 1</b></p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p>My recommendation is to make your first save once you've reached the Ishimura and after you have defeated the two Brutes. That fight is easy assuming you've stockpiled enough ammo. Simply stasis and shoot the first brute and once you trigger the second brute
 run all the way back to the end of the hallway and let him come to you. Kill him the same way and now all of the necromorphs will be ahead of you. Easy peasy. There is a store and a save station waiting for you.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recommend this as a first save because it is about 1.5 to 2 hours into the second disk and sets up very close to the difficult battle in the Ishimura where you fight mob after mob trying to turn on the Centrifuge. There are a couple of areas of concern
 before this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The instant death sequences. I forget what this room is called but it requires careful navigation to get through the grinders and steam. This is an area where overthinking can kill you. Each of the sequences is very simple and the necromorphs waiting for
 you after each one should be the most troublesome. You don't even need stasis to get through the first one. The second obstacle has a moving machine blocking steam and I found catching it at the bottom gave me the most time to make it through (with upgraded
 stasis it was almost 8 seconds) and the last is easy enough with stasis. Even if you die here, the trip back isn't awful timewise.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- A no-space vacuum room. My recommendation is to not blow out this window. Stasis the slasher that falls and take care of him quickly then turn around and stasis the Exploder that drops in as well. Kill him without hitting is exploding arm, grab the node,
 and ****. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The Space Jump after the light beams. Watch this on Youtube before you do it. Get the sequence down in your head and you will be good to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The CEC Welcome Station. This is the part right after the jump that initially had a brute but now has the windows blown out and you get a heavy dose of Pack, Spitters, and Leapers. Stasis, Health, continual movement, and keeping it close to the exit makes
 this fight not half as bad. Remember, there is a store right before this fight and it is the first station where you can spend your Peng. You'll have the credits to make it work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The Stalker room right before the Ishimura. This room is also easy. Get rid of the Cysts, use the stasis canisters to take care of the Stalkers and save one stasis canister for the Tormentor on the wall at the very end. Stasis the Tormentor, run around
 the side and grab the explosive canister. One shot and he's taken care of. You are on your way to your first save.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Save 2</b></p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p>I chose to use this save before the elevator ride that leads up to the drill ride. The elevator is a classic place where things can get kind of out of hand and it is so close to the drill ride that I figured why take the chance? This save should take you
 all the way up through the government sector and right to the eye poke machine.Tips for the drill ride? Force Gun, continually check the ledges for exploding canisters to take care of the Lurkers, and have lots of health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Save 3</b></p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p>Personally, I've never had an issue with the eye poke machine but I figured, once again, why take the chance to save myself 5 minutes of playtime at the sacrifice of 45 minutes? With this being the final save all you have to do is move quickly through the
 remainder of the game all the way to the end. You'll have the regenerator at your heels the entire time so it keeps you moving. There is one (maybe two?) final stores between this save and the end so be sure and use up all your credits on health, ammo, and
 grab all stasis packs you have left (which, by the way, you only want to hoard over the course of the entire game).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b>Noob's Guide Part 3 - Execution</b></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b><br />
</b></span></p>
<p>Once you get started be sure and stick to your plan. Hardcore mode is not a mode to get fancy with and definitely not something you want to use for getting a few final achievements. Don't save up health packs if you need them right then. You shouldn't enter
 a fight with anything less than 80% health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no excuse for running out of ammo. Keep a close eye on your ammo count and sell everything you don't think you'll need so you can keep it stocked. If you've done a good job getting conductors and Peng, you'll have plenty of credits. Be sure and
 keep Ammo -&gt; Health -&gt; Nodes prioritized in that order. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep mobs in front of you as much as possible. If that means keep moving, do it. It is much better to get nicked by a mob than it is to get jumped by one and have to smash A to get away only to be surrounded by three new guys. If you aren't sure or confident
 of your backside, use a detonator shell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first couple of playthroughs I died in places I had never died before. I got jumped by a Necro coming out of a wall I had forgotten about and I fell through an elevator by backing myself into an edge thinking a necro was going to drop. Both were ridiculous
 ways to lose an hour or two. The rest of my deaths were due to greed (trying to get through the entire Ishimura without saving), poor planning during the instant death sequence room, and having no health during the room where you have to outrun the lasers.

<p>Execution. Play your game and be good at it. We all know when we play sloppy and make dumb mistakes. This mode makes you pay for it in a bad way. Do these things and you'll be just fine. There is nothing quite like being able to save your progress in Hardcore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In reality, this beauty of this achievement is how stressful it makes the game knowing that at certain points how much time you have on the line. By this point, you probably know Dead Space so well that "scary" isn't how you'd describe this game at all.
 This achievement brings back the heart pumping stress you missed since your first playthrough of the original Dead Space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For 50g this achievement is definitely not worth it, but if you are looking to achieve the entire game, or love the challenge, it is no doubt one you will look at with the most pride. Good Luck.</p>

<h2>            Skyrim Draw Distance Issues and flickering in patch 1.9.31.0.8 after clearing game and content Cache.</h2>
                    My Skyrim game started to run horribly with draw distance issues with flickering and lagging. After clearing the game and content cache, it became worse and started to happen more often. If you have encountered any other problems like this. Please make
 a response.

<p>Hey RayRaxx126,</p>
<p>I'm sorry of your issues in Skyrim.</p>
<p>Try to install the game in the hard disk.</p>
<p>To install the game you have to go in the dashboard's home, press the buttom "X" on the game's icon and then press "Install".</p>
<p>It should works.</p>
        </p>

<p>Also, manually go into your system memory and delete every Skyrim update, then redownload the patch.</p>
<p>Skyrim has had issues where a new patch doesn't override the old and causes glitches because of it.</p>
