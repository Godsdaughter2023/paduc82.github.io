            Hello,
<br />
<br />I am an independent Advisor trying to help, I suggest to you performance an office repair, before you have to check and install the operative systems and office updates.
<br />
<br />Repair steps:
<br />Go to the control panel &gt; open programs and features &gt; click office &gt; click change &gt; and try the quick repair. This will take a few minutes.
<br />If this doesn’t work try the online repair.
<br />Go to the control panel &gt; open programs and features &gt; click office &gt; click change &gt; and try the online repair. This can take around 10 minutes or more.
<br />
<br />Let me know if this worked for you.
<br />Regards.       
        </p>

            <p>most of the issues probably would go away if you make a clean install with an ISO file, the space windows is taking because it's still reserving your old 8.1 version so that you can restore it anytime, if you don't want to restore you can easily delete it
 via disk cleanup system files which will delete the old windows files in which case you won't be able to restore it anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so if you want to really try windows 10 with many less issues you can flash an ISO and clean install</p>

            thank you. no i shouldn't have to do any of it I should be able to just click the thing and be at the control panel. It adds more steps to the menus... Microsoft needs to make windows straight forward and user friendly so far they have been failing since
 XP.

<p>perhaps it would be easier to 'ghost' the drive beforehand, then recover it if you don't like the changes [which from what I've seen is *LIKELY*].</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen many IT pros do this with machines that constantly have 'new stuff' installed on them to test things, then have to be restored quickly so they can be re-used again. &nbsp;So the IT guy creates a 'ghost' image with some Norton 'ghost' utility, and restores
 it periodically. &nbsp;It's also nice with an OS like 7 when you want to create a new user setup, to clone it from a 'ghost' image, then enter the correct license key later from one of the system apps [I forget which one lets you do this].</p>
<p>
</p><p>but yeah, "whole drive ghosting" might have been a nice backup feature to include, even if it requires a 2nd hard drive (or NAS) to do it. &nbsp;But those kind of 'backup' features are *gone* now, like blowing in the wind or something, like tumbleweeds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I wasn't planning on upgrading to 10 anyway. &nbsp;I'd lose to much 'downgrading' to 10 from 7. &nbsp;No need to go into details why, since those are covered in different threads. &nbsp;This one's about 'rolling back'. &nbsp;And 'drive ghosting' is probably the most reliable
 form of backup that I know of.</p>

            I used to do lots of ghosting but now with the speed of SSDs and my home&nbsp;network its easier just to pick and choose what I want and back it up to my storage server. I have Windows 10 still on one of my computers. But for the time being I'm going to run
 off 8.1 for my systems. Even after release Ill probably hold on and only install it on my gaming rig just for DX12. Windows 10 from playing around with the preview for a bit isn't going to be as good as windows 7 was but that's still a good step up from windows
 8. Microsoft three steps forward eight back then seven forward....

    <title>Should I buy a windows phone&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrbigbo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Should I buy a windows phone&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My 1320 looks like its going to die soon so I need to change it. I really want a windows phone running windows 10 and up until recently I was automatically going to buy a 950xl.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never&nbsp;had an issue with the lack of apps on the windows store however just recently we have lost some key apps (key to me that is) i.e. All the Here apps especially Drive+, Flightradar24 has now gone, Microsoft have removed Reading List and it looks
 like the Met Office app is not available for Windows 10,&nbsp;I'm still checking other apps I use. Drive+ and Flightradar24 are particularly annoying as they were both paid for apps and I doubt I will get a refund.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I suppose the real questions is What is the future of Windows Phone? Are more developers going to abandon it? or will the success of Windows 10 finally have a positive effect on the windows phone market?</p>

            So difficult to know where MS is going. I have the Lunia 950 and have had no issues. That said, it's really unclear how long MS is going to be a player with the Win 10 mobile. So for now, I am happy with the phone, but it is going to take some&nbsp;time to
 see of the uniform&nbsp;win 10 idea takes flight or fails.&nbsp;

            <p>I have a Windows phone (Lumina 640lte) which when I bought it 18 months ago&nbsp;or so, had Windows 8, but was updated a couple of times so was running 8.1 I believe.&nbsp; A couple of months ago Microsoft came up with the update so was able to run Windows 10 on it.&nbsp;
<p>I was only saying to a friend a few days ago that it is the best phone that I have used for a long time. I have a Samsung in a cupboard somewhere, periodically have got it out but within a few days have always gone back to my Microsoft Lumina phone. I am
 even thinking&nbsp; of updating to the 950xl&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just checking on my 640 now and the reading list is operating fine..&nbsp;I only paid for the flight radar app once. That was when I had the Samsung phone and before you could get the App for the Microsoft phone. I just went online one day and searched for the
 App (flight radar24) and it worked okay on the windows phone. So. I still reckon the Microsoft phone is an outstanding phone and if I have to buy again would be a Microsoft phone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know as you do What is the future of Windows phone as I heard a rumour they were going to abandon the phone market. Guess we will find out eventually if that's correct or a rumour. All the best.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;950xl was a good phone even, better when they had Messaging SMS between Window 10 PC and Phone.<br />
</p>
<p>Now they removed that feature the phone is just a phone nothing special.<br />

            <p>I am sure if I was able to upgrade my 1320 to W10 Flightradar24 would run just fine. But if I buy a 950xl as far as I can see its not possible to install Flightradar24 as it is no longer available in the Windows Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also surprised at the lack of response to this discussion, I thought that there were many Windows 10 Mobile supporters on this forum, sadly I think this reflects the lack of support for windows phone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea where to go from here, I will never buy into the Android environment, been there done that, never again, and IOS is not a lot better and very much more expensive, and again been there done that and again not impressed!</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, the reason I'm even on this page is because I&nbsp;own the 950 and have been shocked and dismayed over&nbsp;what has transpired within the Windows App store and the lack of functionality and compatibility with other platforms.

<p>I feel like I'm all alone in the universe, when no one I know uses a Windows phone anymore and&nbsp;all the original Nokia functionality is gone (HERE Maps, Nokia Music, etc). The apps are clearly not being updated, since they are failing over 50% of the time
 and there are no new, relevant apps being added anymore. </p>
<p>So, to answer your original question...NO, you should not go out and buy a Windows phone. The one I have is slowly becoming a paperweight and I'm finding it harder &amp; harder to defend the ecosystem when friends ask me, "So, why do you still have a Windows
 phone? Isn't that dead now?" </p>

            Well, I have the Lumia 950XL, and am happy with it, but I suppose it depends what apps you really want. I have no problems with the apps I use, but then I do not use Maps on there and rarely listen to music, although all the music I put on my PC are on
 my mobile if need be. I far rather use my I-Pad when not at my PC, as easier to read and look at things, than the small screen, personally.

            <p>It is App dependent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From both a hardware and OS point of view my 950XL is better in almost every way than my iPhone 6S Plus.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure, as my 950XL is running the fast insider previews it can be much less stable than my iPhone running iOS 10 beta and battery life varies with different releases but when I want to use a phone in general I pick up the 950XL and with Hello, it even winks
 back at me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where I need an app I pick up the iPhone. Pretty much all the big names are there and if that app is available on the Win 10 Mobile, the iOS version is more likely to be up to date and have more functions - Sometimes even with MS apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But don't get me wrong - Maps is now as good or better than Here Drive+ ever was. Groove on my phone is better than Groove on my PC - I have 232 Gb on my 950XL and the SD card is a 15,000 song library on it. Being able to create a music folder on the Start
 screen with a mix of pinned albums or artists etc means I never use Music on the iPhone.&nbsp;On this I wish Win 10 Mobile allowed always on when on power (but appreciate you can things from the lock screen).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is easier to use မြန်မာ (Myanmar) text on the Win 10 Mobile - but you are mostly locked to Unicode and with a keyboard that is only able to use Visual order when Win 10 PC 's မြန်မာ Myanmar keyboard only uses Unicode/Sort order (Unicode purists in မြန်မာ
 want the latter but people using Androids or older computers are used to the former - Why not port the phone keyboard to the PC and PC keyboard to the phone so people can choose). iPhone allows more flexibility to switch between မြန်မာ font formats but locks
 you into one at a time. On the Windows 10 Mobile, I can use Facebook by Facebook to show မြန်မာ fonts correctly where posters use&nbsp;Unicode and မြန်မာဖေ့ဘုတ် where they posted in Zawgyi fonts at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The elephant in the room is uncertainty - Will MS kill Win 10 Mobile? Will it reinvigorate its market with the Surface Phone in October, 2017 or 2018 (which would be far too late)? Will it do something about the apps&nbsp;like allow Android phone apps to work
 on Window 10 Mobile whilst making UWP and Continuum more compelling and usable? The former would allow&nbsp;banking and&nbsp;pay apps etc. (perhaps even the next Pokemon Go) to&nbsp;work without all these businesses needing to support a third environment, the latter to allow
 your phone to reach the potential that high end and emerging hardware provides.</p>

<h2>            Play audio across slides crashes slide show</h2>
                    When an audio file is inserted into a Powerpoint 2010 slide and the playback settings are set to play across slides, Powerpoint crashes when you try to view the slide show.&nbsp; It does not depend on the audio format - same problem with mp3 and wav.&nbsp; Also
 does not depend on animation object&nbsp;settings (i.e. play for xxx slides) - crashes regardless of setting.&nbsp; Can get around problem by using wav file as transition and setting it to play until next sound, but the fact that there is a workaround is not a solution.&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks so much for that workaround tip which works for me with a slight modification. In my case, I didn't want my .wav file to loop so I had to find a "Silence.wav" file to stop it. I guess I will&nbsp;have to use the workaround until Microsoft fixes the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, there was one difference I noticed&nbsp;between our issue. If I set the file to play automatically or On Click, it worked. It was ONLY when I set it to "play across multiple slides" that it crashes upon presenting.</p>

<p>Hi LouisDarling,</p>
<p>Do you mean that you want to add room mailboxes to People-&gt;Directory in OWA (Outlook Web App)? If so, we can’t achieve that in Office 365. We can only add them to My Contacts by performing the steps below:</p>
<p>1. Login to OWA (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/owa/</a>).</p>
<p>2. Click Settings (the gear)-&gt;Options-&gt;People-&gt;Import contacts.</p>
<p>If I have misunderstood your question, please clarify it with more detailed information.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Larry</p>

<p>In the calendar when I book a slot it, at the end of details there is an add room button. When pressed it says 'no rooms were found in the directory'. How do I add rooms to this directory, where do I find it? Hope this is clearer. Many thanks Louis</p>

<p>Hi LouisDarling,</p>

https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>2. Click recipients-&gt;resources.</p>
<p>3. Click Add(+)-&gt;Room mailbox.</p>
<p>4. Type the information needed, then Save.</p>
<p>After that, you can select the room when clicking add room button.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>hi louisdarling,</p>
<p>i have read all posts in the thread.</p>
<p>to better help you, may i know whether you are an admin of office 365? can you see the admin app like the screenshot shows below?</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=edc00510-c57a-498a-9ac8-1f279f5ff44a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dedc00510-c57a-498a-9ac8-1f279f5ff44a" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if not, it means you are not the admin of office 365. you cannot create a room mailbox. given the situation, can you contact your office 365 admin to do it?</p>
<p>if you can see the admin app, can you follow the steps below to upload a screenshot of the page after you click the link larry provided in step 2?</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp;click use rich formatting on the bottom of this thread-&gt;click insert image as the picture shows.</p>

            Since the release of Windows 8, one of&nbsp;new element to Windows&nbsp;including Windows 10&nbsp;is the requirement that&nbsp;Modern applications have a minimum of 1024x768 screen resolution, and 1366x768 for the snap feature. If you attempt to launch a Metro style app with
 less than this resolution (e.g. 800x600, 1024x600) you will receive an error message.

            have you checked that other apps / built-in web browser on your E5 is able to connect to the Internet? may also pay to check that you have the correct cellular data settings and that it is activated.

<h2>            Windows 10 restores itself on reboot after installing Insider Preview</h2>
                    So my installation works fine, but when I activate the linux subsystem it asks me to restart after installing. Once the system restarts it immediately starts reverting to the last system restore point. Anyone else experiencing this issue?

</p><p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>We understand the computer goes to system restore point&nbsp;while the system restarts.&nbsp;We'll certainly assist you with this.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue might have been caused due to corrupted drivers or startup settings.
</span><span>I suggest you to boot the system in Safe Mode and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Try booting the system in Safe Mode and check the status of the issue.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Safe mode</span></strong><span> starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services. If a problem doesn't reappear when you start your PC in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers and services as possible
 causes. Refer the link below for steps to boot in Safe Mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/get-to-safe-mode-and-other-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/get-to-safe-mode-and-other-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are not able to boot to the desktop or the issue persists in Safe Mode, try performing a Startup repair to check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Perform a Startup Repair on the system</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Create a Windows 10 installation media and perform a Startup Repair on the device and check if it helps to resolve the issue.
</span><span>This is an alternate way to boot the device and run recovery tools when something goes wrong with the Operating system.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please follow the steps below to do <strong>Startup repair</strong>:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span> </span></span></span><span>Insert the <strong>installation USB drive
</strong>and boot Windows </span><span>10&nbsp;from it. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don't have one, you can&nbsp;</span><strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Create an&nbsp;installation Media</span></a></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span> </span></span></span><span>In the ‘<strong>Windows setup’
</strong>page select the ‘<strong>language to install’</strong>, ‘<strong>Time and currency format’
</strong>and the ‘<strong>keyboard or input method</strong>’ and click on ‘<strong>next’</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span> </span></span></span><span>Click on ‘<strong>Repair your computer’
</strong>and select ‘<strong>Troubleshoot’</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span> </span></span></span><span>Click on ‘<strong>Advanced options’
</strong>and select ‘<strong>Startup Repair’ </strong>and select the operating system.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps, let us know the status of&nbsp;the issue.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Based on your description, my understanding is that you cannot open some specific Excel files which are stored in local OneDrive sync folder. If this is not the situation, please feel free to clarify
 it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you try opening Excel application first, then go to File&gt;Open, locate to the local OneDrive sync folder, check if you can open the files you mentioned?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, we'd like to confirm the following information for troubleshooting:</p>
<p>1.Can you open the affected Excel files on your laptop?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.Does the issue only happen to these specific Excel files?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.Can you open Excel application directly?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.If you cannot open Excel application, can you open other Office applications such as Word? If yes, please go to File&gt;Account, then capture a full screenshot of

<p>5.For the affected files, what is their file extension?</p>

<h2>            Moving files into folders with subfolders, or accessing the subfolders.</h2>
                    <p>Hello!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would greatly appreciate it if you would endorse the following idea with your comments, and clicking the "Me Too" link above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the ideas I've had for a while is to improve what happens when a user drags a file on top of a folder with other folders inside it; both in Explorer and on the Desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Typically, when a user drags and drops a file on top of a folder with folders inside it, Windows moves the file into the folder. Instead, if a user hovers over the folder for a second, could subfolders animate in next to it? That way, dragging files into
 the right folder feels more intuitive. So, if I grabbed a file on my desktop, then hovered over a folder for a second, the folders inside it would appear next to it (in a non-jarring fashion). In Explorer, the subfolders could "grow" underneath or beside the
 main folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, if there were subfolders of the subfolder (ex. Folder&gt;Folder2&gt;Folder3), those would grow upon hovering over Folder2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would increase my file management greatly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same feature could be used for accessing subfolders. Instead of double-clicking to see inside the folder, just click and hold: and VIOLA! the subfolders appear. And if you hovered over THAT subfolder, the folders inside it would then appear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that while this feature may be strange to read, it would make sense when you saw it in action. If you have a hard time visualizing what I'm trying to say, I'll attempt to animate a scenario of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Logan</p>

<h2>            HELP&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; I lost my Bing rewards&#33; Where did they go&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Hello to all,<br />
<br />
First of all I hope this is the correct category. There were only 3 to choose from at the bottom of this inquiry.<br />
<br />
I signed on yesterday to my FAVORITE search engine in the world and it told me to sign up for Bing rewards. I'm very confused because I've been using Bing for YEARS. I have/had over 2000 points as of Sunday night!<br />
Yesterday I was in a panic. Tried to contact Bing itself so finally in my travels I found 'help' on here.
<br />
Can someone pls tell me what's goin on and how do get those hard earned points back!(seriously, I always check every morning for the extra points and do the searches in one shot.<br />
Signed,<br />
A Faithful Binger<br />
P.S. I defend Bing when someone doesn't like it! I say "you can learn something new everyday about the pics/wallpapers!"<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Office 2007&#58; error during setup.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,&nbsp; I am trying to install Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007 onto my 64 bit version of Windows 7.&nbsp; Before I knew better, I tried to install it when I actually had a trial version installed already.&nbsp; Since then, I have uninstalled the trial version,
 but now cannot install Office at all.&nbsp; The installation progress bar gets about halfway before it notifies me there was an error during setup - but does not give any specific code.&nbsp; I have tried the following with no success:</p>
<p>- automatic and manual uninstallation of all Office files and registry keys</p>
<p>- install while in safe mode</p>
<p>- no antivirus programs installed and windows defender is turned off</p>
<p>- uninstall of rgnstck file</p>
<p>- install of trial version from website</p>
<p>- copying files from cd onto hard drive and installing from hard drive</p>
<p>- administrator rights</p>
<p>- removal of activation assistant with trial version</p>
<p>What else can I do?&nbsp; The only other option I have not done is a complete re-install of my operating system.&nbsp; Thanks for your help!</p>

    <title>Backing Up Contacts Without Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vecs alocar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Backing Up Contacts Without Outlook</h2>
                    I need to perform a hard reset because my T-Mobile Dash with WM6 is freaking out, but I cannot afford to buy Outlook just to back up my Contacts information. All T-Mobile tells me to do is to back up my contacts to the SIM card, which deletes most of the
 information from my contacts that I need to keep, such as email, street address and business information.<br />
<br />
Is there a way that I can back-up my Contacts without Outlook?<br />

    <title>how can create an Outlook.com account with a reserved domain - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cspx210  say:</h3>
<h2>            how can create an Outlook.com account with a reserved domain</h2>
                    Using Live services for small business, I created a custom domain through Microsoft, and now I want to add a user account under this domain. &nbsp;Since creating the domain the registration is with the original registrar, but now under my name instead of Microsoft.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now, when creating the Outlook.com account for another person with my domain get a message that I cannot use the email address. &nbsp;During the new account set up I get the message that the email address cannot be used because it is a reserved domain. &nbsp;What's
 the process for verifying I'm the domain authority and Microsoft is permitted to add the new Outlook.com account using this domain?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can't even use this domain to create a domain. &nbsp;There were tools that allowed me to add individual accounts under my domain, but this feature isn't available since Live small business serviced went away.</div>

<p>I have the same problem. Not sending, stays&nbsp; in the outbox,</p>
<p>Error on Outlook could not logon to the outgoing mail server SMTP. The problem could be the server name, your server may require autentication, our your server may not support SSL.. Verfy on more settings</p>
