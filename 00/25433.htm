<h2>            word always opens with the strike through format</h2>
                    Every time I open WORD and type, the letters come with a strike through. I know there is a standard way to set the settings for WORD, but I can't remember how.<br />
Your help is appreciated.<br />
Thank you.<br />

<br />
There is no need to keep both solutions together, because having both is useless since one can do the job.. but here norton internet security has additional security.. stick to one solution... either uninstall norton and stay with defender or vice versa..
<br />
if you stay with defender, you could have the extra protection with window firewall.<br />
<br />
Having multiple antivirus solutions will cause much issues like your issue.. besides having such things together is pretty much resource intensive.. it will eat your ram and processing power and ultimately you have to experience slow computer.....
<br />
<br />
<b>Turning defender off is natural upon installing a third party security solution on windows 8...&nbsp; it will turn on the following registry keys<br />
</b><br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender]<br />
"DisableAntiSpyware"=dword:00000001<br />
"DisableAntiVirus"=dword:00000001<br />
<br />
<b>To turn defender on you must uninstall the third party security solution... </b>

<h2>            Audio Conferencing with Office 365 Business Essentials</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our company has a mix of "Office 365 Business Essentials" and "Office 365 Enterprise E1" licenses.</p>
<p>We are thinking about implementing MS Teams as a collaboration tool.</p>
<p>One of the requirements is to have a phone call-in option that can be implemented using an "Audio Conferencing" add-on.</p>
<p>All articles about AC licensing state that we need an&nbsp;"Office 365 Enterprise E1" to have an AC.</p>
<p>But when I'm configuring a licensing for a user I see this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7fd5c940-b2e8-444e-89fb-4e9787a032c6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7fd5c940-b2e8-444e-89fb-4e9787a032c6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>"<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Audio Conferencing can't be used without Office 365 Business Essentials</span>"<br />
</p>
<p>Does this mean that "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Audio Conferencing
<strong>CAN</strong> be used <strong>WITH</strong> Office 365 Business Essentials</span>"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this configuration (Audio Conferencing with Office 365 Business Essentials) and it works. Is anything wrong with this?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I know you guys in Microsoft know this. I know there's been a ton of similar posts. I also know that this problem still persist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want you to know that I've done all that I can to try to fix this thing. I want you to know that I've read many of the original posts with the same problems that has no solutions..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want you to realize that I have stop using Windows 10 Mail app for 6 months now, and I was happy. I want you to realize that the minute I tried to fix this issue, I became very unhappy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want you to understand that I've decided, and i can only guess that tens upon thousands of others like me, that I will not use Windows Mail app, or any other Microsoft apps anymore, because shockingly as it may seem to you, I like being happy and i want
 to continue being happy. </p>

            <p>Same here, just upgraded my laptop and the YouTube videos play but without display or do not play at all or jibberish. Now using my own website which has some code to display YouTube videos I experience the same BUT sometimes without knowing why the video
 starts playing like it should, perfect without issues. So it is a strange issue to say the least but in all cases when trying to open for the first time it definitely does not work. Hope there will be a fix soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since we have a new OS I did uninstall my old java and ffdshow which was installed before the upgrade. Also I upgraded my AMD Graphics controlcenter and did a registry cleaning but so far nothing I did helped to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ow last but not least, when trying to watch a video on YouTube I do get the message "an error has occured" in the mediaplayer screen after which is seems to 'reset' itself and tries to load to video again without luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />

            <p>I'm experiencing the same issue. I have many videos that I saved over the years, mostly in MP4 format. None of them work right. About half of the screen appears smudged. Video plays with jitters. I contacted answer desk.&nbsp;As soon as I mentioned the problem,
 the first tech stopped chatting with me.&nbsp;I disconnected after receiving no reply after asking if the gentleman was still&nbsp;there.&nbsp;Connected with another Tech right after. This gentleman disconnected from our chat without giving me any notice right after I described
 the problem. I was surprised that he had the audacity to send me a survey asking if he solved my problem? I asked for a phone call the next time. Never got the phone call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can play the videos on a Sony video player that came with the computer just fine.&nbsp;YouTube videos play fine on Google Chrome.</p>

<h2>            Is there a way to get Outlook &#34;reminders&#34; to act more like &#34;ALARMS&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to get Outlook event reminders to act more like "alarms"?&nbsp; We really enjoy the functionality of shared calendars; however, I notice that unless we happen to be looking at a screen, calendar events might pass unnoticed.&nbsp; Alarms command your
 attention and will get louder and more insistent until you snooze or dismiss them.&nbsp; Reminders, on the other hand,&nbsp;commonly silently appear on your screen (phone or tablet in particular) if you have the volume turned down.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even with the volume on a normal
 level, at most you get a few seconds of whatever soft notice sound you've picked.&nbsp; It's like a stealth reminder as a backup to memory, in case you're&nbsp;momentarily not&nbsp;paying very close attention to the clock and remembering each step of your work day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compounding this problem, we have shared calendars.&nbsp; Someone might add an event, with a suitable reminder prior to the event, but I might have no idea it's in my calendar until the next time I happen to look at my phone's screen.</p>
<p>It seems to me it would be better to have reminders act more like alarms, prompting some user interaction before they quiet themselves.&nbsp; If it's important enough to put in your calendar, it should be important enough to want to be there/do it on time...
 not whenever you happen to next be in front of a screen.</p>
<p>I've tried secondary market add-ons such as "Cal" and others, but those seem better suited to people who have multiple calendars and want them consolidated than for those who might view the items on their calendar to be important.</p>
<p>Suggestions?</p>

            <p>That's an unfortunate answer.&nbsp; Not altogether unexpected, since I've been searching for quite a while, but troubling nonetheless.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify CastroJenny's reply to my question, should anyone else stumble upon this thread: you cannot actually choose a louder sound.&nbsp; Whatever sound you might choose will play only as loudly as your volume happens to be set at the precise moment of
 the "alert" and will only play for about 3 seconds.&nbsp; If your phone or tablet is quieted, muted, your attention is briefly diverted, an ambulance drives by... whatever, you will most assuredly miss that notice in your calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't worry though, the next time you happen upon the alert center in your phone or tablet it will silently gleam at you about whatever important thing you most recently missed.&nbsp; Pick up mom at the hospital?&nbsp; You're not likely to go too many hours without
 glancing at the screen on your phone.&nbsp; Pick your kids up from sports?&nbsp; The time they spend waiting will likely be great social time.&nbsp; And some people say that you should never be on time for a client meeting, it makes them feel that you're not busy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If, however, you are still worried about this you might either leave your phone somewhere in close proximity to your ear, refusing to quite it for meetings, or leave the volume up all the time for phone calls, texts, email alerts, game notices, and such.&nbsp;
 This way the six or seven notes of your alert sound won't be missed.&nbsp; The people you do business with are bound to think you're quite popular.</p>

            What a fantastic response to the response, I am looking for the exact same thing for the exact same reasons. &nbsp;Maybe we will get lucky and Microsoft will look at that and say, "Well we could add that functionality to Outlook with a couple of lines of code,
 then I wouldn't have missed that important meeting with Bill G the other day." &nbsp;One can only hope.

            <p>Since this was posted a year ago, and I am still have this problem now with Outlook2016, I suspect Microsoft has not decided to add in those few lines of code for us.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would prefer that the reminder window open in the FOREGROUND instead of the BACKGROUND, even if it does interrupt the focus on my work. That way, I don't get fired for missing a meeting&nbsp;and can actually continue to work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone seen anything from someone who actually used one the third-party options from the above slipstick site?</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 cannot archive mail</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had upgraded my office 2007 to 2016 recently. a few day ago, it had sent a mail to me to remind my mail only has a little bit storage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I use archive tool to archive my old mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I had finished the configuration on the archive, on the bottom bar, it has shown that it was archiving the mailbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>but just a few seconds, it back to "All folders are up to date. Connected: Microsoft exchange".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new .pst had been created and in my outlook left side, I can see my archive folder. But there is no any mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have anyone face the same issue like me? Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had turned off the auto-archive already.</p>
<p>

<br />Did you  import mail into the account? By default, archive works on the modified date, not received date.

<br />If you change the archive period to more recent, does it work?

<h2>            Checking if a Record is Locked in Access Using VBA</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to check if a record is locked in Access using VBA?&nbsp; I want to notify users that a record is locked before they try to enter any updates.&nbsp; I've used the Record Locks property in forms before, but I want something more elegant.&nbsp; I did find
 an old post here with a link to an article allegedly written by Allen Browne, but the link no longer works and when I contacted Allen, he said it wasn't his article.</p>

            <p>The typical approach is to show the Record Selector and train the user to look for the Stop sign in it.</p>
<p>I know that's not a VBA solution; I don't think there is one short of trying to save and handling the error message elegantly, or short of implementing your own lock tracking fields.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, it appears you have set the Record Locks property to something other than No Locks. That is rarely a good idea. Are you sure it is in your case?</p>

</p><p>I don't like using the record selector approach because it requires the user to notice the icon.&nbsp; In addition, in this particular application I hide the record selector.&nbsp; Although I'm aware of setting the Record Locks property to Edited Record, I don't use
 it since I think the way Access handles optimistic locking is better than the way it handles pessimistic locking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that said, I decided to develop a solution for handling locks within VBA.&nbsp; I'm testing it now and it works well.&nbsp; To make a long story short, when a user accesses a record that's already been opened by another user, they see a message box telling them
 the record is being used by another user.&nbsp; They also see the computer name, which in most cases is the same as the user name, of the computer that has accessed the record.</p>

<h2>            List of Stocks does not update in Finance tile</h2>
                    <p>On the health app on my phone I've updated my list of stocks in the finance tile, but on the band the list of stocks doesn't change.&nbsp; When I go back into the app on the phone and edit the finance tile again, the list of stocks reverts back to the factory
 defaults.</p>

            I have a similar problem with the finance tile.&nbsp; When I added a list of mutual funds to my finance tile in the health app on the phone, each one was found and added to the list.&nbsp; However, only the Dow Jones Avg (which was the only default I had kept) showed
 up on the band.&nbsp; I confirmed that all the mutual funds were in the list on the phone.&nbsp; This is where my experience differed from Tony's.&nbsp; The list on the phone had not reverted to the default...however, nothing seems to make the funds show up on the band.&nbsp;
 These are fidelity funds, and can be found easily on any business website where you can check stock prices (FDCAX, FSLVX...)&nbsp; Since I had 1 additional spot for a stock/fund left, I added in the NASDAQ ticker at the bottom of the list.&nbsp; So I had DOW, MF1, MF2...MF5,
 NASDAQ.&nbsp; Went back to the band and only DOW and NASDAQ are showing.&nbsp; Removed NASDAQ and added AAPL to the end of the list.&nbsp; The band only displays DOW and AAPL now.&nbsp; So

            Nokia produced a Mac Suite years ago, Apple intervened and asked them to stop because they like to handle all synchronising with Apple products.<br />
<br />
Their proprietory attitude is why you are stuck with their inferior iSync software.

            i've copied your original post and broken it down into a few Q and A's:<br />
<br />
Q: Am I alone in thinking that Nokia should come up with some kind of software for Macs?<br />
A: nokia makes software for the mac. Nokia Multimedia Transfer. are all phones supported? no. thats a problem, but not the one you proclaim. what nokia needs to do is start including all of their phones in the software they DO write.<br />
<br />
Q: Surely they can make the equivalent of the PC suite for this OS.<br />
A: oh god i hope they don't bother. i got my fiance an N82 and we installed PC Suite on her windows box... wow - it sucks. i can't stand it. honestly, i'm far happier with the software i have on my mac - the combination of nokia and apple software works very
 well. want to install an app on your phone? great, you can do it without ANY ADDITIONAL software on your mac. that simple functionality requires a full PC Suite app on windows. honestly, i just don't understand people who like PC Suite.<br />
<br />
Q: There are more and more users of Macs and the Mac software Isync does not support all Nokia phones.<br />
A: iSync is just a frontend to a SyncML engine. iSync 'plugins' are just XML files (read: text files) that describe the capabilities of your phone as they relate to generic sync tasks, like whether or not the phone supports arbitrary descriptions of phone numbers
 (versus requiring 'Home', 'Office', 'Mobile', etc). iSync itself? it just doesn't care what your phone can and cannot support - it does whatever the 'plugin' tells it to. in short: iSync supports EVERY SINGLE PHONE THAT SUPPORTS SYNCML. yes. all of them. why
 does it seem not to support YOUR phone? you need the plugin to provide a description to iSync. many people have hacked at existing plugins for other phones to create a working plugin for their otherwise unsupported phone. you can do it too, it's not rocket
 science.<br />
<br />
Q: PC suite is much nicer. Nokia has to wake up very quickly or they will loose out to other products.<br />
A: eek! PC Suite sucks. thats my opinion, but yours seems to be that it's great. ok fine - so nokia made great software? congrats. what other product has great synchronization with the mac? the iphone. any others? no. at least not any better than the nokia's.
 you got a problem with a subset of nokia phones? fine, group ALL the phones that sync properly in a big pile. you'll see a few versions of ONE MODEL from apple (iphone) and about a dozen different models from nokia (n-series and e-series phones). looks to
 me that nokia provides a vast majority of the fully-mac-compatible phones that exist today. btw, ever try syncing a blackberry with a mac? via bluetooth? right, if you haven't then go google it and you'll realize that other phone manufacturer's typically suck,
 while nokia and apple have both provided support for open standards, making it possible to WriteYourOwnDamPlugin.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: A new mac user....<br />
A: yup. sorry to be a jerk about it, but your only other descent option is the iphone, and if you're willing to trade the openness of nokia for the closeness of the iphone then maybe thats what you ought to do. if it weren't for the crummy camera (yes, i really
 use the 5MP a LOT - 100% of my photos come from my phone) and the closed approach to development then i'd own an iphone right now. i had planned to. it was my first choice. on launch day i dug deeper into the literature before heading to the shop to plunk
 down my cash and, well, i was stopped in my tracks. i just couldn't imagine a phone so tremendously different in developer openness than the mac i was using to read about it. so, i looked elsewhere.<br />
<br />
i've got a nokia. i'm a mac user. i'm content with what i've got. the competition doesn't compel me to switch.<br />
<br />
am i alone in thinking nokia has done a stand up job of support us mac users?<br />

<br />
inferior? what's the windows component to do the same? pc suite? works only for nokia phones. what, a new app for every device i own? yeah, thats superior.<br />
<br />
iSync is simply a front end to an open standard. you don't need ANY INFO from apple to add support for your phone in iSync. you need info from nokia however. that they bother to support all (do they?) phones in PC Suite (a heavy development effort) but don't
 both to write a handful of XML files for iSync (one per device -or group of similar devices- pretty much could be automated from the device documentation) is the problem.<br />
<br />
why not supply more isync plugins? you'd have to ask them. it's easy enough that plenty of people have modified existing plugins to provide support for their otherwise unsupported phones (thats what i had to do when i had an SE W660i).<br />
<br />
inferior. hah. open and standards compliant - i'd say iSync is one of the few features in a mac that are decidedly superior to the rest of the industry. graphics, on the other hand, while widely speculated as better on a mac... sucks on a mac.<br />

            Il try to be concise!<br />
<br />
1 Nokia Mutimedia transfer indeed works well but does not work with my phone which is supposed to excel in multimedia. Thats a problem. Not for me but for the kids that buy this phone thinking that they are going to use it to hear music and look at photos.<br />
<br />
2 Agree. When I was a Windows user I had many problems with the PC Suite. However new users of Mac will expect Nokia to provide them with a user friendly Sync software and yes i would probably be able to find something to sync my phone with but unlike yourself
 many people do not like to fiddle with software, they just expect it to work. Thats Apples secret.<br />
<br />
3 I do not want to have to learn how to hack anything, its a hassle I can do without.<br />
<br />
4 Yes Apple is very closed with regards to Mac software and yes I also had problems with my PDA. I repeat what I said before. When people buy a phone they want everything to work without too much fuss. People are leaving windows because of the problems they
 had with Vista and so I would like to see Nokia provide a software that is easy and that works with Macs.<br />
<br />
5 Yep Agree, I dont want this new 3G Iphone, no mms, no video, 2Mp camera, battery life, etc etc. However eventually they will get it right and Nokia will have a problem. No mass market for Iphone?, Dont know about that, this phone is half the price of the
 previous one and the next generation will halve the price again and it will chip into Nokias most profitable phones.<br />
<br />
6 In an Ideal world there would be computers that run on multiple platforms of open source software however this will not happen. Apple is like Microsoft very Closed (or even worse) however they have an OS that works well and they also make hardware that looks
 good and that works without too many glitches (even if you cant upgrade most of it)<br />
<br />
I agree with most of what you say but I still think Nokia can do something about it.

            Just an update.<br />
<br />
I wrote the same thing on the Apple discussion boards and they say that its Nokias doing that I cant connect my Nokia 5610 to my Imac. Quote:"Apple has given the phone manufacturers a means to add support for new phones via iSync Plugins - it's not Apple's
 fault if they choose not to make them."<br />
<br />
I simply want to backup my contacts. Too much to ask for?<br />
<br />
Do not buy this phone if you have a Mac its not compatible.

            I think Nokia PC Suite has some advantages to iSync and multimedia transfer. There are two features I miss on my Mac, I'd like to do a full backup of my phone (if you use the sync options and delete the calendar entries you won't get back the identical
 entries since it isn't stored the same way for example) and I'd like to use software update. Nokia should provide a way to do this on a Mac.<br />
<br />
About the openess I think that iPhone is a lot more open now when the SDK is out there, and I believe that it will just be more and more open in time when the security issues are solved (like viruses). Just like Mac OS is a lot more open than Windows these
 days, which hasn't been true in the past.

            I'm also a N95 8GB user with a Mac. I still have to have a Windows PC around... some things just can't be done on the Mac. The iPhone aside, Nokia is already one of the better supported phone brands on the Mac. But I hope Nokia recognizes where they are
 falling short in terms of functionality required from Mac users and quickly work to add them soon.

            i've had my N95 8gb about 2 days and have had great, and poor results using on my mac.<br />
<br />
setting up isync and itunes to work was seemless. both work fine, and i'm so not interested in ever opening iPhoto.<br />
<br />
but, i find it quite annoying how i can't download applications to my mac and somehow install them on the phone. honestly, what am i supposed to do with an exe file?<br />
<br />
seriously, if anyone knows how to install a tiny game from miniclip into my phone i'd love to know how. connecting as mass memory to the desktop is just confusing and everything is stored in a not so friendly and confusing PC way. different C and D drives.
 i'm pretty lost.<br />
<br />
they could just work on developing a proper "mac suite" to give us full functionality.

            One simple way to install applications on N-series via Mac is via Bluetooth:<br />
<br />
- download application on Mac<br />
- make sure bluetooth is switchen on on the phone<br />
- Send File... from BT menu on Mac<br />
- select file to be sent<br />
- select phone (supposed Mac and phone are already paired)<br />
- accept (eventually) file on the phone<br />
- Go to Messaging on phone after file transfer<br />
<br />
Opening the BT message initiate application install procedure.<br />
<br />
That's it...

    <title>Changing account name or deleting skype without deleting microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> swizzles_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing account name or deleting skype without deleting microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am getting a bit frustrated trying to figure out how to solve this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I originally wanted to delete my skype account so that I could make a fresh one to link with my microsoft account.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in order to do that, I was forced to link it with my microsoft account.</p>
<p>Once I linked it, I had to delete my Microsoft account, <em>which I don't want to do. You also can't unlink your account once it is linked. Very frustrating.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping to either delete just my skype account, or change the login username of my skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Is there any way to do just either of those things?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it seems I am stuck with a login name from years ago that is bleh and can't be changed associated to my microsoft account which I can't get rid of without losing all of my microsoft account stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to find a way to contact someone at skype to see if I could at least get my login changed and I can't seem to do that either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

</p><p>I am sorry I did not see your post before you linked your legacy Skype account with the Microsoft account you use for other purposes.&nbsp; I would have recommended that you create a different, new Microsoft account with its own separate, unique e-mail address
 to use, to link to the legacy Skype account you wanted to close and/or stop using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, un-linking accounts is not possible.&nbsp; Please see this FAQ help article,
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa12060/can-i-unlink-my-skype-and-microsoft-accounts?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Can I unlink my Skype and Microsoft accounts?</a>,&nbsp; where you can provide feedback about this problem using the
<em>Share your experience!</em> button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, unfortunately, there never was a method to change a Skype account name once it was created.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What to do?</p>
<p>Create a new and separate Microsoft account, as well as create a new e-mail address as part of the new account creation routine, that you can reserve for use for Skype.&nbsp; You will, however, need
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12158/how-do-i-transfer-contacts-from-one-skype-account-to-another?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
to transfer the contacts</a> from your legacy Skype account (which is now merged with your current Microsoft account).&nbsp; You would have needed to transfer the contacts anyway, considering you wanted to close the old legacy Skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

            This really sucks to me. My Skype is really old and just now I intended to update it with a new account and Skype name but I can't. Can the public see the Skype name? (Not the Display Name.)&nbsp;

<p>I've a very simple inquiry, why OneNote app is not syncing with Exchange Server notes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exchange Notes has a very ugly and limited editor and interface, and OneNote is very powerful when it comes to text/drawing editor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, why not replacing exchange notes to be Synced with OneNote as a separate workbook?</p>

<h2>            excel 2016 cannot download the information you requested</h2>
                    <p>The fix prior to 2016 was either donotcacheencrypted or forcing it to open via the shell so it passes it straight out to the default browser.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However neither of these fixes work on the machine with the issue. I also don't have this issue on other machines so i'm wondering if its something that's been left over in the registry from the upgrade from an old version of office.</p>
<p>Anyone got any ideas?</p>

    <title>Excel 2010 calculation bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geoffreyeargle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2010 calculation bug</h2>
                    I have found a calculation bug in Excel 2010 (32-bit) v14.0.5128.5000 and v14.0.6023.1000, and likely others. To replicate the error, enter a number and increase the decimal places to around 20 places, for example: 7.11000000000000000000 in one cell and
 7.10000000000000000000 in another, and then enter a formula to subtract one from the other. The result I get is 0.01000000000000070000. Where does the 7 come from? I found this because a conditional format wasn't reporting the correct results, telling me that
 7.11-7.10 was &gt; 0.01. Has anyone else seen this error or know how to correct it? I'm running WIN7 Enterprise v6.1 (Build 7600) on a Dell Optiplex 760.

            <p>Computers work with binary representations of numbers, but humans work with decimal numbers. There are some decimal numbers that cannot be exactly represented in binary. It's the same kind of issue that prevents the fraction 1/3 from being exactly represented
 as a decimal number.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You haven't found a bug, what you have discovered is a result of the way Excel and most other applications do Floating-point arithmetic. When you entered those decimal numbers Excel converted them to Binary and often there is no precise binary representation
 of a decimal number and that's where the 7 came from.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>have a look at the link below</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/78113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/78113</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The link discusses rounding and in your case =ROUND(A1-A2,2) would eliminate the 7</p>

    <title>Single Sign on with Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amit chachra  say:</h3>
<h2>            Single Sign on with Office 365</h2>
                    We have two domains within the company, one public domain lets say ABC.com and one internal domain with Active Directory lets say ABCInternal.com. Our users log on to ABCInternal.com with AD credentials. We are trying to move to Office 365 and want to
 use Single Sign on functionality and want to make sure that users can use the ABCInternal.com credentials to get into Office 365.&nbsp;
<div>We only want to use SharePoint in Office 365 for now but in future may use Exchange and Lync.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>We have set up an ADFS farm internally and also set up ADFS proxy server in our DMZ in order to do Single Sign on.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now when we do the steps in Office 365, do we add ABC.com domain to Office 365 and then add the UPNs for ABC.com to the user accounts of ABCInternal.com to do the federation.</div>
<div>Are we missing any steps here.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am just not sure if this is the right configuration because all the guidance on the Microsoft sites assumes one domain for single sign on and we have two domains here, one public and one internal.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can someone point to any guidance for organizations who have both public and internal domain for Office 365 Single Sign on.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for your help.</div>

<h2>            what is it with microsoft 950&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I have stayed with my lumia 950 for about 4 months now,not a bad device but being true there are a lot of bugs on my device ,even after recovery/resetting several times from day one I don't know if I am the only one facing this, lets keep it real.NB.my
 phone is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.recording video at only 1080 fps after 7&nbsp; minutes,my device suspends the video recording by saying it needs to cool down due to over heating.?</p>
<p>2.same to images trying to take multiple pictures after reaching&nbsp; the 20th image,the overheat error boom...comes again?</p>
<p>3.The most irritating thing happens when someone calls you the&nbsp; screen goes blank,press power button what you can see is only the iris scanner lighting,also try to call someone the light sensor wont light up the screen&nbsp; stays black blank till hard restart.</p>
<p>4.Trying to open images it takes time to open also when done it only scale a small image at the center.</p>
<p>5.sometime massages wont display only the contact but no text.</p>
<p>6.The hunting restart thing,why should this phone just freeze on it's on and restart...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I am not here for criticisms but to to seek solutions,my old lumia 1020 with Qualcomm MSM8960 Snapdragon S4 Plus,never overheats on 1 plus recording, on my opinion with old processor it beats 950.if this issues would be fixed the phone would be superb.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Office 2013 opens pop up that continuously says not responding</h2>
                    I just purchased a new laptop that comes with Windows 8. I downloaded Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013 but every time I open up any of the documents (like Word, for example), a pop up will appear stating that it is not responding and Windows needs
 to close the program. It seems that every time I click onto anything Microsoft related, it will freeze and take a very long time to close or when trying to open Office, it closes down. What am I to do?

            <p>Im sorry, but i have this exact same issue too :/ and it is very frustrating. I have tried the link to get it fixed through chnaging the installation, and it didnt work. I also tried to un-install it, then re-install it and this didnt work either.</p>
<p>I originally purchased the download version + the DVD back up, and have tried to install both versions, and still have this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you please help, because the whole reason I upgraded my OS was to be able to use this new Office package</p>

            <p>I had an IT technitian fix this because your auto fix wouldnt do the job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you should have people&nbsp; willing to log in to peoples IP address to fix things, we pay enough for the software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a very complicated process, as the program kept trying to point to office 15, from when i had xp on the system, despite having upgraded to windows 7 since</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>your auto update wouldnt fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now im just having difficulty with explorer 9... i log into my email and can see the folders, but not the physical email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However i downloaded google chrome and it worked first time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i would rather use explorer, but i dont have much choice?</p>

    <title>Call History, Windows Phone 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dakota jay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Call History, Windows Phone 8</h2>
                    Hi, super basic question. On my Windows 8 phone, my "call history" shows every single call I've made, even though 90% are to my wife... :)&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can I tell it to collapse the calls so I only see one call per phone number? I'd like to be able to see, for example, someone I called 5 days ago, but not interested in scrolling through the last 50 calls to try and find their number.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And, on a more general level, where can I go to learn basic stuff like this without having to rummage around the Web? I probably spent 15 minutes looking for an answer to this question, and didn't find anything that would point me in the right direction.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

<h2>            What will I lose when I upgrade to 10&#63;</h2>
