<h2>            How to differentiate between calendars in the calendar view</h2>
                    I have to view at least 6 calendars at one time for my job and for scheduling meetings. How can I differentiate between the other calendars? It is very difficult to view more than one calendar at a time - are there different colors I can make each shared
 calendar? Please help as this is crucial to my job. <br />

<h2>            how to switch between japanese &#38; english input for MAC Word 2008</h2>
                    How do I temporarily turn on global ime (Japanese) in Word 2008 for MAC? I want to type kanji for letters to Japanese friends. Normally I use English. I want to temporarily have my keyboard interpreted as Kanji to type a letter and then return to English
 keyboard input. Grammar and spell check in Kanji would be nice too. I don't want to change everything on my MAC to Japanese. Thanks<br />

    <title>repeatedly asked to sign in to office 365 Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garyjhtr  say:</h3>
<h2>            repeatedly asked to sign in to office 365 Mac</h2>
                    <p>Why does office 365 for mac keep asking me to sign in to my account to verify I have a licensed version?<br />
As an educator who uses his mac to give lectures in a lecture venuse without internet facilities I have no option but to leave that venue, go to my office, connect to the internet, verify my license by signing in, then go back to the lecture venue to give my
 talk.<br />
This is also a problem if I have "reopen windows" selected when I shut down my mac. Not only do I get the sign in dialog box, but I get it for each office application that was open! So one for powerpoint, one for word and one for excel.<br />
Of course I am now committed to paying for this feature on a monthly basis (for which I get a monthly paper receipt by the way which is also wasteful).<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE Sep 2015</p>
<p>I have discovered that this behaviour will happen if you fail to wait for all office programs to quit fully on shutdown.</p>
<p>If one office program is left running when I shut down my computer I am asked to sign in. However, as suggested by the report below about reopening windows when restarting, if I take the time and trouble to quit each office program individually before shutting
 down, I no longer get the request to sign in again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps a little.</p>

            I was under the impression your only supposed to sign in once a month every 30 days and have been giving advice based on that assumption.<br />
<br />
The way I've been lead to believe it to be:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Every 30 days Office365 is supposed to receive a Phone home signal.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Supposedly your supposed to have a Grace period in which a connection can not be found it will try again over a period of two or three days.<br />
<br />
</li><li>If it don't make the connection Then you will be asked to sign and your supposed to be good for another 30 days.</li></ol>
Based on your information it sends out the signal every day and if it don't receive it you have to sign in.<br />
<br />
This is exactly the situation and others that I have been preaching about at every forum I can preach it. Not everyone has access&nbsp; to the Internet and 85% of The US Internet is lousy. Subject to frequent Drop out, no signal, Noise. Only system as Good as or
 better than Cable or Fiber Optic is needed to prevent signal from being lost or be noisy. Even Cable unless in metropolitan (the good 15%). Age not updated and often operating on wiring and equipment put back in the early 90's. DSL and POTS often are are operation
 on portion wiring and switching equipment put in just after WWII.&nbsp; Copper when subject to the elements even if is covered Corrodes and connections become loos and noisy as a result.
<br />
<br />
How far are you away from your office are your classes?<br />
Would you be allowed to set up&nbsp; Wireless Router?<br />
<br />
If the distance is not too far away, you might be able to setup a Wireless Router and Password protect it so only you can use it. Then turn on Airport (or 802.11) and sign into the network.<br />
Save the Password in KeyChain Access. Then every time you open your computer and start up Office 365 can send Phone Home signal so you don't have to sign in.<br />
<br />
Just in case try tips in this Link:<br />

            Thanks for the reply. At least I'm not the only one with this issue. Wireless is on its way to my lecture venue but it does not solve the underlying problem of why verification is required more often than expected.
<br />
Moreover if I shut down my mac with "reopen windows" for the restart option, I have to verify my subscription for each and every open office program.<br />

<p>Hello Harriet,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post. Given the situation, you need to close Outlook first, and open the Microsoft Database Utility. The location is in
<strong>/Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/Office/</strong>. Click the identity that you want, click
<strong>Action</strong> and choose <strong>Set as Default</strong>. Here is an article for reference:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-profiles-or-identities-in-Outlook-for-Mac-fed2a955-74df-4a24-bef6-78a426958c4c#ID0EAABAAA=Office_2011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then open Outlook 2011 for Mac, you will open it with the identity you want. In order to find out which identity is the correct one, you may need to switch some times.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I's relieved that there is a way to locate my current identity which I know still exists as I am receiving Microsoft emails on my iPhone. &nbsp;However, I don't know how to apply your adivce. &nbsp;When I use the Finder and clokc on Applications/Microsoft Office 20ll,
 I can see only the emails that go up to the year 2016; there is no list of other identities. &nbsp;I am desperate to locate my current calendar as I have not kept a paper version. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Dear Rick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was finally able to get to Microsoft Database and rebuilt all of the identities that were shown. &nbsp;Unfortunately, none of them go beyond sometime in 2015. &nbsp;I know that the later emails must exist somewhere as I am receiving emails on my iPhone and iPad
 and both of those contain all the emails between 2015 and now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else that you can &nbsp;suggest?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I especially would like to retrieve my calendar so that I don't miss any appointments. &nbsp;I plan to transfer my roadrunner email address to Apple Mail which is stable; the 2011 version of Microsoft Office for Mac has been highly unstable and caused me much
 trouble. &nbsp;I will also switch to Mac Calendar. &nbsp;But I really would like to retrieve my current calendar if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Harriet</p>

<p>Hello Harriet</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is not an Exchange account, the calendar items will not sync in the new identity. Based on the description, I think you are not using an Exchange account. Given the situation, you can try to export the calendar from the old identity
 and import them to the new identity. Here is an article for your reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/export-items-to-an-archive-file-in-outlook-for-mac-281a62bf-cc42-46b1-9ad5-6bda80ca3106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Export items to an archive file in Outlook for Mac</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, since October 10, 2017, Office for Mac 2011 will no longer receive any bug fixes and security updates. Therefore we might not able to provide any further official supports. It is highly recommended to upgrade to Outlook 2016
 for Mac for a better experience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<p>Rick, thanks for your efforts. &nbsp;Unfortunately, however, reaching and rebuilding my various identities did not recapture my calendar or any emails past 2016. &nbsp; It would appear that whatever identity held my more recent information and calendar were deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spoke to a Microsoft technician earlier this morning and he recommended using my time machine to recapture the relevant information. &nbsp;I may try that but my impression is that it is not possible to restrict my time machine to one application and I would
 be reluctant to delete and recapture everything else which is what I think would be involved. &nbsp;The technician also suggested that I purchase Microsoft Office for 2019 and update the software on my Apple computer as Office for 2011 is no longer serviced. &nbsp;While
 that might enable recapture of my data, that outcome is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have all my emails from 2016 to today on both my iPhone and my iPad as these messages are received by Apple Mail and so were not affected by the erasure of data from my Microsoft application on my desktop. &nbsp;The main loss is my calendar which I am unable
 to retrieve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you should have any other ideas, I would appreciate hearing from you. &nbsp;if not, thanks for trying to help which I appreciate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Harriet</p>

<p>Hello Harriet,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the description, I understand that it is not an Exchange account. Under this circumstance, if you cannot find back the missing calendar items by Time machine, then you may not be able to recover them now. Because they are stored
 on the local device, and if they are deleted from the local device, they are deleted permanently. It is sorry to hear that.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any other problems, please feel free to post a new thread in the forum. Our agents are pleased to help you.

<p><span>Hi, Rick</span></p>
<div><br />
<div>I appreciate how responsive you are.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have all my old emails on my iPhone and iPad. &nbsp;The loss of my current calendar will be inconvenient for the next few weeks, and I’ll have to reach out to my friends and other contacts to ask &nbsp;whether I have appointments with them and to verify
 the dates, which is time consuming and embarrassing but should mostly work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There are other items that appear lost: &nbsp;I routinely file emails re various subjects of interest. &nbsp;For example, I file emails re certain art exhibitions as I am a volunteer who does tours. &nbsp;These files were itemized on the left side of the email
 pages under the heading that stated they were filed on my Mac &nbsp;but I have no idea how to access them now as none of the identities currently shown list these files. &nbsp;Do you?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Harriet</div>

<p>Sorry to hear that. Like I said in the previous reply, you may not be able to recover the missing items based on your situation. It is suggested to:&nbsp;

<p>Dear Rick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I respect and appreciate your knowledge and repeated efforts to help me. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I can't say the same thing about Microsoft. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The company must have known that Microsoft 2011 Office for Mac was unstable - I've met other people that had problems with it, including a computer technician - and it should have provided a free upgrade to people who paid for a defective product. And when
 I called Microsoft for help a couple of years ago I had to pay some $125 because my warranty had expired. &nbsp;As a result, I am reluctant to spend any more money on Microsoft products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm going to do for now is to transfer my NY Roadrunner email account to Apple Mail as I do receive its messages on my iPhone and iPad. &nbsp;I will also start using Apple Calendar, which will have the advantage of having the phone and computer coordinated.
 &nbsp;After a few weeks, the loss of my Microsoft Office calendar will become irrelevant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a related question re this: &nbsp;I am still able to use Microsoft Word and Excel and have quite a number of documents in my files. &nbsp;Can those documents be transferred to Apple's equivalent software?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Harriet</p>

            check whether your phone date and time is properly set. Ideally this message should pop up only and only if the date is wrongly set.

            <p>Let's say the record source has a unique key named RecordID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create a text box in the form header or footer. Name it txtCurrentID.</p>
<p>Set the Visible property of this text box to No.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create a text box without a label in the Detail section of the form.</p>
<p>Set the following properties for this text box:</p>
<p>Back Style: Normal.</p>
<p>Back Color: same as the Back Color of the Detail section.</p>
<p>Border Style: Transparent.</p>
<p>Control Source: =IIf(Not IsNull([RecordID]), Null)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this text box selected, select Format | Conditional Formatting.</p>
<p>Select Expression Is.</p>
<p>Enter the expression [txtCurrentID]=[RecordID]</p>
<p>Specify the desired highlight color as fill (background) color.</p>
<p>Click OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Resize this text box to fill the entire detail section, then send it behind all other controls (Format &gt; Send to Back).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create an On Current event procedure for the form:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub Form_Current()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.txtCurrentID = Me.RecordID<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MeRecalc<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The effect is not perfect: depending on the speed of your PC, you may see some flickering as you move from record to record.</p>

<h2>            Is it safe to use both Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 and Windows Live Mail &#40; both email clients &#41; at the same time&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Is it safe to use both Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 and Windows Live Mail ( both email clients ) at the same time?</p>
<p>I was using MS Office Outlook 2007 earlier, and was able to set reminders in calendar, and used to receive pop-ups in my email. However, I have started using Windows Live Mail, recently, and found out that although you set reminders in the WL Calendar, we
 don't receive alerts / pop-ups, like we used to get in MS Office Outlook 2007.</p>
<p>So I thought of using both email clients i.e. MS Office Outlook 2007 and Windows Live Mail together, so that I will be able to get the pop-ups alerts through MS Outlook.</p>
<p>So I just wanted to check, whether there are any issues if I use both the e-mail clients together, at the "same time".</p>
<p>Kindly suggest.</p>

            Absolutely. I use both with no bother. However, you can only set ONE as the default email client.

    <title>How to reply to an e-mail from a forwarded address - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to reply to an e-mail from a forwarded address</h2>
                    <p>I want to know if I can reply to my e-mails that were forwarded from&nbsp;a second live.ca&nbsp;account, from that account, without logging into it?&nbsp; I have all my e-mail forwarded to&nbsp;my main&nbsp;live.ca account. I want to reply to the e-mails sent to my&nbsp;second live.ca
 account. They are all forwarded to my main live.ca account. Can I reply to them from my main account without sending my main account address. I used to switch between linked accounts easily but now I'm forced to log out and in each time. I do not even have
 the e-mail in the second account to reply from there. I think there might be an option to keep copies of forwarded e-mails but I'd rather not have to read them all twice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I could add the second account to my main one as an alias, that would work. I tried but a note said that you cannot add existing live.com accounts as an alias. I guess they applied that to live.ca as well.</p>

            You might have to edit this and move it to the right section. It ended up under the forum where unreleased Windows 10 is discussed. There should be a gaming section. I haven't seen this crashing problem with mine, but often mine loses its connection to
 Facebook or to update results online.

<h3> ivanarnold  say:</h3>
<h2>            Groove music downloads take forever&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; Many are stuck in &#34;Pending&#34;.</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a question about the Groove music app. I have been a longtime Spotify user (on Android)&nbsp;and recently started a free Groove trial as the Groove app seems to perform better on my new&nbsp;Windows phone. I am on Windows preview build 14295, but please note
 that the problem I am asking about today was present on 8.1 and has been the same on&nbsp;all stable, non-preview builds of Windows Phone 10. My phone is a BLU Win HD LTE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tend to download a lot of my playlists for offline use, as the audio quality seems better and I don't use cellular data while driving, etc. If I create a long playlist of, say 30 + songs, the downloads take FOREVER. As in days. Currently my phone is stuck
 trying to download the last twenty or so songs of&nbsp;a playlist I created that had about 100 songs in it. These songs have been attempting to download for over three days. This is something I do routinely on Spotify's Android app&nbsp;without any issues. &nbsp;I've specifically
 noticed the following behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Songs all say "Pending", but have 0% downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I can't cancel the downloads. Attempting to do so momentarily deletes the songs from the "Downloads"&nbsp;page, however they are automatically re-added within a few seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Some songs seem to download ok. However, even these download (over WiFi) much slower than I am used to on Spotify.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Often songs reach 100%, then just sit there for several minutes to an hour before they complete the download process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Downloads seem to progress at a much faster rate if I have the "Downloads" page on the app actually active and looking at it. In fact, it almost seems like songs ONLY download when I have the "Downloads" page active.&nbsp;If I navigate away from the "Downloads"
 page it seems like the active downloads all get paused? Then they seem to resume after I return to the "Downloads" page. This has led me to leave my phone sitting idle for hours, with the "Downloads" page on the Groove app pulled up while songs actually download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated. I actually like the Groove app quite a bit, but bugs like this sure make me miss Spotify / Android.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ivan</p>
<p>

<h2>            Sharepoint Calendar and Resource Calendars</h2>
                    <p>Hello - </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 4 resource calendars (rooms).</p>
<p>Each one is managed by booking delegates.</p>
<p>These resource calendars are visible in our Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>We are using Office 365 E4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to use SharePoint to at least simply view these resources overlaid.</p>
<p>Every staff person is intended to have a link to SharePoint, and their homepage will automatically show ALL Resource appointments.</p>
<p>We don't want to have to do anything but just one click to see the resource appointments</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would also be nice if resources could be requested by using the SharePoint calendar...</p>
<p>I tried the Calendar Overlay, but I cannot find the Exchange and outlook web links... or lists...
</p>
<p>I tried Group Calendar, but none of the appointments show up, and the calendar has to be reconfigured on every refresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a loss.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Can you help?</p>

            <p><span>Hi SirTyler1826,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’d like to explain that we can only connect a SharePoint Online calendar to Outlook. It’s not feasible to overlay a calendar from Outlook to SharePoint Online.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We understand it will be more convenient if users can also see those Exchange calendars in SharePoint Online. We suggest you submit feedbac via
<a href="https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SharePoint Uservoice </a>or directly vote in<a href="https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/forums/329220-sharepoint-dev-platform/suggestions/7078870-fully-integrated-overlay-calendar-from-exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> this similar thread</a>.
 This is the best way to influence our products and services.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your understanding.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Tim</span></p>

            You will have to buy 100 licenses / Product Keys.<br />
<br />
Your best price will be by way of a volume license. I do know there will be a discount from single license retail prices, and at 100 licenses it should be significant, but I have no idea of how much it could be.<br />
<br />
Here are a bunch of links to with probably more information than you really want, help get you up to speed so you can ask whoever you buy from intelligent questions:<br />

<b>Turn Up The Volume - </b><a href="https://rstlaw.wordpress.com/2010/11/04/may-i-see-your-license/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://rstlaw.wordpress.com/2010/11/04/may-i-see-your-license/</span></a><span><b>
</b></span>
<p><span>In most firms with more than a couple of computers the best solution is actually Microsoft’s Volume License program.&nbsp; Their Per Device licensing has the same advantages of the Retail license – the license CAN be reassigned
 to a different device later if you choose to replace your computer and you can install a copy on a portable device that is used by the same primary user as the desktop.</span></p>
<p><span>The pricing tends to be favorable on Volume Licensing compared to the retail boxes you get at Best Buy, though perhaps not as favorable as you might expect.</span></p>
<p><span>The other big advantage is in management of the licenses.&nbsp; With Retail Licenses every box comes with a product key – a series of numbers and letters that looks like this:</span></p>
<p><span>A1B2C-D3E4F-G5H6I-7J8K9-0L1M2 <br />
</span><span><em><span>(obviously that one’s fake)</span></em></span></p>
<p><span>The thing is you have to keep track of which product key goes to which machine.&nbsp; And when you install the software on multiple machines you have to enter the product key for each machine manually.&nbsp; OEM versions these tends
 tend to print the product key on a sticker, attached to the system.&nbsp; Makes sense, the license goes with the system so the key might as well too.</span></p>
<p><span>With volume licensing, however, you get ONE product key, which you’re allowed to install on as many devices as you bought licenses for (plus additional portables if applicable; see above).</span></p>
<p><span>“But I don’t have hundreds of machines!” you may say.&nbsp; You don’t have to.&nbsp; Volume licensing agreements start at just 5 (yes FIVE) licenses.&nbsp; And they don’t have to be 5 licenses of the same thing.&nbsp; If you only have 3 machines
 you can buy 3 licenses of Microsoft Office Professional 2010 and 2 licenses of something else…maybe Microsoft Streets and Trips or “Microsoft Math 3.0”.&nbsp; Something cheap.&nbsp; Ask your software dealer they can probably find you something.</span></p>
<p><span>Adding additional licenses later is easy – once you have the initial five licenses you have a Volume License Agreement and you can purchase additional licenses as needed.&nbsp; You add another member of staff?&nbsp; Buy one more
 license of Office 2010 for them.&nbsp; No problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Most firms with 3 or more computers should be using Volume Licensing in my opinion, if for no other reason than the simplicity of management.&nbsp; No need to track a bunch of product keys – just use one and your licenses are
 NOT handcuffed to the physical computer.</span></p>

<p>Most large organizations have Software Assurance (SA) as part of their licensing agreement and there are many benefits that are included that go unused every agreement period. We have found that many of the people who would use the benefits
 don’t know that their organization has them. Those who do know about Software Assurance associate the program with getting the next version of software at no additional cost, however there are other benefits that can save you money from your budget on training,
 support and services. If you know your organization has an Enterprise Agreement, then you also have Software Assurance. If you are not sure what kind of licensing agreement you have, check with the person who works on Microsoft licenses to see you if you have
 Software Assurance. Some of the most popular benefits are technical training days, home use licenses, online training for users, and 24x7 support. In this post, I will highlight some of the benefits, talk about eligibility, and let you know who to contact
 to find more information or to start using the benefits. </p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<b>What is Software Assurance?</b>
<p>Regardless of where you are in your software lifecycle, Software Assurance provides benefits to help you upgrade to new software, get more productivity out of existing software, and support your current environment. When you are ready
 to upgrade to a new version of software, SA provides new version rights at no additional cost, deployment planning services and end-user readiness benefits such as online training and home use licenses. To keep your IT department up to date and to help your
 end-users be more productive on existing software, SA provides classroom, technical training and online training for end-users. And to help you maintain your environment, SA also includes a 24x7 support benefit.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<b>Software Assurance Benefits:</b>
<p>There are over a dozen SA benefits and the amount of benefits your organization has depends on the licensing agreement. The list below highlights the most popular benefits associated with Office.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/licensing/software-assurance/new-version-rights.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>New software versions</b></a> when they are released within the time of your agreement.</p>

<p>What now?</p>
<p>In order to find out what benefits your organization has and to start using them, you will need to contact your SA benefits manager. Your organization’s SA benefits manager is likely in the IT department and will have access to the online
 Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC) where the exact benefits your organization has can be looked up. If you know who manages your Microsoft licenses, then that person can likely look up your SA benefits manager. The benefits manager activates the benefits
 in order to make them available for you to use.</p>
<p>Hopefully this gives you an introduction to Software Assurance benefits and the resources you need to learn more about what they are and how to use them.</p>

<p><strong><i><span>Both options to activate Office 2010, KMS and MAK, have their up- and downsides. This article discusses a few things you have to consider when you decide for the activation method
 in your organization.</span></i></strong></p>
<p>Now that you have an overview of the <a href="http://4sysops.com/archives/office-2010-kms-activation-essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 2010 KMS activation</a> and <a href="http://4sysops.com/archives/office-2010-mak-activation-essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MAK activation</a>, I can address the question of whether KMS or MAK is the better option to activate Office 2010. Most of the arguments also apply for Windows Vista and Windows 7 activation.</p>
<p><b><u>Microsoft recommendations</u></b></p>
<p>You need at least 5 Office 2010 installations if you want to activate Office 2010 with KMS; however, Microsoft recommends using MAK activation if your network has fewer than 25 computers. If you have more than 50 Office 2010 machines,
 Microsoft recommends going for KMS.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

</b>
<p>KMS involves running an internal company license server. Client computers will renew their license against the server. Each renewal will reset the expiry to 180 days, and it will try renewing every 7 days. Office will try contacting the
 server more frequently if expired or close to expiring. KMS is the preferred method of volume activation for businesses and incidentally KMS based solutions are the main source of activation “solutions”.</p>

<p>MAK activate similar to a retail key. It is a one-time activation over the internet against Microsoft’s server. Unlike a normal retail key, each key can be used for a minimum of 500 activations to thousands of activations. Like a retail
 key you will have to reactivate if there’s a drastic hardware change or if you change your installation to a new computer.</p>

<p><strong><span>Key Management Service (KMS)</span></strong>. KMS uses a host computer to establish an activation service on your local company network. With a KMS host you can activate thousands
 of computers at the same time when they regularly connect to the company network. If you use a KMS host to activate Windows, you can use the same host to activate Office 2010.</p>
<p><strong><span>Multiple Activation Key (MAK)</span></strong>. With MAK, each computer activates Office 2010 with the Microsoft hosted activation servers over the Internet or by phone. MAK is recommended
 when you have fewer than 50 computers to activate, and for computers that are not regularly connected to the company network.</p>

    <title>MSN money portfolio asking to verify Silverlight after installing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MSN money portfolio  asking to verify Silverlight after installing Internet Explorer 11</h2>
                    <p>* Original Title: Installed IE11 on win7 machine</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installed OK but when I opened IE11 and tried to open MSN money portfolio it asked me to verify Silverlight which I believe is installed OK.
</p>
<div>I couldn't get to the portfolio so simply uninstalled IE11 and the MSN portfolio works fine.</div>
<div>Why does MSFT products not work simply with each other? &nbsp;Why do I have to do handstands to make a recommended update work.</div>
<div>IE11, Silverlight and MSN portfolio are all MSFT products and should work smoothly together.</div>
<div>can't imagine that happening on a &nbsp;Mac computer. &nbsp;Too bad MS won't enable other browsers to work with MSN money portfolio so I would have no need for IE at all.</div>

<p><span><font><font color="#000000">If you want to give it a try, I would suggest you to enable Silverlight add-on in Internet Explorer and check if it helps

            I reinstalled IE11 and got it to work. Thanks.
<div>But why is it so complicated? And why wasn't it automatic?</div>
<div>And why weren't the instructions set out?</div>
<div>An update should make all the changes particularly if all parts are MS, as IE11, MSN money portfolio and Silverlight.</div>
<div>This is my last MS machine. &nbsp;My wife has a Mac and it just works. &nbsp;Did a major Mavericks OS FREE update. No hiccups.</div>

<h2>            Excel files opening in read only mode from Onenote 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have come to the conclusion that Microsoft Onenote2016 is now of no use to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Onenote on my Surface Pro3 running Win 8.1. This runs perfectly. I can drop a spreadsheet onto a Onenote page. Open it, Edit it and just click save in Excel. Job Done. This is what I call collaboration&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now with the new Surface Laptop and the dreaded Windows 10 OS. Nothing works as before. Onenote is now a worthless piece of software for collaboration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heres the Issue.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I save an excel file to my onedrive folder.</p>
<p>2. Through the Onenote insert function I try to insert an excel file to Onenote</p>
<p>3. I open the file from the Onenote page, and it opens as "read Only</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e6fbca8-9195-4b4e-b0b0-b55132fd38ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e6fbca8-9195-4b4e-b0b0-b55132fd38ca" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does this not work as it did in earlier versions of Onenote on Win 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please press the excel book &gt; Open &gt;File &gt; Info &gt; Related Documents &gt; Open File Location &gt; right click the workbook &gt; properties &gt; General &gt; check if it is set to Read-only &gt; Security &gt; check if your user profile has the full control permission.</p>
<p>If the steps above don’t help, to narrow down the issue you have, please provide the information below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the issue happen when you insert excel file as “attach file” or “insert spreadsheet”?
</li><li>Does the issue happen to all inserted excel workbooks (even a new created one) or only a specific one?</li><li>If you create a new workbook on the desktop, insert it to OneNote page, does the issue happen?</li><li>Your Windows OS version. For example: 1709</li><li>Your Office version. &nbsp;You can go to File&gt;Account&gt;Product Information to check it. For example: 1708(8431.2031)</li></ol>

<p>Hi Azaam,</p>
<p>In Office 365 for Business Online services, Azure Rights Management (RMS) feature is included in specific plans, such as Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3 or E4, Office 365 Government E1, E3 or E4 and Office 365 operated by 21Vianet Enterprise E1, E3 or E4.</p>
<p>If we’re using other plans, such as Office 365 Business Essentials, Office 365 Business Premium, Office 365 Education, .etc, we need to purchase Azure Rights Management (RMS) as a separate add-on (or added for free to the Office 365 Education plan) in order
 to enable the supported IRM features.</p>
<p>To configure Azure Rights Management (RMS) for specific mailboxes, we need to perform the following steps:</p>
<p>Step 1: Use the Office 365 Admin Center to activate Azure Rights Management.<br />
Step 2: Use the Shell to configure the RMS Online key sharing location in Exchange Online.<br />
Step 3: Use the Shell to import the Trusted Publishing Domain (TPD) from RMS Online.<br />
Step 4: Use the Shell to enable IRM in Exchange Online.</p>
<p>Here is an article for your reference: <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn151475(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Configure IRM to use Azure Rights Management</a>.</p>
<p>If you encounter any errors when performing the steps above, feel free to post back. We will further assist you.</p>
<p>Meantime, if you encounter any issues using Azure Rights Management (RMS) for Office 365 in the future, you can also post a new thread in our
<strong>Manage Office 365</strong> channel and our engineers will assist you in time.</p>

<p>Sorry the late reply.</p>
<p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>1. Aisa.</p>
<p>2. No.</p>
<p>3. No, enabling IRM for internal messages is a prerequisite for all other IRM features in Exchange Online.</p>

    <title>ISO for Release Preview Version - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harry muscle  say:</h3>
<h2>            ISO for Release Preview Version</h2>
                    <p>Will there be an ISO made available for the Release Preview version of Windows 1903?&nbsp; Or will this only come out at the end of May when this version is officially released?&nbsp; I know I can create my own from UUP files but I'm hoping to use an official version
 for my production machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If an ISO will come out before the end of May, is there any details on roughly when?&nbsp; If no ISO is expected early then how do OEMs install this version which apparently they are based on what the Insider blog said?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>My exeriences are it comes out with the official public release so users can do manual updates if they wish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OEM will have .esd available when they finalize whats out now so they wont need large culmalatives or some sudden utoh fix.&nbsp; You can watch some sites for your esd.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am using my home-made iso to clean-install build 18362. Before installation, I integrated the .30 patch and the drivers into the USB installation media. I have been doing this for Windows 10 installations for years. No ill effects till this date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you may do the same or wait for the official ISO.</p>

<p>Often an Insider Preview ISO is made available, prior to the Media Creation Tool getting the new Windows 10 Version. The results of using either one should be the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I did see a Tweet indicating that the Media Creation Tool will be the next available ISO for the May 2019 Feature Update (Build 18362.30).</p>

<p>Hello Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I found interesting was on my strange install on Surface Pro using 18362.1 ISO image, this was after being told my device was not eligible for upgrade, (would not proceed retaining files and documents) I had to go back couple of screens and pick not
 retain and then it proceeded. End result was I was at Build 18362.30 when install finished. It must have integrated the CU in the install process as usually I only install offline, this time I didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's why I reported this issue, not being able to retain files, apps and settings on an upgrade with a MS device yet. Only thing I had on this Surface was Office 365 with over 100GB free space. First time coming across this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per topic, usually the official esd files come out few days prior to the official ISO images which normally come out once a build is released to the public. There was always a small edited file you could use to create the official ISO with the previous
 Media Creation Tool.</p>

<p>Is there any chance that your Surface Pro had some blocking software that had the potential to crash the computer (similar to what would happen if an upgrade were allowed on a PC with BattlEye)?&nbsp; This would mean that selecting not retaining files should
 work, since that also eliminates the blocking software.<br />
<br />
I wonder if selecting not keeping files would also work for a PC containing BattlEye?</p>
<p>_________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>They have integrated some CUs into the "Official RTM" ISO in the past. I think .30 will be integrated, even if subsequent CUs come on Day 1 of public release. This is similar to the recent integration of CUs currently available for the official Windows 10
 Version 1809 ISO, which I believe you brought to our attention (17763.379).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you check the build names at UUP dump (which they get from Windows Update servers) everything after .30 is named as a CU only. That does not mean that you could not create an integrated .53 ISO, but to me suggests that Microsoft likely has no intention
 to do so.&nbsp; They have to call it at some point. Also, you can see that builds up to .30 are named Insider Preview and then .30 also has one without the Insider Preview name, called&nbsp;<strong>Feature update to Windows 10, version 1903 (18362.30) amd64</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am speculating that the first one named "Feature update" after the last one named "Insider Preview" is most likely to become the RTM ISO build number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From UUP dump website:</p>

<p>I don't believe that there would be any blocking software on the Surface Pro. I did a total clean install of 17763 on this device when that build came out, installed Office 365 as they opened up the subscription for many devices now, and it just basically
 sat collecting dust. Once a month I would fire it up just to install any CU and that was about it. Never really found a use for this thing, too heavy for a tablet, screen too small for my ole eyes, lol.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I am totally aware of all the images on the dump as I have them all, I tend to dl Feature Update ISO's so I do have them, including 18362.30 and 18362.53
as well as 17763.437</span>. You sometimes have the choice of CU or Feature for same build. Only difference I have seen is different file dates on some of the UUP files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rarely do any installs online, just felt lazy so I used ISO image of 18362.1 just because it was still on a flash card and I did have the latest CU on same card so went ahead with upgrading while watching a movie.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wasn't expecting the device not eligible error at all, tried couple times, then hit the back button and thought, nothing really on this device so changed the setting to not keep files, settings etc. and it went through. This is strange behavior in itself
 on same install. There were no other programs on this device except Office with over 100GB free space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to your question&nbsp;<span>I wonder if selecting not keeping files would also work for a PC containing BattlEye? It should as you are really doing a partial total clean install, just no option to delete partitions. Same as running Setup.exe from
 the Sources folder in the image instead of the root.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally I would have used a bootable flash card to do a total clean install wiping partitions offline but have not made one for 18362 yet. (I keep 4 8GB flash cards on hand for several Releases so I can cover for the last couple years). I only use official
 ISO's for this purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My assumption was doing an online upgrade, I let windows check for updates on the first install screen (which MS has cleverly hidden with a link for choice in this cycle), it must have grabbed a CU and integrated it as after installing it was on 18362.30.
 Why not 18362.53 as I used the 18362.1 image. I applied CU&nbsp;KB4495666 to bring it up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the length, not much to do today. Cheers Don.</p>

<p>My question is if there is a possibility on my N85 to set an automatic message for all callings comming in (when i am at a meeting for example)
<u>without</u> leading the call to the message/mail box. Just an automatic response asking to call later ?. At the same time, having a list of all income calls during the lapsed time.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

            In "Call" settings, there's a "reject call with message" option. I think if you set that, and find an option to let you reject the call completely (not just to voicemail) then you'll be set. The standard call log would log rejected calls, I think.

<p><span>Hi Wieland,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Managing your folders in <strong>Outlook.com</strong> makes your email messages more optimized. You can create custom folders and apply the option called “<strong><span>Rules</span></strong>”. This allows the users to manage incoming emails and receive
 it directly in the specific folder. This practice is best applied especially if you receive bulk emails daily.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You need to successfully create a rule to set conditions for your incoming emails. Rules have three (3) options available and these are:

<p><span>Hi Wieland,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Managing your folders in <strong>Outlook.com</strong> makes your email messages more optimized. You can create custom folders and apply the option called “<strong><span>Rules</span></strong>”. This allows the users to manage incoming emails and receive
 it directly in the specific folder. This practice is best applied especially if you receive bulk emails daily.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You need to successfully create a rule to set conditions for your incoming emails. Rules have three (3) options available and these are:

<p><span>Maybe I did not express myself clearly: I want to create a rule allowing to automatically send a message to a folder containing messages received from one sender ("From:"). Messages to which this sender is copied
 ("cc." or "bcc") I DO NOT want go to this folder.</span></p>

<span>You write "Advanced options like excluding&nbsp;</span><span>CC&nbsp;</span><span>and&nbsp;</span><span>BCC</span><span>&nbsp;recipient rules is not available
 on this app" -- Can't this problem be solved? I cannot be the only Outlook user who is exchanging many mails with people who in turn are copying some of the same people I am copying on my mails. As a result it becomes quite unpredictable in which mailbox these
 mails end up.</span>

<p>Do you have an <strong>Outlook </strong>desktop version? Using <strong>Outlook.com</strong> is like using a basic mail app. Due to its a web app, it's limited to give way to browse this email website faster.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Outlook 2016 </strong>has more features and customization due to its a big program that can be installed on your computer.</p>
