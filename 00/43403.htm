<h2>            Why parental controls &#40;curfew&#41; are not working in Windows 7</h2>
                    I set up in parental controls the time when my son could not log into the computer (curfews) &nbsp;are not working at all. My son can log in any time and this undermines the credibility of controls.
<div>How to fix that?</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft community forums and thank you for posting the question. As per the description, Parental controls are not working in Windows 7.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Are you referring the Parental control within Operating System or Windows Live Parental Control?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Was it working before? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Have you made any changes to the parental controls recently? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provide more information regarding the issue so that we could help you further.
</p>
        </p>

            <div>Hi Winston M,</div>
<div><br />
1. I am referring to Windows Live parental controls. I am not aware of the controls in the operating system.
<div><br />
<div>2. It was the first time I set them up. Before I could set them up I had a problem &nbsp;and had to uninstall and re-install Windows Life&nbsp;Family&nbsp;safety or something like this. The problem was &nbsp;that I couldn't set up parental controls at all for any account,
 there was a &nbsp;message "contact your administrator" and the window that was appearing only for a second. This problem was fixed with re-installation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. It was one big change - I set all types of controls for three different standard users. The web filtering, activity reports and blocking of selected websites work as defined for each respective user. The time limit doesn't work for any user.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't know whether it is relevant, but I add some more information:</div>
<div>-There are three standard user accounts with different controls. One user is without time limit and has only web filtering and some specific online games sites blocked. It is meant for homework. The other account where time limits don't work is meant to
 give access to those online games, but only for one hour.</div>
<div>- there is a password to log-in into the account for which I set up the time limit. Is that the problem? For the moment it is the only control I have over the usage time.&nbsp;</div>
<div>-I don't think it is the time zone as I basically allowed only one hour &nbsp;par day - 4 to 5 pm UK time for this particular user account and therefore it should be blocked in other time zones too. &nbsp;It basically works without time limit.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please help me to resolve this. Thanks,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Toto&nbsp;</div>

            I am having the same issue. I allows two hours a day from the Live parental support but yet I can log on with that user when it is supposed to be locked. Do I need to reboot or something?

<h2>            Event Id 4672 Security Concern</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ever Since my computers were violated I have been paranoid about someone malicious gaining access&nbsp; to my personal life. Since that time I took a break from using computers to help my possible concerns. Recently, certain events have re-kindled my feeling
 of concern and I am now very concerned and have stopped using my computer again. Apart from the many odd event logs such as 4672 special log ins etc. There is someone blatantly using my browser while I am on it. Unbelievably, this person was going through
 personal data that I could not have initiated. I have been feverishly pursuing all resources to protect myself using proper security measures in every aspect that I can imagine.&nbsp; I am totally unable to determine exactly the state of my systems security and
 would like to know the course of action to determine if in fact my system as well as my personal data is being compromised.</p>
<p>Thank you in Advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Since you are by your own words paranoid you should do this:<br />
<ol>
<li>Back up your data. </li><li>Back up your EMail files. </li><li>Install a router for your Internet connection. </li><li>Reload Windows on a freshly formatted disk. </li><li>Activate the firewall. </li><li>Install a good virus scanner and keep it updated. </li><li>Reload your apps. </li><li>Restore your data &amp; EMail files. </li><li>Practise safe hex. </li><li>Keep an eye on who uses your PC. </li></ol>
If you do all of the above then you're safe.

    <title>Windows 10 PC with Family Safety Enabled Won&#39;t Block Youtube - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maethlin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 PC with Family Safety Enabled Won&#39;t Block Youtube</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded a machine from Win7 to Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up creating a new Family Safety kids account on Win10 complete with email address login for my kid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything seemed to work okay, but for some reason, Youtube is not being blocked now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I log into the family safety dashboard, it shows that the last time youtube was visited/blocked, was about about 5 days ago. &nbsp;Now even though my kid is actively watching youtube (using chrome browser), it doesn't even show on the summary page though
 other activity for today is visible (like visits to google.com).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use the new Edge browser, youtube is blocked, but chrome and firefox can get through fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think on Windows 8 chrome/firefox actually get blocked - was this feature disabled in Windows 10?</p>

<p>Still broken - and still no useful response from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, now I'm getting inconsistent screen time monitoring with Win10 AND Win8.1 - I have one kid on each platform. &nbsp;Sometimes one will be able to play for hours past their normal aloted time. Sometimes the computer will actually restrict them to their 2.5
 hour playtime that I set on the Family Safety site.</p>

 my kid can do as he like instead of doing homework, the blocking function really helped him to study and to prevent destracting himself.</p>

            <p>Not acceptable. &nbsp;Students use google chrome all the time in school with google classroom, etc. &nbsp;I understand that Family Safety can't always be perfect about controlling things through outside browsers because the other browsers make upgrades without giving
 them warnings, but an occasional slip through is better than having our kids know that all they have to do is switch to Chrome or Firefox to do whatever they want. &nbsp;Now it's utterly useless because I can't just tell my teenagers they can't use Chrome when
 I know their teachers post things on it. &nbsp;If it could at least monitor other browsers, that would be something. &nbsp;And there's no way to block chrome without blocking all kinds of other things even if I wanted to. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>I tried using these settings as well with poor results. &nbsp;Individual websites are not blocked in Chrome and blocking chrome isn't an option since they need it to do their homework since the school is using Google docs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I actually tried blocking chrome, &nbsp;but it only blocked it for one kid and not the other. Guess I'm back to blocking websites at my router. Which stinks because my wife can use the family settings, &nbsp;but setting up rules in the router goes over her head</p>

</p><p>The two finger gesture on my touch pad for my Inspiron 15 5000 series model 5567 is not working. Many of the solutions online state to go to the device manager and go to touchpad, but it doesn't show up. What do I do?</p>

            Hi  lilfofo01
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />There are some important updates for this model I recommend you apply to see if they resolve this issue. 
<br />
<br />BIOS Update May 2019
<br /><a href="https://downloads.dell.com/FOLDER05416717M/1/Inspiron_5567_5767_127.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloads.dell.com/FOLDER05416717M/1/In...</a>
<br />
<br />Chipset Driver Update December 2018
<br /><a href="https://downloads.dell.com/FOLDER04001557M/8/Intel-Chipset-Device-Software_HMDR4_WIN_10.1.1.38_A05_06.EXE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloads.dell.com/FOLDER04001557M/8/In...</a>
<br />
<br />If these updates don't resolve the problem...
<br />
<br />If your touchpad is not working, here are some things you can try:
<br />
<br />1. Connect an external USB mouse then run the Hardware Troubleshooter:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down
<br />Click Hardware and Devices
<br />Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />2. Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Human interface devices 
<br />Right click HID-compliant touch pad
<br />
<br />(If you don't see your touch pad listed, look under 'Mice and other pointing devices')
<br />
<br />Click uninstall
<br />
<br />Exit then restart.
<br />
<br />If you don't have an external/wired mouse...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Press the 'M' key
<br />Press tab once
<br />Use the down arround to select Human interface device or Mice and other pointing devices.
<br />Press the right arrow to expand Mice and other pointing devices.
<br />Use the down arrow again to select your HID-Compliant mouse or touch pad
<br />Press the right click menu key on your keyboard (usually located between the Alt and Control keys)
<br />Select uninstall
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Press Alt + F4
<br />Press the Windows key + X
<br />Press the letter U
<br />Press the letter R
<br />
<br />Restart
<br />
<br />Other things you can try.
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />
<br />How do you do that?
<br />
<br />Power on, when you see the Windows Logo - power off

<br />If you are not on latest feature update, make sure you are:
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now

<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />That’s it, the Windows 10 Feature Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />How to prepare your computer before upgrading?
<br />
<br />Although updating to Windows 10 version 1903 is a relatively simple process, similar to a repair upgrade; users should perform some basic pre-requisites before initiating the upgrade.
<br />
<br />If you are finding it difficult to carry out some of the steps described below, please review detailed instructions how to perform them:

            You probably don't have any download accelerators. Download accelerators are third-party programs (which means not part of Windows) that were particularly popular during the days of dialup. The website probably says something more like "if you have any
 download accelerators, disable them" and not that you specifically have one. Websites will do this because download accelerators work by making multiple connections to a website to all download bits of a file. The program would then put all the bits together
 for you.<br />
<br />
So unless you are connecting to the Internet with dialup and unless you installed a download accelerator program yourself, you don't have one and can safely ignore the warning.

<p><span><span>Do you have 2 monitors or are you saying that 1 display is showing 2 screens?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are saying that you have 2 monitors, and then go to your desktop and right-click in an
 open area.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Select “personalize” then “display settings”.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Click the dropdown and change to 2.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There will be 2 boxes below that. Uncheck the one that says “Extend the desktop onto this monitor”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>But if you want to get your display back, I think you should check the cable in the back of
 the monitor to see if that is plugged in to the monitor and then the back of the computer.

    <title>Assigned .lnk Shortcut Keys are not honored upon reboot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dkqwerty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Assigned .lnk Shortcut Keys are not honored upon reboot</h2>
                    <p>I like assigning keyboard shortcuts to frequent tasks/functions (don't we all?). However, I noticed a distressing issue in which shortcut keys assigned to .lnk files are ignored upon reboot and must be reassigned to function again. For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I tried making a .lnk to "C:\Windows\System32\scrnsave.scr" and assigning the shortcut "Ctrl + Shift + Alt + D" to quickly blank the screen. This shortcut key combo worked brilliantly until the system was reset, upon which the shortcut combo no longer
 functioned unless I reassigned it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had also tried many months (years?) ago to assign "Ctrl + Shift + ` " to Process Explorer (a legacy alternative to task manager), but again, the shortcut never stuck past reboot and I eventually gave up on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only shortcut key combo that has ever stuck was assigning "Ctrl + Shift + Alt + X" to the Snipping tool. The only difference in the above example is that the .lnk file is resident on the OS's partition (within the "All Users" Start Menu to be precise),
 while the other two .lnks reside on non-OS partitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas why one specific example continues to work while the others fail to survive a reboot?</p>

<p>Sounds like you are confusing Alt-4 for Alt-F4 but somehow getting what Win-P does when you use it.</p>

            <p>As Robert stated I think you meant &lt;alt&gt;+F4.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Some laptops will set the Function keys to trigger media or alternate&nbsp;functions&nbsp;by&nbsp;default. These are&nbsp;normally triggered by pressing &lt;Fn&gt;+F1-F12. The alternate functions are usually marked on the F&nbsp;keys using icons.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If this happens to be the case your F4 key is also the Project&nbsp;key - used when you are running more than one monitor.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Check your user manual to see if you can change the default settings of your Function keys.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

Thanks for the article. It shows that ALT-F4 closes the active item or exits the active app. That is how mine functioned last week, but now I just get the Project screen.<br />

Maybe doing a system restore to a time when the <br />
shortcut worked would be a way to fix it.<br />

                    <p>I have two accounts, one that I use as a family account that the whole household can use on the pc and a new one that is solely for my use on my mobile phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I have been able to connect from one account to the other, I am unable to connect to anyone else from the mobile phone. I recently added a friend and sent a message and weeks later it still shows that they haven't accepted my invitation and on checking
 with them, they haven't had the invitation. We have now tried to do it the other way and said friend send the invitation to me and despite being sat 2ft apart, there was no invitation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can see all permissions have been granted, I just can't figure out why I can't get Skype to work on my phone, which is a Huawei P20 if that makes a difference.</p>

<h2>            Updating WIndows 7 Home Premium</h2>
                    I have a Dell laptop with Windows 7 Home Premium that I only use when traveling.&nbsp; The last update on the laptop was 5/15/16.&nbsp; When I open Windows Update, I'm told that Windows is up-to-date (even though it says the last installed update was in May 2016).&nbsp;
 When I check for updates, it checks and it checks and nothing happens.&nbsp; Dell says that this is a problem with Windows 7&nbsp;that Microsoft is aware of&nbsp;and is working on a solution.&nbsp; Is that true?&nbsp; If so, any estimated time for a fix?&nbsp; If not, how to I respond/talk
 to Dell?&nbsp; I have two PCs with Windows 7 Professional and both have automatically updated in June, July and August.

    <title>Windows Updates keep ruining my laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Updates keep ruining my laptop</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to write a complaint email, but because that doesn't seem to be possible, I'll simply write it here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For as long as I've had pc's/laptops, I've always used windows and been pleased with that. However, your windows 10 is ruining my laptop;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, at some point windows started a mandatory update. Sure, no problem. However, after that, my entire computer crashed and I had to remove windows from my laptop, reinstall it my laptop, delete it again and reinstall it again to be able to access my
 desktop, personal files etc. I've never had an update cause such a mayor fail in functionality. Most personal files were kept, but I lost a lot of installed programs, which obviously sucks.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Secondly, ever since this &amp;^#%(&amp;! update, windows has been unable to recognize my cd-drive. I have tried every piece of advice on the Microsoft support page. Edited register entries, deleted the driver, tried some stuff in command prompt and still no result.
 Sometimes after start up my laptop 'forgets' that it cant read the drive anymore and it shows up on mypc, but after about one minute it disappears again. Seriously, wtf. I must've spent over two days trying to fix this.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now there is another new update and guess what: my charger is connected, but my battery is no longer charging.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I don't mean to offend, but your company is doing a horrible job. Updates are supposed to make things better and so far they've crashed my laptop, deleted the presence of a cd drive from its memory and now my battery can't charge. I've spent hours online trying
 to fix the mess your program is causing and I'm done.<br />
To be honest I am very angry and I want a solution for the problems your updates keep giving me. I honestly hate apple products, but windows 10 is seriously making me consider transferring to apple, since I can't trust my 1100 euro laptop to function properly
 due to rubbish software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance. <br />
<br />
Kind regards, </p>
<p>Maxx&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi trekds9,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Answers community.</p>
<p>a. What's the name of the folder?<br />
b. What type of files are there in that folder?<br />
c. Where is it located in your computer?</p>
<p>Try deleting the files in safe mode.</p>
<p>To use a Safe mode option, follow these steps:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears.
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the arrow keys to choose Safe Mode in Windows Advanced Options menu appears, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>You can also use Disk Cleanup to clean up all the files on your computer.</p>
<p>1. Open Disk Cleanup by clicking the Start button. In the search box, type Disk Cleanup, and then, in the list of results, click Disk Cleanup.
<br />
2. In the Drives list, click the hard disk drive that you want to clean up, and then click OK.<br />
3. In the Disk Cleanup dialog box, on the Disk Cleanup tab, select the check boxes for the file types that you want to delete, and then click OK.<br />
4. In the message that appears, click Delete files.<br />
<br />
Hope this information is helpful.<br />
Let me know if this worked.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks and Regards:<br />

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Windows Updates will not cause catastrophic hdd failure. Further, I would like to let you know that Hard drives are mechanical devices with moving parts, so they are subject to expected wear and tear. It can potentially fail mechanically at any given
 time. However, most manufacturers will label their product with an expected average lifespan (usually provided in total expected number of functioning hours). But if a part is faulty or there are some manufacturing defects, a drive's lifespan can be over in
 as little as a day. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Other factors are primarily external in nature. Power surges can cause drive failure, as can fire or water damage, along with a number of computer viruses. Exposure to high levels of magnetism can disrupt the normal functions of a drive, along with
 sharp impacts. If dust gets into a drive, it can become the catalyst for an eventual failure.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

    <title>What is that flashing icon within taskbar&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            What is that flashing icon within taskbar&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, lately I've noticed that there is an icon, or something, that flashes inside of the taskbar.&nbsp; It flashes so fast I can't see what it is and also the address bar seems to flash at the same time too.&nbsp; I don't know if it flashes at certain intervals or
 not.&nbsp; I have tried researching this, but it doesn't seem like anyone else has this exact issue.&nbsp; I have windows bit defender activated, I run Norton PC Checkup,&nbsp; I always update and run Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, I think I still have AVG installed because
 after I uninstalled it and ran an overall computer scan of installed programs it said that AVG was the antivirus protector.&nbsp; I don't know if any of my computer spec information is necessary, but if it is I will give what ever else is needed.&nbsp; Is this something
 to worry about, is it a virus?&nbsp; I just purchased this computer in April of 2012 and there doesn't seem to be any known issues after I noticed the flash.&nbsp; If it's nothing, then I guess I'm just wondering what it is and if I can get rid of it.&nbsp; Thanks for the
 help.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Update: I finally got a screen shot of it after a few hours today.&nbsp; It flashes once an hour at 13 past the hour.&nbsp; I don't know what it means by interactive.... It looks like a camera with a gear.&nbsp; I have a camera and a printer, but I hardly ever use them and
 they aren't connected at this time.&nbsp; Could either program just be looking for that device?&nbsp; Any suggestions is well appreciated, thx.

<h2>            My computer won&#39;t start and System Recovery Options won&#39;t work&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
I've had my HP pavilion dv5 (Windows Vista) for a few years now. It has worked perfectly, until this morning...&nbsp;<br />
<br />
At startup it automatically prompts "Error recovery for Windows" with only 2 choices&nbsp;<br />
-&gt;Start Startup Repair Tool (recommended)&nbsp;<br />
-&gt;Start Windows as Normal&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When trying to start normal, it goes automatically to System Recovey Options.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"Select an operating system to repair and click next."&nbsp;<br />
No OS shows up...&nbsp;<br />
Options "load drivers" or "next"&nbsp;<br />
Not sure where to try and load what drivers from.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Trying Startup Repair Tool gives me 5 choices&nbsp;<br />
-&gt; Startup repair (Startup repair cannot repair this computer automatically)&nbsp;<br />

I've tried Command Prompt and Recovery Manager as well... and I don't have a Windows Vista Emergency CD.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You can check your Hard Drive.</p>
<p><span>Go to your&nbsp;Laptop/Computer Manufacturer's website &gt; <a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/support.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www8.hp.com/us/en/support.html</a>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;find your Laptop's Hardware specs (Hard Drive) &gt; go to the Hard Drive Manufacturer's website &gt; download their Diagnostics software &gt; make a Bootable Disk &gt; test your Hard Drive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><b><span>Saving your files:</span></b></p>
<p><span>You can pull the Hard Drive and put it in a USB Hard Drive Enclosure &gt; plug it into another Computer &gt; and attempt to read and copy over your Data that way.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Or, you can download Knoppix &gt; make a Bootable disk from it &gt; Boot into your System with it (IF your Hardware is all working) &gt; and copy your Data from the Hard Drive that way.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://knoppix.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://knoppix.net/</font></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>With a HP machine you press F11 at Boot to reinstall the OS.</span></p>
<p><span>But, unless it gives you the option of a destructive or non-destructive Recovery you lose all Data if only destructive Recovery available.</span></p>
<p><span>And a non-destructive Recovery rarely solves problems anyway.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
