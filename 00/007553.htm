<h2>            Lumia 620 - Trouble in getting Amber updates.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we have almost reached end of September and most of us are yet to get Amber update on 620 via OTA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone has got Amber updates so far via OTA in India (Chennai)? If yes, what is the FW version number? Is it 1030.6407.1308.0001 or 1030.6407.1308.0002?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have read in some forums that Amber updates are avialble for 1030.6407.1308.0002 FW version. Is that true? What is the difference between 1030.6407.1308.0001 and 1030.6407.1308.0002?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is really true, how can we update our FW to 1030.6407.1308.0002? Whenevr I check for updates it shows that my phone is already up to date (Hate to see this :smileyfrustrated:) :smileysad: :smileymad:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure what to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bear in mind that if you get it updated thru' Nokia Care, all your data will be lost as it will be clean installed. You will need to download all applications again ..so suggest you to have patience as it might be made available over FOTA soon ..</p>

            Keep calm Arivaz I had that same issue on mine about two and a half weeks back. IM in Ireland on Vodafone and was going nuts I didn't have it but alas my wait was over and I had gotten it..... Farby is right too about your data make sure its all backed
 up ie your pictures, videos, music and such..... Your installed apps wont be affected though they will still be there.... When I updated I was nervous of this too but it didn't wipe my apps as they get updated too so they can run in conjunction with Amber....
 You don't see this as the update itself does it all.

            Thanks Eire. Glad to hear that. I will then wait for the OTA update to come to my mobile. I have all my data in the SD card. I hope SD card won't get affected while upgrading.<br />
<br />
Btw, Do you use 620? How is the Amber update on it?<br />
<br />
Few of my friends have Lumia series but none of them got OTA updates so far @ India. Not sure if anyone from India has successfully updated to Amber via OTA.

            Your welcome Arivaz. Yes your files wont be affected but just incase take the SD card out. I have the 520 and its well worth the wait.... It makes the camera much better for low light shots.... The added FM Radio is great too... Unfortunately i don't have
 glance screen or double tap to wake.... I read on here that double tap to wake is a nuisance so im not worried about that.... All in awe Amber gets 5 stars from me.... No issue with it so far.... I hope you and your friends get it soon... Be patient though
 it will come. :)

<p>As long as you have the backup option activated you will get all phone settings, SMS messages and the applist back when you register the phone after the update. It is important to know you must be on Mobile data when you do this and this must be done during
 the device first use setup. For this to be possible the settings for mobile data need to be on the SIM as the phone will read these at that time. Once the restore is complete you can continue the automated download of your apps over Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you will have to do manually is to arrange the startscreen again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully waiting :)<br />
<br />
620 doesn't have radio chip. So FM is not an option for me. double tap to wake is also not supported on 620.<br />
<br />
Let see how long it is going to take for the updates to come to my mobile. Will keep you posted.<br />
<br />
Thanks again :)</p>

<p>@lawrence crumb - You often mention&nbsp; that you need to use Rufus to make a bootable USB using the Media Creation Tool.&nbsp; The USB created by the Media Creation Tool is already bootable.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the initial setup, you have the option to request an USB for use on another PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just last week, I fried a 14942.&nbsp; I just did the d/l of Media Creation Tool and loaded from BIOS.&nbsp; I am using that same PC right now at 14951.&nbsp; I got from 14393.xxx to 14951 in a few hours via Fast Lane.</p>

<p>Hi Lawrence&nbsp; - this capability is pretty well documented.&nbsp; For sure, an ISO with W10 will install on a working PC from Drive C, an USB or DVD.&nbsp; Just hit Setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if the PC has a dead O/S, then you must load from BIOS.&nbsp; I have done this a few times, just last week on a fried 14942.&nbsp; I keep the 14393 ISO on an USB direct from Media Creation Tool and just change the load order to USB .&nbsp; A piece of cake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The existing USB data will be wiped at the start.</p>

How To Create Bootable Windows 10 USB
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have a stable Internet connection.</li><li>USB flash drive with space of more than 4GB. We recommend that you format the drive yourself before going ahead.</li><li>Windows product key if you’re installing the operating system for the first time.</li></ul>
<p>1. Go to this <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> and download the official Windows 10 media creation tool. Make sure you download the correct one tailored for your desktop operating system which you’re currently running – 32-bit or 64-bit.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn.wccftech.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2015%2f07%2fCapture2-635x254.png" height="254" width="635" /></p>
<p>2. Plug in a USB drive to your Windows PC.</p>
<p>3. Launch the media creation tool you just downloaded.</p>
<p>4. Select ‘Create installation media for another PC’ option. Click on ‘Next’ in the bottom right corner.</p>

<p>5. On the next screen, you’ll be presented with a bunch of options. Select your language, the edition of Windows 10 you wish to download, and of course, the architecture. Click on ‘Next’ once your choices have been made.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn.wccftech.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2015%2f07%2fScreenshot-8-635x515.png" height="515" width="635" /></p>
<p>6. Select the ‘USB flash drive’ option, which should be highlighted by default. Click on ‘Next.’</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<div style="text-align: center; color: rgba(136, 136, 136, 1)">

<p>7. The tool will now prompt you to select the USB drive you’ve plugged into your PC. Click on ‘Next’ once you’ve made your choice.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn.wccftech.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2015%2f07%2fScreenshot-10-635x512.png" height="512" width="635" /></p>
<p>8. Windows 10 will now begin downloading and once the process is complete, you’ll be left with a bootable Windows 10 USB drive, all ready to be installed on a PC of your choice.</p>

            are you sure that the code your phone is asking is the security code? if it really security code and default code 12345 is not working, you need to bring your phone to the nearest nokia carepoint so re-flash will be done on your phone and the default code
 will be back to 12345 again.

    <title>A Master Worksheet from which data can be linked to many other - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crescent786  say:</h3>
<h2>            A Master Worksheet from which data can be linked to many other workbooks within the same OneDrive Account.</h2>
                    <p><span>I have (literally) 100’s of Excel workbooks in my Computer, (OneDrive Account) and the number is gradually growing.
<br />
Each workbook has one or more worksheets (usually 3). <br />
They are in many different folders (within OneDrive) and the ‘Folder Names’ as well as ‘the path to these Folders’ keep changing (as I keep re-organizing my File or Folder Directories layout.<br />
There is one special Workbook, where I keep a large amount of data.<br />
I call this the Master Workbook. It has just one worksheet (the Master Worksheet) which consists of 3 Columns and about 100 rows.<br />
That is (say) A1 to C100<br />
<br />
The cells Column ‘A’ contains, what I refer to as the ‘Reference Data’.<br />
As an example, let’s say the worksheet is a Dictionary.<br />
Column A contains the Words or phrases (that is the reference data)<br />
Column B gives the meaning in English, and<br />
Column C gives the meaning in a different language, let’s say in Arabic<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>The Master Workbook will always remain in one fixed folder (the name or the path of this folder will not change)</span>
<br />
<span>The question I have is, how can I have this entire Master Worksheet (A1 to C100) appear in other workbooks?
<span>The question I have is, how can I have this entire Master Worksheet (A1 to C100) appear in other workbooks?
<br />
<br />
Whenever or whatever I may change in this Master Worksheet must automatically be reflected in the linked worksheets, even if I keep on changing the Folder names and Folder paths to these linked worksheets.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Similarly, can I make changes to the data being reflected in another worksheet, and those changes too must then (in turn) be reflected in the Master Worksheet as well as all other worksheets that is reflecting this data.<br />
That is regarding A1 to C100.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Can I also have sections of this worksheet linked (say A24 to C30)?<br />
<br />
I know that it sounds a little complicated, but I do hope my question is clear.<br />
Thanking you<br />
Imtiaz<br />

<p>Hi Imtiaz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to your description, these workbooks are stored in OneDrive for Business or the local OneDrive sync folder. If it is the case, your requirement cannot be achieved as external reference links cannot be updated automatically in OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they are local files store on your computer, you can paste the master worksheet to other workbooks as link. Then it can be automatically updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ran</p>

<h2>            No New Email Notifications Sent To iPhone</h2>
                    
<p>We recently switched from google @ work to office365. Our users are experiencing an issue with not getting notifications on their iPhone of new email.</p>
<p>We have narrowed it down to all messages that we have a Rule setup so it goes to a certain folder. This is not very helpful as we have many folders and how would one know which email arrived. Most users are on the road and wouldn't have time to go through
 multiple folders.</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestions as the rules as you know save time and work great.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Rod,</p>
<p>To better understand your situation, could you provide the following information?</p>
<p>1.What is the mail app that you are using, built-in app or Outlook for iOS?</p>
<p>2.How did you set up your account in the mail app, via POP3, IMAP or Exchange?</p>
<p>3.What is the iOS device version?</p>
<p>4.Regarding “We have narrowed it down to all messages that we have a Rule setup so it goes to a certain folder.”, do you mean that you have found that the root cause is related the inbox rules? For example, you can receive the email notification which the
 emails are sent to the Inbox folder directly. However, if the emails go to the subfolder, you cannot receive the notification.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>hi rod,</p>
<p>thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>as i know, the email notifications is turned on only for inbox by default. to let subfolders also get notifications, please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>1. in <strong>settings</strong>, click <strong>mail, contacts, calendars</strong>.</p>
<p>2. click <strong>fetch new data</strong>-&gt;<strong>exchange</strong>.</p>
<p>check the folders in the list that you want to get notifications when receiving emails. if you still cannot receive notifications or encounter any problem during the procedure, please upload some screenshots about the settings for further troubleshooting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>to upload screenshots, select&nbsp;the <b>use rich formatting </b>button in the forum, and then click&nbsp;<b>insert /edit media</b> like the picture shows below:</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Yes it does notify the user that he has got a new email but the issue is they have multiple folders so which one arrived? If they selected one extra folder we would be fine but they have multiple they want to monitor. It will help some.</p>
<p>Too bad there wasn't an unread folder list. </p>

<p>It’s not feasible to notify the user which folder the newly coming email arrives at in the built-in mail App. To achieve your goal, we recommend you use Outlook for iPhone.</p>

            Hi, I'm Juergen. I've been teaching Office for 17 years now.
<br />Let's see if we can find a solution for you.
<br />One could add this functionality using VBA, so that clicking one button enables the second (and disables the first one). That means, you'd have to change file-type to .DOCM, which allows macros, but maybed that's already the case?
<br />Some people do allow macros, some fear it, because macros CAN be viruses. That's why some firms deny macros completely.
<br />If you cannot write macros at all, the only way for me to help you, would be to work on the template you're using (containing the 2 butons) a little bit… 
<br />Please let me know what your about to decide.

            What is the process for the form being accessed by the Administrator and then returned to the originator?&nbsp; It would seem to me that you would want something in that process to enable the second Submit button, which in the first instance should be disabled
 to prevent it from being used.

            The Word form is emailed to the user to complete a section.&nbsp; When the user clicks on Initial Submit it is then emailed to an operational owner in SharePoint.&nbsp;The owner puts her/his comments in the form and then it is emailed back to the user.&nbsp; The user
 makes his/her final edit and does a Final Submit.&nbsp; The problem is some users are using the Final Submit when the form is first mailed to them.&nbsp; I'm trying to prevent that from happening.

<br />
Which <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-version-of-Outlook-do-I-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c#bkmk_32" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

upgrading to Office 2016 using Office 365 for business</a>? Please provide us with the detailed information about this.<br />
<br />
May I know whether you have checked those missing Notes in the <strong>Deleted Items</strong> folder? If you can't find it there, the next place to look is the Recoverable Items folder, which you can access by using the
<strong>Recover Deleted Items</strong> tool. See <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Recover-deleted-items-in-Outlook-for-Windows-49e81f3c-c8f4-4426-a0b9-c0fd751d48ce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Recover deleted items in Outlook for Windows</a><br />
<br />
Start Outlook in safe mode to check, if you can see the Notes. For your reference see under
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/I-can-t-start-Microsoft-Outlook-2016-2013-or-2010-or-receive-the-error-Cannot-start-Microsoft-Office-Outlook-Cannot-open-the-Outlook-Window-d1f69da6-b333-4650-97bf-4d77bd7abb85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Start Outlook in safe mode and disable add-ins</a><br />
<br />
You can also try to troubleshoot this issue via repairing Outlook Data Files (.pst and .ost). for more detailed information, please refer to the article:

<p>I didn't find my notes there though: &nbsp;either that the tool only works for mails, events &amp; tasks or that my notes were deleted more than 28 days ago.</p>
<p>I now believe my notes are gone forever ... Pitty 😔</p>

            <p><span>Hi Soufiane,<br />
<br />
If you are using an Office 365 for Business email account in the Outlook client, you may also try to use in-place eDiscovery search to find the notes. Here is an article about in-place eDiscovery search:<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd353189(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd353189(v=exchg.150).aspx</a><br />
</span></p>
<p>Note: You need to use an admin account to create an in-place eDiscovery search.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If a hold isn't placed on your mailbox before it's deleted, the contents of the mailbox won't be preserved or discoverable. &nbsp;<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Your time and understanding will be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Yang<br />

            <p>Dear Yang,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is my understanding right that notes stored locally in the computer for the Microsoft email account
<strong>are lost</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;after upgrade/re-connecting to MICROSOFT Outlook and <strong>
cannot be recovered</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Lost - because nobody warned users to back up notes or other content of the *.ost file before starting upgrade/reconnecting procedure</p>
<p>a)Does not Recovered - because "Recover Deleted Items" does not see notes or if&nbsp;a person does not use Office 365 for Business email account in the Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if my understanding is right, does Microsoft feels being smart and/or treating customers fierily?
</p>

            <span>Hi David,<br />
<br />
Firstly I’d like to clarify that the data such as notes stored on the local computer will only exist on this computer. It will not sync with Office 365 Exchange Online or other email services. So when upgrading the Outlook client or re-configuring the email
 account, the data on the local computer will not sync from Exchange Online or other email services to the Outlook client again.<br />
<br />
a) Lost - because nobody warned users to back up notes or other content of the *.ost file before starting upgrade/reconnecting procedure.<br />
The notes stored on the local computer will not be part of the ost file of an email account in the Outlook client. As I said above, they will not sync to Exchange Online or other email services. So before upgrading or re-connecting, users need to backup these
 notes. <br />
<br />
a) Does not Recovered - because "Recover Deleted Items" does not see notes or if a person does not use Office 365 for Business email account in the Outlook.<br />
For an Office 365 for Business account, the notes which are not only stored on the local computer will also sync to Exchange Online. If the notes are deleted from the recover deleted items folder, they would also exist in Exchange Online for 30 days and can
 be recovered if there is no litigation hold or in-place hold enabled. During this period, only admins can find these notes and end users will not be able to find them from their Outlook client.
<br />
For email accounts from other email services, we are not clear about how notes will be managed so we cannot determine whether they are not recoverable.
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yang</span>

    <title>Outlook Quick Step order of execution is broken - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robfea  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Quick Step order of execution is broken</h2>
                    <p>I have implemented Getting Things Done using Outlook and it's been working wonderfully for me. I have Quick Steps configured that do the following:</p>
<p>1. Categorize the message</p>
<p>2. Create Task with message as attachment</p>
<p>3. Delete the message</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result of this was a new task that was already categorized exactly as I want it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, all of a sudden, the Quick Step has decided to start executing these three commands in a different order. First it creates the Task (without a category) and then deletes/categorizes the message. The deleted message is categorized appropriately.
 Ironically, this has happened and the stopped happening a couple times. Currently today, no matter whether I use the shortcut keys or click the Quick Step button, this incorrect order of execution is occurring. Tomorrow, who knows? I have restarted Outlook
 and even created new rules, but same issue is occurring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is driving me crazy. It is clearly some type of bug deep in the code. If anyone can track this down or has any pointers, that would be great!</p>

            If you have fast battery drain, random reboot and overheating problem with any Windows phone devices this not related to Windows 10 Mobile or any build. This is just because most of the Windows Phone devices are older than a year or two so the battery
 is expired. Replacing the battery will fix fast battery drain, random reboot and overheating problem of Windows Phone. I had same problem, I replaced mine now I don't have any problem. I highly recommend you to replace your battery if you have same problem

<h2>            Inconsinstency With Spacing in Address Block of Word Mailmerge document.</h2>
                    <p>In Word 2010 I am doing a mailmerge.&nbsp; I have the recipients list saved in an Excel document.&nbsp; When I use the Wizard to build the mailmerge and use a letter template, the addresses comes in just fine, but when I use a custom letter that I designed and then&nbsp;insert
 an address block to pull in information from the Excel file,&nbsp;the address information&nbsp;comes into Word double spaced which is not what I want.&nbsp; When I use the wizard and a template the address block is single spaced.&nbsp;&nbsp; Does anybody know why this is happening?&nbsp;
 How do I control this?</p>

<p>Either change that, or, instead of using the Address Block, just insert the individual merge fields in the configuration that you want them.</p>

<h2>            LED Notification Does Not Work with Outlook for Android on Samsung Phone After Upgrading to Oreo</h2>
                    I recently upgraded my Samsung S7 phone to the Oreo OS, and found that I no longer receive a blinking blue LED notification when I receive messages.&nbsp; I have confirmed that this problem is specific to Outlook, and not a system-wide issue, as the blue light
 notification works fine with Gmail and other programs.&nbsp; The problem has nothing to do with the Focused feature, as the light doesn't turn blue no matter how this feature is configured.&nbsp; Please note that I do receive notifications upon receiving Outlook messages;
 however, the LED light remains green, whereas it should (and used to before Oreo) turn blue and blink.&nbsp; Please investigate!

            Hi <strong>rschum</strong>,<br />
<br />
It could be due to an incompatibility issue of the application and the software at the time that a new version was installed. It’s also possible that the issue is with the upgrade itself as the LED notification setting is configured on the device. We can perform
 some troubleshooting steps for the Outlook app to resolve this concern. Just to confirm, have you already tried
<strong>installing the latest version of the application</strong>? How about <strong>
uninstalling </strong>and <strong>reinstalling </strong>the app?<br />
<br />
If you haven’t done it yet, I’d suggest that you check if there’s a recent version of the Outlook app that you can install and see if the same issue persists. You may proceed to the
<strong>Store </strong>app on your device and search for the app, then update from there. From the Store app as well you can
<strong>uninstall </strong>and <strong>reinstall </strong>the app. <strong>Note:</strong> For the accurate steps on how to uninstall an application on your device, you may reach out to its manufacturer for further assistance as they may have a different way
 to execute this process.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me know how the issue progresses so I could provide additional assistance.

<p>For some reason, I was never notified that there was a reply to my posting.&nbsp; I just found it by searching for any news on this issue, and seeing it listed in Google.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I've done everything you suggested, and none of these attempted fixes have resolved the problem.&nbsp; I'm convinced that the problem lies with the Outlook app, since messages from Gmail and other apps are able to trigger a blue LED notification
 without a problem--just like Outlook did before the Oreo update.&nbsp; There must be a bug somewhere, so I encourage you to reach out to Microsoft engineers to resolve this matter.&nbsp; Please do not ignore it, as it seems Microsoft so often does.</p>
<p>

            It's been over a week since I posted the information that the Microsoft agent requested and promised to respond to, and I've yet to receive a reply, despite the fact that 29 people have experienced the same problem which appears to be caused by a bug in
 the Outlook app (since it only occurs exclusively with this app).&nbsp; Microsoft is quick to initially respond with feigned interest and generic troubleshooting tips, but then usually chooses to ignore the matter entirely when it comes to actually addressing the
 issue at hand, which likely requires the involvement of the development team.&nbsp; Sadly, this is the kind of 'support' that we all have become used to in these forums--it's more lip service and public relations than actual technical assistance.&nbsp; Has anyone ever
 been provided with a solution in these forums from Microsoft itself, rather than fellow users who try to assist each other in the face of Microsoft's abject failure and lack of interest in helping its customers?

</p><blockquote>I recently upgraded my Samsung S7 phone to the Oreo OS, and found that I no longer receive a blinking blue LED notification when I receive messages.&nbsp; I have confirmed that this problem is specific to Outlook,
 and not a system-wide issue, as the blue light notification works fine with Gmail and other programs.&nbsp; The problem has nothing to do with the Focused feature, as the light doesn't turn blue no matter how this feature is configured.&nbsp; Please note that I do receive
 notifications upon receiving Outlook messages; however, the LED light remains green, whereas it should (and used to before Oreo) turn blue and blink.&nbsp; Please investigate!

<p>Dear friend,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think it's a specific Outlook's bug. I have the same problem with other apps too. Damn actually my LED doesn't blink anymore even on messenger and calls and everything, just AFTER i upgraded to Android Oreo. So i guess Google really messed up with
 notifications</p>

            Thanks for sharing your situation.&nbsp; However, in my case, the problem is specific to Outlook, since I get a blue blinking light notification in other apps, including Gmail for messages.&nbsp; I know that others are experiencing LED problems with all apps, but
 thankfully my issue is isolated to only one.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Microsoft has ignored my posting after I informed them that their general troubleshooting instructions failed to resolve my problem.&nbsp; Thanks for the customer support, Microsoft!&nbsp; Clearly, you care

<p>Thanks for pointing me to the link as a solution.&nbsp; I came across this in my research; however, the last several versions of the Android Outlook app do not have a blinking light setting--at least on my device.&nbsp; If yours does (and you're using the latest version),
 then it would appear that Outlook is installing itself differently on different devices.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate it if you would confirm that the setting is missing on your device, or that the setting is present, which would be helpful info in determining how to proceed.&nbsp; It seems to me that this setting might very well fix the problem, but then I would
 need to find a way to access it.</p>

<h2>            Nokia 215 &#40;rm1111&#41; bluetooth malfunction</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I hope you are happy and able to help me.</p>
<p>I have a Nokia 215 (microsoft rm1111) phone and I have managed to pair it with my laptop.</p>
<p>I can send MP3 files from my laptop to the phone and there they are - so far so good.</p>
<p>The laptop name is the only device one the phone's paired list.</p>
<p>If I go into the phone files and select a photo or voice recording then attempt to share by bluetooth then the laptop name is not there. A previously used and deleted paired device (my son's old phone) still shows on the paired list in this share dialog
 even though it is naturally absent from the paired list on the phone's main bluetooth menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone else had this malfunction? There is obviously communication one way so I cant see why it isn't happening in the other direction.</p>
<p>The USB connection does not work either. There are no screen prompts from connection and it doesn't show on the windows explorer side of things in the laptop.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Your computer has to offer the service Object-Push Profile (OPP). I am not sure whether the Bluetooth Software Stack from Microsoft (that is what you are using, it is OK) offers that automatically. Anyway, please,

<h2>            my experiences and suggestions so far &#40;main point&#58; take some more notes from unity and gnome 3&#41;</h2>
                    <p>so I have been using preview on my latitude tablet. it has been an interesting experience and I have&nbsp; like a lot of the new features but have run in to several problems as a result of the new features not being fully fleshed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>most of my suggestions will revolve around how the task switcher operates however I do also have some issues with how metro apps now handle on a tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. you designed an os for tablets then redesigned it for desktops and subsequently forgot about tablets. the way metro apps behave now is sort of awful as a result of this. none of them full screen by default which is silly given that the whole point of
 them on a small screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a of course this new system is a decent improvement for desktops but the os needs to be more adaptive to what it is running on and should change to suit its platform</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. the efficiency gains of metro apps were lost when you made them operate on top of the desktop. I thought that the whole point of the metro system was that it removes the need to keep the desktop loaded by having applications behave more like they do on
 android or ios. there was a lot of potential in app instancing and i really feel that it needs to make a come back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2a. games and videos need to be able to tag in to the same system. basically when you start playing a game or watching a full screen video it should put it object in a metro instance. in theory this shouldn't even require anything on the application side
 and could be handled entirely by the os. what this offers is the frame rate advantage of full screen directx without the hassle of tabbing out because you could switch back to the desktop and in theory not have the screen flicker and potential crash issues
 gamers are so familiar with. without having to use some form of windowed mode and sacrificing frame rates. this also has and advantage for multimonitor users in that it would allow you to more easily move videos and games among monitors potentially.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. task switcher desperately needs a drag and drop feature without that it really is a pain to use especially on a tablet</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. metro apps need to be placed on the task switcher as their own "desktop" this allows similar function to how metro apps worked in windows 8 in a nicer interface and goes in line with the rest of my recommendations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. as much as I hate to use it tablets desperately need the metro IE nothing else performs well enough on these things and the desktop version is awful because it isn't nearly as optimized for tablets as metro ie was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. the on screen keyboard needs to be smarter. in android the system detects when you have a keyboard and/or mouse connected and adapts it's behavior accordingly. for instance if i have a keyboard but no mouse I need to touch the screen to select things
 but what I don't want in this situation is for the onscreen keyboard to popup. obviously if I have a keyboard connected im going to use it please recognize this and disable it on the fly of course when I disconnect my keyboard i want the table to recognize
 this as well and default back to using the on screen one</p>

                    <p>I have a problem since my company installed office 365 for mac. When I flag or unflag emails, changes are randomly synced or not within various devices. I've tried setting up from scratch accounts on iPad and iPhone, and to recreate the identity, but was
 useless. This is quite annoying since I heavily rely on flagging emails for completing my tasks, and now what shows up is different in any device!</p>

            <p>Hi MassimoU,<br />
<br />
I did a test on Built-in mail app and Outlook Web App (OWA) for iPhone on iPhone 6, and found that they sync well on OWA for iPhone when I flagged and unflagged emails on Outlook for Mac 15.24. Sometimes it needs to take several minutes to sync with Built-in
 mail app in iPhone. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand your situation, I need to collect the following information:<br />
1. What version is your Mac OS?<br />
2. What types and versions of your iPhone and iPad? And what mail apps do you use, Outlook for IOS, Built-in mail app or OWA for iPhone &amp; iPad?<br />
3. Regarding “changes are randomly synced or not within various devices”, what devices and mail apps does this issue occur to? Please give us detailed descriptions.<br />
4. Have you waited several minutes to check if they are synced? The sync speed relies much on your network flow rate. Does this issue occur in a comparatively high-speed network environment?<br />
5. To rule out the possibility that Outlook for Mac client is the culprit, if possible, could you have a test on another Outlook for Mac client?<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Jasmine<br />

<h2>            it takes forever to load web pages</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have&nbsp; a problem with my internet explorer, but I am not sure if this is caused by &nbsp;IE 10. Every time I open a page... it takes too long to load or hangs up or a message at the bottom of the screen "Microsoft...not responding..." when I open MSN pages.
 I did the recommendations I found here, but didn't work. I decided to install Fire fox to see if&nbsp; the problem still exist. When I open any web pages in there (Fire fox) it works all the time. I am thinking of uninstalling the internet explorer and reinstalling
 it. Is there anybody who have tried uninstalling and reinstalling internet explorer?&nbsp; I just want to be sure somebody have tried this and works properly. I appreciate any suggestions.</p>

<h2>            Forms - to be completed by hand and&#47;or electronically</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I'm new to Forms, so please be gentle with me!<br />
<br />
I am creating a form which some users will complete electronically, but others will print out and complete by hand.<br />
<br />
I have set up the fields, which now show &lt;&lt;Click here to enter text&gt;&gt; everywhere that a response is required.<br />
<br />
The problem is that when the form is printed, &lt;&lt;Click here to enter text&gt;&gt; also prints, so there is no room for users to handwrite an answer.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Is there a way to either:<br />
<ol>
<li>Have this text not print.</li><li>Have a field there, but without the text (the design of the form makes it fairly obvious where they need to enter something).</li></ol>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p><br />

            <p>That "Click here to enter text" is called placeholder text.&nbsp; The fact that it prints when you don't click there and enter text is IMHO a long uncorrected design flaw.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>With a bit of effort, you can get it not to print:<br />
<a href="http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/content_controls_do_not_print_pht.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/content_controls_do_not_print_pht.html</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In your case, you might want to simply change it to a series of underscores so it looks like a&nbsp;line.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Select the CC tab, click Developer&gt;Controls&gt;Design Mode.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When in design mode put you cursor right after the "C" in "Click" and type your series of underscores.&nbsp; Then select the rest of the "lick here to ..." and go back and delete the "C"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>That may seem odd but, placeholdertext is fickle and just deleting the existing text and typing the underscores may not produce the desired effect.</p>

<br />
A big design flaw, I agree!<br />
<br />
I ran away scared as soon as I saw VBA mentioned in the link you posted.&nbsp; That's a long way beyond me - so I will happily settle for your other suggestion.&nbsp; Out of interest, do I need to put the series of underscores, or can I just delete what's there?<br />
<br />

"Fickle" and "objects" - nice to see those two words being used in a sentence that doesn't also contain "women".<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft Outlook&nbsp;2003, 2007, 2010, 2013 and 2016 allows you effectively use G Suite with the corresponding sync app from the developer. Based on our findings
 to resolve your concern. there is a sync app available from the same developer and it would be best that you get in touch with them so that you can get the app and the exact steps you need to complete the process.</span></p>
