    <title>Office 365 Home Word - Table drag and drop highlighted row SOMETIMES - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mark-gump  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Home Word - Table drag and drop highlighted row SOMETIMES changes the width of columns and height of rows</h2>
                    <p><span>There appears to be a bug in Word 365 with moving rows of a table to new locations using a Drag and Drop technique.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The problem occurs when I do the following:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<span>I create a Table in Word that has 3 columns and 5 rows and populate it with some data.</span></p>
<p><span>2. I highlight any row by clicking the margin to the left of the table at the location of the row I want highlighted.</span></p>
<p><span>3. I put the mouse cursor on the highlighted text in the row I want to move.</span></p>
<p><span>4. With the left mouse button held down, I drag the cursor to be in front of the text in the left most column of another row that I want the highlighted row to me moved and inserted above then I release the mouse button.</span></p>
<p><span>5. The highlighted row of text will be moved and inserted above the row where the cursor was located.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Most of the time, but not all of the time, the width of the two left most columns are changed to make them wider than they were and the right most column width becomes very small. &nbsp;This causes the text in the right most column to wrap around and
 forces the height of the rows to become much higher than they should be.</span></p>
<p><span>7. This,of course, completely messes up the formatting of the whole table with column and row sizes changed to values I don't want.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Moving rows using the following technique works fine:</strong></span><br />
<span>1. Highlight row to be moved.</span><br />
<span>1. Highlight row to be moved.</span><br />
<span>2. Hold the left Shift and Alt key down.</span><br />
<span>2. Hold the left Shift and Alt key down.</span><br />
<span>3. While holding these keys down, use the Up or Down Arrow key to move the highlighted row up or down the table one row at a time.</span><br />
<span>3. While holding these keys down, use the Up or Down Arrow key to move the highlighted row up or down the table one row at a time.</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>This is not a very handy way to rearrange rows in a table but it does work every time whereas the drag and drop seems to be failing MOST but not all of the time.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This technique of moving rows of data in a table has worked for me using Word 2007 and 2013 without fail so it appears there must be a bug that got introduced in Word 365.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would be interested to hear from others if they have had similar problems and especially if they do NOT have this problem if they try to use Word 365 in this case with a similar table. &nbsp;I have reported this problem to Microsoft and talked with a
 level one and level two representative on the phone about this and neither of them could tell me why this was happening. &nbsp;Hopefully, they have notified the software development team and this bug will be fixed soon.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This same problem occurs when I run Office 365 on a Windows 10 system and also when I run Word in Safe mode.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. &nbsp;I have already tried the Quick Repair process and it did NOT make any difference to the issue I am speaking about. &nbsp;I'm pretty sure this is a bug in Word because I can reproduce it on a Windows 10 machine and also because I found
 a number of &nbsp;postings in the Answers.Microsoft.com website talking about drag and drop not working for trying to move text around in other situation that are not related to tables. &nbsp;It looks like there is a general problem with drag and drop that needs to
 be addressed by Microsoft development.</p>

    <title>How to enable macros Word 2013 RT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mary chipman  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to enable macros Word 2013 RT</h2>
                    How do you enable macros/VBA in Word 2013? I have configured word for backwards compatibility and attached .dot templates, but I cannot figure out how to enable the macros to run. I've looked and looked at the configuration and security settings, enabled
 group policy settings, to no avail. It seems like whenever I get close to figuring it out, the Surface RT UI does not match the screenshots of the relevant help topics, and there doesn't appear to be an administrative configuration tool in the Windows Store
 (tried downloading the one from TechNet, but of course that didn't work). Thanks!

Thanks James. Do you know where/how to confirm?&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>If this is true, and there's no way to enable macros/VBA on the local machine, then it's a show-stopper for me and I will return the Surface RT while I still can. Which would be sad -- I'm otherwise quite happy with it, but if I can't do my work, which
 requires having my macros work, what's it good for?</div>

            <p>I had read that last year about Visual Basic.&nbsp; Some things just could not be ported over to the ARM processor along with those systems could also grow beyond a reasonable size for a tablet like the RT.&nbsp; Office itself was not designed to be a primary office
 suite either and is real good for the basics, but, you still need a laptop or desktop running the 'real thing'.&nbsp; Office RT will load any file created with all other versions of Office in perfect format, BUT, not all options are available.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The machine you need is the Pro model and if you just got the RT, see if you can swap it in and get a Pro model and subscribe/download Office 365.&nbsp; If you do that, you are set with the real thing.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It probably sounds like a Coke commercial but if you need the use of macros, you need the real thing.&nbsp; On the Pro, you may need to download/install the Visual Basic Runtime but not sure on that.&nbsp; That may already be in Office 365.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Microsoft just reduced the prices on the Surface tablets to a permanent discount, so now is the time to buy.&nbsp; I have been sitting here all day with my finger on the "Place Order Now" button at the Microsoft Online Store for a 64GB Pro model (I don't need
 massive file storage for what I do).&nbsp; I have a RT myself and in the past few weeks, it up and decided to work and actually get online.&nbsp; I think it is up to something but not sure.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I better order the Pro model myself!</p>

<ol>
<li>no USB drive</li><li>it’s heavier than the RT.</li></ol>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I did get the reduced price at Best Buy (same as online). I bought a mini-SD card to expand the storage (don’t need to pay more for 64), got a Bluetooth mouse to free up the USB drive, and have been happily using it as an e-book reader, data entry, writing,
 etc. I also have a laptop because I need to run other apps, like Photoshop, SQL Server, Access (etc) which I was aware that I would need to do up front when I bought the Surface RT. What I like about the RT is that it’s little, light, and I can pop it in my
 purse and go. I’ve been able to use it productively (except for wasting an entire day trying to enable macros due to the documentation/Help sucking, which is how it always&nbsp;is&nbsp;for&nbsp;Office apps). I never&nbsp;imagined that they’d ship a crippleware version of Office,
 the whole point of which is to increase productivity. I’m beginning to understand why&nbsp;the Surface RT is a failure, which is a shame because there are so many things&nbsp;about it that they got right.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I guess the next question would be, if VBA will never be available on the RT for Word/Excel, will there be some other way to automate repetitive tasks, sort of like the old Access macros which did not require VBA? I get that you may not have the answer
 to that :)</div>

            <p>The answer to that will be NO.&nbsp; You can forget about high end processes for a RT.&nbsp; It was designed for home and student use and the office suite freebie was to give the user something to work with.&nbsp; With 8.1, they will get Outlook RT also.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, Access and Publisher will not be available for the RT either.&nbsp; That might change in the future iterations of the RT series.&nbsp; The specifications for the second generation have been leaking out and the future RT will have some increased capabilities
 but not much.&nbsp; The current version would be no.&nbsp; Most likely is the storage space.&nbsp; Chances are that VBA can be crossed over to the ARM processor but that is a fairly large system on its own.&nbsp; Even just the runtime version would eat up a lot of space.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Bottom line, it would not be practical for a tablet designed for home use even though corporate entities are looking at the RTs (they don't like distractionware installed on their computers and the RT is a good solution).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The Pro model should have been your choice to begin with.&nbsp; That is why you research what you get before you get it!&nbsp; If anything, you could have gotten on this forum and asked about the tablets.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>At least you got a good price now because that price reduction was made permanent for these 1st generation machines from what I hear.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Think of the RT as a Windows version of Android.&nbsp; You don't do high end functions with an Android tablet.&nbsp; You need something with a fuel injected V6 like a Pro.</p>

            I did research before buying, and totally disagree that I should have gotten the Pro -- no USB port, case closed.&nbsp;I'm doing a lot of work right now with a client who has Word for Mac, and that's the easiest way for us to exchange files, so the only baseline
 functionality I absolutely require from Word/Excel is backwards compatibility as Mac always lags the latest PC versions.
<div><br />
<div>It was apparent up front that RT wasn't going to be a laptop replacement. I was surprised to find that my legacy macros couldn't be enabled as everything I had read about Office 2013 indicated that templates were fully supported. I would say that my biggest
 complaint is that the documentation and search is, (to put it kindly), fatally deficient. But that has been the case ever since I can remember (going back to the early '90's when I was part of Woody Leonhard's original gadflies on CompuServe and later as an
 MVP for Access and then SQL Server). So I know how essential community support is, but I've also always found that to be really sad as well. So many customers get turned off when they become frustrated looking for answers to fairly straightforward questions,
 and can't find them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If the Surface RT is going to appeal to corporate customers, it's going to need to provide some sort of automation that IT can program, configure and control. If you want to circumscribe what users do, you generally have to write some code to enforce limits
 as well as make it easier to perform the work that they are supposed to be doing. Out-of-the box software doesn't do that, and neither do de-fanged templates. The whole point of the Office suite from the get-go involved a "unified macro language" (in billg's
 words) to automate tasks and enhance productivity. I'm familiar with all of the reasoning behind VBA being out of favor, but if corporate is the goal, there needs to be *something*.</div>

            <p>Well, the Pro does have a USB port.&nbsp; It always has.&nbsp; I have Office 2011 for my Mac as well (I have a MacBook '09 model and a current Mac Mini) and reads all Office files including the older ones.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What I am getting at was that the RT was for home use. It was designed to be a low priced, Windows 8 tablet that most people could afford.&nbsp; People did not want to shell out $2,600 for a HP Slate. It didn't have a keyboard or anything else plus it has an
 ATOM processor to boot.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Corporations have been looking at the RT model because of price and its general capabilities.&nbsp; Now, you can Remote Desktop and access a machine that has a full Microsoft Office suite with VBA and work that way.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I build and repair computers and knew all about the RT long before it came out on the market.&nbsp; What was a surprise was the list of problems that came out on it right after it went on sale.&nbsp; I bought mine in February and just two weeks ago, it decided to
 go ahead and be fully functional (WiFi issue).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The RT is fun to play with but not designed for high end business use even though people are looking into doing that.&nbsp; The Windows 8 that is in it is a re-compiled version designed for the ARM processor and absolutely will not run regular Windows software
 of any kind.&nbsp; The office suite was done the same way.&nbsp; Like Windows 8 RT, Microsoft Office Home &amp; Student RT is not the real Microsoft Office suite.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So, myself, I knew the limitation of this tablet right out of gate.&nbsp; Microsoft never advertised it to be anything other than a Windows 8 tablet that can only run apps from the Store.&nbsp; They never advertised it to be a replacement for anything.&nbsp; That was CNET,
 ZDNet and a bunch of others thinking and writing about it being a laptop replacement plus a lot of people bought them to do just that.&nbsp; Why pack around a full case when you pack around something the size of a tablet of paper and you don't need a case.</p>

<p>The Pro model I looked at that was on sale&nbsp;in Best Buy did not have&nbsp;a USB port (which both the salesman and another customer pointed out). Plus, it was heavier. If I want to throw out my back, I can always lug my laptop around and run full versions of all
 the&nbsp;software I&nbsp;could ever&nbsp;need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided I was willing to take the tradeoff between lighter and less functionality vs. full featured and heavier. Just sayin' that if msft wants to appeal to corporate where the lightweight RT form factor would be valuable (and I can think of many business
 scenarios where this would be the case, from travelers, sales,&nbsp;remote workers, educators &amp; so on), then future versions would need to have a means of automating business processes.</p>

            <p>The picture of the Surface Pro and the technical specs for it are at the online Microsoft Store.&nbsp; It has always had a USB 3.0 port.&nbsp; A picture of it is on this web page under "Ports":
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-US</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The USB port on the Pro model is on the left side just below the Volume Rocker Switch, not right like the RT. The Pro model also, cannot be much heavier than a RT.&nbsp; Both are almost the same size.&nbsp; It is built internally much differently because it has an
 Intel Core i5 processor which also needs a cooling fan.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you don't believe me, contact Customer Support via phone and they will tell you.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can also do a web search for "Surface Pro" and click on "Images" at the top of the search page and you can go through all the pictures of it.&nbsp; The USB port is on the left side just above the kickstand and below the volume rocker switch.&nbsp; Every Surface
 Pro built has it.&nbsp; The salesman you talked to probably didn't know anything about computers.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The Pro is easy to pack around and plus if you find a program out there that you think you might need along with business, you can install it.&nbsp; The RT, you can't.&nbsp; I call the RT; "Canned SPAM".&nbsp; If it is not in the Store, you ain't gonna get it!&nbsp; The ARM
 processor cannot execute x86 code.&nbsp; It was designed for cellular phones and running Linux or Android.&nbsp; It wouldn't have the horsepower to run a lot of programs out there even if it could.&nbsp; It was designed for home use.&nbsp; That is why the Pro model is marketed
 for businesses.</p>

            <p>I'm sure you are right and the guys in the store were wrong, but that doesn't alter the fact that the RT could find a niche in the business marketplace with minor enhancements. I'm well aware that the marketing for the RT has failed miserably (I question
 what "home" even means in this context since students need a computer that performs basically the same operations that businesses do, or msft wouldn't have included Office).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your expertise is clearly hardware, mine is software, so I'll focus more narrowly on the decision-making process that led to the purchase of the RT so that you understand. The hardware specs were close enough, the RT had Office, and paying hundreds more
 for the Pro just wasn't worth it (nor was paying more for&nbsp;the 64 GB HD on the RT when you could get an SD card for less than the price difference). The clincher was the weight, which may not mean much to you, but is considerable when you are looking to lighten
 the load (it weighs almost as much as my laptop). Perhaps in the next generation or two down the road I'll consider something along the lines of the&nbsp;Pro version when my laptop dies, but in the meantime the RT fills a niche lying somewhere between my Galaxy
 S4, a Kindle,&nbsp;and my laptop. It's possible that msft may abandon the RT platform, like they did with Zune (a truly wretched device), but I figure RT will be in support for at least three years, at which point I will have gotten my money's worth and there will
 likely be even better options out there. The added weight plus higher sticker price of the Pro made it just not worth it unless it was going to be a laptop replacement, and if I was going down that road, I would not be shopping in Best Buy's tablet section.
 Make sense?</p>

            <p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>By default, email messages are sent automatically when you click<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Send</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>in a new message window. One of the possible reasons could be an intermittent internet connection or your messages contain
 large attachments.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To help you resolve your concern, kindly follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Start Outlook in safe mode. Press Windows key + R and then type <strong>
outlook.exe /safe </strong>and press<strong> Enter</strong> in the search box. <span>
Sometimes, one of Outlook's add-ins will crash and prevent your email messages from sending. To disable all add-ins, you can start Outlook in safe mode. If you can send email while Outlook is in safe mode, creating a new Outlook email profile should allow you
 to send email again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Method 2: Remove and re-add your email account in Outlook 2010.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Method 3: Follow the steps on the </span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Repair an Office application</a> article. This article is
 applicable in all Office apps including Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 4: Repair a profile in Outlook 2010. Here's how:</p>

    <title>Video calling on 6280 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tazzie2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video calling on 6280</h2>
                    Sorry if this has been discussed before.<br />
I assumed that when I got my phone it would be set up for video calling. Tried to video call tonight and all I got was no UMTS network coverage.
<br />
How do I get this to work on my phone? I am with Tmobile.<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />

            Indeed, you must be on a 3G (= WCDMS = UMTS) network to make video calls.<br />
<br />
The recipient must be, too, of course.<br />
<br />
And if the recipient is on a different network (different operator), then the networks must have a roaming agreement that also covers video calling between themselves.

</p><p>Hi I have a problem with my Dell laptop Inspiron/5100 &nbsp;XP - 2001,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">It all started&nbsp;yesterday&nbsp;when my Toolwiz Start Up Defender asked if I wanted to accept or deny, my daughter had the very same problem with her Window 7 laptop last month we haven't been able to fix that either, she accepted from
 Toolwiz as well it all said it came&nbsp;from Microsoft </span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">(you think I would had learned from her mistake...I didn't she didn't mention until after my computer
 did the same as hers that she accepted from Microsoft)&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">so we said yes then it asked again &amp; again along with more from Microsoft next thing we know we got the same report:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action. Create an association in the Folder Option Control Panel."</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">We couldn't open anything but regular folders I can't get into my User Account, Add or Remove, can't use the System Restore at all (it only gave my daughter the only option besides factory settings, it ask to set to last picture
 made none was made) Security Center or click on anything inside Performance and&nbsp;Maintenance&nbsp;folders to check for anything, luckily my Opera was still open so I was able to be online I know if I exit out I&nbsp;can't get back on, all my other programs will not let
 me open it as well &amp; I can't use my Comodo Virus Scan to check for viruses.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;I tried the&nbsp;</span><span>Open control panel &gt; folder options &gt; file types &gt; new (button) in the new window click advanced. In the file extension dialog box type exe. In the drop down menu locate and
 select application &gt; click ok but nothing worked.&nbsp;</span>Nothing downloaded can be run as well, I can get my cmd by using the Task Manager clicking new while holding down the Cntrl key, but not sure what to do with it yet,&nbsp;</span>the Task Manager Processes
 says it has a lot of things going on other than my Opera, Control Panel folder, Computer Management that I was able to open, I'm not sure to End Process without messing something up.</p>

<h2>            Multiple attachments &#40;e.g. 3&#41; won&#39;t make it to recipient</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a very interesting issue at our business. It appears to only be affecting 3 users. Essentially, when they send multiple attachments, only the FIRST attachment makes it to the recipient. So if the user attaches 3 files (can be any file type and/or
 mix - excel, PDF, word) then only the file that was attached first makes it. It is as if it cuts the others off. Yet I can send the same 3 files via my Outlook just fine and the recipients receive all 3. What is more interesting is that when you check their
 Sent folder you can see all 3 attached in the sent email. Is this some sort of setting I can't seem to find or what is going on here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!!</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply, but those solutions did not work. In fact I think those are unrelated to what our particular issue is. Please see this long thread which I believe to be the same issue we are having:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_win10/office-2016-attachment-bug/a20a346d-2875-4516-8ab1-0ed83faed24a?page=11&amp;auth=1</p>
<p>
</p><p>People are claiming there is some bug within Microsoft Office/Outlook 2016 with the recent updates? The Outlook versions suffering from this issue are Outlook 2016 with the latest updates:
<span>Version 1607 (Build 7167.2060)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any solution (or fix incoming)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Unwanted border one quarter inch around document and on each page&#58; How to remove in Word 2011&#63;</h2>
                    I am using Word 2011 and have updated it to the most current version.<br />
<br />
The unwanted page border does not appear until I go to Preview or print a document.
<br />
<br />
I have already tried Layout, Format, Page Border, None without success. No border appears on the small work area but does appear on the page preview and printed document. How do I remove it?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2007 auto deletes &#47; purges emails marked for deletion</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a weird problem as of today. I didn't alter any preferences in Outlook or on the mailserver. Outlook 2007 just started automatically purging emails that I have deleted/marked for deletion in 1 of my IMAP mail accounts. I can't figure out how to stop
 this behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><div>1) Once I delete a message, a strikethrough line appears.</div>
<div>2) After about 3 seconds the message disappears from the Inbox. It seems consistent with purging since I cannot find it anywhere. I do not change from folder, it just *floep* disappears from the inbox in Outlook AND from the mailserver (I checked through
 webmail).<br />
</div>
<div>3) "Purge items when switching folders while online" is UNCHECKED.</div>
<div>4) The Inbox Current View is set to "IMAP messages" and NOT to "Hiden messages marked for deletion"</div>
<div>
<p>5) I just completed a pst file repair with the Outlook repair tool. No change in behavior.</p>
<p>6) I just made a new pst file by deleting the mail account completely including manually deleting the pst files with it. After that I restarted Outlook and added the mail account new, no change in behaviour.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>6) I just <span>configured the IMAP account in a completely new Outlook profile, no change in behaviour.</span></p>
<p><span>7) Another mail account with the same provider, using exact the same details/data is working properly as it should (leaves the items marked for deletion be until I manually purge them).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have looked everywhere but cannot find any solution, very frustrating....help!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks in advance for any solution.....</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Greetz, Master</span><br />

<p>I am having the exact same issue, except that it is intermittent.&nbsp; I typically sleep my computer in between sessions, and about 1 out of every 10 times I wake it up, everything is working fine - deleted emails are marked in strikethrough and are only purged
 when I click to purge them.&nbsp; I haven't changed anything in my setup.&nbsp; I also contacted my email provider (Fastmail) and they couldn't find anything on their end that could be causing it.<br />
<br />
It's not only frustrating, it is very dangerous.&nbsp; Since the deleted items are immediately purged, it is very easy to accidentally delete something and not be able to recover it. Please help!!!</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2011 and Exchange 2010 Sync Issues</h2>
                    I have an exchange 2010 account that I setup with Outlook 2011 on my Mac. When the account is first setup it syncs and pulls in emails ok. After the initial sync it stops pulling in new emails and I have to clear the cache to re-sync and get it to update
 again. Any thoughts?

            <div>How many messages are in your Inbox? The most prevalent reason I've seen </div>
<div>for mail not syncing with Exchange is that the Inbox has too many items </div>
<div>to sync with each sync cycle (about every minute).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Keep your Inbox as clean as possible. I recommend no more than just a </div>

 Windows 7 is installed, and I'm using IE Version 10. Thanks!

            No, I enable in excel add-ins: Analysis&nbsp;Toolpak- VBA&nbsp; for data analysis and there is an option of correlation, so I tried to analyze data in a table and also select the "labels in the first row" because I had. But It continued to say that.&nbsp;

    <title>VBA Chr function for smart quotes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ariodante  say:</h3>
<h2>            VBA Chr function for smart quotes</h2>
                    Using Word 2010. I have a document filled with technical terms (one or more words in each instance) surrounded by quote marks. I want to change the font of each such instance from Times New Roman&nbsp;12-point to Ariel 10-point bold. I wrote a macro to find
 the leading quote mark in each instance, then extend the selection to the trailing quote mark and make the font changes. It'll find the leading quote mark OK, but not the second, if smart quotes are used -- but works just fine if smart quotes have been replaced
 by straight quotes. So though the first smart quote in a pair apparently uses Chr(34), the second uses something else. Does anyone know what that might be? Thanks!!

            <p>Ok Folks... A solution based on other treads all having issues with Dub-M.hotmail.com.. combines Entegy solution with the other recommendations.. this worked for me... but who knows</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Switch off WIFI</p>
<p>2. switch off data connection (or go to flight mode)</p>
<p>3. If Hotmail says synching.. switch off phone</p>
<p>4. switch on phone</p>
<p>5. Switch off&nbsp;text message back-up in messaging (tap settings in messaging to get setting)</p>
<p>6. in Hotmail folders select trash folder and choose not to sync this folder (expand menu at bottom of trash folder)</p>
<p>7. in Hotmail sync settings change server to m.hotmail.com</p>
<p>8. Switch on WIFI and connect to WIFI network</p>
<p>9. Sync Hotmail... IT WORKED</p>
<p>10. Switch on data connection (or switch off flight mode)</p>
<p>11. Hotmail STILL works</p>
<p>12. Switch on syncing of Trash &amp; Hotmail STILL works &amp; now back to original desired setting</p>
<p>13. Go for a beer... Most important step of lot</p>
