            Hi juggaletteclown
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general) 
<br />
<br />Note for Office 2013 and below - Please repair only if you have product key with you as sometimes it asks for the product key again after the repair.
<br />
<br />How to repair instructions -

<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi juggaletteclown 
<br />
<br />Are you unable to get into Windows due to this winpesh1.ini error?
<br />
<br />If so, Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the efforts which you took to get the issue resolved. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the frustration when things don't work as expected. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> </p>
<p><span>This issue can be caused due to many reasons. I would suggest you to run the Microsoft Troubleshooter to check if Microsoft Account is working fine.<em>

<p>

<p>
</p><p>* i tried the <span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=268424" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Microsoft Accounts Troubleshooter</span></strong></a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> which didn't identify anything wrong</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Not willing to accept the solution by Microsoft Support Engineer&nbsp; which is essentially reinstalling Windows, blowing out all applications, keeping only documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lots of other solutions, that appear to work for others, are offered elsewhere:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* ensuring microsoft account sign-in assistant services is running</p>
<p>* signing out of Microsoft Store </p>
<p>* create a new local account and switching to it and back to the Microsoft account</p>
<p>* turning off Antivirus programs</p>
<p>* and many others</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have exhausted all of these, but there must be something resolvable that is causing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its incredibly hard to believe that something as fundamental as Microsoft OS user account does not have logging or troubleshooting to identify issue.</p>

            I also have the same problem. The error code appears every time I try to disconnect or change my password. I ran the troubleshooter program and it said it detected a problem and I should try it again. It still doesn't work no matter how many times I run
 the program.

            <p>May be irrevelant, but I had this problem under Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this error message when trying from the User Accounts in the "older" control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to change my password by searching in the menu for "password". The icon with the key is the good one. That's in the newer control panel.</p>

    <title>Viability of 64 bit Windows re-install over 32 bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kaedee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Viability of 64 bit Windows re-install over 32 bit</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Acer Aspire notebook with the following specs;</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Intel U2700 1.3 Mhz CPU</p>
<p>* Bios v1.17</p>
<p>* VGA Bios Intel v1744</p>
<p>* Running Windows 10 Pro 1803 v17134.799</p>
<p>* 128 GB SSD drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>I resurrected the notebook from the back of my closet and in doing so I noticed, in the My PC Properties, that I am running 32-bit Windows on a x64 hardware. I know that I may not get a huge bump in performance by going 64-bit but at least I could bump up
 the RAM (currently 4 GB) and see some improvements, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several questions;</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Does it make sense to reinstall the 64-bit Windows OS or is this notebook too old/slow to attempt?</p>
<p>* Realistically, how much of a speed bump could I expect from a 64-bit OS and, say, 8 GB Ram? 16 GB?</p>
<p>* Although there is no need on either laptop, can I swap the "Pro" license from this notebook to my current "daily driver" notebook, which is running "Home"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, this notebook is a sandbox for me to play with, having said that I am not interested in Linux or Chromium OS as I would, ideally, like to pass this on to my spousal unit or child if I can get it a little more snappier (for ex. time from entering
 login password to operational usage of Windows is roughly 1 min).</p>
<p>
</p><p>KD</p>

            Hi I'm Peter an independent advisor, the 64bit OS gives an advantage if you have applications that need lots of RAM (image/video/audio processing, world/universe simulations).  For an average user to be honest it would have little to no advantage having 64 bit.  You'll also need to make sure your notebook is capable of supporting more RAM before buying more.  And lastly no you can't swap licences as each OS is activated for that hardware (unless of course you have the exact same spec and model conputers

            Hi kaedee 
<br />
<br />Honestly, you will not get a speed increase by installing another 4GB or RAM and upgrading to the 64bit version of Windows 10 on that system
<br />
<br />The limiting factor on that laptop is the Single core Pentuim 1.3Ghz processor
<br />
<br />No matter what other hardware you purchase, that processor will hold that system back
<br />
<br />Even though that processor does support 64bit Windows 10, you are best to stick with the 32bit, it is not as resource hungry . . . Sorry!

 feature can be 'unchecked.' That solved the problem.

    <title>Error&#58; Unable to record sound using Microphone. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> signevaughan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error&#58; Unable to record sound using Microphone.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title:</p>
<p>recording audio</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran the diagnostic "fix it" program I downloaded from Microsoft for recording audio issues and if found no problems but still my mic records nothing.&nbsp; I know very little about computers and my realtec mic test fine but does not seem to detect sound.&nbsp; What
 do I do?<br />
<br />
Don't know if it is important but I discovered this problem because I was trying to use skype but no one on the other end could hear me.&nbsp; I haven't used skype in about three months but last I used it I had no problems.<br />
<br />
And the mic is digital and was installed in my computer when I got it.&nbsp; It has worked fine for the last year, which is when I bought it directly from dell.&nbsp; I ordered it online.<br />
<br />
Here's to hoping someone can help me fix this problem.<br />
<br />
<br />

            <div>Hi,</div>
<ol>
<li>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue? </li><li>Which "fixit" are you referring to?</li></ol>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>Run the Record Sound Troubleshooter:</div>
<div><strong>Open the Recording Audio troubleshooter. <br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Recording-Audio-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Recording-Audio-troubleshooter</strong></a><br />
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>Perform the task mentioned below to enable the Microphone:<br />
a. Go to <strong>Start </strong>and click on <strong>control Panel</strong>.<br />
b. Click in<strong> Sound</strong>, then a new window will open up.<br />
c. In the new windows click on the <strong>tab "Recording</strong>" and right click in the winodow and click on
<strong>Show Disabled devices</strong>.<br />
d. Now check if <strong>Microphone is </strong>listed there and right click on it and choose
<strong>enable.<br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong>Step 3:</strong></div>
<div>Update the audio drivers and check if the issue persists. Check if there are any optional updates available for the recording device in Windows updates. Refer the following links to update the audio drivers.<br />
<br />
‘<strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly’<br />
<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</strong></a><br />
<strong><br />

<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links</strong></a><br />
<div><strong>Step 4:</strong></div>
<div>You may &nbsp;test the recording device by following the method described in the below mentioned link and see if you can record audio using this method:
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Record-audio-with-Sound-Recorder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Record-audio-with-Sound-Recorder</a></div>
<div>If this method works, then probably the issue is only with Skype.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            You asked:
<li>
<br />
Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</li><li>
<br />
</li><li>
Answer: No changes</li><li>
<br />
</li><li>
Which "fixit" are you referring to?</li><li>
<br />
</li><li>
Answer: I downloaded a fixit program from the following website:&nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/help/no-sound-in-windows</li><li>
The file it downloaded was named: &nbsp;MicrosoftFixit.AudioRecording.RNP.132269512249454980.1.1.Run.exe
<div>It turns out to be basically the same file you sent me to through Control Panel</div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>Both the one I downloaded and the one you sent me to say it is working fine.</div>
<div>So that was your STEP ONE</div>
<div><br />
<div>STEP TWO:</div>
<div>This process shows that the DIGITAL MIC - REALTEK HIGH DEFINITION AUDIO is my default device with a nice check mark in a green circle beside it. &nbsp;When I right click it shows that STEREO MIX REALTEK HIGH DEFINITION AUDIO was disabled. &nbsp;I enabled it and
 it is also now READY.</div>
<div><br />
<div>STEP THREE:&nbsp;</div>
<div>I updated the REALTEK HIGH DEFINITION AUDIO through the DEVICE MANAGER or rather I tried to but it says it is working and up to date.</div>
<div><br />
<div>STEP FOUR:</div>
<div>Still when I open the mic program to record it shows that it is not hearing anything. &nbsp;The green line that displays the level of noise being picked up by the mic is not showing any sound detected. &nbsp;I test it anyway with a few "testing testing 1, 2, 3,
 4"s and the entire time nothing registers on the display. &nbsp;Sure enough when I "play it back" &nbsp;There is nothing there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now what?</div>
<div><br />
<div>By the way, thanks. &nbsp;While it wasn't successful in fixing my problem it was educational.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please, now what?</div>

<p>Hey there JODO, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to us on the Forums. Are you referring to the short cut scenes that pop up on certain games or as you said when you complete a mission, or get a trophy?
</p>
<p>If this is what you are talking about unfortunately all this comes from the Developers and you will more than likely not be able to turn these off. I would advise that you reach out to the game developers to get more information on this matter.

<p>It's really up to the Developer of the game on if you can skip cut scenes or not.&nbsp; Some developers will make it to where you can press the B button, others might allow you to use the Menu button.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of them make you watch it the first time.&nbsp; They want you to see the story and the work they put into the cut scenes.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There isn't a setting in the Xbox that would turn these off.&nbsp;</p>

            You can turn off the auto recording by pulling up the settings on your xbox, scroll down to the "Preferences" tab and select "Activity Feed" and unticking "Share clips &amp; Screenshots automatically" to avoid further auto capture during gameplay.

<p>Hello Jodovalo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In game cut scenes or video clips most are unavoidable and need to watch them. However, some games allow you to skip them. Also sometimes in settings in game you can turn these off also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Let&#39;s talk about the &#34;Microsoft laid off Xbox support staff, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shadow of arman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Let&#39;s talk about the &#34;Microsoft laid off Xbox support staff, in favor of volunteers&#34; article</h2>
                    <p>I’m writing this to resolve some of the confusion/controversy&nbsp;caused by a recent post by Polygon regarding Xbox Support Twitter staff being replaced by Xbox Ambassadors.</p><p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/29/17406254/microsoft-layoffs-twitter-support-xbox-ambassadors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/29/17406254/microsoft-layoffs-twitter-support-xbox-ambassadors</a><br /></p><p>



As you should know by now, websites such as Polygon spice up stories to drag more attention to the article, as more views they get, the more money they receive. So some of the things you have read at the mentioned article is added drama to make it more controversial.</p>

<p>More drama = more views = more money.&nbsp;</p><p>With that said, let me start by saying that the Xbox Ambassadors had no idea nor any intention for something like this to happen, most of us don’t even agree with this decision and have had our voices heard.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p> 

Xbox Ambassadors have existed along side the Xbox support for more than 7 years, back then there were no “Prizes” or “Rewards” for participating, we simply joined just to help our fellow gamers based on the passion we have over gaming, many of us are still here for the same reason, we don’t care about the “Prizes” or the “Rewards” that have been mentioned, the great feeling of satisfaction when a gamer says “Thanks, you made my day!” when we solve a problem is just amazing and thats what we want! Sure there are rewards added now and we sometimes get some cool stuff, but most of us don’t care about them and have said time and time again that we don’t need more prizes as this program is supposed to be made of passionate gamers looking to help others because its right, not because we get rewards, for proof you can visit the Xbox Forums to see us saying this.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>
But why gamer volunteers? Well, Xbox support staff are locked behind certain rules and restrictions which we don’t have, that makes us have a better connection with the said gamer when we are trying to help them, because, we are just like them! We wake up everyday, turning on our consoles, having the same problems as anybody else, and deal with them. But since we already experience these problems, we can find clever ways and work arounds to fix these that the normal Xbox Support staff cant say or most don’t know because they are bound by certain protocols written for them and have to follow those. What we don’t have are the resources that Xbox support have, for example like the ability to do refunds, Access to account details, etc…

So the experience that we have + the resources that Xbox Support have is the perfect match to help out with all kinds of problems that gamers have to deal with in a day to day basis, And thats what makes this program great.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>

Another thing that has been said in the article is that the support agents “Trained” us to do twitter support, this is one of the added dramas I was talking about, We don’t receive any special “Training” from anyone, the only thing we have to get more knowledge of how everything in Xbox works is something called the “Academy” which is nothing like what the name suggests. The Academy is just a web page filled with quizzes that have been made by the Ambassador program staff (Not the Xbox support or the Xbox support twitter staff) and shortcut links to the posts available to EVERYONE on the <a href="http://support.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com</a> page. Its nothing special related to us! And this has existed since the launch of the program! The Twitter (WatchTower as we call it within the program) has only been launched for less than 2 years, which within these time frame again, no&nbsp;special training was done for us, its Twitter! What “Training” do we n

Only extra thing that we have is an&nbsp;ACE, someone from the Xbox Ambassadors Staff that we can ask questions of that we are unsure of, like when Xbox live is down or something like that.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>
I hope this clears out most of the confusion made by the said article, and hate towards us.</p><p> As I have said, we do not agree with the decision of removing the Xbox Support Twitter members and we are mad and sad about it cause it feels like we have cost them their jobs, and like I said, we + the official support is what makes this program so great, not alone.&nbsp;</p><p>

Also, take note that Xbox support at <a href="http://support.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com</a> is still available.</p><p>

Thank you for reading this.

            <p>After reading the article, I did feel that Polygon either a) didn't do their research about Ambassadors, or b) they just wanted to create drama and make it seem like we're causing people to lose their jobs which we're not trying to do. We're just like an added bonus to the Support team in helping them with questions or concerns because they do get overwhelmed with people and for the most part, we usually help them by leading people towards the right direction to get their issue straighten out. <br /></p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This could be with the <strong>CMOS </strong>Settings. Also check in the <strong>
BIOS</strong>(Basic Input/Output system) if the time is set correct. If you are not comfortable changing the settings in CMOS/BIOS, you may contact the system manufacturer for more help.<br />
<div><strong>NOTE: </strong>Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>Usually, this issue is caused by Windows Time service corrupt. You can try to take following steps to troubleshoot this issue.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<ol>
<li>Click Start.<br />
</li><li>Type ‘cmd’ in the search bar.<br />
</li><li>Right click Command Prompt in the list and choose “Run as Administrator”<br />
</li><li>In the Command prompt type the following commands one at a </li><li>time and press Enter.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a. net stop w32time<br />
&nbsp;<br />
b. w32tm /unregister<br />
&nbsp;<br />
c. w32tm /register<br />
&nbsp;<br />
d. net start w32time<br />
&nbsp;<br />
e. w32tm /resync<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Then, please restart the computer to test the issue again.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>

    <title>WIndows 10 hangs during installation on MacBook Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jerhx  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIndows 10 hangs during installation on MacBook Pro</h2>
                    <p>My son is inheriting my wife's older MacBook Pro...it's a late-2011 model, 16GB of RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Bootcamp Assistant to partition the hard drive and gave Windows 620 GB. &nbsp;I installed Windows 8 from a DVD I had. &nbsp;That installation was touchy...lots of hanging up on reboots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then downloaded the Windows 10 upgrade and began the upgrade process. &nbsp;At some point it hung up on a reboot and I now have a Windows logo with no spinning dots. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried rebooting multiple times. &nbsp;Once I got a message about "attempting to recover installation" but as soon as it rebooted it hung up again. &nbsp;Then I got a message a "preparing to install your previous operating system" (or something like that) but
 again no dots and it just sat there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several reboots later it finally booted into Windows 8, but as soon as I tried the Windows 10 update again I wound up right back at the Windows logo with no dots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To top it all off, something seems to have gone wrong in the process....I should be able to hold the option key down on the keyboard during reboot and bring up the startup manager to boot back into OS X. &nbsp;But that isn't working either...it always boots to
 Windows no matter what I try, and it always hangs up...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on how to proceed?</p>

    <title>Sequence for the maze levers in Buried in 5 tries or less - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> team klepek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sequence for the maze levers in Buried in 5 tries or less</h2>
                    
<p>Last night playing with a group on Buried, we attempted the Easter egg, but got knocked out of the game by a disconnect. Anyway, we were stuck on the maze for quite a while. Here are some things to note for anyone trying the egg, and helpful hints we didn't
 know at first.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The levers do not spark until all 4 are pulled. If you pulled a lever in the correct sequence, it will spark after the last lever is pulled. If you pulled it out of sequence it will not. So it is important to have all 4 players in the maze looking at the
 levers. We started out running as a group to find them and then nothing happened as some sparked but we were not there, only at the last lever.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Second, systematically, you can get the right combination in 5 tries or less. Pull the first combination&nbsp;of levers and rotate the colors for each consecutive pull.</p>
<p>Red, Blue, Green Yellow</p>
<p>Blue, Green, Yellow, Red</p>
<p>Green, Yellow, Red, Blue</p>
<p>Yellow, Red, Blue, Green</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If you are watching all 4 levers each time, all 4 will have sparked at some point during the last 4 pulls. Remember which order the lever was pulled when it sparked after you pulled the last lever&nbsp;and write it down.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Spelling this out, it means, If you pulled Red, Blue, Green, then Yellow and the green sparked at the end, then Green is in the correct location but the rest are not. So try again after exiting the maze and coming back through the ghost house. Then keep
 green at the third pull, and try another combination like Blue Yellow, Green, Red. If both Red and Green spark then it leaves you with only two to figure out, So switch Blue and Yellow and you have your order.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Most of the tutorials online are not helpful. Understanding that the switches spark at the end is much better than trying the 26 combinations possible and hoping you didn't forget one.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>As well, at points a lever will not spawn, and you need to go back through the house again to get it to respawn in, sometimes it takes more than one try. Yellow is most common for this but it also happened once with green.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Last, buy some Galvaknuckles and just hit the witches or ghosts with them. Saves a ton of ammo and you are never caught in a reload. Just bank the points first.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Now to take on the targets.....</p>

<p>Sounds hard. So what brings the levers out and where are they? And this is right before the target shooting. Are there 4 different locations to shoot the targets? Maybe easier if I just invite you to play zombs with me, LOL. :P</p>

<p>haha, the levers come out and are attached to the green doors in the maze. They appear after you go to infiniti mode and find the lever on the body of one of the players, then attach it to the guillotine once the round resets to normal mode.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>They levers are random as to location of where they are and where the doors are located. The hard thing was not understanding that the levers only spark once all 4 are pulled. We would pull a lever and look at it and nothing happened then search for the
 next. But when we got to the last lever, it is wasn't in the right order, no spark and we though we did them all wrong. so we were all mixed up. I tried to explain it better than what I have seen posted elsewhere.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Yes the targets do appear in 4 different locations. I have not gotten to that point yet, but from what I have read and seen, it takes a good 20 minutes to get the sequence down and not miss one. Everyone says go with the PDW, placing it in the church so
 you can just grab more ammo as needed. You start the sequence by tipping or tossing 10 dollars in the fountain you broke.

<p>Correction to my above post. You do not have to tip 10 dollars, just hit x to tip the fountain and start the sequence. As well, I tested the 5 tries or less last night, and we actually got it in 3. Process of elimination was simple once you knew how to go
 about it. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>As for the target practice, we worked on it for about an hour, and were missing one somewhere, when our 4th player lagged out. Guess we will try again. And the hardest sequence is definitely the candy store. The targets in the windows are tough to hit as
 you hit the window frames instead with the angle you are at. oh well. try try again.

<p>Hi there&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/3409ad64-4f16-4129-9d0e-a1e7cd029787" title="Toujoursjoyeuse5617"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Toujoursjoyeuse5617</span></a> and welcome to the Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The automatic answer call feature is currently not available on Skype for Windows 10. This was not a feature introduced when the application was launched.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One workaround I could suggest is to use the classic Skype for Windows desktop application. You can configure call and IM settings in this version of the application. To enable automatic answer on Skype for Windows desktop:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Click <strong>Tools </strong>and then choose <strong>Options</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>Click <strong>Calls </strong>and then click <strong>Show advanced options.&nbsp;</strong></li><li>Tick the box for <strong>Answer incoming calls automatically </strong>then click
<strong>Save</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>Restart the application.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We are collecting feedbacks with regards to the use of the Windows 10 Skype app on the features it can improve. Please don't hesitate to leave a feedback on the Community so we can pass it to the appropriate support team. You can also check latest fixes
 and update of Skype for Windows 10 <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34685/what-s-new-in-skype-for-windows-10?q=whats+new" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>A warning popup when opening any .url file in &#8220;Favorites&#8221;. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            A warning popup when opening any .url file in &#8220;Favorites&#8221;.  Why&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>When I open a folder or file-window and click to “Favorites” folder, then double click to open a .url file
 I get a windows warning popup “File Download – security warning”, “Do you want to open this file?”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This has been happening since the September 13, 2016 second Tuesday windows update.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This did not happen before September 13, 2016 second Tuesday windows update.</span>&nbsp;
</p>
<p><span>I get this warning with all the internet links or .url files I saved in the entire “Favorites” folder.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This happens every time I open any .url file in the “Favorites” folder.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This does not happen to .url files saved in other folders ( non-favorites folders).<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I also get this popup warning when I move a .url file from one sub-folder to another sub-folder in the “Favorites” folder.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I do not ever use Microsoft Edge or Microsoft internet explorer browsers.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I use FireFox and Google chrome variant SRWare Iron browser.<span>&nbsp; </span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My way of using the internet is to work out of the “Favorites” folder (file window) exclusively.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I do not keep my main frequent links anywhere else.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is how I use the internet.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have been doing this for years.<span>&nbsp; </span>The only way I access saved internet links is by opening a “Favorites” folder.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since this is the only way I have used the internet for years, it is very cumbersome to suddenly have warning popup every time I use a saved internet link.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This warning is so very unnecessary.<span>&nbsp; So, </span>I need a warning when I open a .url file to my bank web site or yahoo web mail or web site of local newspaper, or Ars Technica or CNET?<span>&nbsp;
</span>I even get a warning popup for all my Microsoft web site .url files! <span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I get this popup warning for every one and all other .url files in the “Favorites” folder.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is madness!! </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is not caused by a malware infection.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have very safe internet practices.<span>&nbsp; </span>I do not go to questionable web sites or do any questionable unsafe things on the internet.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I use Norton Antivirus Online and it automatically updates itself.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I also use a number of stand-alone scan-only anti-malware scanners and scan regularly.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So I do not need to check my system for malware and post back because I have already done that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>How do I shut off this silly and cumbersome warning popup?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I use my computer in a normal user account not an administrator account.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>I am running Win10 Pro on a i7 tower 16GB memory 2TB HD.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I vigilantly keep everything updated daily.<span>&nbsp; </span>Or at least every three days I check EVERYTHING for updates.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>

            <p>I've run into this problem on 2 Windows 7 machines today.&nbsp; Fortunately, it is easy to remedy.&nbsp; Open an Administrator command prompt and type in the following commands:</p>
<ol>
<li>PUSHD C:\Users\user_name\Favorites</li><li>ICACLS *.URL /L /T /SETINTEGRITYLEVEL MED</li></ol>
<p>You will have to substitute in the appropriate path to your Internet Explorer favorites for the first command.</p>
