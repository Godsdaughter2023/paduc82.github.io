<h2>            I cannot read my emails on Outlook.com.</h2>
                    <p>I don't know what kind of idiot you have working for you company but hotmail-outlook change in the stupidest thing I've ever seen!
</p>
<p>I don't need a new user interface, i don't need an on-line out look, i don't want something that can connect me account with facebook or give me social media updates........I just want to have and on-line email account that where i can receive and view emails.
 Hotmail has managed to do this seamlessly for the ten years now i have outlook.com and i can't even view my mails!!! Let alone search the information that i need. Great job!!! I present you with the underachiever award for the mentally retarded! &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hotmail do yourself a favor and go back the your original accounts that worked fine before the change! Oh and if anyone for the your company actually reads this then fix my account while your at it. I don't want to have to search though 2000 Q&amp;A's in some
 forum to find details as the right combination of computer, browser and settings to make this thing work (answer: If your working on a 'Packard bell' running 'chrome'&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;then go to options- further options - Advanced settings - calibrate - then change the value in the 10th row from 101090198199019 to 1988181818)
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Honestly, do it yourself! We haven't all studied IT! Make it work for people who just want a computer to work then you wont end up with so many complaints!</p>

<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand that you are having issues with Outlook.com interface as you cannot read your emails.
<font><font color="#000000"><font>Please be informed that one of the possible reasons why this is happening is that you are experiencing browser issues or you have add ons installed on your browser that can block Outlook.com to run the way it should or you
 are using an outdated browser. </font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><font>As our initial troubleshooting step, I would recommend that you optimize your browser, clear browser's cache and a temporary internet file to make sure that your browser’s setting doesn’t contribute to your issue.
 Kindly visit the article below for instructions:</font></font></font></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font>Regarding the add ons, you can visit the article below for additional information if you are using Internet Explorer as your browser. However, if you are using a different browser other than Internet Explorer, I would suggest that you visit you

<h2>            Use Domain Purchased Through Office for Website</h2>
                    My mom purchased a domain name through Office 365 Business for her business. She wants to use it, for now, to redirect to the business' Facebook page. Eventually, it needs to be used for an actual website. How does one go about doing any of this? Can it
 even be done through Office? It doesn't say anywhere what registrar Office used.

<p><span>Hi Porter,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Generally, the domain bought from Office 365 is registered at
</span><span>Wild West which may be a partner of GoDaddy. For checking where the domain you registered, I suggest you f<span>ollow the steps
 in&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/get-help-with-domains/find-your-domain-registrar?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(85, 26, 139, 1)">the article</span></a>&nbsp;to check it. As using the domain in a website needs changing
 the name servers and there may be no way changing the name servers in the Office 365 portal, I suggest you transfer the domain to GoDaddy via the GoDaddy support and then connect the domain to other websites.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your understanding.</span></p>

            You should have connected one or more alternate addresses or a cell phone to your account. &nbsp;It is to an alternate address or a phone that a password reset will send the code, which you then enter to verify that it was you who requested the password change.
 &nbsp;If you don't have those defined, there should be a "I don't have those any more" link that will allow you to enter an address.

<p>Interestingly, I did nothing - and for the past couple of days, I have not had this warning and have been able to loggin as usual. &nbsp;I did not change my password and really think it was at Outlook's end, not mine. &nbsp;Perhaps they don't want us having a Hotmail

            I, on the other hand, believe it was your Internet security suite giving a false positive and that the suite's vendor updated it (like they do every day) and fixed the false positive.

            If you made use of a numbered style, you can apply Normal style to selected paragraphs by pressing Ctrl+Shift+N. (Of course, to get rid of the numbering, you can apply any unnumbered style.)<br />
<br />
If you want to remove the numbering from a numbered style, but keep other formatting, you will have to clear the numbering from the style. In the Modify Style dialog box, click Format, click Numbering, select the "None" option, and then click OK twice.

            <p>There really is no way of knowing, if you usually apply numbering directly from the Numbering button on the Home tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get control over numbering, you need to set it up attached to paragraph styles (one paragraph style for each numbering level). See

            Likely you are black listed by Microsoft for spam. If you aren't getting a satisfactory answer via their automated system then the best you can do at this point is to change the IP address of your mail server and hope that gets you off Microsoft's black
 list.

<h2>            Issue in accept alert message in mircosoft edge browser</h2>
                    <p>Hi Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently working on Edge browser with Selenium C#.</p>
<p>My application has&nbsp; java script alert message at some pace, I am using common selenium method&nbsp; " alert().accept()" to accept that alert message.&nbsp; Other browsers (FF, Chromes) it's working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When try with Edge browser, selenium perform click operation on button where alert will appears (alert message displaying) then execution freeze that point.&nbsp; After 60sec it throw exception message&nbsp; "Timeout Exception for Click()". It's try to click on same
 button again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope selenium unable to change focus (index) next element that is the reason it throw exception message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could anyone help how to fix this issue in edge browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<div>Gosub is a branching command that isn't used in VBA. It's a leftover from procedural programming languages. It forms part of the Gosub...Return construct, so you need to search your code for the word "Return", then get rid of
 it.</div>

 to the next possibility.</div>

<p>Are we talking about a main form with only one subform. Main form based on Trial and subform based on Crime?</p>
<p>If you have subforms on the subform for Crime, for testing purposes, remove the subforms so we can&nbsp;get the main form and subform working correctly.</p>
<p>Once that is working fine, you can look at adding a subform to the Crime form if that is what you are trying to do.</p>
<p>Otherwise you the error may be coming from a subform on the Crime form. You can track down the error by adding one subform and get it working without errors before you add another subform</p>
<p>If you have only the main form based on Trial and subform based on Crime, and the error is hard to find, we can think of it as corrpution. To test this, create a couple of quick forms using the forms wizard to create the main form for Trial and the subform
 for Crime. If they work ok, then recreate your trial and crime forms.</p>

<p>Thanks - did the search and it found nothing. I've copied below, from my earlier post the info re master and child fields:</p>
<div>My main table/form is Trial, primary key TrialID. I then have a table/subform called Crime, primary key CrimeID, foreign key TrialID. The Link master field and link child fields on the Crime table are both TrialID. I then have four tables which are each
 subforms of Crime - these are Defendants, primary key DefendantID, foreign key CrimeID; Goods, primary key GoodsID, foreign key CrimeID, Shop, primary key ShopID, foreign key CrimeID; and Modusoperandi, primary key ModusID, foreign key CrimeID - on&nbsp;each of&nbsp;these
 forms the link master fields and link child fields are both CrimeID.</div>
<div>Thinking back, the problem started to occur after I deleted a command button (set up with a wizard) on the Crime sub-form - this took you from the main Crime form to a second Crime1 form containing one of the fields from the Crime table. I decided to move
 the field from that form to a tab on the Crime form and deleted the Crime1 form and control button. Could this be the root of the problem?</div>

<p>hi Jeanette</p>
<p>I responded to Graham's earlier post before reading yours. The Trial form with its two layers of subform seemed to work perfectly well when entering the first four records (which I did intermittently over a period of days). It only started throwing up errors
 when I tried to enter the fifth record and as recalled, I did delete the Crime1 form and add a new tab for the field into the form in the interim - would this have corrupted the form?</p>

<p>The quickest way to find if the form is corrupted is to create a new form using the wizard. If the new form doesn't give the same errors, we assume that the errors were caused by some corruption. Access forms do get corrupted while we work on them. To check
 out ways to avoid corruption, see these links:</p>

<p>I removed all the subforms to my Crime subform as you suggested. The Trial and Crime subform then worked without errors. So I added back each of the subforms to the Crime subform, one at a time, and they all worked OK too. So I don't know what was generating
 the 'GoSub' error message, but&nbsp;disentangling the composite parts and then recompiling the form seems to have cleared the problem.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            How do I change accent colours in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Upon upgrading from Windows 8.1, I can't seem to change my accent colours from which they previously were set (specifically, the purple shown in the images below).</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft forums. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I like to inform you that you cannot change the accent colors in Windows 10 Technical Preview. I suggest you to use the Feedback app If you want this feature to add to the final version of Windows 10. Just share your need in that Feedback app so that the
 developers can make the necessary changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back if you have any issues related to Windows and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>

            Actually the accent color is set according to the wallpaper, just as setting the window colors to "Automatic" in Control Panel. I do agree that the background color is great, although the foreground color is way too odd.

            So&nbsp; technology advances with the great Windows 10, yet we somehow lose the ability to modify&nbsp; certain items such as colors.&nbsp; I find this unacceptable. Not everyone likes the same colors schemes. They are limited at that.&nbsp; I&nbsp;get migraines and like to "dim

            Woah hold up there,&nbsp;the reply is almost a year old. The most recent Technical Preview build as of this reply (now called Insider Preview builds) is build 10576. The builds have evolved a lot more since then and please do take a look at even just the RTM
 build of Windows 10, build 10240, and reassess the situation.

</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the latest Preview builds of Windows 10, you have the ability to select 'choose an accent&nbsp;color automatically from my background' OR you can choose your own accent color from a full color palette.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you should consider&nbsp;joining the Insiders program and help to make Windows 10 more to your liking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p>Perhaps Windows programs can keep the options that they had in the past and then when they make a new Windows that is supposedly better, they ADD options and tools to make it better, not remove valuable options and replace with a vast majority of tools that
 are NOT valuable. We all know the money game, make new products to keep the money flowing and make sure that you use their add on and items.
</p>
<p>Perhaps if they did this there wouldn't be any need for some little Insiders Group. Sound like people with nothing better to do. Some people have to use the program to WORK, not to play.&nbsp;Every time a new program comes out, there is learning curve and it
 shows down productivity.&nbsp;</p>

            I think, that deprecated functionality of W7/W8 has been removed because its implementation on xBox and phones is costly or not possible (e.G. Windowing on a little smartphone). Our discussion is a symptom, that the "One Windows on all devices" is a risky
 strategy because no one gets what she/he needs, because the devices have their special use cases and markets.<br />

            <p>First off, thanks for the response I&nbsp; DO appreciate it, and thanks for the comments of explaining the reasoning.&nbsp; I understand. ........ I understand and don't buy it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no reason that a person can't change the colors. I had noted in a previous comment that I get migraines and looking at a bright white is a big trigger, and kicks my migraines in. If it were only me, then I could understand, however&lt; there are
 numerous people with the same issue and other similar issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had a migraine ever since Windows 10 was installed. I spent last night with heat and cold packs on my head, as I am this morning,&nbsp;trying to get a project out the door for a long time client.</p>
<p>&nbsp; There is no reason to eliminate the option to change colors. I realize that you can change a scheme and get other schemes online, but each scheme has its own color configuration. In this day and age it is silly to have to go thru this for something that
 was previously available.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have done my share of programming, teaching etc etc. and I don't buy the fact that this couldn't be done.</p>
<p>It is a streamline where we are being "cattled" down a&nbsp;path that others have chosen for us. Personally, Microsoft Edge is a joke and now every program defaults to this mess, but I am working on fixing this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Progress for the sake of progress is in fact, not progress. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time though, much appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Bing Rewards and Dual Language Support</h2>
                    I have (had?) gold status with Bing. I'm learning another language, so I did a Bing search from that language's Bing page. I can conveniently switch between languages via a button in the upper right, but I can no longer earn, claim, or see my rewards.
 When I try to go to the Bing rewards page, I'm told that it's not available in my country or region. My account settings still have me listed as being in the USA.

            <p><span>Hi Joe,</span><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span><br />
Thank for posting your query on Microsoft Community. This issue can be caused due to corrupt files on Play Store or due to Update issue. I would like to know if you encounter any error message while trying to access the application.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Try the below steps provided below and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Troubleshoot problems with an app:</span></strong><span> Please follow the steps mentioned in the below article to troubleshoot the Play store issue:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />
</span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> <strong>Windows Services:</strong> First, I would suggest you to check if the Windows store service is running. Refer to the steps mentioned below:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a)&nbsp;Press Windows key + R, type ‘services.msc’ and press enter.<br />
b)&nbsp;In the services Window, locate and check if the Windows store service is running.<br />
c)&nbsp;If the service is not running, right click and select ‘Start’.<br />
d)&nbsp;Also right click on the service and click on properties.<br />
e) In the properties window, set the service startup to ‘Automatic’.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong> If the issue still persists, I would suggest you to reset the store cache and check. Make sure you run Windows Update and install all available updates including the optional driver and firmware updates.<br />
Refer the steps mentioned below:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a) Press Windows key +R, type WSReset and press enter<br />
b)&nbsp;Check if it takes you to a store page which displays that the cache has been reset<br />
c)&nbsp;Now try to open the app and check.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span><br />
If the issue persists, I would suggest you to temporarily disable any third party security software that you might have installed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Important Note:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you
 should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

<h2>            Locking Cells&#63; Help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I want to make some cells lock if theres certain text in another cell. That way its easier to recognize where to go to. I want to use Data Validation to do this. But I have NO IDEA how to make formulas for this. So if someone could PLEASE show me how to
 do this provide them for me. Either would be greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what I need:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If cell C7 contains a word that starts with the letter L, it unlocks cells B10,B11,B12,B13,B14.</p>
<p>But if it's blank or contains a word that starts with any other letter, cells B10-B14 will still be locked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the only way to unlock Cells B10-B14, is if there is a word that starts with L in cell C7. NO OTHER WAY</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If cell E7 contains a word that starts with the letter S, it unlocks cells E10,E11,E12,E13,E14.</p>
<p>But if it's blank or contains a word that starts with any other letter, cells E10-E14 will still be locked.</p>

<p>So the only way to unlock Cells E10-E14, is if there is a word that starts with&nbsp;S in cell E7. NO OTHER WAY</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would really appreciate if someone could please help me with this problem. PLEASE HELP and thank you in advance to everyone who helps me.</p>

<h2>            Audio Devices not recognized after upgrading from 9879 to 9926, running in Hyper-V VM</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I yesterday upgraded Hyper-V&nbsp;Generation 2 Virtual Machine from TP build 9879 to 9926, and now I have issue that audio devices are not recognized in my VM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Host machine is Lenovo T420 running Windows 8.1 Pro x64, VM is also x64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known issue? Any help or guidance?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Of course I checked in Device Manager. No Audio devices were present there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue was resolved. Here is the cause and resolution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason VM was unable to connect to host devices using Remote Audio driver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I shut down the VM</p>
<p>2. I rebooted the host machine and verified that Audio is working</p>
<p>3. I started the VM again - and now it was able to display "Remote Audio" device in Device Manager.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Microsoft issues a &#34;unusual activity detected&#34; email for no reason</h2>
                    <p>I use Mailbird, it's a great program.</p>
<p>However Microsoft doesn't seem to think that, so every time I start my computer, mailbird starts as well and Microsoft sends an email and locks my account down where I have to confirm the activity to reopen it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This doesn't work at all, as soon as I confirmed that it's me on all the occasions, Microsoft eats an amnesia pill and the wheel keeps rolling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is so annoying that refraining my self from swearing in this post has proven to be quite a challenge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't even send Microsoft an email to address it, and I don't wanna call the **** either. Chat doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I make them stop? Security is ****. I wish two factor authentication was never even invented either.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
There are many possible reasons this issue is happening. To better understand and isolate the issue, we'd like to ask the following questions below:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your Email provider?<br />
</li><li>Which Windows version and build of your computer?</li><li>Have you tried contacting Mailbird support for additional assistance?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly include a screenshot of the message or the email to further isolate the issue.<br />
<br />
We'll wait for your response.</p>

<p>Email Provider? I reckoned microsoft? This happens to my hotmail.com and live.dk accounts</p>
<p>Using Win7, always updated to latest build.</p>
<p>I have not contacted Mailbird as I reckoned it was Microsoft having some issues in their end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The emails are in Danish, but essentially it says that they registered some suspicious activity on the account and I need to confirm my activity. But as I said, that doesn't work.</p>

<h2>            Nokia N82 WLAN Problem</h2>
                    Guys,<br />
<br />
Suddenly my WLAN does'nt work!!<br />
<br />
I can scan for networks no problem, but when I attempt to connect to one, for example, my home network, it tries to load p the web page and then returns an error message 10 seconds later saying "Wirless network not found" or something similar.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what's wrong with it...<br />
<br />
Any light can be shed?

            I take it you've tried switching it off, removing the battery for 5 mins and trying again? If not give that a try.<br />
<br />
Have you recently installed any new apps? One of these could be having a negative effect.<br />
<br />
You could also try resetting (try soft reset first, then hard) your phone to see if that cures it.<br />
<br />
If all that fails then you need to visit a care point/service centre.

Nokia support call center in India was really unhelpful, I visited a Nokia care center, he didn't have the latest firmware so I downloaded it and installed it, which didn't help sort the issue either.<br />
<br />
So now wondering who to go to????????? or WHAT TO DO...<br />
<br />
If anyone has a solution please do respond.<br />
<br />
The strangest thing is my WLAN connection used to work earlier :-( now it just doesn't!!!!! arggggggghhh

            So it's happening when trying to connect to other networks aswell, or just yours?<br />
What about if you temporarily turn the security off (assuming that it's normally enabled) on your home network? Still the same issue?

            Ok here's what I did which seems to solve the problem. However this could mean that Nokia's WLAN implementation is faulty. Please fix it, as it's a problem on N95 and now the beautiful N82 as well.<br />
<br />
Solution:<br />
Manually make entries for the access point, Then go to advanced settings and manually assign an IP Adress under IPV4 and also manually enter DNS settings. Doing both of this helped me to connect.<br />
<br />
The only issue is that when connecting to other public networks I won't know the gateway detail!!!! so need a better solution to this DAMN PROBLEM!!!! I REALLY HOPE SOME ONE AT NOKIA IS LISTENING TO THIS RANT OF MINE AND PROVIDES A PERMANENT SOLUTION.

 has a clue how to solve this? Perhaps, that is the default value, but how we persomalize it to&nbsp;the one we&nbsp;desire.</p>

            <p>windowsphone has this feature where it decides the appropriate volume on its own. For instance, a lot of times I have seen this message which says 'high volume will damage my ears' and the volume is set to 15 by the phone, on its own.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For good or bad, there is no way to disable this volume 'safety' feature. </p>

    <title>WM6 Email Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> muzll0dr  say:</h3>
<h2>            WM6 Email Problem</h2>
                    I'm using WM6 on the new Sprint Mogul.&nbsp; Been having a problem that's perplexing me.<br />
<br />
I use messaging with a Gmail account.&nbsp; The account is setup properly, it sends and receives fine, but EVERY TIME it sends/receives it deletes ALL the items in the Inbox, whether they've been read or not.&nbsp; Where I have it checking for new messages every 15 minutes,
 this becomes a really big problem as I keep missing messages on-the-go.&nbsp; I've turned off everything I can find to stop from deleting messages, but it still continues to nuke them, regardless of what I try to keep them.<br />
<br />
The only way I've found to keep them from disappearing is to catch them in the 15 minute window, then move them into a different directory before it does another Send/Receive cycle.<br />
<br />
Anybody have any ideas on this, or can verify the problem?&nbsp; Thanks!<br />

    <title>NOkia E63 All Software Problems listed, Ignored by CUstomer CAre to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> balajimcat25  say:</h3>
<h2>            NOkia E63 All Software Problems listed, Ignored by CUstomer CAre to reply.</h2>
                    
<p>here are NOkia E63 All Software Problems listed.</p>
<p>-- Picture Editor:<br />
You can Zoom, Rotate a Picture but E63 never allows to Save the edited Picture, Worst SOftware Engeering.</p>
<p>-- No Calendar Sync with Address Book Events<br />
Add a Birday/Annivesary event along to a contact, you will never see the event entered to Calendar/neither gets a remainder alarm on that occassion.<br />
Very Sad to say Nokia has very less knowledged engineers who are not even capable of giving a software which Rs 500 mobile gives with colors.</p>
<p>-- Memory Card COrrupted and needs a restart of MObile to recongise the Mem Card<br />
3 to 4 times a day and every time when you switch off and switch on You need to re-insert the memory card(which is supplied along with MObile by Nokia)</p>
<p>-- Picture Viewer<br />
Awesome, you cannot open pics with folder wise,<br />
Open a Pic from folder, delete the that pic, you will be routed back to Home screen instead of folder.<br />
What a Testing Engineered SOftware.<br />
and after encryting memopry card, and after decrypting i am not able to see pics on pic viewers.<br />
but can access to files directly going to Mem card folders.<br />
ENcrypt and decrypt are juts for name sake, not for functioning and serving the need.</p>
<p>-- Contacts<br />
Enter one or two char in search, Say<br />
Ma<br />
it lists out<br />
Mahesh<br />
Manikanth<br />
Martin<br />
Mariya</p>
<p>though i see the contact Mariya, i cannot scroll down to select that Mariya Contact<br />
i should have to enter full name.<br />
then why we need Search option, lets go scrolling down from begining.</p>
<p>-- Message Inbox<br />
Wow, Interesting Area,<br />
1. Just Say i received a message from Number 123456789, now go and save 123456789 as Balaji in Contact.<br />
Now get back to your Inbox, Surprise, you never see 123456789 updated with COntact Name Balaji, it will stay as 123456789 only, even give a try of Swithc off and Switch on 100 times, its same.<br />
its new nokia software getting back to 1950s.</p>
<p>2. Now, one more test:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You have already saved a friend number 12345 as Balaji in contacts.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; you get a SMS from 12345, well the inbox now promptly shows message from Balaji, now go back to Contacts, and change the number 12345 to any number,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; so now Contact Balaji's number is changed but you will never see this reflected in inbox.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; you will be still shown as message from Balaji, though that number is not at all saved.</p>
<p>One more roboustness testing:<br />
You delete the contact Balaji, still you see in Inbox SMS from Balaji.</p>
<p><br />
-- Wi-Fi.<br />
Even with dedicated Wirelss internet connection, E63 just detects the connection but when started browsing, i just get5 this.<br />
"No Gateway Reply !"<br />
you give a try for 1000 times you wont get internet brrowsing in E63,<br />
i get heavy headache if i start thinking why i paid RS12000/- for Junk.<br />
if i meet any of NOkia people at my office i will kick to them for sure.<br />
Nokia should be Sued.</p>
<p><br />
if i keep on digging the non-sense behavior of Nokia E63 i dont know, instead i can write a pretty good software.</p>
<p>Dear Nokia,<br />
I need all this and every software problems to be fixed, else i will go to COnsumer COurt,<br />
this is cheating All indian Customers, Taking RS 12000/- and not even providing a sofwtare which a RS 1000/- gives.</p>
<p>And if i wont get all this erros fixed by 15days, i will publish all this info at all leading weblinks, and will ask none to go for Nokia,<br />
because Nokia has forgotten what is SOftware.</p>
<p><br />
Regards,<br />
Balaji M<br />
</p>
<p>EVen after Several Mails to 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** i got mail as "All the mobile phones do not support all the features. Further, we endeavour to address any concern or suggestions that may be raised by our customers. We thank you for your valuable feedback and have forwarded
 the same to the relevant department for their due consideration."</p>
<p>i really dont understand why Nokia Customer Care perdonals are always so dump like Nokia SOftware Engineers, i am asking for existing features not working properly but they comment saying "All the mobile phones do not support all the features"</p>
<p>Again they say, if any questions ask at Nokia !!<br />
I am listing out the problems that your very high end Mobile Costing Rs. 12000/- INR which is failing to give even Rs 1000/- worth mobile.<br />
This is all the questions I have, again why should I have to go and ask the same at Ask Nokia" at&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.nokia.co.in/asknokia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.nokia.co.in/asknokia</a> ?<br />
once listed problems are answered again and again just for formalities they are asking ask question.</p>
<p>I want the Board or Directors and Senior responsible personals to attend to this, and get me bug free mobile for what i have paid RS12000/- else return our money, else i will soon file a Cheating case of not providing a said fetaures working phone by Nokia
 at COnsumer COurt, India.</p>
<p>Iam not the one facing this, just visit mouthshut.com, you will see people crying with erros on NOkia even after paying RS 30,000/- who's money is all this ?</p>
<p>I am awaiting for the response with bug fix by 24 hours.<br />
and also i need my money back by 1 week.</p>

<p>Nokia E63 has a name sake encryption and decryption. Once you encrypt and decrypt it is difficult to find any of your old saved files. Paradox is that the memory status will show a huge quantity of used space. But GOD only knows where the files are. Nokia
 support centres have no answer for this problem. I lost a large chunk of my pics n files. Shame of Nokia. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Cost2 and Cost3 not adding to Cost - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cost2 and Cost3 not adding to Cost</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a project plan with two types of costs and having trouble getting them to add up to the Cost column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cost1 is empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cost2 contains one type of&nbsp;fixed costs and Cost3 contains another type of fixed costs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've not used the Fixed Cost column as I've got two fixed costs to deal with. I tried for one, but it wasn't doing a rollup (Custom Fields--&gt;Cost--&gt;Rollup--&gt;Sum), and hence using Cost2 and Cost3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Cost column is correctly calculating hours x rate. What I'd like to happen is that it calculates hours x rate and then adds the values in Cost2 and Cost3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this do-able?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks...David</p>
<p>

<p>make a resource, call it "Cost X for Task Y", make it a cost type resource.<br />
Go back to the Gantt chart view.</p>

<p>Hi anniieam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you with this concern, I would like to confirm if you're trying to remove or delete a mail account in Outlook.com or Outlook application. If it happens that you're trying to delete an account in Outlook application, you can refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/remove-or-delete-an-email-account-from-outlook-1fa900ae-6dc8-468c-b754-10292f7ee47a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> for the steps on how to remove an account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you're using Outlook.com and you want to remove a connected account, you may visit this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/remove-a-connected-account-from-outlook-com-0b9a6b95-ff1b-46c1-bf60-d6b3b82c5ac8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> instead. Also, there are a number of possible explanations for why
 security codes don't always arrive. Read through the list below of the most common causes, and see if any of them apply to you:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Does your phone block calls or texts from unknown numbers?</strong><br />
If so, change your phone settings then choose <strong>I don't have a code</strong>. We'll send another security code.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Did your email send your security code to your junk folder?</strong><br />
Check your junk folder for a message from Microsoft account, and use the code you find there. To prevent this from happening in the future, mark Microsoft as a trusted sender. Valid security codes come from an @accountprotection.microsoft.com email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is your phone number or email address entered correctly?</strong><br />
To&nbsp;keep your information safe when you're signing in, we only show you the last two digits of your phone number or the first two characters of your email address.</p>
<p>To see if your security info is correct:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to your&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Security basics</a></strong> page with your Microsoft account,</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Update info</strong>.</li><li>You may need to enter a security code to get to this page. Choose a method that you know works, or choose
<strong>I don't have any of these</strong> to replace your security info.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Does your alternate email address end in @outlook.com, @hotmail.com, @live.com, or @msn.com?</strong><br />
If so, you're using one Microsoft account to verify another Microsoft account. This can make it tricky to keep track of which one you're signed in to. When you sign in to the second account (to get the code sent to that email), most browsers automatically sign
 you out of the first account (the one that's actually requesting the code).</p>
<p>To get your security code:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using a browser in privacy mode, sign in with the first account. This lets you stay signed in to both accounts at the same time.</li><li>When you're prompted to enter the security code that was sent to your alternate email address, don't close the browser window.</li><li>Open a new window in privacy mode. <strong>Ctrl</strong> + <strong>Shift</strong> +
<strong>P</strong> is the shortcut for InPrivate&nbsp;Browsing in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer. If you're using a different browser, check that browser's help for info about privacy mode.</li><li>In the new window, sign in to your alternate email account and look for the message from the Microsoft account team. Copy or write down the security code&nbsp;from the message.</li><li>Return to the window that is asking you for the security code. Enter the code and follow the instructions.</li></ol>

Do you get any error after the synchronization? What's the status text&nbsp;that shows up in the application after the synchronization?<br />
Do you have your contacts with any partnership with active sync/exhange?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

            No.&nbsp; I don't have any other partnership.&nbsp; It says that the Synchronization is successful. All of the contacts are still available online when i log into myphone.&nbsp; I deleted myphone off of my phone and put it back on and my text messages and photos synced
 but not my contacts.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I also noticed that on line it says my last sync was Oct 8th where on my phone it says 10/17.................what is up with that?

<div>Wow, I've been having the same problems as everyone else here with my T-mobile Dash. If I never did the mandatatory update my phone would be working fine but instead I've lost my contact list on my phone. On my web account it shows that
 I should have over 800 contacts and that's because it kept doubling my contact list over when it was trying to sync. If there's no answer than I'm removing this useless program and try something else...thanks Microsoft!</div>

Hi,<br />
<br />
In Web when accessing your contacts you can use the option "Find Duplicates" to find duplicated contacts and remove them. You can try that out.<br />
after doing this, can you try somthing, which is to archive all the contacts and the restore them all again and sync, to check if they are restored to your phone?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />

<br />
It covers the problems with contact syncing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Be sure your contacts in the address book are as "outlook contacts" instead of "live contacts". Live contacts are not synced by My Phone.<br />

Thank you,<br />

    <title>Odd size of an excel file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daveclose  say:</h3>
<h2>            Odd size of an excel file</h2>
                    <p>I have a spreadsheet (xls format) that is used to send about 20 lines of data back to me from a customer and recently I noticed it has increased in size from 38K to over 2096K.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried deleting all of the empty lines and columns but that does not help. I removed all conditional formatting - still the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looked to see if there are any macros or objects but can see nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried deleting all of the data and it saved at a smaller size. Went back in and put a single "x" in cell A1 and the size jumped back up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I save it in xlsx fomrat it drops to 346K or so</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on what to look for that might be the cause of this?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To resolve this issue try the following step: </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Using the key option Ctrl + A (Control Key + A) which will highlight the complete Excel file, try completely copying the contents of the .xls file using (Ctrl + C).</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Open a new blank Excel file and paste (Ctrl + V) into the new blank Excel file.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Check if the size of the file increases dramatically.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Test the above and let us know. </span></span></p>

            <p>Yes - that took the file size from 2096K down to the expected 36K.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have been doing this routine for about 5 years and when I look back at the history, it appears to have begun about 2 months ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm curious to know what might be causing this since it seems to be happening about 10-20% of the time now - not every day.&nbsp; It results in a much longer transmission time and takes more time link and import it into downstream applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

            <p>
</p><p>Among objects that may cause excessive Excel file sizes are :</p>
<p>- named styles (depending on the version of Excel you are using, there is a bug that duplicates named styles)</p>
<p>- named ranges (some of it may be hidden)</p>
<p>- external references. You can ask Excel not to save them on the next save by unchecking "Save External Link values" in Excel options (Options / Advanced tab).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can always share this file so it can be analyzed.</p>
