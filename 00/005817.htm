            <p>Yes. A Form is just a tool, a window that lets you manage data in a Table (usually via a Query). The data is stored in the table, and only in the table.</p>
<p>Change the table first, then the queries, and then you'll have the new field available to add to the form.</p>

<h2>            Problems with Spell Check when using Merge</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I create a document using the Mail Merge function, which extracts information from the columns of an Excel 2010 spreadsheet, the Spell Check function doesn't work in the Word document once the merge is complete. Does anybody know how to correct this?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            Why would you need to spell check<span style="font-weight: bold"> after</span> the merge? Spell check your merge document before merging, and if your data source has spelling errors, then correct them in the data source. A garbage in - garbage out!<br />

<h2>            Uninstall individual Office 2013 applications</h2>
                    <p>I know that there are other posts regarding the installation (or removal) of individual Office 2013 components (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.) but they either explain the obvious old methods (custom installation - not available for me; custom uninstall from
 add/remove programs - also not available to me) or they go on at long and very technical lengths about the differences between MSI installations and CTR installations and offer confusing and non-specific advice.&nbsp; I know from reading those posts here and at
 other websites that I am not the only one whose installation did NOT allow a choice of which components to install or uninstall - it's either all or nothing.&nbsp; So is there a solution for me?&nbsp; The one extensive post I read
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-office_install/how-do-i-uninstall-select-components-of-microsoft/d545daf4-2b9b-4c33-ae10-e325b278163a">
here</a> offers solutions that are prohibitively technical and most of which appear to be for Office 2010.<br />

Can someone walk a moderately tech-saavy user through a solution to this?&nbsp; I only want Excel, Word, and Access on this machine.&nbsp;

    <title>Hotmail deleting emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicolam_88  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail deleting emails</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hotmail account seems to be automatically opening and deleting some of my emails, with no pattern as far as I can see. I have 8 read emails in my deleted items folder right now, and I didn't open or delete a single one of them. Some of the emails are
 just marketing messages, but some have been from people I actually know that still seem to have somehow bypassed my inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I view my emails using Chrome, Outlook, and the Outlook App on my phone. Occasionally I'll see a notification about an email in my laptop's Action Centre and then I'll visit my inbox and it'll already be in my deleted items, so I'm not sure if that can be
 the cause. At the moment I'm inclined to blame the Action Centre but I don't know why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had a massive influx of spam emails recently so I had set up a few rules to automatically delete some obvious spam emails, but I removed all of those rules and this is still happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a very nice person from Microsoft remote onto my laptop yesterday to try to figure it out, and they weren't able to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else I can try to stop this? I feel like my previously-very-reliable email account has gone totally rogue on me!</p>

            <p>Hi Paola,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I either use my laptop or my phone, and this issue is happening with both of them. My laptop is an ASUS UX330 and my phone is a Samsung Galaxy S5.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first noticed the issue two or three weeks ago, but I feel like it could have been happening for longer than that and I just wouldn't have noticed because I didn't think to look in my deleted items to see what was there. I only noticed when I started seeing
 'new email' notifications in my Action Centre on my laptop. I'd look at my inbox to see the email (usually not following the link from the notification) and the email wouldn't be visible. I eventually realised they were going to my deleted items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to log out and back in but it doesn't change anything. The emails that were deleted are still deleted, as if I'd been the one to delete them, except I didn't do it. It's very weird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<h2>            Pictures in Publisher document will not print</h2>
                    <p>I am an in-plant and received a CD with a 4page Publisher document totaling 69MB. The last page is picture heavy and contains almost all the MB. In printing to a Canon C700, the picture heavy page does not print at all and shows no error messages, just a
 blank page.&nbsp; I tried converting to pdf and it also converts to a blank page.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used Acrobat 11 Distiller to distill and pdf, same result <em>and no error messages.</em></p>
<p>I asked for a new CD, and have the same result, so I am ruling out bad burns.</p>
<p>I tried condensing the files as per other suggestions in this Community. No help there.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am out of tricks.&nbsp; Anyone have suggestions?</p>

<p>Everything looks and acts perfectly normal up until the point where it hits the printer.&nbsp; Print Preview looks fine. As I said, Acrobat 11 Distiller did not catch any problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have also tried printing to an HP office printer and also an Oce 135 and neither of them produce a print of that page.
</p>
<p>Thought:&nbsp; I am in the&nbsp; Office 365 trial group in the building. Is it possible that something in 365 would require different drivers for everything? I am not using the Cloud-&nbsp;the applications are&nbsp;on my computer.&nbsp; Windows 7 64bit OS.</p>
<p>I will try to get a pdf from another computer. No others are connected to the C700 so a pdf will have to be the test.</p>

            <p>Did you copy the file to your local hard drive before you opened it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You said that you 'condensed' the file but if you 'compressed' the images then the overall file size would go down. Further I don't think you can compress the images if you were working on the file opened from the CD.

            <p>Hi David, </p>
<p>Now we are getting somewhere! Thank you!</p>
<p>When I use the File Export Create PDF, I get the page and I can print it.</p>
<p>Now, what reason would there be that it will not print from the Publisher file, not convert to pdf through Acrobat Pro 11, yet will convert in the PDF Office?&nbsp; I am very aware that Adobe and Microsoft do not mix well, but the fact that the PUBLISHER file
 will not print has me stumped. </p>
<p>( I will be getting this type of file monthly.)</p>

            <p>Dottie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Newer versions of Publisher can choke on large images. Did you try compressing the pictures? Do a Save As and make a copy of the original Publisher file to experiment with if you are uncomfortable with compressing the images. A 69 MB file with just 4 pages
 suggests you have some pictures that are way larger than needed. Part of the process of creating a PDF using the Office tool is it will resample and resize excessively sized images. That may be why you are successful using the Office PDF tool and not Acrobat
 or printing directly from Publisher. So create a test file and try compressing the images to no more than 300 dpi and then see if you can print directly from Publisher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, what kind of images are inserted? Any transparent GIF or PNG?</p>
<p>

            <p>David,</p>
<p>Rule #1... never work on the original and always work from your hard drive... check!</p>
<p>I had done the compression but the file was still in the 40MB range and would not print.&nbsp; It is a problem with the pictures being large but I cannot control that at this end, and it's much better than the 72 dpi they used to send me.</p>
<p>The export feature is new to me on this version. I was wondering where the acrobat title in the banner had gone. I will use it more often.
</p>
<p>They use plain jpgs downloaded from their classroom camera.&nbsp; It is created by teachers who are not very tech or design savvy and I need to do a lot of cleanup and tweaking. ( Can you see 4 different shades of red type in 2 similar fonts on a page?)</p>
<p>I normally use pngs whenever possible with Office products, including converting any pdfs to pngs. In an education environment, Publisher is the product of choice due to availability and price. However adding in any and all additional material makes life
 interesting on my end.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for the advice! Another trick to add to my bag.</p>

<h2>            Drivers on Windows 10</h2>
                    After a few hours of using Windows 10, my Bluetooth driver uninstalled itself.&nbsp;My keyboard is Bluetooth so I noticed it as soon as it happened. To fix it (finally after trying to troubleshoot the keyboard itself first), I checked under Device Manager and

<p>They did say that this OS is alpha - beta level (more like beta) currently. Plus I believe that by the way your saying it, it would be one of those new preview OS issues.</p>

            I figured. Its getting annoying tho, it just happened again. Except this time it didn't uninstall, it&nbsp;just disconnected all my bluetooth.&nbsp;Had to turn Bluetooth off and on to connect again.&nbsp;I guess this is something worth reporting on the feedback app.
 An issue like this can't be ignored. Just wondering if anyon else is encoountering driver issues similar to this even if its with other drivers/devices. We're going to have some interesting things going on until at least we get a few months into the Preview
 testing&nbsp;with some&nbsp;updates smoothing out the kinks.

            I haven't noticed any new patches released to address drivers on windows 10. my Bluetooth comes in and out. It just drops and disappears from the device manager then a click here and there brings it back. Yesterday something about the communications interface
 crashed. I noticed its name started with "Windows7.Communications...."&nbsp; in the crash log which I thought was odd this computer only being a month old coming preinstalled with windows 8. I think new Windows 10 drivers are yet to be released across the board.
 OEMs/manufacturers got the windows 10 build only like a month ago for them to work on stuff.&nbsp;Anything that I do that has to do with using any kind of communications drivers tends to be a buggy experience for me so far. Especially the modern apps. Facebook
 freezes like crazy (might be other compatibility issues tho as well there). I'm starting to wish I had waited at least until the build was updated&nbsp;to address the first round of major issues before installing Windows 10.

<p>So the bottom line is, no bt drivers for win10 yet? I tested Skype using only onboard speakers and mic and the quality was good. Possibly full duplex.</p>

Is that a statement or are you asking a question, if it is a question I suggest that you check with HP for updated drivers.

<p>First check with your network provider that you receive the network settings for cellular connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We have created also this FAQ:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select menu &gt; Settings &gt; Connectivity &gt; WLAN &gt; Available WLANs &gt;&nbsp; choose the WiFi network name you wish to connect</p>
<p>Select Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Configuration &gt;Personal settings&nbsp; &gt; Add new &gt; Access Point &gt; Write the name of the WLAN access point you wish to connect</p>
<p><br />
Select Menu &gt; Settings and Configuration &gt; Preferred access point — View the saved access points and choose the preferred WLAN access point.</p>
<p>Select Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Connectivity &gt; WLAN &gt; Internet Connection :Ask first<br />
you are asked for the connection method every time you open an application that requires an Internet connection such as Browser or Mail.</p>

<h2>            how to filter List Items by hyperlink column or MultiLineText value using REST api from Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>How can i build REST api URL to filter list items by a field of type Hyperlink or Multiple lines of text?</p>
<p>I searched for it and find only like this:<br />
&lt;url&gt;/_api/web/Lists/GetByTitle('&lt;list name&gt;')/Items?$filter=&lt;Field Name&gt; eq '&lt;field Value&gt;'</p>
<p>But this is not working for me!</p>
<p><strong>my url</strong>: mysite/_api/web/Lists/GetByTitle('roster Testing')/Items?$filter=MigrationSourceURL+eq+'&lt;a href="<a href="https://site/Test_DatabaseItems/0_c8832" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">site/.../a&gt;'</a></p>
<p><strong>error i am getting</strong>: <br />
This XML file does not appear to have any style information associated with it. The document tree is shown below.<br />
&lt;m:error xmlns:m="<a href="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/metadata" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">schemas.microsoft.com/.../metadata"&gt;</a><br />
&lt;m:code&gt;-1, Microsoft.SharePoint.SPException&lt;/m:code&gt;<br />
&lt;m:message xml:lang="en-US"&gt;<br />
The field 'MigrationSourceURL' of type 'Note' cannot be used in the query filter expression.<br />
&lt;/m:message&gt;<br />
&lt;/m:error&gt;</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Sudheer.</p>

<h2>            Can Publisher 2010 read Publisher 2003 files&#63;</h2>
                    I am waiting for Publisher 2010 to come in the mail which&nbsp;I will use on Windows 7. Will it be able to read files created in Publisher 2003 with an XP operating system? Just wondering if I should make any new documents in Publisher 2003 on my old computer
 while I'm waiting for Publisher 2010 to arrive for my new computer. Thanks!

            <p>Yes, Publisher 2010 can open Pub 2003 files, and the other way around is also true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pub 2003 &amp; 2010&nbsp;also will run on Windows 7 and XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With all that said I would keep copies of your Pub 2003 files seperate from your Pub 2010 files as there
<strong><em>may </em></strong>be features or formatting that does not convert correctly.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also copy the files to the hard drive before you try opening them. As a rule you never open from or save to any removable media such as a USB flash drive. It can corrupt your files.</p>

                    <span style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">I have a standard Excel spreadsheet that I use all the time to perform estimates. &nbsp;It contains several radio buttons to select pricing options. &nbsp;Today when opening the file the security option bar "Enable
 Macros" is visible and I select that option. &nbsp;However I can not change any of the radio button selections. &nbsp;I have gone through the trust center options, even tried enabling all macros, I believe I set the selections back to default, no luck. &nbsp;I uninstalled
 and re-installed Office 365, no luck. Rebooted my computer three times, NO LUCK! &nbsp;The same file can be opened and the macros active on all of my co-workers computers also running Office 365, so I am pretty sure its not the file - somehow something is preventing
 me from having those macros enabled on my machine. &nbsp;I have not installed any new software (other than regular windows updates). &nbsp;I have not installed any new anti-virus (although I allow McAffee to perform auto updates). &nbsp;Any ideas? &nbsp;I am ready to pitch my

<p>I am sorry but I do have the same issue with my HTC HD2 UK version on an non updated Rom ( same as when purchased)&nbsp;only I had to hard reset it since I wanted</p>
<p>to&nbsp;restart fresh with my phone and I do have the "No results found" with 2 apps "s2p, and Aloqa " all the other purchased apps do reinstall properly such as prince of</p>
<p>persia, asphalt 4 and others...</p>
<p>So I do find microsoft pretty poor on support with their customers specially after emailing the support twice with only the automated reply for help, GREAT!!!</p>
<p>maybe there is too much focus on windows phone 7?!!!</p>
<p>I would only point out that we would probably be your 1st clients when ready so you shouldn't treat us this way!</p>

<h2>            My Microsoft Account was hacked and Microsoft has taken no action to assist me</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Microsoft account which had Microsoft 365 and Xbox Live.&nbsp; I had 1000s of photos on my OneDrive account associated with this account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A hacker with an IP from Russia hacked my aol email account and somehow managed to send a request new password to my Microsoft Account.&nbsp; The hacker then added a new email address to the account and renamed my Microsoft Account and removed all my emails from
 that account.&nbsp; When I tried to subsequently login to the account, it said that the account does not exist. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent countless hours on chats with Microsoft representatives that say they are not in the right department to help me.&nbsp; There is apparently an account recovery department but there is no way to reach them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of this time... which has been 4 days... I have no knowledge whether my Microsoft account is still active with the Russian hackers using it.&nbsp; I have no knowledge if they still have access to my 1000s of photos and I have had no way to deal with the fact
 that I had prepaid for a year of Microsoft 365 and Xbox Live.&nbsp; In the meantime, my son no longer has access to Xbox Live and I have no way to deal with my account status and remaining Microsoft 365 subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has really dropped the ball and left me high and dry without recourse.&nbsp; Fortunately, I also keep a local copy of my photos on a backup drive.&nbsp; If I had trusted Microsoft with all my photos, I would have lost countless memories. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone who can direct me to someone who can advise me of my account status and if my account can be recovered and whether I can be made whole financially with my prepaid Microsoft subscriptions? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any responses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark</p>

    <title>Problem with &#39;exclusive access&#39; when querying SQL Server table - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem with &#39;exclusive access&#39; when querying SQL Server table</h2>
                    <p>I hope I&nbsp;am describing this correctly?<br />
<br />
I was given a linked table from our dba that links to what I believe is a SQL Server db/table.<br />
He also created&nbsp;what I believe was a Make Table query that created a local table to replicate what was in the linked table.<br />
The query was getting to a point where it was needed to run it multiple times a day to recreate the table to&nbsp;show the latest data, sometime 20+ times a day.<br />
<br />
I recently split this db into a front-end/back-end db set up, and gave copies of the fe-db to about 15 people.<br />
When I did this it occurred to me that rather that doing the make table query, I did two sperate queries in the be-db to the linked table.</p>
<p>Then I queried the queries in the be-db from the fe-db, essentially using the be-queries in place of the table.<br />
There was concerns that the queries were allowing read/write access so in the be-db queries I made them query the fields AS aliases to make them read only.<br />
There are a number of combo-boxes in various forms in the fe-db that use these queries so I have some vba code like ' Me.Requery ' in different places.<br />
<br />
Things are working great from my perspective, but apparently when it is doing all these requerie's it gives me 'exclusive access' to the entire SQL Server db; and by me they say me in particular, but I wonder if it is the be-db that gets 'exclusive access'?<br />
<br />
I need some ideas on ways to still be looking at current data, but not taking exclusive access to the SQL Server db.<br />
There are maybe 100 users of that db so when it gives exclusive access they get rather upset with me...<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />

<p><span><span>Well, of course if those make tables and queries are in the Back end, then you must be at some “time” re-running those queries in that access back end, and you can’t use, nor link to
 the queries in that back end from the FE.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>And you can’t link to a linked table. So, I am perhaps not grasping what you saying here?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now, perhaps you have some make table or append queries in your front end that you “re-run” on occasion to fill out some local tables (that may be in the be).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>However, I have to wonder if all this dancing around and effort is worth it?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the data is to come from SQL server, then setup the combo box, or whatever it is that needs the data to pull it from sql server and be done with this (you save world poverty by doing
 this).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As for stray and accidental locks by access on SQL server?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Yes, it is a HUGE problem. If you using:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Macro code (not VBA), to do updates, you often get locks on the sql server side.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>And, if you using linked tables or quires to sql server to fill out combo boxes, then again you get stray locks.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The simplest solution to all of the above issues, and also that of forcing the linked table to be read only?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Create views for the combo boxes on sql server side. Include the WITH (NOLOCK) hint in those queries.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The result is;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You not messing around with a whole bunch of quires and code and stuff to pull data from sql ever to update local tables that drive combo boxes. That’s just a messy approach, and you
 can dump all of those hand stands.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>And, by using a view, the linked table (view) from Access will be seen as read only.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So, no question, the issue of stray locks is a very nasty issue and problem. So, just in place of linking to the table, create a view on the sql side, and include with (NOLOCK) hint,
 and that will eliminate this locking issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Eg this:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>select * from tblHotels with (nolock)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would if possible simply eliminate the access back end if possible. The FE should be free to query the data from SQL server, and you thus eliminate the issues of having to maintain
 + update + mess with an accDB back end. There is always problems with larger user counts, and accDB back ends.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Get rid of the access back end – you will 100% eliminate all of the maintains and that messy linking to it. With your user counts, then you be glad you di.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You wind up with a nice clean FE, and your back end is now sql server.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Regardless?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Those append queries that you run also as you are finding is causing some sql server locking issues. Use linked views in place of the tables – this will fix the locking issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>And, as noted, if you update your FE to directly use links to sql server to drive those combo boxes, then once again, use linked views to sql server to drive the combo boxes (with the
 nolock hint). If you don’t do this, you will once again get all kinds of stray locks on sql server.</span></span></p>

<p>Thank you for your reply!<br />
I have been looking around the net at this for the past few days, and I have found your answers to similar questions on other forums, so thank you for taking your time to help us!<br />
<br />
Our DBA does not allow me to query directly off our main SQL Server database (I think it is what you call an ERP db?), so he created me the MAKE TABLE query using INTO
<em>mytable</em>.<br />
I am new to all this but learning as I go so I understand their being hesitant to allow that.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>To be clear, I removed the MAKE TABLE queries and am now querying the link table directly - there are no links to linked tables.<br />
In my BE I have the link table (to our SQL Server db) and other local tables, and two queries that query the link table.<br />
In the FE there are link tables to the local tables in the BE, but not to the link table to SQL Server; I am querying that table in the BE, then querying those queries from the FE.</p>
<p>There are multiple users (copies) of the FE.<br />
Maybe I misunderstand this - "<em>and </em><em>you </em><em>can’t </em><em>use, nor link to the queries in that back end from the FE</em>"; I have queries in the FE that query the queries in the BE?</p>
<p><br />
In the FE there are&nbsp;multiple comboboxes in various forms and subforms, and I am thinking that is where the problem comes from. I thought they were all re-queried with VBA, but it is possible I did some with Macro Builder so I will check that.<br />
<br />
I will talk to our DBA Tomorrow about creating the 'view' you suggested, but I am not really understanding what that is?<br />
Is a 'view' an object like a query or table, or what is it?<br />
"<span><span><em>So, no question, the issue of stray locks is a very nasty issue and problem. So, just in place of linking to the table, create a view on the sql side, and include with (NOLOCK) hint, and that will eliminate this locking issue.</em></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;<em><span><span>Eg this:</span></span></em></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;<span><span><em>select * from tblHotels with (nolock)</em></span></span>"<br />
<br />
Reading this - <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_view.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_view.asp</a>, leads me to think&nbsp;I would have something like this in the SQL Server db:<br />
<em>CREATE VIEW LocalInvMaster AS</em><br />
<em>SELECT * </em><br />
<em>FROM dbo_InvMaster WITH (NOLOCK);</em> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Then I would query that from my Access db?<br />
<br />
Again, thanks for your time!</span></span></p>

<p>A possible reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC. Remove all other security software from the PC.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This problem persisted for me with Microsoft Office 365 Business - my office is updated to version 1809 yet I still get the "File is open in another application" error.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I exit out of my local "OneDrive for Business" app and edit the file using the sharepoint URL*, then re-open "OneDrive for Business" it re-syncs the file back down from SharePoint and I don't get the error anymore. This makes me think that the "OneDrive
 for Business" app is someone messing with SharePoint locks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneDrive for Business is version 2018 (Build 18.151.0729.0012)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This feels like a OneDrive issue to me - putting file locks on. I expect it might clear up in future OneDrive updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* By "SharePoint URL" I mean a URL like this: "https://&lt;customer&gt;-my.sharepoint.com/personal/..."
</p>
<p>I get that URL by opening the file in word or excel. This puts the file in my recent history with the above access path. I re-open the file by using the recent history (instead of clicking on it in my OneDrive folder via file explorer)</p>

<h2>            remove company domain on Windows Store service before register domain name to Office 365 tenant</h2>
                    <p>Dear All,</p>
<p>We have to a plan to migrate my company email from on-premise Exchange Server to Office 365 and we found our company email already registered on "WINDOWS_STORE" as a free domain by "self-service sign up" function. (I guest someone have to use their company
 email register Windows store) And we need to remove this registered service before register domain to Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone advise how we check who register Windows Store and how to remove our company domain from Windows Store? Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Marvin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your advise. I already solved this issue via register Microsoft cloud service such as Power BI free trial, change user privilege to Administrator role and change registered company domain to another domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, now we can prepare our company domain for Office 365 migration.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Office 365 Scam BeWare&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dan schroth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft  Office 365 Scam BeWare&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a office 365 prescription for my new pc I proceeded to <a href="http://www.office.com/setup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.office.com/setup</a>&nbsp;as instructed and could not enter my key code after several attempts a prompt cam up on the screen directing to call the support number. After speaking with the Indian support specialist she asked for control of my computer which through
 flag number 1 up, she then ran file explorer and told me that my new computer had been infected with a trojan virus and I needed to purchase a $200.00 support plan so they can remove it and if I didn't she informed me that my computer would be useless due
 to any information would be going to a Russian hacker site thus Flag #2</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried asking several questions and received answers that didn't make sense they then went to a site showing the recent hacking attempts Fast forward I was furious screaming at them because they never gave me a direct answer out of frustration I talked
 them down to $100 one year support plan they then sent me a paper to sign along with my payment info and then turned on my camera and asked to be shown the signed documentation they then started downloading software that I was told was to combat this specific
 trojan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My technician was already on his way to my office to transfer files to the new computer once upon arriving he shut my computer and told me it was a scam and to call my bank and stop the payment he spent 4 hours wiping the programs they installed and one
 of the programs collected banking information!</p>
<p>
</p><p>All in all Microsoft has allowed this to happen and has take 0 action in protecting the public I am now out the money unfortunately the paper I signed and showed it to the rip off company gave them permission to steal my hard earned $100.00.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, I reluctantly us windows anymore only for my accountant and bookkeeper's preference my preference is a Mac zero problems no crashes no hacks no worries system upgrades are for free Windows and Microsoft are a endless pit of problems.</p>

I am a CompTIA A+ Technician and I (respectfully) disagree with the assumption that the PC, "may have already been infected with Malware" based upon first-hand knowledge of two Installations of Microsoft Office Home &amp; Student 2013.&nbsp; I (personally) removed all
 traces of Malware and/or Viruses within one-day of their Microsoft Office 2013 Installation attempts.&nbsp; Both&nbsp;attempts&nbsp;indicated that, "Your Installation was unsuccessful" and the Installer (subsequently)&nbsp;received Unsolicited Calls from people claiming to be
 from Microsoft Support.&nbsp; These people then accessed their Computers and then try to Scam&nbsp;them into purchasing a Protection Package.&nbsp;After realizing the Scam, both Clients called me and I (immediately) re-examined their PC's for any Malware/Virus threats (I.e.,
 there were none).&nbsp; In addition, both Microsoft Office Installation were (in fact) completed successfully!&nbsp; Conclusion:&nbsp; Somehow, these Scammers are being triggered by the Microsoft Office Home &amp; Student 2013 Installation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I am a CompTIA A+ Technician? What does that have to do with anything besides showing you have the lowest form of certification required to do the work. What the person said was correct that before they paid for the subscription they had a virus.&nbsp; So many
 questions about what type of Anti virus removal software did you use?I'm guessing you used MS essentials and or some bad A/V like micro trend or Norton. Was the computer put into safe mode and checked. Did you check start up programs and was the browser completely
 cleaned of add-ons? &lt;----- probably how they did it!

            <p>This afternoon I tried to enter my new office passcode on a new apple computer. I used the search engine to take me to the right site and at the top of the google list was a site called office creator. Without thinking I clicked on the site and the page
 looked legitimate asking me to enter email address, create a password, telphone number and the product key. Despite entering the correct code an error popped up. There was a live chat box &nbsp;and I explained the situation I was told a technician would phone in
 2 minutes and about 20 minutes later I received a phone call from someone who said he would check my system and see where the problem was. He told me there was a problem with the network and he would pass me on to the network technician. He used a system called
 team review to analyse what was wrong and said I had imported corrupted files through my icloud connection with my iphone, ipad and another computer. At this stage I started to get suspicious when he said I could take my computer back to te apple store &nbsp;to
 have it cleaned or take on a variety of support plans they offered. At this stage I halted my conversation and instantly got rid of any diagnostic software.</p>
<p>I am surprised that a scam to sell technical support (or blackmail) came at the top of a google search list</p>
<p>and a company which seems to have a legitimate website with public contact information about their owner, location etc would attempt to do this. At the very least they were trying to pass themselves off as Microsoft support.</p>

 number for Australia. After speaking with the Indian support specialist&nbsp;for some time&nbsp;he asked me for access.&nbsp;I was VERY wary of this however as I had come from the legit site and I had no files on my laptop I went ahead. He told me that my applications were
 corrupted and I needed to purchase a advanced tools and that he would get his senior technician to go through this with me. I immediately shut down my laptop and closed the conversation. I then changed my laptop password. I tried again to download office and
 this time was successful. BEWARE.</p>

            <p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>I &nbsp;too have recently had almost the exact same issue. Tried loading office 365 and was directed to the 'enter key stage' where the download failed. I called the helpline where an Indian man advised me of corrupt files on my brand new pc! He then asked me
 to log on with other devices to see if they were also corrupt. I stopped the call and removed anything that was downloaded during the call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the call is looked at the details of the call and the website I was directed to. I then saw that the key enter stage was bogus and not a true Microsoft site. How I was directed to this site I don't know but I have since downloaded the software as normal
 on another old laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the key point to note is at the key enter stage try to ensure as best as possible that it is a true Microsoft site before entering a key code. Enter the Web address exactly as it is shown on the software package regardless of what Google or any other
 search engine prompts you to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having my new pc checked for any possible corrupt software before I will go on to use it.</p>

            <p>Thank you Andy! I still receive calls from those pirates unfortunately I was a too late in recognizing the threat and they took my payment information and had stolen $200 from my account in seconds but was able to recover the funds with the help of my bank's
 fraud division.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beware of future calls saying that you had already prepaid for the service but I always hang up on them and I too had to bring in a tech that cost me over $300 for them to remove the software that had been installed!</p>
<p>

            Same problem. My mother purchase a apple computer and a subscription to Office 365. We entered the code and it gave us a support number to call. An indian gentlemen answered the phone and we went through the same process. This is a brand new computer and
 the number came from going through microsofts setup, so while I was wary it seemed legitimate. Seeing this thread I informed my mother to return the computer and have put in a claim for fraudulent action.<br />
<br />
So this seems like a pretty big problem. Why has this not been addressed by Microsoft?

            <p>It really is a bummer hearing about how so many people get scammed, but in reality it is no different than going in for service on your car. Any first time service request you should always be wary, especially if you did not solicit the service yourself.

</p><p>Know who you are dealing with and investigate the issue before committing to the first solution you come across. The OP got burned because he was too "lazy, bizzy, pre-occupied, etc." to do a little research. Always&nbsp;get a call back number, never give out
 bank info, get a company name and look them up on the BBB.org web site,&nbsp;this is&nbsp;a good start to validate legitimate companies, or read about scams. Ask to wire the funds to the company,&nbsp;some banks can&nbsp;pull funds back on the wire transfer.</p>

<p><span>From our smartphones (Verizon XV6800 - running Mobile 6.1 and Communicator mobile 2007) we are able to successfully use communicator - however periodically (perhaps every 15 minutes) we get the following error
 message "An error occurred.&nbsp; Please contact your system administrator with the following error code. (ID: 800ee008a)" - our&nbsp;Communicator Mobile client then goes "offline".&nbsp; We can sign back in fine.&nbsp; Does anyone know why?&nbsp; This happens regularly (perhaps every
 15 minutes.)</span></p>

            <p>Hi Seanie71,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your forum contribution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easiest and only way is by making sure that you add the same Windows Live ID as the primary account to your phone that you had on your old device.
<br />
<br />
Once that is done, you can access your account again and reinstall all your apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marc A.</p>
