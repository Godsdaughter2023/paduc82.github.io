<h2>            Change Brightness on Windows 8.1 DESKTOP</h2>
                    How do you change screen brightness levels on a Windows 8.1 Desktop? I have an HP Pavilion TouchSmart 23" All-in-one with and AMD A8-5500 APU Processor, and an AMD Radeon HD 7560D Graphics Card, running Windows 8.1 x64 bit. The charms icon does not work,
 the icon displays "unavailable". I also cannot change brightness with power settings. The charms icon worked fine with Windows 8, but when I upgraded, it stopped working. &nbsp;The room I have my desktop in is very poorly lit, and the maxed-out brightness level
 is bad for the eyes. Any way I can change my brightness level without a third-party application/program?

<h2>            Microsoft Edge, and all the apps won&#39;t connect to the internet.</h2>
                    <p>HI. so I see that my question has been brought up alot and I'm pretty sure I've read every forum on how to fix it with no luck what so ever. So, my question is,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>how do i get all my new windows 10 apps (mail, accounts, edge...etc) to connect? I try to bring up my new email app so I can login to my gmail and it says something along the lines of that it's not connected. Same thing when I try to use the new edge browser,
 no connectivity. I've tried going through the admin settings, and doing the scan thing and then restarting it and nothing has worked....Is there a way to uninstall Windows 10 so I can try to reinstall it and maybe fix the problem? I feel like that's the only
 other thing to do that i haven't tried. Also, I AM connected to my private house router and using the other browsers; thats how i was able to type this. Please Help! I want it to work so badly!!!</p>

            <p><span>Hello Jete,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regret the inconvenience you have experienced.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your description, I suspect that the issue might be with the blocking or might be with the Windows Sockets. If your PC is running with any third party Antivirus software, then ensure
 that it shouldn't be blocking them. Also check with the Windows Firewall settings to make sure everything is fine.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem still persist try to execute the below command and see if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>* Right-click on Start menu and select Command Prompt (Admin) from the context Menu.</span></p>
<p><span>* Type or Copy/Paste the below command into it and hit Enter Key</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(93, 93, 93, 1)">Netsh winsock reset</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: rgba(93, 93, 93, 1)"><br />
</span></em></strong><span style="color: rgba(93, 93, 93, 1)">* Now Reboot your PC and see if everything work fine.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(93, 93, 93, 1)">The above command will reset
</span><span>Windows Sockets and restores it to their default. By this most probably issue will resolve.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(93, 93, 93, 1)">Keep us posted if you require further assistance.</span></p>

            <p>Firstly, thank you for the quick reply back. However, and unfortunately, none of your suggestions worked. I even completey turned off my firewall just in case I was missing something. Any idea as to what it would say so i know I have the right box checked
 to keep it unblocked? I checked the actual "Microsoft Edge" box but it still wont let me on. And I couldnt find a box for the mail app because im not sure what it would say. I cant even log into my microsft account via app. I also reinstalled windows 10 just
 to see if it would make a difference and it hadnt. Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I feel like ive tried everything :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Rugby Challenge - the world cup is upon us&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Stoked to hear about this game yesterday!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so who's keen for this, i know with recent goings on in Australian rugby some of ya'll might be a bit upset by the whole concept of Union at the moment but... lol</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I played the recent league game by these guys, and was not impressed. still pretty certain that the best Rugby game ever made was Jonah Lomu Rugby and World Championship Rugby was pretty decent but looking at the trailer this gamer has some pretty decent
 polish to it... fingers crossed it turns out all right, but as with any kiwi gamer this is a must purchase.</p>

<p>The Offical Rugby World Cup game, which looks like rubbish and doesn't even have the licences for the Wallabies or All Blacks.
<a href="http://au.xbox360.ign.com/articles/118/1189590p1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Review by IGN.</a></p>

<p>Wallabies Rugby Challenge <a href="http://www.jbhifi.com.au/games/wallabies-rugby-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I will be getting Rugby Challenge for sure. Tri-Nations, Super 15 ... yes please!</p>

<p>Yeah the official rugby world cup game has the demo on market place at the moment and it is woeful. I have played it a few times and it gets very monotonous very quickly. All you have to do is pass until a player runs into a gap then rinse and repeat until
 you score.</p>
<p>I wont be buying that one. This is the first I have heard of wallabies rugby challenge, I will have to check that one out. Hopefully it gets a demo too.</p>

<p>World Cup game is pretty bad, plays like the old Rugby 08 on the PS2 (Graphics are pretty much the same too) and not to mention the lack of team licenses is very annoying! Can't wait for Rugby Challenge though!</p>

<p>So guys I have been doing a bit of hunting and ... it seems EB are going to started selling Rugby Challenge tomorrow (02/09/11). I called JB and they aren't selling to the 8th ... however, if they get the stock in today or tomorrow they will start selling
 it. I refuse to buy from EB because they're are total rip offs. Here's hoping JB get it in. Will keep you up to date.</p>

            <p>Hi PedroCMCE,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. Let me assist you with your inquiry regarding the location of the files created from Movie Maker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Movie Maker uses this folder to store the temporary files:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>C:\Users\%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Temp</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if you have other questions regarding the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. I understand how frustrating this must be. If you are still unable to see or find the file, it might be deleted. In order to have the official copy of the webcam record, it is required to save it after you record it. Since you are
 not able to finish recording it causing the file not to be saved, there's no chance recovering it because the only way to recovery the file is from the Temp folder.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we can suggest is to double check your Temp folder and then sort by date. If you are still unable to find it, again, there's no chanced of recovering it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>If you have further questions, please let us know.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Regards.</font></p>

            I'm not worried about the file being missing, I just want the space back. The tablet has only a 64GB HD, so all space is necessary. I have checked by sorting by date

            Hello Pedro,
<div><br />
<div>We have simulated your issue and verified that the file that Movie Maker creates when the project is not yet finished/recording a movie is a .TMP file. However, the file will be automatically deleted once you've closed Movie Maker. It is also possible
 that there are programs on your background like antivirus software, or updates within your operating system that caused the decrease in your storage.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you still cannot determine the cause of the decrease of your hard drive, we suggest that you create a separate thread within the link below:</div>

<h2>            Problems with Windows Update in Windows 10 - STILL&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Windows Update is stuck. It's been stuck for 3 days now. Ran the Update Troubleshooter but it couldn't identify the problem. Now I know if I get a reply from a Microsoft tech it will be full of complicated maneuvers. THAT'S NOT MY JOB! Besides, upgrading
 to Windows 10 really slowed down the shut down and startup. And my PC has a hybrid drive with solid state just for startup! Thank you Microsoft, you've managed to fail AGAIN!

            <p>I upgraded two computers from 8.1 to WIN10. BIG MISTAKE! After the upgrade I got the repeating "there's a problem" screen. I went to my trusty Kindle and started research. Many articles said one of the biggest issues was problems with drivers. I found one
 article that the upgrade had problems with ESET security sw driver. I finally was able to get one of my pcs to boot in safe mode and uninstalled my security sw. When I rebooted the WIN10 upgrade completed. The other pc I couldn't get to boot even in safe mode,
 just kept getting the same STUPID and UNINFORMATIVE message. I even attempted to boot from an 8.1 USB recovery media. I&nbsp; had to take this pc to have a full copy of WIN10 installed on it. Cost me $200. THANKS ALOT MICROSOFT!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>MICROSOFT when your upgrade has problems why not put out a real, unambiguous, informative message? A message that says "there's a problem" is as informative as a fart in a hurricane! If the issue is a driver issue why not say what driver is the issue and
 let users start real research and problem solving? </p>
<p>
</p><p>When the Microsoft "techies" give these long winded help that won't work if you can't get the machine to boot, it gives users another reason to dislike Microsoft in a very big way. GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER!!!!</p>

    <title>Xbox 360 Family Settings not working with Netflix App - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> avistettoxbox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 Family Settings not working with Netflix App</h2>
                    
<p>In the Family Settings for my Xbox, I have set the restrictions so that some content is limited unless the pass code is entered. For example, R-rated movies are not allowed.</p>
<p>This works well with most of the streaming services. For example with Hulu or Amazon Prime, I can start the app and browse available movies. R-rated movies show with a grey box instead of the movie's image, and a pass code has to be entered to watch the
 movie.</p>
<p>Netflix also used to work this way. However, since November (when the Netflix was updated)<span><strong> I cannot even start the Netflix app without entering the Family Safety pass code</strong></span>. It is as if Xbox views
 the Netflix app itself as restricted content rather than the individually streamed videos.&nbsp;Furthermore, once the code it entered to start the app, all content is available. This pretty much defeats the functionality of the Xbox Family Settings, not to mention
 the annoyance of needing to enter the pass code every time one of the kids wants to watch a video on Netflix. The only other option is to turn Family Safety off - for ALL applications. If possible, I would be willing to add Netflix to the "game exceptions"
 list so that Family Safety continues to work for everything else, but alas, that option doesn't present itself.<br />
<br />
I have contacted Netflix about this issue, and they deny responsibility and blame Microsoft. I am 99% sure that the deficiency is in the Netflix app (since it worked before the update, and other apps work correctly). However, I thought I would post here to
 see if there is any glimmer of a resolution to this issue from the Xbox side.</p>
<p>Is there any hope of this bug getting fixed by Microsoft (or is there even a bug being tracked by Microsoft) anytime soon? Barring that, is there any way to work around the issue?</p>

<p>I am also having this issue and it is causing difficulties with my two children. &nbsp;I do not see that I can even add Netflix to my exceptions list to bypass the safety pass code entry. &nbsp;I don't actually see where I can add anything to my exceptions list anymore...

    <title>Win 10 display driver update causes permanent black screen before and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oldaxman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 display driver update causes permanent black screen before and after login</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>have had this problem since 21/2/19 and am tearing my hair out trying to resolve it.</p>
<p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>Windows 10 Home edition 1809 gives me black screen before login, after the system HP logo splash screen.</p>
<p>Booting in safe mode lets me use the default MS VGA driver and the screen works fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to the latest driver update, the machine has worked fine.</p>
<p>I can access the PC when the black screen problem is there using realVNC server and client from a tablet. No errors displayed, don't know where to look for driver / update error logs if any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hardware is HP Pavilion 550-253na desktop with external Samsung S22D300 monitor.</p>
<p>Graphics device&nbsp; is shown as&nbsp; Intel HD Graphics 530 in device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Home 1809 ver 17763.316</p>
<p>Got the feature update to 1809 on 11/2/19, with a quality update on 21/2/19.</p>
<p>The driver that causes the black screen seems to be&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intel Corporation - Display - 11/19/2018 12:00:00 AM - 25.20.100.6446</p>
<p>Which Windows Update wants to reinstall as soon as I remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used DDU utility to completely remove the Intel display driver from my system in safe mode, and the system works in normal mode with the default MS VGA driver.</p>
<p>I have now prevented Windows automatically replacing the VGA driver by setting my active hours as long as I can, and turning the PC off outside those hours. I have also set "I will decide" option for Manufacturer's software in System properties.</p>
<p>As this is a Home edition, there doesn't seem anyway to actually disable or postpone driver updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I let&nbsp; Windows Update reinstall the above driver, I get immediate black screen during the update and then permanent black screen until I go into safe mode and remove the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I simply uninstall the bad driver in device manager using realVNC remotely while black screen is there, the black screen problem returns AFTER login as soon as Windows 10 (Not Update) finds a local "better driver" and reinstalls the bad one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling updates as far back as the quality update and everything since and it makes no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed the steps in Microsoft's "solving black screen issues" support article, and it makes no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have referred this to HP support and am getting nowhere.</p>
<p>They have a later driver, 25/2/2019 25.20.100.6577, but that also causes the black screen problem. They have so far referred me back to HP, who don't seem engaged.</p>
<p>The latest driver on the HP site is the failing 6446 one, which it lists as being for build 1803. Nothing listed for 1809.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Intel site has information about changing to new DCH drivers, which may be something to with this, but I don't know what drivers I would need to install to get a matching set, as it were, if Windows 10 can't achiever that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry this is so long, but I wanted to put as much information in to see if anyone can resolve this, or at least identify what the likely cause is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Hi  OldAxMan 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What I would do is block and hide the offending driver.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.       
        </p>

<p>Andre,&nbsp; thank you for the quick reply.</p>
<p>the kb your link takes me to says the troubleshooter that lets me block drivers is for Win 10 1511 or earlier. It doesn't list one for 1607 or later... (unless I misunderstand the way the article is written.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>All it says for 1607 is use rollback driver in device manager. That doesn't work because the Feature update obliterated all old drivers so there's nothing to roll back to, and even if it did, surely update would just find the newer one again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had been to that article before, but didn't try downloading the troubleshooter because of the version.<br />
</p>
<p>Is the same download valid for my Windows 10 build 1809?</p>

<p>O.k., I ran that version, and it showed me the Intel updates, and two others that aren't shown in Update &amp; Security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hid the Intel driver updates, but Update and security is still showing them as "Pending Install", and saying "We'll automatically install updates when you aren't using your device, or you can install them now if you want."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two other updates shown by the troubleshooter are :</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Silverlight (KB4481252)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>2019-02 Cumulative update for .NET framework 3.5 and 4.7.2 for Windows 10 version 1809 for x64 (KB4486553)</p>
<p>
</p><p>These do NOT appear in the Update and security pending updates list or in my installed updates list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has Update got confused?</p>

<p>I have manually downloaded and successfully installed the two updates that the troubleshooter showed but Update &amp; Security didn't. (KB4481252 Silverlight and KB4486553 .Net Framework update 2019-02). Update &amp; Security now lists them as installed today in
 update history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two Intel drivers that were listed by Update &amp; Security as "Pending" that I hid using the troubleshooter did NOT install, which is what we want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment, the PC is running with the default MS VGA Display driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, the display driver updates will remain hidden and I won't get pestered now to reinstall them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I still have the original problem of the black screen when I do install the "latest" HP/Intel display driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this stage, Intel and HP have come back to me with some suggestions for other drivers to rty, which I will experiment with later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will come back to this thread if I get a successful solution, or if I am still stuck.</p>

<p>Hi OldAxMan,</p>
<p>I have same problems with a complete different system since 21.02.2019, with the Windows update, graphic drivers update.</p>
<p>I have two notebooks, HP 355 G2 with Radeon R5 M240 graphics. It happened on both laptops, same as on your machine.</p>
<p>After driver installation from Windows update I got black screens and freeze of the machine. With restart in safe mode, and installation of windows basic graphic driver I could use the machine for some moments. The windows update installed the bad driver
 again, with the result of black screen and freeze again.</p>
<p>I used troubleshooter… nothing. I tried AMD latest driver package Adrenalin 2019, after restart black screen and freeze again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before 21.02.2019 I had a stable system with stable drivers for my Radeon R5 M240 graphic. Now I have an unstable system on two laptops, just with a basic driver from 2006, and can not use my extended graphics card, for HDMI streaming on TV and others.</p>
<p>The problem is definitely caused with the Microsoft Update of the bad drivers installation. No wonder if desktop PC or laptop, or Intel or AMD graphic cards. And I didn't found a way, to return to my old drivers.</p>
<p>I already found the hide drivers program earlier, and stopped the automatic updates. But now I want my stable system back ! Please Microsoft deliver correct drivers for all machines and no corrupt drivers, no trash !</p>
<p>

<p>It is no comfort to you I know, but at least we are not alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the drivers Intel have offered me, and they all cause the black screen problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something definitely went wrong around 21/2/19, but I am no nearer finding what.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to be to do with the new DCH drivers, but I can't pin down where.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still running with the default MS VGA driver. Everything else produces the black screen.</p>

<p>Hi OldAxMan,</p>
<p>thank you for your quick reply.</p>
<p>From Microsoft I feel to stay very alone. There is no help at all.</p>
<p>You are right, we are not alone. I think thousands of PC and laptop users are in trouble with 21.02.2019 Microsoft update for graphics. It is not defective machines, if the systems are totally different. Intel... AMD... desktop… and notebooks. It is trash
 or corrupt drivers from Microsoft.</p>
<p>On one of my laptops I already spent hours and hours, to find a solution. I did a clean install, and lost all of my data, before I realized, it was needless, to wipe the complete system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With all my searches, I found a Microsoft Update catalogue, with elderly drivers. It shows for me 56 drivers for my AMD Radeon R5 M240 between 2015 and 2017. Maybe I try some of them on the weekend and test, if any of them maybe works better than the Microsoft
 basic driver from 2006.</p>
<p>
</p><p>www.catalog.update.microsoft.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you find anything for your&nbsp;<span>Intel HD Graphics 530. Please watch out for difference in AMD64 or Intel x86 processors.</span></p>

<li>Get a install file I can put on a flash drive to go install manually on each Register.
</li><li>Get the IP address the Microsoft Update install file is coming from to allow it on my network.

<h2>            rundll32.exe Errors</h2>
                    
<p>Vista HP 32bit. Errors pertaining to Windows Host Process and rundll32 closing, a program causing Windows Explorer to close... automatic searches for solution (not found)... even after acknowledging error messages, error pops up again, and again, and again
 ad infinitum. Having perused many Help postings (Microsoft and Google searches) have tried the following: As Administrator, have run sfc under Safe Mode - Command Prompt (some files were not repaired but the Log is denied me); I use regular antimalware/antivirus
 apps; have tried to replace rundll32 from Safe Mode cmd (access denied); have uninstalled (albeit in slow motion) all recent software installs and some drivers... the error pops up so I can hardly run ANY app. The computer was working well one day and acting
 up the next during routine use. System restore unavailable for longer back than time of error (not sure how THAT happened); Vista repair from DVD not helpful. System will run OK in Safe Mode.</p>

I think the clean install is the way I'll go... too bad though - the computer was set up so nicely. I really can't think why the rundll32 got messed up... any ideas for future reference?<br />

            I have no idea.&nbsp; It probably just got corrupted (that can happen to any file but it happened to one that's particularly important).&nbsp; All you can do to prevent that sort of thing is simple maintenance.&nbsp; Here are some suggestions:

<h3> netriderlives  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creators Update Compatable problems with Intel Mobile Processor Atom x5-Z8500</h2>
                    I have a...
<p>Dell Venue 8 Pro Model 5855<br />
Intel Mobile Processor Atom x5-Z8500 1.44 GHz with Turbo Boost 2.24 GHz<br />
Intel HD Graphics<br />
This Processor was formerly Cherry Trail<br />
4 GB Ram 64GB SSD</p>
<p>This Tablet works great under the Anniversary Update.</p>
<p>Microsoft Offered the update, and as soon as the creator update completed....</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Processes went from 65-70&nbsp; to 150-158. I managed to get it down to 135 but still had issues....</p>
<p>CPU is not ramping up when needed the most, even though settings are set to max in power settings.</p>
<p>Video and sound out of sync and video image freezing at times, Mostly due to poor CPU handling. "Movies &amp; TV, or Media Player both suffer", I believe it may be chipset driver update problems. CPU is not ramping up when it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bluetooth has gone into persistent mode.<br />
Used to be: If my Bluetooth speakers disconnected or connected to a different device it would revert back to the internal speaker. Now it is persistent and will kick off any other device that connects, and reconnect even if it is not streaming music.<br />
Used to be able to control this by simply changing the default sound device, but that now changes the default sound, but persistently reconnects to the Bluetooth speaker.</p>
<p>Only way to fix it is to drill down into settings and disconnect the device. It remains paired but will stop being persistent. I can no longer set the default device and make it reconnect unless I drill down into settings and reconnect. Very Annoying.</p>

</p><p>I read that the Creators Update does not support certain cherry trail processors, but mine was not on the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it be, that it should be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The install went smooth and there are no system errors that is to say.. everything appears to function without an error message, but it is way unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank Goodness I have complete backups and went back to the anniversary version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now&nbsp; I have changed my WiFi connection to metered to try and prevent future updates, but what does that mean?</p>
<p>
</p><p>No more important updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What ever happened to user choice&nbsp; I remember when Microsoft Plus was an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So all this to say... If it ain't broke, why do I have to break it.</p>
<p>Short of having to , install the update to see if it is fixed, when or how will the announcements be made that it is now ok to update?</p>

            <p>Hi Dmitry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are having queries about screen resolution. The resolution you can use depends on the resolutions your monitor supports. CRT monitors generally display a resolution of 800 × 600 or 1024 × 768 pixels and can work well at different
 resolutions. LCD monitors, also called flat-panel displays, and laptop screens often support higher resolutions and work best at a specific resolution.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screen resolution refers to the clarity of the text and images displayed on your screen. At higher resolutions, such as 1600 x 1200 pixels, items appear sharper. They also appear smaller so more items can fit on the screen. At lower resolutions, such as
 800 x 600 pixels, fewer items fit on the screen, but they appear larger. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to refer the article mentioned below and see if it answer your query.</p>

            Hi David,<br />

Cybercriminals don't just send fraudulent email messages and set up fake websites. They might also call you on the telephone and claim to be from Microsoft. They might offer to help solve your computer problems or sell you a software license. Once they have
 access to your computer, they can do the following<br />

            <p>It is my experience that Microsoft does not solicit business or publish alerts via the phone. It is very likely that you were approached from a scammer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main objective is to take your money. Failing that, steel your information so other people will pay them money for that information (be it legit email businesses or those that have malicious intent).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would avoid anyone claiming to be from Microsoft (or on behalf of Microsoft)&nbsp;unless you yourself initiated the call-back need from Microsoft for a very specific topic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just a few thoughts... Hope it gives some insight.</p>

    <title>another post about mscorsvw.exe error messages - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gbswales  say:</h3>
<h2>            another post about mscorsvw.exe error messages</h2>
                    <p>I have seen several responses to this issue which I have on my windows 10 64bit installation</p>
<p>. The problem is that it is not consistent - sometimes after a restart it will occur almost immediately but other times it will not happen for up to several hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know what is causing it (directly) from this log entry</p>
<p>
</p><p>Application: mscorsvw.exe<br />
Framework Version: v4.0.30319<br />
Description: The process was terminated due to an internal error in the .NET Runtime at IP 698BA254 (69760000) with exit code 80131506.<br />
microsod</p>
<p>
</p><p>but this entry doesn't tell me which software is calling the net framework.&nbsp; On earlier versions of windows it was possible to completely uninstall Net framework and then re-install which usually fixed any problems.&nbsp; It seems to me that in Windows 10 this
 is not possible</p>
<p>
</p><p>A consistent suggestion is a clean boot - but doesnt go on to say what you should do after the clean boot!</p>
<p>I can understand if the error persists after a clean boot that it will be a windows issue and I am guessing the next stage would be a refresh or re-install of windows (system restore doesnt fix it for me) Which would be a big pain as I have several valuable
 programs that I had a time limited free install for - ie they had to be installed within a day or two of download for them to be free.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would lose these and probably have to wait up to a year or more for the offers to come around again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However lets assume that after a clean boot the error is no longer there (that would involve me running the PC for about a day to be sure as the error is inconsistent) Do I then introduce each missing piece of software one at a time (with a similar wait)
 until the culprit is found?&nbsp; That could take days/weeks during which many programs might not work properly</p>
<p>
</p><p>This IS a COMMON error and I am amazed that Microsoft have not come up with some kind of hotfix for it.&nbsp; It has been going on so long that I have taken to dropping the error to the bottom of my second screen and working on as normal.&nbsp; This is OK except that
 the power down/restart functions do not work while it is present and I have to resort to powering down using the restart or power off buttons on the computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the reccomended solutions to check system files etc and no problems are found.&nbsp; This is driving me crazy because it is the first time that I have not been able to track down a solution for a windows issue and it has been going on for over a
 month now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing I have noticed is that after most windows updates that include a restart my system becomes unstable blue screening for no apparent reason.&nbsp; I find that going for full shut down and cold restart fixes this (so much for windows self healing)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My drivers are up to date and I have all windows updates installed.&nbsp; I even uninstalled all my Iobit software (advance system care, uninstaller etc) as one post on a forum suggested their software caused the error message - made no difference.&nbsp; I also noticed
 a dropbox sync error before one error message so I uninstalled their desktop app - still no difference</p>
<p>
</p><p>System - homebuilt ASUS mBoard, AMD FX 8350 8 core 4.3GHz, 16gb ram</p>

                    <p>So, I think I may have posted this here somewhere weeks ago, but I can't find it.&nbsp; All of my settings are set to never go to sleep, never turn off the display, I went into advanced settings, there's no screen saver that is set to on or come on.&nbsp; Every random
 amount of time, maybe one day, sometimes two days, maybe four, who knows, there's no rhyme or reason that I can figure out a pattern... &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>.... my laptop will get to the point it decides its going to start going to sleep on me after maybe 30 seconds, maybe a minute, maybe 2 minutes, who knows, and it will keep doing that until I reboot.&nbsp; It is VERY annoying, because I'll be in the middle of
 doing some work and i'll look up, the screen is black, and I have to wiggle mouse or touch the keyboard and it will take a a few seconds, then come on, and i have to re enter my pin and then I'm back in...&nbsp; but it will keep doing that until I reboot.&nbsp; It sucks
 to have to reboot when I'm in the middle of a lot of work and have to close everything out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I can't be the only guy with this issue and someone has to know how to fix this, please God! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Chris</p>

            Everything is set to never, yes, I've gone to every place there could possibly be a setting that would trigger it to sleep after whatever period of time and set it to never or the applicable setting for it not to go to sleep.

<br />
<br />Which version and edition Windows did you originally upgrade from or was installed prior to your current version:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - 1703, 1607, 1511, 1507 (build 10240)
<br />
<br />Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro
<br />
<br />This sounds like you likely need to update your BIOS, Chipset and Display driver. 
<br />
<br />Do the following then try again:
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>

<br />Please read the following: Fix Windows 10 Media Creation Tool from Defaulting to Home Instead of Pro
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />Performing the upgrade:

<br />Wait while setup is initialized.
<br />
<br />You can select download and install any important updates before upgrading. This is recommended since it can help to ensure a smooth upgrade. If you are not connected to the Internet, select the Not right now radio box instead. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup checks your system for compatibility issues.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.

            The last game I tried was <span>Wallace and Gromit from Telltale Games. When I start the game, I get an error message saying direct3d is not eabled. When I run dxdiag in 32 bit mode, it says the same. Not eabled. When I
 run dxdiag in 64 bitmode, everything is fine. I have no problems on my 64 bit vista desktop, only on my win 7 64 bit laptop.&nbsp; (It's a Dell M6400 btw.)<br />

<p>I had the same issue, but not for games, but for running a MS program called Deep Zoom Composer and with no errors at all.</p>
<p>My machine is a Dell Inspiron Desktop (s560)&nbsp; with Win 7 x64, and I kept downloading the driver for their website but no luck. Then I went to the ATI website and downloaded the&nbsp; Win 7 x64 driver for my video card (ATI HD 5450 1GB DDR3)&nbsp;directly from the
 ATI website. After installation, the DirectX Features are enabled on both, the 32-bit and 64-bit dxdiag.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>P.S.: I did not face this issue with all my previous nVidia video cards. I guess there are some miscomunnication or lack of testing between DELL and ATI!!</p>

<p>Uninstall the drivers again (via'Programs &amp; Features' ), and then use a handy little free ware app called<em>Driver Sweeper</em> to finish uninstalling any graphics driver bits that may still be on the machine. It is best to get all of the old out before
 installing the new.<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Make sure you only uninstall the<em>graphics drivers</em> with Driver Sweeper.</span></p>

<p>The drivers direct from ATI are the one's you want. You should always get drivers from the mfg of the card, as they will always have the latest version.</p>

I did that already, and it restarted again. Anyway, I went to the Dell forums and I found a huge thread for this issue specially for the Dell Inspiron 560 Model, and there was no resolution at all. There are some people that had Dell Engineers replaced the
 motherboard twice, hard disks, and the power supply and still their machines are restarting.</p>
<p>The only solution I have is to return the machine to the vendor where I bought it. Dell used to be great, obviously not any more.</p>

<p>This is just the basic troubleshooting steps but lets ensure that method 1 and 2(For Windows 7)&nbsp;is followed from the link below.</p>
Method 1: Configure Hardware Acceleration to use the Full setting
Method 2: Enable DirectDraw or Direct3D

<h2>            Install Simfarm on Windows 7 from disc&#63;</h2>
                    I'd like to install an old copy of Simfarm from a CD on my Windows 7 x64 bit PC. Is it possible? I already tried dosbox&nbsp;unsuccessfully, but are there any other (free) possible alternatives?
