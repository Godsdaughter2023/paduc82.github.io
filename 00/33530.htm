    <title>Mouse scroll wheel works in other programs but not Windows 10 Apps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gameteur  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse scroll wheel works in other programs but not Windows 10 Apps</h2>
                    <p>Just installed the release version of Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>I have a Corsair Sabre Gaming mouse, and the scroll wheel does not work in any Windows 10 Apps.</p>
<p>I've played a few games... it works. Using Mozilla instead of Edge and it works. Edge does not.</p>
<p>I have the original minecraft and it works. Minecraft Windows 10 edition, it does not.</p>
<p>I tried the Weather app, food, edge and the apps store... basically any Windows 10 App and the scroll wheel on the mouse does not work for those.<br />
</p>
<p>Wouldn't seem to be a driver issue (which I updated manually) if it works everywhere but Windows Apps.</p>
<p>So what would be causing this? Is&nbsp; there a hidden setting for Apps that is preventing it from working.
<br />
(every other button, even custom ones, work as expected)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm stumped...</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize this post is a bit old, but I figured it might help someone. I've been having this issue as well, where the scroll works everywhere except for Windows 10 apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what fixed it for me,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Start&gt;Settings&gt;Devices&gt;Mouse &amp; Touchpad and turn the "Scroll inactive windows when I hover over them" to ON.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I made that change I can scroll in all Windows 10 apps again, such as Facebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps someone. Good luck.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Actually in Windows 10 Home as of todays date of Dec 12, 2017 there is a Settings&gt;Devices&gt;Mouse&nbsp; &nbsp;Scroll inactive windows when I hover over them selection on my desktop PC.&nbsp; And probably has been because I have been doing exactly that for MANY months when
 i move my mouse from my primary monitor to my secondary and scroll the browser tab without activating it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I still cant figure out why the Ubisoft Uplay store doesnt scroll with the mouse wheel.</p>

<h2>            Access to Computers on Network blocked by Credential Manger on new Laptop</h2>
                    My original HP laptop died and now I have a brand new Lenovo Z70 that I have completed the Windows 10 upgrade and can't access any of the computers on my private network. I can finally see them in the file manager after changing the workgroup name, but
 can't access them. Each time I try to access any of the computers on my private network a pop-up appears from the Credential Manger asking for a name and password.&nbsp; I have no idea what this is since I don't use any passwords on any of my home computers. I
 have search and tried everything I can find on the Internet, but nothing helps. Homegroup won't setup either.&nbsp;

            My Webroot Antivirus software is not the problem. The HP Laptop that I had previously was running Windows 10 upgrade with the Webroot Antivirus and never had these issues. My previous HP Laptop had no problems accessing my other desktop computers and the
 homegroup worked perfectly. I have tried every suggestion that I have found on the Internet, but nothing has helped. I have never ever had to enter a user name and password to access any of my computers on my private network. I have 3 desktop computer, all
 running Windows 10, and this new Levono Z70-80 laptop. This new laptop came with Windows 8.1 which I immediately upgraded to Windows 10 after completing the initial setup. This is the first time I have ever encountered the Network Credentials.

            Still waiting for Microsoft to either provide a fix for this serious network / homegroup issue with Windows 10. I still can not access any of the other desktop computers on my private network which are all connected to the same Netgear AC1900 Router.

    <title>About Win7 Install Limits how many OEM retail installations - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            About Win7 Install Limits how many OEM retail installations motherboard times</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm reading that windows 7 Retail can be installed infinite times on as many different motherbaords (mobos) as I want as long as only 1 is online at a time. Some say it can only be installed 10 times.<br />
I read that people sometimes try to reinstall Win 7 Retail and get blocked and have to call MS and explain how it's still only being installed on 1 PC at a time and then it gets OKayed as if it's not cheating/stealing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is calling MS for the above example the same as the following example which I'm reading is basically stealing?:</p>
<p><br />
Example which I'm reading is basically stealing: (Still only 1 PC at a time/online per key code) installing W 7 OEM on an upgraded mobo and getting the popup to call MS and entering the no-questions-asked codes from MS to get the upgraded mobo to overwrite
 the past mobo that was supposed to be the only one the OEM could ever be installed on.</p>
<p>I've read Mods on the MS forum suggesting to call in with the RETAIL probalem example, but they say the OEM is for&nbsp;only 1 mobo only no exceptions.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Besides buying the Downloadable version, Is there a cheaper way to not spend $200 to get 7 Retail to install on as many mobos I want (using&nbsp;1 mobo at a time only) (and if calling in to get Retail to keep installing isn't even cheating/stealing, in which case
 maybe I should just get the $99 OEM and call in every mobo upgrade)? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I change mobos about once a year. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe I'd be better off buying used mobos that had 7 installed on them and using a Win 7 recovery CD (like $50)? Could that be done infinite times, and would a matching Branded version be needed? Could I just call MS and have them give me a code and it not
 be like lying/stealing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
I think they'll make windows 9 (or whatever) sooner than expected, so I don't want to waste $200 on W7 Retail and then want the new Windows 9&nbsp;in like two years. I think they might (and should) take W8 and just make it look and work&nbsp;like W7 but keep the benefits
 of 8 (faster, more secure, one button reformat, better task manager, etc, etc,) without the&nbsp;GUI etc&nbsp;desktop users rejected 8 and 8.1 for.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I get W7 retail, I could probably sell it used with the key code if I want W 9 in a few years and not loose much $, but I'm&nbsp;thinking the key code could somehow be used to find info of my account so I'd probably end up just destroying the $200 DVDs and
 code instead of selling it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who's actually going to buy a $99 W7 OEM and keep it on only 1 mobo for like ten years using Win 7? I feel bad for all the people who mistakenly bought OEM thinking they could use it on upgraded mobos and couldn't even return it after the box was opened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MS should have made the retail version like $150 or maybe $140 without MS support which I personally never needed or even knew existed. They'd also have less people downloading the cracked versions.
<br />
Thanks.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>That is correct. </strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Some say it can only be installed 10 times.</p>
<p><strong>No, unlimited, but you might have to use phone activation after the 5th attempt to install.</strong></p>
<p><br />

<p><strong>That is correct, hence the 5th time I mentioned above.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is calling MS for the above example the same as the following example which I'm reading is basically stealing?</p>
<p><strong>No, it is not, if you have a legitimate purpose for reinstalling Windows 7 that many times, activation will be granted, but it is unusual. Personally, I look at it from the perspective, its an OS, its meant to manage the resources of your computer.
 The need to be reinstalling or moving to different motherboards can draw suspicions and if you are blocked permanently for it, sorry.
</strong></p>
<p><br />

<p><strong>OEM versions of Windows 7 are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em><strong><u>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</u></strong></em></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</strong>

<p><strong>Sorry, full retail license is your only option. Why are you installing on different motherboards? What is the objective?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I change mobos about once a year. </p>
<p><strong>Phone activation is your only option and full retail license is your only option.</strong></p>

<p><strong>No, its still different motherboard in the eyes of your own personal retail Windows 7 license.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 of 8 (faster, more secure, one button reformat, better task manager, etc, etc,) without the&nbsp;GUI etc&nbsp;desktop users rejected 8 and 8.1 for.
</p>
<p><strong>Windows 8.1 already works like Windows 7, you can boot directly to the desktop, set programs view as the default. The rest of what you are saying is speculation.
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I get W7 retail, I could probably sell it used with the key code if I want W 9 in a few years and not loose much $, but I'm&nbsp;thinking the key code could somehow be used to find info of my account so I'd probably end up just destroying the $200 DVDs and
 code instead of selling it.</p>
<p><strong>Windows 8.1 and obviously future releases are full licenses, so it makes no difference whether you keep Windows 7 or not in the future, since its not needed for compliance.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who's actually going to buy a $99 W7 OEM and keep it on only 1 mobo for like ten years using Win 7?</p>
<p><strong>The majority of PC owners, every PC sold from a name brand with exception of some specific cases came with a OEM license and most persons keep that copy of Windows installed for entire life of the PC or upgrade it to a future release.
</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>If the motherboard fails, then they either replace the PC or purchase a new motherboard. Taking into consideration that there are no PC warranties that go beyond a year unless acquired and that usually maxes out to 3 years. You are not gonna find
 an OEM providing support for 10 years on the same motherboard.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;I feel bad for all the people who mistakenly bought OEM thinking they could use it on upgraded mobos and couldn't even return it after the box was opened.</p>
<p><strong>So what about preloaded OEM licenses from DELL, HP, Lenovo, Microsoft? What about system builders who would never purchase full retail licenses?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MS should have made the retail version like $150 or maybe $140 without MS support which I personally never needed or even knew existed.
</p>
<p><strong>The new Windows 8 OEM System Builder Personal use license permits this and you can transfer it to as many licenses as you wish. Windows 7 is different because its an exception because of when it was releases.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>They'd also have less people downloading the cracked versions. </p>
<p><strong>Yes, then when malware, rootkits, Trojans, spyware, worms, man in the middle attacks slows down their computer, steals their personal information and identity costing them thousands, who do you blame then? No one but yourself.

Thanks.</p>

<p><strong><em>Why are you installing on different motherboards? What is the objective?</em></strong></p>
<p>Because sockets and CPUs change all the time. Last years stuff becomes cheaper&nbsp;so I can sell the current and have a faster machine.&nbsp;And&nbsp;don't have to&nbsp;stick&nbsp;with only 1 mobo for many years if I get OEM instead of Retail.&nbsp;$100 saved goes a long way with hardware.</p>

<p><strong><em>So what about preloaded OEM licenses from DELL, HP, Lenovo, Microsoft? What about system builders who would never purchase full retail licenses?</em></strong></p>
<p>Suckers -&nbsp;It takes&nbsp;like half a day to&nbsp;digest how-to build a&nbsp;PC for dummies videos.&nbsp;For the same price of a pre-build machine with a Dell/HP/etc branded OEM, one can build something that kicks the teeth out of it. Hardest part is knowing what parts are compatable
 but there are forums where people gladly help w/ that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MS should have made the retail version like $150 or maybe $140 without MS support which I personally never needed or even knew existed.

<p><strong><em>The new Windows 8 OEM System Builder Personal use license permits this and you can transfer it to as many licenses as you wish. Windows 7 is different because its an exception because of when it was releases.</em></strong></p>
<p>I learned this since making this thread, that Win 8 and 8.1 OEM&nbsp;ARE transferable&nbsp;to upgraded mobos and&nbsp;also resellable. 8.1 64&nbsp;OEM is the same price as&nbsp;OEM 7 64 (give or take a few bucks&nbsp;depending on which vendor), so I don't know if I should even feel guilty
 if I got 7 OEM&nbsp;instead of 8 and call in for the no-questions-asked code generator&nbsp;when installing&nbsp;OEM 7 on an upgraded mobo. But I guess rules are rules and&nbsp;I'd also risk getting blocked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Windows 8.1 already works like Windows 7, you can boot directly to the desktop, set programs view as the default.
</em></strong></p>
<p>I'm probably going to end up with 8.1 OEM.&nbsp;I even considered building a hackintosh but that's aparently&nbsp;illegal and might end up&nbsp;blocked or something and it's&nbsp;more work than&nbsp;building a PC.</p>
<p>I use XP like second nature and basically do things as fast as humanly possible in it, but&nbsp;changing to the W8.1 GUI shouldn't be too bad. My&nbsp;only real&nbsp;gripe is how they made it seem like everyhing is too easily accidentally public like with sky drive and
 MS servers&nbsp;backing up basically the entire computer. It's a disturbance and diservice to me to have to go into all the settings and then hope I have everything disabled and trust it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.<br />

 up on MS server, blocking the ability to log into my entire computer from any computer, etc?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, is this allowed with any version of Windows 7 or 8?:</p>
<p>Install on one PC, install all the updates and then install the same disc on anotehr PC and use only the second PC online and keep the other one as an offline computer.</p>

 window that Windows 7 has, my computer say "Connected" next to my network, comcast, however, above that, it says "Identifying...(comcast)". Right below that it says "No Internet Access. I posted this on my laptop using an ethernet cable. The results right
 below are from ./ipconfig all with ethernet, the results on the very bottom are from when ethernet was not plugged in. Also, sometimes, plugging in the ethernet will work, and sometime the issue will go away after a while, however, I'm looking for a permanent
 fix. Also, you should know that when I try to connect, I generally have three or four bars.</span><br />

<h2>            Windows 10 LAN gaming network</h2>
                    I am trying to set up a wired LAN network using Ethernet cables, gigabit Ethernet switch and no internet connection. I was able to do this with windows XP but since I upgraded I cannot figure it out. it recognizes an unidentified connection hooked up by
 ethernet but there's no way to connect. Previously, you were able to set up a LAN network through create a new network but that no longer seems to be an option. Network discovery is on on both computers, in networks i can see the other computer, but I cannot
 connect. Tried to use a home group but the home group doesn't go through the direct Ethernet connection. This network will be used for gaming any and all help would be appreciated!

<h2>            My Computer Crashes When Playing Games</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;My computer crashes when i play games, it only happens when ive been gaming for a while. I thought it is a temperature problem, because it only shuts off when it gets past 60c, so I just kept it under 55c and have had no problem with it for a couple of
 weeks. I got the new game H1Z1 and when ever I get into a game my pc shuts off. It doesnt have the "Shutting Down", it just black screesn then starts up again. Someone please help. I have replaced the power supply as well to a 80+ gold. It still is shutting
 off.<br />
<br />
Motherboard: <a href="http://pcpartpicker.com/part/asus-motherboard-m5a78lmlxplus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Asus M5A78L-M LX PLUS Micro ATX AM3</a><br />
Powersupply: Rosewill 650 Watt 80+ Gold<br />
CPU: AMD FX-4130 (Quad Processor) 3.80 GHz<br />
GPU: ASUS GTX 780TI DirectCU II OC</p>
<p>RAM: PNY 1x8</p>
<p>Temperature:<br />
Not Gaming: 33c-38c<br />
Gaming: 50c-56c</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Additional note:<br />
This problem only occured when I install the GTX 780TI DirectCU II OC card into my computer. This problem never happened with my AMD 7850.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to fix this? Such as get a new motherboard, buy some fans to keep it cool, or get a new hard drive?</p>

</p><p>These are all called BCC124 and are related to hardware.&nbsp; Since yours refers to AUthentic AMD I would start by running a cpu stress test.&nbsp;<strong> If you are overclocking revert back to default.</strong></p>

<div>
<p>Prime95 Setup;<br />
- extract the contents of the zip file to a location of your choice<br />
- double click on the executable file<br />
- select "Just stress testing"<br />
- select the "Blend" test.&nbsp; If you've already run MemTest overnight you may want to run the "Small FFTs" test instead.<br />
- "Number of torture test threads to run" should equal the number of CPU's times 2 (if you're using hyperthreading).<br />
The easiest way to figure this out is to go to Task Manager...Performance tab - and see the number of boxes under CPU Usage History<br />
Then run the test for 6 to 24 hours - or until you get errors [b](whichever comes first)<br />
The Test selection box and the stress.txt file describes what components that the program stresses.</p>

<div><strong>Stop 0x124 is a hardware error</strong><br />
<div><em><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>If you are overclocking try resetting your processor to standard settings and see if that helps.</strong></span></em></em></div>
If you continue to get BSODs here are some more things you may want to consider.<br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This is usually heat related, defective hardware, memory or even processor though it is"possible" that it is driver related (rare).</span></em><br />
<strong><br />
Stop 0x124 - what it means and what to try</strong><br />
Synopsis:<br />
<em>A "stop 0x124" is fundamentally different to many other types of bluescreens because it stems from a hardware complaint.<br />
Stop 0x124 minidumps contain very little practical information, and it is therefore necessary to approach the problem as a case of hardware in an unknown state of distress.<br />
</em><br />
<br />
<strong>&nbsp;Generic "Stop 0x124" Troubleshooting Strategy:</strong><br />
<br />
1)&nbsp;<strong>Ensure that none of the hardware components are overclocked.</strong>&nbsp;Hardware that is driven beyond its design specifications - by overclocking - can malfunction in unpredictable ways.<br />
2)&nbsp;<strong>Ensure that the machine is adequately cooled.</strong><br />
&nbsp;If there is any doubt, open up the side of the PC case (be mindful of any relevant warranty conditions!) and point a mains fan squarely at the motherboard. That will rule out most (lack of) cooling issues.<br />
3)&nbsp;<strong>Update all hardware-related drivers</strong>: video, sound, RAID (if any), NIC... anything that interacts with a piece of hardware.<br />
It is good practice to run the latest drivers anyway.<br />
4)&nbsp;<strong>Update the motherboard BIOS according to the manufacturer's instructions and clear the CMOS.</strong><br />
Their website should provide detailed instructions as to the brand and model-specific procedure.<br />
5)&nbsp;<strong>Rarely, bugs in the OS may cause "false positive" 0x124 events where the hardware wasn't complaining but Windows thought otherwise (because of the bug).</strong><br />
At the time of writing, Windows 7 (or 8) is not known to suffer from any such defects, but it is nevertheless important to always keep Windows itself updated.<br />
6)&nbsp;<strong>Attempt to (stress) test those hardware components</strong>&nbsp;which can be put through their paces artificially.<br />
The most obvious examples are the RAM and HDD(s).<br />
For the RAM, use the 3rd-party memtest86 utility to run many hours worth of testing. (6-8 passes to stress the ram out)<br />
For hard drives, check whether CHKDSK /R finds any problems on the drive(s), notably "bad sectors".<br />
Unreliable RAM, in particular, is deadly as far as software is concerned, and anything other than a 100% clear memory test result is cause for concern. Unfortunately, even a 100% clear result from the diagnostics utilities does not guarantee that the RAM is
 free from defects - only that none were encountered during the test passes.<br />
7)&nbsp;<strong>As the last of the non-invasive troubleshooting steps</strong>, perform a "vanilla" reinstallation of Windows: just the OS itself without any additional applications, games, utilities, updates, or new drivers - NOTHING AT ALL that is not sourced
 from the Windows 7 disc.<br />
Should that fail to mitigate the 0x124 problem, jump to the next steps.<br />
If you run the "vanilla" installation long enough to convince yourself that not a single 0x124 crash has occurred, start installing updates and applications slowly, always pausing between successive additions long enough to get a feel for whether the machine
 is still free from 0x124 crashes.<br />
Should the crashing resume, obviously the very last software addition(s) may be somehow linked to the root cause.<br />
If stop 0x124 errors persist despite the steps above, and the hardware is under warranty, consider returning it and requesting a replacement which does not suffer periodic MCE events.<br />
Be aware that attempting the subsequent hardware troubleshooting steps may, in some cases, void your warranty:<br />
8)&nbsp;<strong>Clean and carefully remove any dust from the inside of the machine.</strong><br />
Reseat all connectors and memory modules.<br />
Use a can of compressed air to clean out the RAM DIMM sockets as much as possible.<br />
9)&nbsp;<strong>If all else fails, start removing items of hardware one-by-one in the hope that the culprit is something non-essential which can be removed.</strong><br />
Obviously, this type of testing is a lot easier if you've got access to equivalent components in order to perform swaps.<br />
<br />
 - something is fundamentally wrong with the machine's hardware.</strong></span></div>

<p>It is not the CPU.&nbsp; It is the OC video card pushing the CPU in some way.&nbsp; I NEVER recommend OC of anything.&nbsp; After 10,000 crash analysis OC does nothing other than (IMHO) causes problems.</p>

<h2>            Hard Drive light turns off then PC freezes.</h2>
                    hey, guys, what's up? here's the thing, i've been having this problem for a really long time, i'm using my pc and all of the sudden everything sofwere stops responding and the hard drive light turns off,&nbsp; then after 30 seconds or so it starts blinking
 again and everything starts working again, i am also getting a lot of bluescreens, probly because my hard drive stops responding and it messes up my windows, a while back i couldn't even install the windows because the problem happened during the installation
 of the windows, then i found out that if i swap the power sata cable of the hard drive the problem goes away for a little while, a week sometimes, then it starts all over again.<br />
<br />
my hard drive's new, i've changed it twice thinking it was the root of the problem, and my motherboard's also new, but the warranty expires in 5 days, so i really need to know if the motherboard is the problem, my power supply is 600W, it's 2 years old or so.

            it can't be a window problem guys, because sometimes my pc doens't even recognize my hard drive, and the problem kept happening when i was installing windows from scratch, in the middle of the installation, and it goes away for a while when i change the
 sata power supply of the hard drive, the problem is either my power supply or my motherboard, i just wanted to know for sure it's not my motherboard because as i told you, my motheboard's warranty expires in 4 days. :/

            One thing is sure-It is some hardware that is at fault.
<br />Quite probably it is your PSU that is failing.
<br />Do you have a spare one and use it to narrow down the cause, at least?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<div>Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</div>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong>You may try to reset Winsock and check.
<div>This will take care of any winsock corruption that can lead to connectivity issues.<br />
To reset Winsock, follow these steps:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Click&nbsp; and typecmd in the Start Search box.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Right-click cmd.exe and click Run as administrator.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Press Continue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Type "netsh winsock reset" without the quotes at the command prompt, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note If the command is typed incorrectly, you will receive an error message. Type the command again. When the command is completed successfully, a confirmation appears, followed by a new command prompt.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;e. Type exit, and then press ENTER.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>If you're using Internet Explorer, then we recommend you to check if proxy server settings are enabled. To do this, try these steps:<br />
Disable proxy server on Internet Explorer (IE):<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, type inetcpl.cpl and hit Enter.
<div>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Connections tab, click LAN settings button.<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncheck "Use a proxy server for your LAN" under proxy server and make sure to check “Automatically detect IP address.”<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Ok to apply the changes.<br />
e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Internet Explorer and check if the issue persists.<br />
See Change proxy settings in Internet Explorer<br />

<h2>            What tool is included in Windows 7 Enterprise to unzip zip files&#63;  Please tell me something this basic is included.  If not, WHY NOT &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Please tell me something this basic is included by Microsoft.&nbsp; If not, WHY NOT ?</p>
<p>Tired of always searching the internet for basic programs to do standard things that should be included by the Windows Vendor (Microsoft).</p>
<p>The outlying marketplace for software tools is filled with viruses and malware and ingenuine or misleading offers by less reputable companies.</p>
<p>It is time for Microsoft to start taking ownership of all the basic things we need these days:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; A way to zip and unzip a collection of files</p>
<p>2. A way to play various standard media types (MP4, AVI, 3GP, etc).&nbsp; Sometimes Windows Media Player does not seem to work.</p>

    <title>Hyper-V networking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthew.hart.tmg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hyper-V networking</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Pro, Build 10586.71. &nbsp;Hyper-V installed. &nbsp;All was working well, and then I got a chipset update from Dell. &nbsp;Installed the update and rebooted computer. &nbsp;After that networking was not working correctly, windows showed limited connectivity. &nbsp;I looked
 a little to roll back the driver update, but Windows did not show a new Nic card driver and the chipsets I looked at also did not show a current date. &nbsp;The Dell Command update program does not provide a way to uninstall updates. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to access hyper-v switch manager but it returns an error that "an error occurred while trying to retrieve a list of virtual switches". &nbsp;Also tried using the powershell cmdlet but got a general error. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I accessed the networking center and deleted the Hyper V adapter, then edited my LAN card's config disabling the two Hyper V protocols and enabling the rest. &nbsp;This let me get back on-line with my computer. &nbsp;I have tried uninstalling the Hyper V feature,
 reboot, reinstall - but I am still unable to access the switch manager. &nbsp;I then removed the feature again, re-named the&nbsp;C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Hyper-V directory, rebooted, added the feature again. &nbsp;This time (obviously) none of my VM's show up but
 I'm still unable to access the switch manager. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no critical data in my Hyper V, I use it for testing, re-creating issues, learning, etc. &nbsp;Is there a way for Windows 10 (or something designed for server 2012 that will apply) that I can use to fully reset the Hyper v networking, or fully rest all
 of hyper v so I can get it working again? &nbsp;I do use the workstation heavily, it's my work computer so it would be very difficult to impossible to reinstall the OS. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts and suggestions appreciated. &nbsp;</p>

<p>My main Desktop, then I used my Laptop and because of Microsoft not letting you decide to NOT UPDATE!&nbsp; You have put a need for me to SPEND money I DO NOT HAVE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to write this on my iMac that I am blessed to still have.</p>
<p>I'm disabled now, and because of Microsoft I have not a computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm ashamed of you folks.&nbsp; You really messed up!</p>
<p>if not for an iMac and my brother having an old WinXP machine, we wouldn't have anything!</p>
<p>Both my Windows 10 machines are DEAD!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is totally unacceptable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Humbled Servant of God Fredrick Earl Hight</p>
<p>God please help me.&nbsp; I don't have money to fix these.</p>
<p>I tried to fix the Desktop using my laptop to make a Windows.iso</p>
<p>and even that was the biggest JOKE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is really screwing up!</p>
<p>What do I do now, I have two bricks!</p>
<p>My Desktop has c0000001 and c21a</p>
<p>
</p><p>ARG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for your attention and focus.&nbsp; God Bless.</p>
<p>My Gateway DX4850 is getting the c0000001 and c000021a<br />
<br />
I've read all about this; it's common for error of turning off computer during update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, this happened at night while I slept as Microsoft did this after nearly a month of choosing</p>
<p>"REMIND ME LATER" option for the update that never worked.&nbsp; It would only go 87% then revert&nbsp;</p>
<p>to the old install. So, I just kept the "REMIND ME LATER" because clearly my computer didn't</p>
<p>like it.&nbsp; That should be my choice!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then after all day of trying the Window.iso I got from the PAIN in the BUTT site Microsoft set up</p>
<p>to download the iso from my Laptop I eventually got that done.&nbsp; Burned a dvd and it's junk.</p>
<p>it's not formatted for boot even though it was supposed to be. That was my last DVD!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I'm lost because after that evening I was going to bed, frustrated and sharing the nightmare</p>
<p>on my Facebook with 7000 people who follow me and friend me as a Minister for the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I went to shutdown the Laptop and only had the option to update and shutdown!!!!!!!</p>
<p>I knew what was coming!&nbsp; I posted a live video to Facebook of the Reboot after 1hr of&nbsp;</p>
<p>the spinning dots!&nbsp; &nbsp;I swear Microsoft should be responsible for this; because as a former</p>
<p>business owner, my liability was clear.&nbsp; I feel like I should file a lawsuit in my county.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly this was November 7 for my Gateway and my Dell laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I have my iMac whom I always preach against, and look... it's the only thing working&nbsp;</p>
<p>but my brothers old xp laptop.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Gateway is the center of the Music I make and study I do</p>
<p>to be healed for the illness struck on me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do if I can't even boot either device?&nbsp; Nothing on the Gateway it's a brick.</p>
<p>Nothing works.&nbsp; You can boot to bios, and sometimes get the recovery console, but it</p>
<p>goes nowhere when you select even safe mode, like the YouTube videos say about</p>
<p>those errors.&nbsp; It has wrecked my authorization and nothing can help.</p>
<p>If I had a Windows 10 DVD perhaps because it would be bootable I could do something.</p>
<p>I've upgraded from 7 to 8 to 10 on the Gateway all online.&nbsp; I bought it from Microcenter</p>
<p>in Madison Heights, Michigan in 2010.&nbsp; The Laptop sometimes around then as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps the Laptop can be helped but I can't figure out what to do with it.</p>

<p>That is the Site that took 4 hours to get a Windows ISO from.&nbsp; I used Windows 10 on my Laptop to burn it to DVD per all the information from Microsoft.&nbsp; I got a DVD that will not BOOT even though it says it will.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have another writeable DVD and I'm disabled and feed 3 people on a small income.</p>
<p>I don't even have the laptop now to try again if I had one.&nbsp; I have my iMac, but I don't know</p>
<p>much about iMacs,&nbsp; and don't care to learn.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had that site make a 16gb USB stick I have and IT TOO does not boot!</p>
<p>Each time, that site took 4 hours.&nbsp; It was so slow, I have a 100 service for my ISP</p>
<p>so this shouldn't be the case.&nbsp; I searched online and many people complain about&nbsp;</p>
<p>the Windows 10 Installer Media Creation Tool site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can try again on USB but now, I only have my iMac.&nbsp; I wonder if it will work from this?</p>
<p>clearly the ISO on the USB now doesn't boot from the ISO.</p>
<p>Oh, right the USB wouldn't be any iso, it would be expanded.</p>
<p>So, I'll try that from this apple and see what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I want to disable all updates from Microsoft!</p>
<p>Thank you so much.&nbsp; I should have thought about this.</p>

<h2>            My Microphone Stopped Working Windows 7</h2>
                    I have a Sony VAIO VPCCB37FD laptop and have had it for over a year. My mic has been working up until around 11 PM last night. After trying to roll back the driver my laptop would not log onto my account after booting up and I had to restore back to June
 5th and that fixed up mic issues for about 10 minutes then mid-sentence it dropped again. There are no updates for Realtek High Definition Audio that I don't already have. As much as I want to try rolling back again I don't want to have to restore just to
 get back on my laptop. Mic volume it at 100, mic is enabled, troubleshooting says nothing is wrong, multiple voice chat services won't recognize my mic and neither will Windows Speech Recognition. I have to clap my hands as loud as possible in front of my
 mic to get the slightest sound to show up. The mic is built in to my webcam

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for the delay in responding to your query. I believe I could provide you some more information on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this issue, the Microphone appears to have some hardware problems. All the services that needs a microphone are not able to read any input through it. Even after a System Restore, the microphone is behaving the same. So, at this point, instead of doing
 another restore in the computer, I would suggest you to get in touch with your manufacturer support to diagnose for any hardware issues. That would be more helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the link to Sony Support : </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this information helps you in getting the Microphone diagnosed properly. Do write back if you need any assistance with Windows, we will be glad to be of help!</p>

    <title>Xbox App Stream from Xbox One issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dubiousdvorak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox App Stream from Xbox One issues</h2>
                    
<p>I consistently have issues with streaming from my Xbox One.&nbsp; Some days it works, but most days it does not.&nbsp; The most common issue I see is the "We couldn't connect to your console. Make sure the console is still on and connected to the same network as this
 device."</p>
<p>I am actually considering purchasing a second Xbox so my girlfriend and I can play games like Destiny together, but this would mean one of us (likely me) would have to stream.&nbsp; The fact that streaming is totally unreliable makes this a difficult purchase.</p>
<p>We have multiple laptops in the house, and each exhibit the issue at various times.&nbsp; Some times I can flip between a few laptops and one of them will work, but most times, if one does not work, none will work.</p>
<p>This has been an ongoing issue for MONTHS and I have researched this issue many times, and always come up short.</p>
<p><br />
Steps I have taken to troubleshoot:</p>
<p>Hard restarting xbox</p>
<p>Restarting laptop</p>
<p>Restarting Modem</p>
<p>Installing the beta xbox app</p>
<p>Uninstalling via powershell the xbox app (and the beta app), and reinstalling from the Store</p>
<p>Resetting modem to factory</p>
<p>Removing my profile from the game and re-adding.</p>
<p>Changing the name of my xbox (saw this one on some forum that I forget now, but didn't help me)</p>
<p>Typing the IP address of my xbox instead of letting it search</p>
<p>removing the xbox connection from the app and re-searching.</p>
<p>Installing the xbox app (and beta app) and attempting to connect on multiple computers.</p>
<p>Setting up a separate SSID for my 5 and 2.4 GHZ wireless bands.</p>
<p>Connecting both laptop and xbox to a physical network connection.</p>
<p>Set my NAT to public (I know this is more related to party/multiplayer, but one random forum post suggested it anyways).</p>
<p>Updating to latest Xbox app</p>
<p>Install all latest windows updates.</p>
<p>Standing on one foot, spinning, dancing, and chanting "ooooommmmPLEASEWORKPLEASEWORKooooommmm", repeating this step
<em><strong>exactly</strong> </em>7.5 times in a row.</p>

<p>This is a constant source of frustration and stress for an activity that should be fun and allow me to escape.<br />
<br />
HALP!&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>Hey DubiousDvorak, </p>
<p>I think I see the issue: you didn't repeat the last step 8.5 times. </p>
<p>I see you say you're on the latest version of Windows. Can you check to make sure you're on the Win 10 Anniversary update? Report back here if you are.

<p>Both actually. &nbsp;My primary machine is still on build 1511, 10.0.10586 (it's running CBB update model), with the latest updates per CBB release schedule, but one of the machines I also see the issue with is on the Anniversary update 1607.</p>

<p>Oh, and I should add:</p>
<p>Of all the troubleshooting steps above, the only that will SOMETIMES make a difference are the "hard restart xbox", and the "powershell uninstall/reinstall from store" steps.</p>
<p>I usually attempt the uninstall/reinstall first, if that fails, hard reset. &nbsp;Sometimes it's resolved with the uninstall/reinstall, other times with the hard reset. &nbsp;Usually, unfortunately, neither work however and then everything down the list do not change
 the scenario.</p>
<p>I appreciate any guidance!</p>

<p>I'm with you, Dvorak.</p>
<p>The App and the Box definitely have communication issues.</p>
<p>We DO have 2 Xboxes here and what I observed is, that for example Box1 is up and running, kids play on TV.</p>
<p>I fire up Box2 and want to stream to my Desktop-PC. That goes well maybe for 10 minutes, then its loses connection. From that point onward the timespans between reconnect and connection lost get shorter and shorter each time. After an hour its like 3-5s.</p>
<p>Since I log in via smartglass app I can watch the connectionstatus there. There seems to be a refresh cycle and It looks to me the Box gets confused upon that. If just Box2 is up and running it just "forgets" where its supposed to be connected to. If both
 Boxes are up it seems to be even more confusing as the disconnect frequency only grows then.</p>
<p>Kinda noteworthy: In the smartglass app, specifically in the list of all Boxes found in the network, each individual Box there has an option for "auto-connect". Now I obviously dont want to autoconnect to Box1. But even though you can uncheck that option,
 its still marked as checked when you reopen that "boxes in the network"-list.</p>
<p>If i leave smartglass completely away and manually log in on the box, it doesnt work most of the time either, I get stuck at "You need to be logged in to stream" yadda yada-thingy.</p>
<p>I have no Idea what went wrong here. Given the fact that so many people have this issue I cant believe this made it through Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>I'm not a couch type player. I bought the Box because of exclusive content, but only after the Win 10 streaming feature was announced.</p>
<p>As of now my Box is unusable.</p>

<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>The first step is to turn the Xbox to power-saving mode and see if the problem goes away. If you're using the beta app, file feedback. Be as clear and detailed as possible.

<p>Thanks for the response, but let me make an honest question please.</p>
<p>I understand the approach to keep everything more and more simple, more accessible etc in order to reach out to more casual people.</p>
<p>But why does this include error-handling? How on earth I am supposed to give any meaningful information when there is virtually NO exception handling other than those generic "Please try again"-Popups?</p>
<p>There is no logging, no error codes ... nothing. I have no clue if the app threw the execption because of a connection-reset or if it just listens on a wrong port because there is some typo in the code.</p>
<p>Computers get more and more technical, people that use them should at least have AN OPTION to get more detailed information presented, if they want to have that.</p>
<p>Instead of tackling the issue right away we then sit in forums for hours debating about what *might have happened*
</p>
<p>And of course, you, the customer support, always have to start at the very basic "turn off, reset" etc ...every.....friggin....time.</p>
<p>I dont get it, why so many programmers these days complicate their lives that way.</p>
<p>Heck, I cant even find an obvious link to a changelog for the Apps .... duh</p>
<p>sorry, for the rant, but...I hope you see my point.</p>

<p>I have tried the step "to turn the Xbox to power-saving mode and see if the problem goes away" many times, and most of the time, it does not resolve.</p>
<p>My apologies if I have submitted my support issue in the wrong spot. &nbsp;I'll submit this through the xbox beta app as well if that makes it easier, but I thought this forum was for support.</p>
<p>Is there anything else I can try, or steps you can offer for me to collect further diagnostics? &nbsp;There's a sticky post in this forum about this issue that was posted in April. &nbsp;I find it shocking that this is a known and announced issue for this long without
 any fixes.</p>

<p>As far as I know, the issues have been addressed. That's why it's important to file feedback with the Xbox beta app.
</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't know what else to tell you besides start looking at antivirus and the firewall. Are you using a a special antivirus? What happens if you turn the quality down?

<p>Yesterday I tried again after not having touched the box since my last post.</p>
<p>There was both an update on the app and the box. After having patched both I was able to streamplay for multiple hours without any issues.</p>
<p>So, whatever was wrong you must have fixed it and it wasnt on our end.</p>
<p>That said, while this thread essentially (for now) is obsolete... I don't know anything. I understand that customers just want their stuff functioning, thats however not how I operate. I want to understand what exactly caused the error. This is purely for
 self education.</p>
<p>See it from that standpoint: In order to provide exact, precise information and feedback to you guys, one must have some sort of understanding how things function, interact etc.</p>
<p>While I am happy that things are working again, I still dont know what the issue was. I dont know the error and there is no information on the fix.</p>
<p>If this trend is keep going software developement will hit a wall somewhere going down the road.</p>
<p>thanks for listening</p>

<p>Oh I forgot to answer your question above ;)</p>
<p>I've tested this with AV (avast) being shut down completely. Also it didnt matter what quality I chose, low, med, very high....all the same, connection just reset somewhen.</p>
<p>This is exactly what I talked about the days before. Your software guys didnt include ANY exception handling, not even some cryptic error code one could eventually google up. I have no idea which method in your code errored out and therefore I'm stuck at
 sitting in the forums, answering redundant (from my POV) questions and waiting. I hope you understand that this isnt meant to be rude or something, I just hope you get my point :)</p>

<div>Quicken 2000 worked with XP because it was released around the same time as XP. The year is now 2010, and the OS is Windows 7.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Quicken have thoughtfully released a version which works with Windows 7.. see here..</div>

<p>Sounds like the program might not be compatible with Windows 7. Have you tried running the program in compatibility mode to see if it will print then?</p>
<p>You can find more information about compatibility modes in the articles below:<br />

<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Program-Compatibility-Assistant-frequently-asked-question</p>
<p>If you have Microsoft Excel installed, you could export the data to that program and try printing from Excel.</p>
