<h2>            I lost my Windows 7 dvd and my computer can&#39;t boot up Can&#39;t restore what can I do&#63;</h2>
                    Hi I have a computer that will not boot up. I seem to have lost the windows 7 DVD and though I have looked for a long time cannot find it. I recently won the computer from Microsoft and now it will not boot up. Is there some way to get another dvd from
 microsoft for free? I do not need another license as I already have the one but I do need to use the computer.

<p>Mine was professional.&nbsp;But apparently the disk was not thrown away and I now have the windows 7 disk as well as the asus disk. So I just need to find a friend who has an external dvd player with a usb cable and use that to re-install I guess.<br />
I am going to try that. I don't see why it wouldn't work. Thank you for your help and suggestions. If I hadn't ended up finding the disk I think you may still have helped me find a way to make it work. Again thx and I will update this when I try the install
 and find out the result to let you know how it went. And the disk holder has the key on the back.</p>
<p>Almost forgot the update I promised. The restore worked fine and I have been using it for a long time now with no similar problems.</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />I would suggest you to follow these Methods: 
<br />
<br />Method 1: Run the SFC.
<br />
<br />Follow the below steps:
<br />
<br />	1. Open Command Prompt.
<br />	2. Select “Run as Administrator”.
<br />	3. Type “sfc /scannow” without quotes and hit Enter.
<br />Now check for the issue.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Run the DISM Tool.
<br />
<br />If the issue persists, I would have you run the DISM tool to check the system health and will try to restore the files.
<br />
<br />	1. Click on 'Start'.
<br />	2. Enter 'Command prompt' in the Search box.  
<br />	3. In the list of results, swipe down on or right-click Command prompt, and then tap or click 'Run as administrator'. 
<br />	4. In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. Press the Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />To close the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter.
<br />
<br />Note: The tool might take 15-20 minutes to finish running, so please do not cancel it.
<br />
<br />Method 3:
<br />
<br />Type the following in a Windows PowerShell as Administrator:
<br />
<br />1.Launch PowerShell 
<br />2.Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted 
<br />3.Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />
<br />Restart your device.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sometimes this issue might occur due to some corrupted system files or damaged operating system files. I suggest that you try performing a repair upgrade if you try all method and still persist the issue. Here is instructions in his article to resolve the issue  by following Andre Da Costa's:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope the information provided is useful. If the issue persists, reply here and we will be glad to help you.
<br />
<br />Angel.

<br />
I believe that is the 32-bit driver that the OP already tried.&nbsp; The site is slightly different than the Canon site I checked but it has x32 in the file name and the FAQ tab has an FAQ section that says only 32-bit Windows 7 is supported:&nbsp;

<h2>            Blue Screen analysis request&#33; &#40;IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL&#41;</h2>
                    I've recently reformatted my computer due to this blue screen problem in the hopes that it would make it go away. It didn't. I receive the same blue screen every time. It happens at random intervals and the last time it happened was 7 hours ago (new record!).
 Are there any analysts here to help me out? I don't want to take it to an ITS place and have them keep it for 4 days. Thanks in advance!

<h2>            78 background processes... which can I disable&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo Z50 with Windows 8 64-bit OS. It has no touch capabilities, and the only wireless device I connect to is my Brother printer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Task Manager says I've got 78 "background processes" running. That seems excessive. My startup is also quite slow considering that my laptop is new. Can anyone tell me clearly which of these I can safely stop or get rid of?</p>
<p>I also randomly get notices saying that I have "A New App" to do things. I'm not sure if my computer is automatically downloading things without asking or if it came with these things and is letting me know I have them when it thinks they are relevant. Anyone
 else know?&nbsp;</p>

            Did you uninstall the program&nbsp;completely before trying to install it again?<br />
What is the program name?<br />
The iij15.dll may be hidden. Did you do a search for the file?<br />
<br />
Did you try and register the .dll?<br />
<p>Go to a command prompt. Right click and select, “Run as administrator.”<br />
Then type in the command: regsvr32 " FileName.dll"<br />
For your .dll type in: Regsvr32 iij15.dll</p>
<p>Once the DLL has been registered, you should receive a confirmation the DLL file was successfully registered into the registry.

<h2>            Do &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; actually grow in a mushroom biome&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>This is nuts.&nbsp; I planted brown and red mushrooms on surface level mycilia.&nbsp; They will not reproduce and spread.&nbsp; So I grabbed a silk touch pick and gathered some mycilia blocks.&nbsp; I tunneled out underground in the mushroom biome.&nbsp; I then planted the mycilia
 blocks.&nbsp; I then planted both brown and red mushrooms in this underground room.&nbsp; No light.&nbsp; Door closed off tunnel.&nbsp; They STILL won't grow and spread.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>I put some plain old dirt down on the floor of a cavern in a normal biome.&nbsp; Planted red and brown mushrooms, and they grow.&nbsp; What the heck? I put mycilia blocks down next to regular dirt blocks.&nbsp; It spreads.&nbsp; I built a room on top to shut out light.&nbsp; Planted
 mushrooms.&nbsp; They don't grow.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
The Wiki says "<a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Mushrooms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Mushrooms</a> spread faster on Mycelium than on other blocks".&nbsp; Yet in my world, they don't spread at all on mycillia blocks.<br />
<br />
<br />
What the heck, mushrooms grow normally in non-mushroom biome but refuse to grow in the mushroom biome.&nbsp; That makes NO sense.&nbsp; None.&nbsp; There were mushrooms on the surface in the biome when the world was generated.&nbsp; Not one has spread.</p>

<p>I planted two in a room with 1/3 mycilla (silk touch) and 2/3 dirt - I have "grown" to more in 3 MC days - very slow. I have another world with mushrooms growing in large dark room and they even grew one on crafting table. Growth rate much faster even on

    <title>Xbox One Keeps Signing Out On Its Own - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> briansmith&#35;&#35;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Keeps Signing Out On Its Own</h2>
                    <p>Recently I have been having an issue where my Xbox One will randomly sign me out as if I have turned off the controller. The message comes up 'Bye Brian! Sign in using an Xbox controller'. It occurs every 1-5 minutes, give or take, and always when I am in
 an app that is streaming content. It will also sign out under my fiancee's profile. It doesn't occur on my Xbox 360. Here are the steps I have taken to try and correct it, based off of searches for the same issue:<br />
<br />
I have done both a soft and hard reset of the console.</p>
<p>I have tested the internet settings. No other device loses connectivity.</p>
<p>I have deleted and re-downloaded my profile.</p>
<p>I have re-synced my controllers and even changed the batteries. Worth noting, neither controller loses power when the sign out happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the above have remedied the issue. I do not have a current Gold account, however, that has not affected me in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how to permanently correct this? It has rendered my Xbox One console useless at this point.</p>

            Do you get an error message when it goes offline? In the network settings or otherwise? Or do you just have the comfort of the console saying "bye" to you? If you have no error messages anywhere, I would try a power cycle. That is only because the 3rd
 thing you tried didn't work. Here is a step by step link on how to do it.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console</a>.&nbsp;

</p><p>I'm sorry that you're experiencing issues with your Xbox One signing you out of your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might want to consider performing a factory reset on your console. However, it will erase all accounts, saved games, settings, and home Xbox associations. Although, you should try and contact Xbox Support first to see if they have any other suggestions.</p>

<p>I did do several power cycles with the console; going as far as leaving it unplugged for 30 minutes. However, after some thinking I hit upon what the issue was overall. I had recently moved the console from one room back to my main room and in the process
 I hooked it into my router. Previous to these issues it was running through wireless. So I disconnected the LAN cable and moved over to having it be on wireless again, and that corrected the problem 100%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems I had a damaged LAN cable that was causing the intermittent log offs from Live.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you everyone who assisted!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Valeria,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HDMI issues can be caused by either software or hardware failure. To isolate the issue, allow us to ask you the following questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the made and model of the micro HDMI adapter?</li><li>Are you getting an error message when you tried to connect the device?</li><li>Does the issue persist when you tried another micro HDMI adapter on your device?</li><li>Does the issue persist when you tried to use the micro HDMI adapter with another Surface device?</li><li>When did the micro HDMI adapter stop working?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to your reply so we could assist you accordingly.</p>

    <title>Microphone not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johncoleman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microphone not working</h2>
                    <p>All of a sudden my microphone stopped working, three different headsets and the built-in mic. When I try to "Set up Microphone" under the Speech Recognition page, I get a warning:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Wizard Would Not Start</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Make sure your audio hardware is working properly</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and check your audio configuration in the Audio</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Devices and Sound Themes (?) control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question mark is my addition since it does not seem to make any sense in this instance, but the Audio Devices, Device Manager, and Sound Settings tab all show that the device is working properly. I am at a complete loss. If this were a problem on only
 one device, then it would be a simple fix. But three separate and distinct headset microphones (1. Microsoft LifeChat LX-3000, 2. Logitech H600 Wireless, and 3. A Turtle Beach Recon 50P) all having the same problem seems like more than a coincidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, when I choose to "listen to this device" in the settings tab, using the headset speakers, the mic works fine, but no one else can hear me, Live chat, game rooms, whatever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

            What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Microphone 
<br />Toggle on Allow apps to access your microphone
<br />
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Microphone
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your Microphone
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level
<br />
<br />Other options:
<br />
<br />1. Play a youtube video with the soundcard speaker jack unplugged and let it play through the laptop's inbuilt speakers.
<br />2. While it is playing, plug in the audio jack and see if it starts playing.

<br />If its Windows 10 1803:
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started.

<h2>            ISP HughesNet satellite is not compatible with Window 10</h2>
                    <p>My Desk top PC was running perfectly with Window 8.1. on July 29 Microsoft introduce Window 10 for free. I said to myself "Why not?" I soon found out some problems, mainly that there was no Internet Explorer available. Window 10 seemed to work until August&nbsp;
 12 when Window 10 installed 10 updates before Shutdown. On August 13 Morning When I tried to boot, it was impossible, my monitor screen stated that the PC couldn't be started due to some elements missing. My telephone was also dead, I had no communications.
 I had to call my ISP with my portable phone to find out about the problems. I was told that the Window 10 wasn't compatible with Hughes Net which control the Ethernet and also provide my telephone service. Apparently Window 10 updates deleted my ISP and many
 other installed programs. My ISP advised me to remove window 10 and reinstate Window 8.1. I had to bring my processor to be repaired. I believe that Microsoft should warn that Window 10 is not for everyone, especially customers that have satellite with Internet
 Hi-Speed and phone services.</p>

            First, whoever it was that told you that Hughesnet is incompatible with Windows 10 is completely incorrect.&nbsp; Secondly, if your Windows 10 installation wiped out your internet settings, that has absolutely nothing to do with Hughesnet.&nbsp; Hughesnet is absolutely
 compatible with Windows 10.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 10 fall creators update network problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thanassissarikas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 fall creators update network problems</h2>
                    <p>Hello,i recently upgraded to windows 10 fall creators update.And after i did i started to have some problems.1st windows were keep changing the driver for my BT dongle keeping it from working.I managed to fix it by going back to the previews version of windows,and
 back to the fall creators again.That was only temporary tho cause after a while the same happened and i did the same steps again....Until one time this procedure broke my keyboard mouse and internet all together,not even a ps2 keyboard was working,everything
 worked up until windows started to load..So the next step in order not to lose everything i have on my system,was an in place upgrade with fall creator dvd disk.This fixed my mouse for good Bt dongle still has the same issues but i manage to make the keyboard
 work...But the big problem now is that my internet only works immediately after the upgrade,if i restart the computer its stop working again.Not even in safe mode.No errors are found in sfc /scannow and no errors in device manager too.I did change the lan
 drivers also.Ping doesnt work failure is 100% reset lan doesnt work also.There is no default gateway at all.I tried to force it in but still doesnt work....Any other ideas?Everything works fine after the in place upgrade as long as i don't restart,what does
 it change after restart and brakes the internet?And how can i fix this.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>
</p><p>We recommend that you check this article on how to <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">fix network connection issues in Windows

<p>Hello,My computer is connected with cable,(i also tried wireless).</p>
<p>No errors are displayed at all....</p>
<p>The BT dongle is a Logitech BT mini receiver,it was a part of a BT mouse and keyboard combo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to solve the network problem by,doing an in place upgrade,but this time didn't choose to keep my settings and apps,and only kept my documents...That got rid of the problem.The BT problem still remain.Now that im writing,BT keyboard is working fine,but
 there is no BT dongle visible at all in system manager,and i cant use it at all to send or receive,since it doesnt see it....This problem started if im not mistaken from the creators update,(not the last one).Before this BT was fine with no problems at all..<br />
</p>
<p>This is how system manager looks now.&nbsp;&nbsp; http://prntscr.com/h8ekvk</p>
<p>And this is how it looks when everything working as it should.&nbsp; http://prntscr.com/h8elxi
</p>
<p>I also get this new error now...when im in the working BT state.&nbsp; http://prntscr.com/h8endr</p>
<p>I found an easy way to make it work most of the times,the dongle has a small red button on it,that its for changing channels...if i take it out and press it while i put it in again,most of the times is working...But it doesnt stay.</p>

            Of course i did,no new drivers available for the hardware in the update....BT dongle is many years old,but it was working fine before the updates.From there on it seems that windows are partially recognise it.

<div>Yes, there are lots of options built into Windows to help you get out of this predicament:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Reboot the machine with your Windows Repair CD, then use System Restore to set Windows back by a few days (works only if you changed the password recently).</li><li>Log on under your spare admin account, then reset the password to your usual account (works only if you set up a spare admin account).</li><li>Log on as Administrator in Safe Mode, then reset the password to your usual account (the password is usually blank).</li><li>Use the password hint (works only if you created a hint and if it is good enough to let you guess the password)</li><li>Check your paper records (works only if you jotted down the password somewhere)</li></ul>

<h2>            manages scheduled tasks stopped working and was closed</h2>
                    
<p>Lately I've been getting this error message often when I start using my Vista PC (Vista Business SP2)&nbsp;in the morning:&nbsp; "manages scheduled tasks stopped working and was closed".&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
And this morning the Windows Defender definitions autoupdate also couldn't install (so I dnld'd and installed that).&nbsp; Autoupdate was reporting "unknown errors" (8 and 57, I think).<br />
<br />
FYI, sfc /scannow reported no integrity violoations with the system files.&nbsp; I also re-imaged my PC about 2 months ago to make sure it was all clean, fresh, and fully up to date before reinstalling all my apps, and it's been kept up to date since then.<br />
<br />
How can this "manages scheduled tasks" application problem be fixed?&nbsp; If you don't know, where can I get an answer?&nbsp; Neither Google nor Bing seem to&nbsp;show any references to the exact phrase ""manages scheduled tasks stopped working stopped working".<br />
<br />

            7/22 update:&nbsp; I'm beginning to suspect a problem of interactions between Vista disable and HP [printer] Digital Imaging Monitor.&nbsp; I tried disabling the latter via msconfig a couple of days ago&nbsp;and haven't seen the errors routinely since, but the jury is
 still out for&nbsp;another week or two.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll report back after a while.<br />
<br />
It is premature to point a finger since we know they&nbsp;each&nbsp;have worked&nbsp;fine normally in the past and they seem equally at risk of corruption.&nbsp; For example, I get no such errors when using the very same HP software on my Win7 PC and I didn't get these errors
 for a couple of months after rebuilding my Vista laptop, so I'm suspecting&nbsp;some piece of software became corrupted (something in Vista, or something in the HP printer monitoring software,&nbsp;or some Windows or run-time &nbsp;software&nbsp;component or registry setting
 one of those&nbsp;relies on).<br />
<br />
Craig in NJ<br />
<br />
7/27 update edit:&nbsp; Since disabling HP Digital Imaging Monitor (hpqtra08.exe) component of the HP printer/scanner drivers more than a week ago, I have not seen the "stopped working and was closed" error messages recur, and Windows Update appears to be working&nbsp;normally.&nbsp;

<h2>            Bluetooth Mouse Disconnects after exactly 30 seconds.</h2>

<p>
</p><p>Since May 01, 2019 (after installing an update related to MS virus definitions or something like that - possibly not connected with the problem) my Bluetooth mouse gets disconnected after 30 seconds. To connect it again, I need to turn it off and on. But
 then it gets disconnected again after 30 seconds. Before May 01 the mouse just worked as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I use USB dongle provided with the mouse everything works as expected.

<p>My system is Surface Book 2 15''. All Windows 10 updates applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the problem was the Bluetooth service which was in "Stopping" state. What is very strange is that this state did not change even after Shutting Down (it seems that "shut down" works more like "hibernate"). The state only changed to "running"
 after RESTARTing the machine.</p>

<h2>            Are there two Operating Systems in my computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you spare a minute on the visual below, it is the startup screen everytime I boot up my laptop after the Windows 10 upgrade (upgraded to activate product key and then clean install by using a Windows 10 boot-up CD made from the Microsoft Media Creation
 Tool).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a2fcce3-7f00-43aa-a445-91b246126f2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a2fcce3-7f00-43aa-a445-91b246126f2c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this mean that there are currently Two operating systems installed in my laptop? FYI, it is a Dell Vostro 3550 64-bit, previous OS is Windows 7 Professional 64-bit. If the answer is yes, how can I remove the old OS and just have the laptop boot to the
 10 automatically without asking me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Andrew</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>This is a good example of why it is important to always boot the installation media to delete all partitions down to Unallocated&nbsp; Space before install, as illustrated in
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
Clean Install Windows 10 Upgrade</a> .&nbsp; That is the only true Clean Install, because leaving partitions on the drive otherwise builds up a disk junkyard.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, the boot partition should be the 100mb partition, but it has been cut out after the install with the boot files moved to Recovery as signified by the
<strong>System Active</strong> labels being there now.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The space used on Recovery also doesn't look like enough to still house Factory Recovery, which is useless after a reinstall anyway unless it's HP which retains the F11 hotlink.&nbsp; So unless it's being used as the separate Windows 10 Recovery partition (which
 only needs to be 250mb) housing built-in repair functions (which I doubt) it is wasted space that could have been avoided by correctly deleting all partitions before install, to let Windows 10 decide what service partitions are needed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your other question, the stray boot listing cannot be a&nbsp; for the old install archived in Windows.old or any other way unless it is still intact in its own separate partition on the drive.&nbsp; It is instead an artifact because the disk wasn't cleared
 correctly.&nbsp; You can remove the ghost listing as I already wrote in msconfig&gt;Boot tab or by installing
<a href="http://neosmart.net/Download/Register/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
EasyBCD (click Download - no Name or Email required)</a> to highlight and delete it on the Edit OS Menu tab.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any further problems arise or if performance isn't perfect then you can always do it over and follow
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
Clean Install Windows 10 Upgrade</a> which assures the best possible install which stays that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any questions?</p>
