<h2>            We limit how frequently you can change your primary alias. Try again next week.</h2>
                    <p>Why? Yes safety blabla.</p>
<p>Why a week? why not using the two-step verification? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to do it urgently.</p>
<p>If you consider posting the link to a service request (or whatever was that I found in a few other posts) please be sure you are posting a serious one. Some of what I found were simply broken and others seemed to take my "service request" but after more
 than 24 hours I still did not get even a confirmation that I have submitted one (which I would expect).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help welcomed.</p>

    <title>Help&#33; two different Skype Accounts associated with one email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kunal_d  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help&#33; two different Skype Accounts associated with one email address.</h2>
                    <p>Hi Skype Technical Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already have a username (<em><strong>let's call this </strong></em><strong><em>X</em></strong>) and password (<strong><em>let's call this Y</em></strong>) along with my email address (<em><strong>let's call this Z</strong></em>) associated to my
<em><strong>Skype Account 1</strong></em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I tried logging into my <em><strong>Skype Account 1</strong></em> with my usual email address (<strong>Z</strong>) and password (<strong>Y</strong>) as the username, Skype automatically created a new
<em><strong>Skype Account 2, </strong></em>which I was not really expecting, a bit surprised about it as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have two different Skype Accounts - <strong>Skype Account 1 </strong>with username
<strong>X</strong> and <strong>Skype Account 2</strong> with username <strong>Z</strong>, both of these accounts are associated with the same email address
<strong>Z</strong>. Is it possible if we can remove <strong>Skype Account 2</strong> without removing my Microsoft Account along with it - thanks!</p>
<p>
Hope to hear back from you soon!&nbsp;</p>

            Hallo kunal_d .
<br />
<br />For your X account Z is security info (not alias).
<br />
<br />When you signed with your email, you created a new account. Here an email is alias.
<br />
<br />If you would like to keep Z as Microsoft account that it is not possible to remove Skype name from it.
<br />
<br />If you do not have anything on your Z Microsoft account you can do:
<br />
<br />1. Rename Z to outlook.com or different name
<br />2. Make a new name primary
<br />3. Delete Z from the alias list
<br />4. Add Z as an alias to the X account (you should use signing option with X name).
<br />
<br />Here you will get X+Z, this will be one account, where you can use 2 names for signing option
<br />
<br />Renamed account, if you don't need it, you can delete.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />Mark

<h2>            Surface Pro keeps asking for Outlook Password - over and over again.....</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro that I use as a secondary PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently changed my password on my main PC.&nbsp; However, I can no longer access email from my Surface Pro.&nbsp; Outlook 2013 keeps asking me for my username and password, but, will not accept them.&nbsp; The dialog box keeps coming back up.&nbsp; All the while I cannot
 send or receive email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a simple solution for this?&nbsp; I have looked all thru support and it seems that this is not uncommon, but, the solutions seem to require an computer science degree to resolve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be nice to input the new password and be on my way, however, that is not an option.&nbsp; Is there something practical?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Absolutely love the device, but, if it does not work, it sorta loses a bit of coolness.....</p>

Thanks for the tips Aravinda!&nbsp; I will give it a try.&nbsp; It does seems like a lot of effort.&nbsp; It would really nice if the dialogue box simply excepted the username and password.

            <p>okay - nothing doing.&nbsp; I think this is a big enough issue to encourage people to not buy this product.&nbsp; It sucks that you can look at email using the device once you chance your password.&nbsp; This, to me anyway, is a very big deal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft, please look into this.&nbsp; It is a major drawback to not be able look at Outlook.&nbsp; This is borderline insane.</p>

            <p>Is it just me or does seem like a very odd and weird solution to a dialogue box that asks for username and password?&nbsp; Should you be able to supply the required information and that's it?&nbsp; Rather than needing an advanced computer science degree to figure
 out?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would really just like to know how I can access work email (from outlook) once I change my password.&nbsp; This should completely disable the email functionality of a device.&nbsp; Why would anyone buy this device of they are trying to do real work?</p>

<h2>            OneNote shared folders, Folder on OneDrive.  Share to Android</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p><span>Hello;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am trying to share a folder I created in OneNote, it is stored on my OneDrive.&nbsp; I can access the folder&nbsp;with no trouble&nbsp;from OneNote on my Android phone.&nbsp; However, when I try
 to share it with my wife’s Android phone I get into difficulties. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I do successfully send a sharing link in email to her Android OutLook The only link in the email is a View In OneDrive link, I wanted to Open in OneNote, not OneDrive but OK I
 click on the link.&nbsp; The link shows me a OneDrive folder and pops up a message that the page cannot be opened in OneDrive and asks if I want to open in a Browser, well no I really do not want to open in a Browser, I want to open in OneNote, but I try the browser,
 it opens the folder.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In a browser the Folder looks bad and is hard to edit.<span>&nbsp;
</span>No problem, the Browser has an Edit in OneNote field, <span>
&nbsp;</span>I ask to edit in OneNote.<span>&nbsp; </span>Up pops a MicroSoft sign in.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I try to sign in with my wife’s <span>&nbsp;</span>credentials, same as her Outlook I sent the link to.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Rejected, MicroSoft Sign in stops this process because this is her “Work Or School Account”, the account is is not her work or school, it is her home account, but Sign In thinks it is work and will not allow further progress (Side question not the main
 point, If it was her work account why should that matter?<span>&nbsp;
</span>I supplied correct credentials, it should work) .</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What a Pain!<span>&nbsp;
</span>Time to cut to the chase, my main question is “How do I put a link in OneNote on my wife’s phone so that the OneNote folder on my OneDrive just opens and all this Outlook to One Drive to a Browser mess is by passed?”</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Side note I do see her OutLook email in OneNote as a work account but it has no folders available.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But the folder is shared to her, I can see the links in Outlook (Same email address)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks</span></p>
<p><span>Nick</span></p>

<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IMAP protocol does not support categories so the option to categorize mail is not available when&nbsp;using IMAP type of email account in Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. If you have any other Office related question, post in Microsoft Community and we will be happy to assist you.</p>

            <p><span>Hi VT,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>GUID is a unique value that distinguishes an individual mailbox from all others.<span> As the email server is changed, the GUID is changed. You may need to set the application to use the new GUID.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To get the GUID of a mailbox in Office 365, you can run the cmdlet below in PowerShell.</span></p>
<p><span><em>Get-Mailbox -Identity 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** | fl GUID</em></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>After you get the new GUID, we suggest you turn to <span>Nylas support&nbsp; to </span>

    <title>Mail For Exchange - Compatability&#47;Downloads menu is a mess. It - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wudang_pal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail For Exchange - Compatability&#47;Downloads menu is a mess. It needs fixing ASAP.</h2>
                    
<p>Using N79</p>
<p>SW 31.002.205.4.<br />
<br />
Up until this morning running MfE 2.9.158. Just been offerred 2.9.160 via App.Update. Post install check indicates this has been available for months - why the delay in pushing it through to App.Update?<br />
<br />
MfE 2.9.160 still not fixed old issue of being unable to open MfE settings following phone restart - why not? - threads dating back to 1st quarter 2009! but this one explains the issue precisely:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/DD5C31BB-E6FE-4FD8-AA44-1F89FA5F573F">/t5/Messaging-Email-and-Browsing/Mail-for-Exchange-corrupted/m-p/603626/highlight/true#M21922</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's the only app on my phone that cannot be routinely opened - not good.<br />
<br />
Notwithstanding this idiosyncrasy email syncing is more hit than miss but&nbsp; falls way short of my iPod touch which is 100% rock solid regarding Exchange compatability. Does Nokia want Exchange Server based customers- my guess is not enough. Generally speaking
 if I notice emails hitting my iPod but not my N79 it's time for a&nbsp; phone restart.&nbsp; But that&nbsp; kills the ability to open MfE settings So it's back to a re-install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above isn't bad enough Nokia has just made it worse.&nbsp; This "current" link from the N79 support page is dead;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://businesssoftware.nokia.com/mail_for_exchange_downloads.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://businesssoftware.nokia.com/mail_for_exchange_downloads.php</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and after much dead-ending find that the Ovi Store now contains MfE - no problem with that it makes sense to consolidate. But no mention of N79 being supported by the latest greatest MfE and Ovi only lists 3.0 as supporting FP1 phones - so wht about FP2?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is my N series phone supported anymore - I've got no idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wake up Nokia it's 2010 not 1990 - we shouldn't have to put&nbsp; up with this **bleep** in basic functionality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Judging by lack of action over the past 12 months have no hope Nokia will put this right but that my dear Nokia is how you lose customers to your rivals Apple and RIM. Pull your finger out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had the 160 version offered a long time ago through updates, tho. Usin 158 now, but don't see any difference.&nbsp;Is there a changelog somewhere?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now Ovi Store doesn't say which version of MfE it is (at least in the desktop browser), so I'm not sure I'd get the latest from there.</p>

<p>Can update further -but no thanks to Nokia Tier Level 2 support staff who promised to get back within an hour but so far haven't called in 24 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deciding that MfE was buggy anyway and I've got 2.9.158 tucked away for re-install I thought I'd see what happens if I downloaded 3.0 from the Ovi store. What's to lose?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interesting result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It downloaded, it installed and I'm now running 2.09.208</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hardly intuitive and definitely not 3.0.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, my experiment yields the following results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ovi 3.0 (seemingly aka 2.09.208) appears to support FP2 phones on the basis the N79 is FP2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amazingly just restarted phone and against my best guess actually still allows MfE settings to be accessed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So 3.0, as of now, works perfectly on the N79.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At worst Nokia's support function is doing a huge disservice to their technical side.</p>
<p>At best Nokia have only the easy bit to put right - how difficult can it be to update the support page of a web site?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. I reserve my right to&nbsp; rant in the near future if MfE starts playing up.</p>

<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>i'm not sure if this is the right discussion, but i am trying to figure out why nokia is not giving E71 users the avalability of Mfe via the new nokia email client!!!!</p>
<p>i know that for hardware requirements reasons, feature pack 2 will not be available for E71. but why not giving us some of those advantages like:</p>
<p>- Access Points destinations</p>
<p>- have the Mfe built into the nokia email client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>kindly advise if this topic was addresses in a different discussion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you</p>

<p>MfE reverting to type.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phone has now decided that following&nbsp; a restart it is preferable&nbsp; to disallow Settings from being accessed</p>

<p>I'm having some issues with MfE from Ovi Store on the N79. On restart of the phone MfE just freezes and doesn't work until next restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ovi Store still doesn't tell me which version is there to download, so I don't know if I can get a newer one from there.</p>

<p>I'm hoping this fix works for me long term and post as is.</p>
<p><br />
Multiple phone calls to Nokia Tier 1 and 2 phone support heavily supplemented by some determined Google searching led me to the following solution.</p>
<p><br />
First off the bad news. To fix the MfE issue requires a hard reset of the device. There's no way around this so resign yourself to it early.</p>
<p><br />
The good news however is you can dramatically reduce the time needed to return your device back to its pre-reset condition by backing up your device using Ovi Suite. Forget to do this and you'll be re-installing your apps one at a time.</p>
<p><br />
My issue was made more difficult because the usual hard re-set code (*#7370 #) would not reset the device i.e. full recovery of phone memory, complete wiping of contacts etc. Ignoring Nokia's advice to return the phone for repair! I turned up an alternative
 method which achieved the hard re-set I was seeking.</p>
<p><br />
As follows:<br />
Hold these three keys down - *, 3 and green accept call - whie the phone is off, then power on keeping them depressed until the Nokia logo plays.</p>
<p><br />
On the N79 this involves an usual amount of manual dexterity but nevertheless worked where the re-set code failed. Hopefully this won't be necessary for most users.</p>
<p><br />
Once re-set you will be presented with the Set up menu as per a new phone.</p>
<p><br />
With a fully recovered phone memory you can now restore your earlier backup via Ovi Suite, which for me did 90% of the work needed to get my phone back to its earlier personalised condition. I took the opportunity of checking for any programme updates of essential
 apps and updated as necessary. Re-installation of Speed Dial settings and permitted Bluetooth devices amongst other items was required but all in all all my data and file structure was faithfully restored first time around.</p>
<p><br />
I am now running MfE 3.0 (actually 2.09.208 - see initial thread posting ) which Nokia support advise is not supported&nbsp; for the N79 -&nbsp; given the varying level of advice received I'm prepared to run with my own view that it works fine. If you wish to play safe
 you should be running 2.9.160.<br />
I have re-booted the phone multiples times over the last two days and on only one occasion (which I'm going to pretend never happened) MfE has been rock solid. In addition Ovi Maps which had stopped opening - and was fundamentally what set me off down the road
 of a hard re-set - is now working perfectly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm hoping this cures the irritating MfE problem long term pending Nokia sorting out whether they even support the N79 any longer as far as MfE is concerned.</p>
<p><br />
As a sign off I will just say for my purposes the N79 is the best smartphone I've ever owned and supplemented with an iPod Touch is a fantastic work/play combination. If you are allowed tethering on your contract I contend Walking Hot Spot is THE killer app
 and so confident am I of my choice of phone I've just bought a second N79, at a much reduced price, which I'm going to use as a backup/extension to my existing N79 when it dies and goes to heaven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this post saves someone else some timeand effort.</p>

            You need a unique ID field to be entered in the first column of each sheet. &nbsp;If the Name is definitely unique then you can use this.
<div><br />
<div>The value in A2 ("Snoopy") of the Calendar sheet needs to be manually entered. &nbsp;This can be done using a Data Validation list which refers to column A of the Participants sheet.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Columns B &amp; C in the Calendar sheet need to be formulas like this:</div>
<div>In B2: =VLOOKUP($A2,Participants!$A:$C,COLUMN(Participants!$B$1),FALSE)</div>
<div>In C2: =VLOOKUP($A2,Participants!$A:$C,COLUMN(Participants!$C$1),FALSE)</div>
<div><br />
<div>That way if the Participants sheet is sorted the Calendar sheet will still look up the correct data.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps.</div>

<h3> greenestguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adobe Send&#38;Track add-in for Outlook 2016 first appeared as an option in email window&#59; now it has to be done manually</h2>
                    <p>On 8/15/2016, yesterday morning I was sending an email attachment when the "Adobe Send &amp; Track" add-in first appeared as a check box along the RH margin, just above the text box for the e-mail. &nbsp;Checked the option, and the process worked smoothly:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">This is a 64-bit installation of Office365Personal/Office 2016 applications running on Windows 7 Home Premium, SP1, installed on an AMD quadcore CPU based PC with 8/possible 16 Gb DDR3 and running an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 750 Ti with
 2048 MB onboard gDDR5 matched with another dedicated 2048 MB of RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I could determine this was a 'one-shot' happenstance as I could not find the "SendTrack add-in" etc. in the listings for my Outlook application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the process worked so well I then went to Adobe to sign up for the first year's service to see how it would work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adobe calls the "Outlook Send&amp;Track add-in a plug-in, but otherwise paid for it, no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, 8/16/2016, the next day, the option for "Adobe Send&amp; Track" no longer appears in the Outlook 2016 window as a checkable box on the right hand above the text field --&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;First issue -- why not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I had formulated the email, today, just as I did yesterday, it turned out I had to redo the email, starting manually from the Adobe "Send&amp;Track" page on the adobe.com website.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Would much prefer the original configuration, as a check box to use "send and track" on the RH margin above the box for email text in the Outlook window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The explanation which occurs to me is that ?? perhaps the original appearance of the option check box for "Adobe Send&amp;Track" was an indication the add-on/add-in/plug-in was available from the last update, the previous day? &nbsp;And so I have in effect installed
 or activated the version from the Adobe website which supercedes the "Adobe Send&amp;Track" add-in which was provided in the latest update to Outlook 2016?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its a puzzle, how someone has a better idea than I of the overall picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Actually, here is an update. More hours on phone with MS, they escalated it to tier 2, now is with tier 3. It is a SERVER issue [not a computer issue] and MANY others have had it happen to them, as well. Might have helped if they had a program in place to
 flag email addresses that did not go properly over to the server during migration. Now TWO Months and not able to access my Hotmail account via desktop. Can read via my phone app, but that is cumbersome and useless for actual business correspondence.&nbsp; Have
 not yet heard back about WHERE my many years of email records are.&nbsp; Have not yet heard back from the server techs.&nbsp; Tried again this morning, STILL no access.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Was not able to get to it via Incognito.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I could access other smaller hotmail email accounts. It is a single account on server issue.</p>

<p>Having the same issue. &nbsp;When I look at the details in the error message, it states there is a server issue. &nbsp;MS has the client ID - they could proactively manage the issue. &nbsp;Wish they would.</p>

<h2>            How to gain back access to my email&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Basically, I registered a gmail account with microsoft (It is not the one I am using to ask this question). It all worked fine until one fine day when I could not log into skype using that account anymore. The message that popped up was 'Something went wrong.&nbsp;<span>There
 is a problem with your Microsoft account. To fix this, sign in to account.live.com from a browser.' I tried to do so but this page kept popping up that said 'You've lost access to your email.&nbsp;</span><span>The
 inbox you've been using is no longer available. This can occur when your account is owned by an organization, or when someone else confirms ownership of the email address.</span><br />
<span>You
<span>You
 haven't lost access to the other services you use with your Microsoft account. However, you must choose a new primary alias to continue.</span><span>'&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, the thing is that the account is my personal account and for some reason this message that my account is owned by an organisation still pops up. Could someone please help me figure this out? Thanks in advance.</span><br />

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 630 blank black screen</h2>
                    My phone is only a few months old. It suddenly went to the black screen and I have followed instructions to restart but nothing works. When I press power key I notice a small vibration and also when I put it on charger.<br />
Is there anywhere on the phone that I can press to see if the screen has just gone black. I can't see anything at all. Any help gratefullly appreciated ...thanks

<p>Tried pulling off the battery ? If Yes then try pressing the "Power Key" till it vibrates and wait for the device to restart.<br />
<br />
If both done is there SD card inserted ? If yes try to remove it first and then restart the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If This also doesnt work then I suppose you will need to Hard Reset the device( at your own discretion )</p>

            Thanks, I have tried everything, even hard reset. It still has nothing on the screen. It still vibrates but blank black screen. Do you know if there is a way to turn the screen off or on or make it brighter from the handset? My understanding is there is
 only the power key and the volume up or down keys on the side of the handset..

            <p>Hi! I've encountered the same problem. My phone starts up to a blank screen. The backlight is on and my Windows computer detects it and can transfer files from it. I was able to reinstall the software using the Windows phone recovery tool, but still no luck.
 The phone's screen is still blank. But when I press the places where the windows button should be, and also the search and back button, it vibrates in response. Please help?</p>

<h3> rip west  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calendar month view multiple appointments</h2>
                    <p>I like the month view for appointments. However, when I have an appointment at 11am and an appointment at 7:30pm, only the first one shows up on month view. When I switch to day view and click on the 7:30 appointment, and then go back to month view, they
 both show&nbsp; up, giving me what I want. However, is I switch to mail, they disappear again. There must be an easier way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it makes a difference, the earlier appointment&nbsp; could be a recurring one.</p>

    <title>Excel Issues since running Office update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jf3loop  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Issues since running Office update</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed an update on Office 365 software as prompted.</p>
<p>I am now trying to open an xlsx file that was created a month or so before the upgrade (8th October 2015).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I do I receive an error message "There was a problem while sending the command to the program".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file then opens as a read-only file with a new file name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I resolve this issue so that my xlsx files open properly as it did before the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note I upgraded to Office 365 in June and Windows 10 in September - this is just an update to those and not an upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using an Acer PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice gratefully received.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Try following (Try point 2 first) -<br />
<br />
1. Update your office as well as Windows 10 to latest patches from Microsoft site. Microsoft keeping releasing Office and Windows 10 patches to correct known errors.<br />
<br />
2. Repair the office installation - https://support.office.com/en-NZ/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b<br />
<br />
3. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\") and see if is contains
 few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.<br />
<br />
4. You may login to Windows with a new user profile and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
5. Review following link - https://community.office365.com/en-us/w/manage/office-365-and-windows-10-problems-and-solutions<br />
<br />
6. Turn off Hey Cortana and reboot your computer (useful particularly if Excel performance is slow).<br />
<br />
7. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.<br />
<br />
8. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
9. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start Excel in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. If yes, then start Excel normally and disable add-ins one by one and start Excel again every time you disable an add-in
 to determine the culprit add-in.<br />
<br />
To start Excel in Safe Mode -<br />
<br />
Hold CTRL key and click on Excel icon<br />
OR<br />
In the Search Box above Windows icon, type "Excel /s" without quotes and enter.<br />
<br />
10. Issues in Protected View<br />
<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; File Block Settings &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
<br />
(For reference, You may review the following thread - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/cannot-open-some-office-files-after-upgrading-from/c103ee49-2e87-4421-ad96-f433ec77ec54)<br />
<br />
11. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15, look for EXCEL.EXE<br />
Right Click on this, Properties, In Compatibility tab, check ""Run this Program as an Administrator""<br />
Start the Excel. You might again get the error. Close Excel and uncheck "Run this Program as an Administrator" and start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore.<br />
(If folder path is not correct, you will have to find EXCEL.EXE manually, like Program Files (x86) may be Program Files. Or you can even search for EXCEL.EXE in your C: drive<br />
<br />
12. File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced - In General section (go very much down in Advanced), check "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)". Close and re-start the Excel. Uncheck "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)".
 Close and re-start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore. (Basically, DDE should remain unchecked)<br />
<br />
13. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Open Excel.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click on file, Options.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the Advanced tab.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click ok and restart Excel.<br />
<br />
14. If above don't, re-installation of office may (and may not also) solve your problem. Remove MS Office completely by downloading Fixit tool and from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 and running it. Make sure that you have license keys ready before
 you attempt re-installation. If you don't have license keys, please do not attemp re-installation. You can also install MS Office by logging into www.office.com/myaccount if you have registered your copy.

<h2>            Can I uninstall office and reinstall from same laptop without it counting as another install&#63;</h2>
                    I purchased office 365 and it loaded fine on desktop and phone but on laptop with windows 7 when I try to sign in using word or any of the others it says;
<strong><u>sorry we are having temporary server issues</u></strong>. That was yesterday and it still says that today. I can go to office and sign in without a problem. So I don't know what the problem is. I cannot save to SkyDrive if I cannot sign in. Any ideas?
 Should I uninstall and reinstall?

<h2>            Now cannot sync with Outlook 2007 and WMDC 6.1 running on Windows Vista on my Palm Treo 500</h2>

                    <span>
<p>After using WMDC with my Palm treo 500 for one year with no problem suddenly my Palm failed to sync with Outlook. I've had minor synchronization issues in the past but I've&nbsp;always&nbsp;solved these in the past by deleting and recreating a partnership. Recently,
 I tried this when my Palm failed to sync and now my Palm is empty of contacts and&nbsp;appointments.. I've tried deleting and reinstalling WMDC 6.1 and have tried downgrading to WMDC 6.0 but without success. I can connect to the Palm and even browse in the file
 system but just not sync. Any ideas would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Greetings Xav1.&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Phone forums!</p>
<p>It sounds like WMDC wasn't able to properly detect your installation of Outlook (since you were able to detect the device and browse it's contents).&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, I would recommend the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete your Partnerships on both the PC and your Palm Treo.&nbsp; Power Restart each device.</li><li>Uninstalling WMDC 6.0 and rebooting your computer (again).&nbsp; </li><li>I would then run the Scan &amp; Repair utilty for Outlook 2007&nbsp;(see <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/scan-and-repair-corrupted-outlook-data-files-HA010075831.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> for directions). </li><li><strong>After</strong> confirming Outlook PST is healthy, I would then re-install the latest version of WMDC.</li></ul>
<p>Contacts created originally on your phone will still reside on your phone, and contacts originally created on your PC should still reside on your PC, so when they are both synchronized, you *should* still have all contacts, etc.</p>
<p>Let us know how things turn-out!</p>

<h2>            how to verify the connection between PC&#47;vista and E51 for PC suite</h2>
                    
<p>I have made an upgrade of the E1 phone software and of the PC suite (over a Vista PC)</p>
<p>I am realy disappointed !</p>
<p>Even if PC sync and the sending/receiving of SMS is still working fine,</p>
<p>There are many functions that are not working anymore and I do not know how to verify that the installations were done properly:</p>
<p>1- MMS: my phone MMS sending is working. it does not work anymore from PC suite (message: failed to send the message) but SMS sending is working fine</p>
<p>2-Notifications: none are available (this is confirmed in the parameters menu)</p>
<p>3- internet access: I am a subscriber of Bouygues in France. I have selected F Bouygues in the config of the connection ! does not work. I have had to set manualy the configuration with the APN ebouygtel to get it working !</p>
<p>4- Initiating a call from the PC: when I right click on a contact, the call option is in grey</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anybodody to help here ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
