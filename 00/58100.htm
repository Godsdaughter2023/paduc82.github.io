<h2>            LaserJet Pro MFP M125nw not working on Windows 10 - Security Problem&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have decided to re-post this problem here as I am convinced that it is a Windows Security fault. I received no help at all to the original post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I posted back in May and which a member of the HP team resolved has now returned.<br />
All was well with printing from my two Windows 7 laptops (one on Pro, the other on Ultimate) but on updating both
<del>within the last two days</del> to Windows 10 Pro then wham! The symptoms are exactly as before:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. WordPerfect X7 (the latest version) and QuatroPro X7 will print a document containing a picture (say clipart), but not if it contains any typed text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Excel 2010 similarly, but Word 2010 will not print anything. Neither will WordPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Notepad prints text!</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Lotus 1-2-3 Release 9 and Lotus WordPro print a picture but not text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Acrobat Reader will print <del>any</del> most .pdf document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. The scanner works fine, and so does printing to a Canon InkJet. Both printers are on Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution proposed by HP Support was to set User Account Control to "Never notify" and this worked fine until Windows 10......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any other solution? My guess is that it is embedded somewhere in security tied in with the different transmission methods of the different programs and document types.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in anticipation!</p>
<p>-----------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Update to my original post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the solution for Windows 7 (set User Account Control to "Never notify") seemed to show that security was the blocking factor would there be something in Local Security Policy editor that is causing the problem in Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The settings are numerous and dauntingly confusing to the layman and I have no wish to fiddle around there without guidance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone able to help and advise me? <strong>P</strong><strong>lease no fatuous answers such as "reload drivers".
</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried that over two weeks ago! The current position is that changing the UAC setting worked for Windows 7 back in May when the problem with the printer first occurred but it&nbsp; does not work for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just tried reloading the HP drivers using Win 7 compatibility mode but there is no improvement.</p>

<p>Normal 0 false false false MicrosoftInternetExplorer4 </p>
<p>Over the last couple weeks, I’ve gotten a few private messages, here and there, from people asking for deck advice, cuts to make, etc.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, I’ve been unable to post here until now, due to someone temporarily banning me (with absolutely zero explanation).<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Awesome Move, whoever you are,<span>&nbsp; </span>No way that was an egotistical power trip!</p>

<span>&nbsp;</span>and digest the new format a little, Here is my take on the best decks…</p>
<p>I began by recording results of worst match-ups.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Playing through the decks (and recording results) I started to look at which match-ups were statistically giving me the hardest time for each given deck. Then an interesting pattern arose:</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;Jace<span>&nbsp; </span>worst match-up<span>&nbsp; </span>Chandra </li><li>Nissa<span>&nbsp; </span>worst match-up<span>&nbsp; </span>Chandra </li><li>Soren worst match-up <span>&nbsp;</span>Chandra </li><li>Sarkhan<span>&nbsp; </span>worst match-up<span>&nbsp; </span>Chandra </li><li>Chandra<span>&nbsp; </span>worst match-up<span>&nbsp; </span>Garruk </li><li>Koth<span>&nbsp; </span>worst match-up<span>&nbsp; </span>Garruk </li><li>Gideon<span>&nbsp; </span>worst match-up<span>&nbsp; </span>Soren </li><li>G/U<span>&nbsp; </span>worst match-up<span>&nbsp; </span>Soren </li><li>Tezzeret<span>&nbsp; </span>worst match-up<span>&nbsp; </span>Soren </li><li>Garruk<span>&nbsp; </span>worst match-up<span>&nbsp; </span>Soren </li></ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that said, the three best decks would be: Chandra, Garruk, Soren.<span>&nbsp;
</span>These three decks also form a Rock, Paper, Scissors effect among themselves, which is probably the reason the game is so well-balanced.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>I had initially suspected Chandra and Soren as being 2 of the 3 best decks when I first unlocked all the cards.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Garruk, on the other hand, surprised me.<span>&nbsp; </span>Now Garruk may seem weak, in that he is the best choice against only 2 decks.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But the fact that he beats Chandra is really significant.<span>&nbsp; </span>Also many of his other match-ups are pretty solid.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I get the impression that when they set out to make this game, they really applied some thought in making Mono Green good this time around.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I’m also predicting that when they do start hiding the opening deck selection (which they will), “Little kid Green” will emerge as a powerhouse player, and possibly even the statistical best deck.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>This is entirely my opinion, based on my own observations and experiences…</p>

<p>I have to respectfully disagree with some of that. I wouldn't call it flaming though. The thing I disagree with the most is Garruk being anywhere near good. Koth's hardest match-up is most definitely not Garruk. Claws of Valakut (a horrible card but insane
 in this match-up) on any creature wrecks Garruk. <span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">I believe Garruk's hardest match-up to be Kiora</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">.</span> She</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">&nbsp;ramps faster, has better
 creatures and has some control cards</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)"> where Garruk only has Serrated Arrows (which doesn't cut it vs Kiora)</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">.</span></span>
</span><i><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">arresting</span></i><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"> creatures won't stop the benefits they give each other. Not only that but Nissa has 3 ways to handle artifacts (Argentum Armor) and 3 ways to enchantments (Arrest). On top
 of all that Nissa has multiple ways to handle Baneslayer Angel (I believe 6 ways). Chandra while good vs Gideon can still lose to the occasional Sword of War and Peace. Nissa doesn't care about Protection from red.
 Kiora is the hardest for my build (I don't play Sizzle</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"> and Lava Axe).</span></span></span></p>

<p>not going to flame. &nbsp; As an engineer with some background in collecting data i am having to say that your data is skewed to your playstyle/deck build. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;while i agree you can't change the decks much you can alter them noticeably and different people will
 have different experiences...was your chandra deck identical to the chandra deck you played against? &nbsp;was your opponents skill with the cards as good as yours........unless you played with friends with identical decks the data is only part of the picture...i
 think it's a step in the right direction however. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;i'm starting my own analysis but I am going to use it to tweak my decks and just look for weaknessess in my own playstyle rather then the decks..</p>
<p>interesting stuff though..</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>I'm sorry but your data is heavily skewed. &nbsp;Although some decks have an advantage over others this advantage often relies upon specific cards being played or using a tactic that can exploit another deck's weakness, such as aggro or evasion. &nbsp;You keep talking
 about how great Garruk's deck is yet you neglect to mention it lacks any removal, and is extremely weak against fliers. &nbsp;Heck, it does not even have any Naturalize cards so once a few cards are in play it could easily be game over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, sometimes letting damage through is the best strategy for a given deck as it means you can now counter attack. &nbsp;Such is the case for playing Chandra against Garruk as her creatures lack toughness yet have significant power by being pumped. &nbsp;Again,
 your opinions seem rather limited considering that personal playing style makes a huge difference in how a specific deck will play. &nbsp;Even worse, a deck might get decimated one match due to being land starved/flooded or lacking the proper cards while the next
 it could be downright godly. &nbsp;In the end there are far too many variables involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the record the top tier decks based upon the general consensus on the Wizard's forums are considered to be Jace's Realms of Illusion, Gideon's Wielding Steel and Sorin's Blood Hunger (for the crazy amount of removal alone). &nbsp;Chandra's Unquenchable Fire
 is not far behind however and Kiora's Ancient Depths has too much potential to ignore but neither are top tier. &nbsp;Keep in mind that all of the decks are fairly well balanced but the rest seem to lack any diversity in their tactics as most are straight aggro
 or simply lack card synergy. &nbsp;Machinations suffers from auto-land tapping and the inability to adjust your land values, as does Sarkhan's Dragon's Roar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, all of this will change after the first DLC is released.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;JayendraGandhi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In order for me to address your concern, I would like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you using any newly installed program on your computer?</li><li>When did you started to get this error message?</li><li>Were there any changes made on your computer recently?</li><li>What is the version and build of your computer?
<ul>
<li>You can have this checked by pressing the <strong>Windows button + R</strong> on your keyboard to open the
<strong>Run</strong> box, then type <em><strong>winver</strong></em> and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li></ul>
</li><li>What is the make and model of your computer?</li><li>Are there any SmartCards installed on your computer?</li><li>Is this a work computer connected to a company network?<br />
<br />

<h2>            How do I delete file ehthumbs_vista.db&#63;</h2>
                    I cannot modify contents of a folder that contains movies I recorded from DVDs.&nbsp; I recently installed Win7 Ultimate on a notebook and used the Media Center to load the DVD files for viewing.&nbsp; I tried adding some more movie titles to the folder, but am
 denied access.&nbsp; I have tried making all the related files and folder "not" read only, but annot do that for the ehthumbs_vista.db file.&nbsp; I think there is a relation between this hidden read only file and my access denial to modify the contents of the folder.&nbsp;
 When I try to delete the file it says I need access from some other cryptic source (name is long series of letters and number.&nbsp; I am logged on as a Administrator, but am never prompted to grant access as an administrator to delete the file.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
How can I delete this file?&nbsp; Or if there is another reason I can't copy files into the folder please help.

            Hi NFarrow
<br />
<br />That upgrade has not gone as planned, the user is running Windows 10 Enterprise, not the Pro Edition . . .
<br />
<br />The only option to resolve this will be to contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you activate your Windows 10 Pro, by changing that back form the Enterprise Edition . . .

<h3> sandra buskey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shut down or sign out menu has changed...</h2>
                    <p>As of two days ago, the <strong>Shut down or sign out</strong> menu offers options to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sign out</p>
<p>Sleep</p>
<p>Hibernate</p>
<p>Update and shut down</p>
<p>Shut down</p>
<p>Update and restart</p>
<p>Restart</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if I click <strong>Update and shut down</strong> or <strong>Update and restart</strong>, no update happens. &nbsp;The system simply shuts down or restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running:</p>
<p>Windows 10 Home</p>
<p>Version 1511</p>
<p>OS Build 10586.545</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can tell, this is the latest build for this version, so why the extra options on the shut down/restart menu?</p>
<p>Previously, the "update" options only appeared when an update was available, so I'm a bit confused. &nbsp;Is there an update that is not installing?</p>
<p>

                    <p>So I'm having trouble with NumLock defaulting on the Logon screen in Windows 10.&nbsp; I have a Dell Inspiron 15R.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I tried the following;</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Logon screen, press the NumLock key on the keyboard to turn it on.&nbsp; On the bottom right corner of the Login screen I clicked the power button to reboot Windows.</li><li>using Registry tweak, InitialKeyboardIndicators under HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Control Panel\Keyboard using code(s)&nbsp; 2147483650 then tried 80000002 as well as just 2
</li></ol>
<p>Before installing Win10 it worked as desired (I did #2 above using code "2").&nbsp; Anyone find a solution?</p>

            <p>OK I found an old solution (Windows 8.1) but after applying, it works in Windows 10 as well, although there were "different" paths to get there.&nbsp; So try this (for it to take effect you will need to restart):</p>
<ol>
<li>First do #2 above - Press Win+R keys on your keyboard, the "Run" dialog will appear. Type regedit without quotes and press Enter.&nbsp; &nbsp;under HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Control Panel\Keyboard select "InitialKeyboardIndicators" in "Value data" type in &nbsp;2 ;&nbsp; then OK

    <title>Perfmon &#47;Report in Windows 8.1 produces weird results - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mehdibens  say:</h3>
<h2>            Perfmon &#47;Report in Windows 8.1 produces weird results</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have just updated my Windows 8 Pro to Windows 8.1 Pro two days ago and I like it a lot. In fact, I love it! Because it seems much faster than Windows 8 Pro. The concern now I have is that when I launched a perfmon test, two weird things occurred:</p>
<p>1) It says I do not have administrative rights:</p>
<p>Error message: </p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>

<td>
<div>An error occured while attempting to generate the report.
</div>
</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td><br />
<div>The operator or administrator has refused the request.</div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I still can find the reports generated using the console (I launched Perfmon.exe and browsed to the reports)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now that's the second part</p>
<p>2) Everything (CPU, RAM, Graphics...) seem to have a low rating and Windows alarms me that I should consider freeing up applications and stuff knowing that I do not feel there is a problem. In fact, My Windows PC is faster than ever before, less resource
 consumption is notable.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I realized that Microsoft removed the Windows Experience Index, which it seems to me, was what used to make the ratings (or at least display them).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I think that is the problem and that is what causes the error messages to be displayed.
</p>
<p>Can you please tell me if you think that's the reason why I receive these messages, or if I should consider performing hardware diagnostics. My PC has less than two years and seems to work fine.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you in advance</p>
<p><br />
</p>

<h2>            KB2976978 now cannot be uninstalled via Control Panel or WUSA&#59; new W-10 push&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just clean-installed a W-8.1 PC. At every step of the way, I deselected "Give me recommended updates the same way I receive important updates." Then I searched through the updates for telemetry and W-10 updates and uninstalled them, except for KB2976978
 which refuses to be uninstalled (when I&nbsp;select it in the dialog for uninstalling updates, the Uninstall pushbutton never appears). Then I tried to uninstall it via WUSA, but I was given "This update is required by your computer and cannot be uninstalled."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So has Microsoft initiated the next phase of forcing Windows 10 onto all 7 and 8.1 PCs, even ones with hardware that cannot accommodate it?</p>

            <p>I clean-installed two different PCs in the past few days: an HP laptop via an HP 8 Pro CD-ROM then updated to 8.1 Pro via Microsoft Store, and a custom-built desktop via an 8.1 Pro CD-ROM downloaded from microsoft.com (I have a genuine retail activation
 code). Both drives are SSDs which were wiped using hdparm on Linux.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't remember the KB #s of the one or two updates I uninstalled, but they were from this set: KB3068708, KB3080149, KB3044374, and KB3075853, all either telemetry or Windows 10 greasers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to uninstall KB2976978 two ways. First, I used the usual technique of going to the Control Panel screen where updates can be removed. Every other update on that screen can be removed by left-clicking on it to select it and then left-clicking on the
 context-dependent Uninstall button which appears at the top. Second, I tried WUSA -- wusa /uninstall /kb:2976978 -- but a dialog popped up with the message: "This update is required by your computer and cannot be uninstalled."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something recently changed. Up until recently, KB2976978 was capable of being uninstalled. It was the primary update Microsoft used to force Windows 10 onto unsuspecting PCs. The aforementioned desktop has a Creative sound card that DOES NOT WORK with Windows
 10, so I don't want it to ever move to Windows 10. And the aforementioned laptop was bought long before August 2013, the date HP has officially announced as the cutoff date for Windows 10 support.</p>
<p>http://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c04730900</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the quoted comment that "There is no GWX or upgrade functionality contained in this update": Microsoft lied to us quite a bit over the last year regarding Windows 10 updates and telemetry, so why should we believe it now?</p>

            <p>I'm not going to answer your questions line-by-line because you refuse to read what I wrote. I specifically wrote "Both drives are SSDs which were wiped using hdparm on Linux" yet you blathered on about HDDs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I WIPED THE SSD! Therefore nothing remains from the previous OS, which was W-7 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it was an HDD, I would have used WDC Lifeguard or DBAN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't understand Linux, so I will explain hdparm. It does a lot of things, but it secure-erases SSDs. That's what I used. Then I created a partition on the drive using a W-7 system, allowing it to quick-format. Nothing was left on the drive. Here is
 the Arch page on hdparm: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Solid_State_Drives/Memory_cell_clearing. It works on all SSDs I have seen except Samsung enterprise.</p>

            I figured it out myself. As I suspected, it had nothing to do with my hardware, AV, or previous SW.<br />
<br />
Microsoft now offers KB3044374 as an important update on the very first execution of Windows Update, with this update NOT being important to users, but it does appear to be important to Microsoft's new business model. It is the gateway for more telemetry and
 Windows 10 greasers.<br />
<br />
For everyone building a new 8.1 system, the update setting must be set to NO UPDATES during installation. Then after login is allowed, start Control Panel and click on "Check for updates." Immediately verify that "Give me recommended updates the same way I
 receive important updates" is not selected. When the initial list of updates is displayed, find KB3044374 and hide it. Look through all updates that start with "Updates for Windows 8.1 for" and hide all that mention telemetry and upgrades to future versions
 of Windows. Yes, it's a pain given the long list of them.<br />
<br />
And for every cycle of updates after that, verify that "Give me recommended updates the same way I receive important updates" is not selected and look through all updates that start with "Updates for Windows 8.1 for" and hide all that mention telemetry and
 upgrades to future versions of Windows.

 I was using a disc downloaded from Microsoft? It was installed before I logged in, before I started Windows Update, with a date of 11/21/2014.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated on this query. We apologize for the delay in response.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Blue Screen error usually occurs when a serious problem causes the computer to shut down or restart unexpectedly. This type of errors usually happens when there are some driver issues on the computer. However, it might also
 be due to some other software/hardware reasons.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In this case, the <strong><span>System Thread Exception Not Handled</span></strong> error seems to be due to the incompatible or old graphics card drivers on the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In order to fix this issue, the computer must be restarted in safe mode. Once after booting the computer in Safe Mode, you have to uninstall the incompatible device driver from the Device Manager, and then download and install the latest drivers from
 the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Boot the computer in Safe Mode</strong>, and check if the issue is resolved<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer with limited drivers necessary to run Windows. The words
<strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you are using.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Use the power button on the sign-in screen to <strong>
Shift + Restart</strong>. This will take you to the recovery boot menu. </p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> Click <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>,
<strong>Advanced options</strong>, <strong>Startup settings</strong>. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You then see a list where you can choose&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong><span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Safe Mode with Networking</span></strong><span>&nbsp;(depending on whether you think you’ll need the Internet).</span></p>

<h2>            Sound Problem in my Windows 10&#58; Volume goes up when the PC idle and the screen goes off.</h2>
                    <p>Please help me solve this issue. I realized this problem when i was playing songs in itunes. When the screen goes off (idle), the volume of the music goes up by its self. But when i press some button to make the screen goes on again, the volume goes down
 to its previous condition. I thought it was the itunes, but when i do the same thing using another apps, the same thing happens. I dont know what causes this because this problem happens recently. It never happened before.</p>
<p>I havent seen other people having this issue.</p>

 Setup couldn't create a SYSTEM.MDW file. After setup is completed, reboot and then run the Workgroup Administrator before you run this application (-1011)</p>

<p>Every product has a life cycle, therefore a product cannot&nbsp;live forever. Why are you using office<strong>1997</strong> while&nbsp;today's already&nbsp;<strong>2010</strong>?</p>
<p>If you really need to run legacy applications that bad, use virtualization. Examples are Microsoft Virtual PC 2007 (replaced by Windows Virtual PC in win 7) or VMWare or Sun VirtualBox etc etc. I've successfully installed MS DOS 6.22, Windows 98, Windows
 XP, and Ubuntu 9.10 inside MS Virtual PC 2007. (on top of my virtual Windows XP, I installed office 2003 and it worked fine)</p>

<p><span>Hi, Anne,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The answer is no to all questions, beside the installation of regular Windows updates. Maybe worth to say that I upgraded from Windows 8.1 as soon as switched on the laptop for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi, Anne,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to figure out how to do it in safe mode as in our office we don't use LAN connection but only wifi which apparently doesn't work in safe mode. I hoped this could be done easily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure I get the "where" question. As I've already written in the first post, I've successfully verified online but apparently this didn't work since Windows 10 still asks me to verify the account. The procedure through Windows 10, instead, doesn't work
 and gives the error in the subject.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this answer your question? Further piece of information, to let BitLocker work I had to dig a bit into regedit and add the State variable set to 0 in $HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList\ .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nicola</p>

<p>We appreciate your response Nicola. Let us resolve this by performing the following methods below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Run the app troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p><span><span>Let's check if running the </span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/instantanswers/69e76f90-d54c-44cf-9851-c2d1542790db/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span>Windows
 apps and store troubleshooter</span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span>would do the trick.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Re-register Windows Store and check if it helps</span></strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Press&nbsp;<strong><span>Windows</span></strong>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<strong><span>X,</span></strong>&nbsp;click on&nbsp;<strong><span>Command Prompt (Admin).</span></strong>&nbsp;</li><li>Type in following two commands and press&nbsp;<strong><span>Enter&nbsp;</span></strong>after<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong>each<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong>command:</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong><span>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong><span>$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Once the command is successfully executed, you can close
<em><span>Windows PowerShell</span></em> and reboot the machine. After restarting the system, problems with apps on your
<em><span>Windows</span></em> should be fixed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, we recommend running Windows Update troubleshooter and follow the on-screen instructions. To do this:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press Windows key, type troubleshooter in the search box and then press enter.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong><span>Troubleshooting</span></strong>. Click on&nbsp;<strong><span>view all&nbsp;</span></strong>and select&nbsp;<strong><span>Windows Update</span></strong>&nbsp;troubleshooter and follow the on-screen instructions.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>If performing the above troubleshooting steps did not work, what we can do here is to perform a
<strong>system restore point</strong>. This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time. In your case, kindly restore to an earlier point where everything was working fine. Restoring won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers,
 and updates installed after the restore point was made. You may refer to this <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-US/help/12415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support article</a></strong>, for guidelines.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>

<p>I've performed the whole procedure without errors, but the error in subject still persists.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED CAN&#39;T BOOT UP HP LAPTOP</h2>
                    <p>Hi !</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to windows 10 about 3 months ago and have been seeing this screen since then tough off and on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I downloaded a software for watching movies (IQIYI) and it downloaded fine. I was in the middle of watching a movie when the screen froze and I got this Blue screen. My HP laptop tried to reboot but kept getting the Critical_process_died
 screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything and nothing seems to work. Everything takes me to a point where it is the dead end and I am back to square one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't restore as I am unable to select the drives,simply cannot click on them.</p>
<p>No recovery image found.</p>
<p>Cannot start in the safe mode (tried it a thousand times since yesterday).</p>
<p>Does not take me to the previous build.</p>
<p>Does not reset the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran test and the hard drive is perfect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help as I need my laptop to access my files and so much more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help will really be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Homegroup and Networking Help needed</h2>
                    Help! I am getting so frustrated.&nbsp; I am trying to network my Pc with my laptop.&nbsp; I keep getting messages saying Windows cannot set up a homegroup on your computer (on both) and&nbsp; having gone through troubleshooting "Windows cannot start the Peer Network
 Service Grouping services on your computer.&nbsp; Error 1068.&nbsp; The dependency services or group failed to start".&nbsp; I have gone into Services and tried to start Peer Name Resolution Protocol , message saying Windows could not start pnrp service on local computer
 Error 0x80630801.&nbsp; Same with Peer Resolution Protocol.&nbsp; Identity Manager seems to be working.&nbsp; Homegroup Listener (same) Error code: 2147023838.&nbsp; Homegroup provider seems to be ok.&nbsp; I think the only thing I can do is to reinstall the O/system unless someone
 can come to my help.&nbsp; I have been trying to sort this out for days and I feel like throwing the&nbsp; ""*** thing through with window (of the house that is)!!!
