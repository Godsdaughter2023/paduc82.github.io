<h2>            Need help on delete a payment record - PayPal account</h2>
                    <p>Dear Officer</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Skype account and I have enable the skyple-paypal auto pay agreement&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I suggest the Skype service to my friend, and she is hesitated to use her own credit card to pay the Skype credit</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the end, I use my own PayPal account to help her recharge the Skype credit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is now come</p>
<p>
</p><p>I check her account setting, under the payment method, it still show my PayPal account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I try to delete it, it can not be done. There is a popup screen to refer me to the PayPal account to cancel the payment arrangement. I follow the instruction and did so. &nbsp;When I go back her Skype account, my PayPal account info is still there and cannot
 be deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now the problem is, if my account info cannot be deleted on her Skype account, I cannot reactive the Skype-paypal auto recharge agreement with my own account. &nbsp; Cuz the stupid thing is, if I active the payment agreement, my friend account can simply recharge
 using my PayPal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And If I don't reactive the Skype-paypal payment arrangement, I will have problem using my own account, since I can't auto recharge my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is now very confusing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to delete the PayPal payment record on Skype account: &nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***. &nbsp;Plz assist.</p>

            <p>To change the language in Windows Speech Recognition to&nbsp;other languages, the language of your Operating System should also be the same.
</p>
<p>Install the language pack you need from Windows Update:</p>
<p><strong><em>Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Windows Update</em></strong> and click <strong>
Check for Update,</strong> wait for a while then click on <strong>Optional Updates are available</strong> then check the Language Pack you want (English)&nbsp;click "Ok" and "Install Updates".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that Updates are installed go to <strong><em>Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Region and Language &gt; Keyboards and Language Tab &gt;
</em></strong>Under <span><strong><em>Display language</em></strong></span>, choose a language (English)&nbsp;from the list, and then click
<span><strong>OK</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Restart your PC. </p>
<p>This must change the Language for Speech Recognition, if didn't go to:</p>
<p><strong><em>Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Speech Recognition &gt; </em></strong>in Left-Top corner click
<strong>Advanced speech options</strong><em>, </em>Under "Language" Select English and click
<strong>Ok.</strong></p>

<p><span>Hi craighale,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft PhotoDraw and</span><span>Microsoft
 Picture It are the programs that can be used to convert .Mix files into .jpg file format.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per the Microsoft Windows 7 compatibility center there is no information about Microsoft PhotoDraw and</span><span>Microsoft
 Picture It</span><span>which means that it may or may not be compatible with Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For more information refer the below link.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Microsoft PhotoDraw</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span>Microsoft Picture It</span></strong></p>

<p><span>If you are unable to use both the programs under Windows 7 you try installing it in compatibility mode and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Locate
 the installer.exe or setup.exe file of<span>Microsoft PhotoDraw or</span></span><span>Microsoft Picture It</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-click
 on the file.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>From
 the contextual menu,</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Choose
 Properties &gt; Compatibility.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Choose
 the version of Windows you want to emulate and select the “Run this program in compatibility mode” checkbox. Run the installer</span></p>
<p><span>If you need further information on the above provided steps then you can follow the link provided below.</span></p>

<p><span>If the above provided steps don’t resolve the issue then you need to wait for the program manufacturer to release the Windows 7 compatible program.</span></p>

<p>======================================================<br />
Best bet would be to use MS PhotoDraw to convert the .mix files to a different format.</p>
<p>FWIW...MS PhotoDraw and MS Picture It! both use the .mix format but typically the<br />
.mix files created in PhotoDraw cannot be opened in Picture It!.</p>

 is intended for pre-installation on a new personal computer for resale. The OEM System Builder Channel software requires the assembler to provide end user support for the Windows software and cannot be transferred to another computer once it is installed.&nbsp;

<span><a href="http://oem.microsoft.com/script/contentpage.aspx?pageid=552846#faq2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Frequently Asked Questions</span></a><br />
<br />
<p><strong>Q.</strong> <em>Can a PC with an OEM Windows operating system have its motherboard upgraded and keep the same license? What if it was replaced because it was defective?</em></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Generally, an end user can upgrade or replace all of the hardware components on a computer—except the motherboard—and still retain the license for the original Microsoft OEM operating system software. If the
 motherboard is upgraded or replaced for reasons other than a defect, then a new computer has been created. Microsoft OEM operating system software cannot be transferred to the new computer, and the license of new operating system software is required. If the
 motherboard is replaced because it is defective, you do not need to acquire a new operating system license for the PC as long as the replacement motherboard is the same make/model or the same manufacturer's replacement/equivalent, as defined by the manufacturer's
 warranty.</p>
<p>The reason for this licensing rule primarily relates to the End User Software License Terms and the support of the software covered by that End User Software License Terms. The End User Software License Terms is a set of usage
 rights granted to the end user by the PC manufacturer and relates only to rights for that software as installed on that particular PC. The system builder is required to support the software on the original PC. Understanding that end users, over time, upgrade
 their PCs with different components, Microsoft needed to have one base component "left standing" that would still define the original PC. Since the motherboard contains the CPU and is the "heart and soul" of the PC, when the motherboard is replaced (for reasons
 other than defect) a new PC is essentially created. The original system builder did not manufacture this new PC, and therefore cannot be expected to support it.</p>

    <title>No Audio After Upgrade to Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gee whiz  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Audio After Upgrade to Win 10</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to Win 10 my previously working audio stopped working, totally. I have updated to the latest drivers for Win 10 from my motherboard mfg, updated my BIOS, and tried every trick or suggestion on the internet, including Microsoft posts. I have
 had the MS techs working on the computer, all to no avail. I rolled back the system to 8.1 and reinstalled the upgrade. Still nothing.</p>
<p>Under device manager/audio, I get the event message that the device could not be migrated. I don't know if that is the issue or not, but I am hoping that this is the source of the problem. Here is the full message in the event area:</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Device SWD\MMDEVAPI\{0.0.0.00000000}.{dfdd802c-ec91-4222-af56-f6a66debed1c} could not be migrated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It seems there are many people having audio issues and I guess it may just be a matter of time until MS does something about this, but I would like to get this fixed now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

    <title>File Explorer won&#39;t open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pastramionrye  say:</h3>
<h2>            File Explorer won&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p>I have a brand-new machine, so I'm also brand-new to Windows 8. I sought solace in the File Explorer pinned to the taskbar at the bottom of the desktop, but it only shows a big blue screen, then reverts to the desktop screen. I tried a workaround by typing
 File Explorer into the search box from the swipey menu on the side, but it doesn't generate anything, just stays on the desktop screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a community article about changing the target destination for the taskbar shortcut, but it appears that it's locked from making changes (when I right-click the icon, right-click on File Explorer, and view Properties). The only way I can see files
 is through OneDrive, but I prefer the hands-on customization of File Explorer. Also, if this function is not working correctly, I'm not clear that other functions work right either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This machine is still under 2 weeks old. Do I:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Return and hope a new machine is installed correctly;</p>
<p>b) Use some workaround that one of you know to view File Explorer; or&nbsp;</p>
<p>c) Buy a Chromebook because I use mostly Google stuff anyway (I hadn't anticipated how hard it would be to use Google products on here).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hello Pastrami,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you make any hardware or software changes to your computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your efforts towards resolving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur either due to software conflicts or missing or damaged Windows files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br />
<strong>Start your computer in safe mode and check if file explorer opens in that mode.</strong><br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue does not persist in safe mode, perform clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
<strong>Perform clean boot. </strong><br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="http://support2.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support2.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not help, use method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
<strong>Run system file checker(SFC</strong><strong>)</strong> and see if it helps.<br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</strong><br />
<a href="http://support2.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support2.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>System file checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: It may ask for Windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <div>Hi JenniferDeal,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>- What's the exact verbatim of the error message that you receive?</div>
<div>- Have you made any recent changes to your computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let's place the computer in clean boot state to identify the application causing this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing
 the issue. </span></p>
<p><span>If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot
 in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting,
 make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in </span><strong><span>Step 7</span></strong><span>
 in the above KB article.</span></p>

<p>I have a Paypal and a debit card, but I cannot add either to my account.</p>
<p>When I attempt to add my Paypal, it sends me to Paypal and I log in, then it sends me back to the page on Xbox and nothing happens. (No error message, but the account doesn't get added)</p>
<p>When I attempt to add my debit card it gives me the following message:</p>
<div>
<div>
"We can't authorize the payment method. Please make sure the information is correct, or use another payment method. If you continue to get this message, please contact your financial institution.</div>
<div>
<span>Error code</span>30225-sLsJEwAAAAAAAAAA-8bf95110-e94c-4bed-b1b6-49513d50667c<strong>"</strong>
<span>Error code</span>30225-sLsJEwAAAAAAAAAA-8bf95110-e94c-4bed-b1b6-49513d50667c<strong>"</strong>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I've tried adding both payment options from both PC and console. Neither work.</p>
<p>My billing info is up to date.</p>
<p>I've spoken to Xbox support and they told me that my bank is probably blocking my card from being added.</p>
<p>I contacted my bank and they told me that from their end, nothing is amiss, and that my card IS in fact being authorized. Yet, based on that error message, it obviously isn't.</p>
<p>I've done a little research and read from other cases that there's a possibility that Xbox has my Microsoft account "under watch" because of potential fraud, and thus not allowing me to add any payment options.</p>
<p>Help?</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>did you also try to add your payment option via <a href="http://billing.microsoft.com?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://billing.microsoft.com?</a></p>
<p>If that also doesn't work then I advise you to contact Xbox Support again, since if the issue is on MS side they are the only ones that can solve the issue.</p>

    <title>Multitasking in windows 8.1 pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john4good  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multitasking in windows 8.1 pro</h2>
                    As of yet, did not upgrade to Windows 8.1, I would like to know how multitasking works. Windows running on a PC/laptop.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>With Windows 8 pro, Apps in the Metro mode are suspended when we move to the desktop screen. Also, metro apps are suspended when they are docked on the left side bar. Its not multitasking at all.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How much has this changed with Win8.1 pro?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows OS is dependent on the concept of apps running as "windows" which are highly scalable, tiled or stacked, on top of others as well as kept in the background. They seamlessly work together if programmed that way to share copied data. With the new
 Metro interface - microsoft moved from the windows concept to bring a restrictive environment. I liked metro look but it just stops there. It became obvious that majority of productivity apps cannot be utilized in the metro restrictive environment.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On a normal day - chat, internet browser, 3d rendering, document editors (various programs), email client, video conferencing, image tool, media converter, media player are running at the same time. Except for game play. Others might use a game recorder
 app to run in the background. I use an audio utility in the background to boost laptop volume. &nbsp;This cannot be achieved in win8pro metro mode.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can Win8.1pro have numerous apps multitask? Are they suspended when docked on the left side bar? Are Metro apps suspended when switching to desktop screen?</div>
                </div>

            <p>In Windows 8.1, the apps will install automatically in the background regardless of where you are.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can also do a split screen between an app and the desktop. You can also switch between apps and the desktop by using the app switcher on the left side.</p>

<h2>            Crackling and hissing sound from the speakers</h2>
                    <p><strong><u>Original Title: sound</u></strong> </p>
<p>hi &nbsp;i have written previously but have not heard back from the fellow that was helping me and &nbsp;am at my wits end. &nbsp;my laptop was fine then i opened it one day last week and from the speakers came crackling and hissing sound. &nbsp;i have checked my dev manager
 &nbsp;and there is no exclamation mark. i have no sound apart from the staticcy sound. even muted it happens!!
</p>
<div>&nbsp;the only time it doesn't do it is when i have disabled the audio dev in dev manager. i reenabled it and updated the drivers and it said the dev was working properly?? so i have disabled it again. &nbsp;Also i thought i would try and play a music file using
 WMP but &nbsp;i am getting this message" the file wmploc.dll has a version number of 12.0.7601.18150 where 12.0.7601.17514 was expected. Windows media player wasn't installed properly and must be reinstalled." &nbsp;okay so i go to the Microsoft website via the link
 in that error box, i can only find the link to download xp ???? i download it but it says i have a newer version installed.&nbsp;i have tried to install every version of wmp.. to no avail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next i tried to troubleshoot and troubleshooter is telling i have no audio
 device installed!! im losing my mind over this&nbsp;like totally. &nbsp;please please help me. WMP is also not present in add/remove programs.
<div>my laptop is barely 12 months old and is an</div>

            &nbsp;Hello,
<div>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>Based on the information you have provided it seems that its a possible driver corruption but you dont need to panic , we will try to guide you in best possible direction.
<div>I also need to know following information:</div>
<ol>
<li>What were recent changes made on the computer prior to issue? </li><li>Do you get any error message or is it just the crackling sound? </li><li>What is the status of sound device in device manager?</li><li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li></ol>
<p>To check status of sound device please follow steps below:</p>
<p>1. Click on the <strong>Start</strong> button and then choose<strong> Control Panel</strong>.<br />
2. Click on the <strong>System and Security</strong> link.<br />
Note: If you're viewing the Large icons or Small icons view of Control Panel, you won't see this link. Simply click on Device Manager and then proceed to Step 4.<br />
3. In the <strong>System and Security </strong>window, click on the Device Manager link located under the System heading.<br />
4. You can now use Device Manager to update device drivers, view the system resources that a hardware device is using, etc.<br />
5. With Device Manager open, locate the piece of hardware you want to view the status of.<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Work your way through the hardware categories by clicking the &gt; icon. The specific hardware devices in your computer are listed under the major hardware categories.<br />
6. Once you've found the device you're wanting to view the status of, right click on its icon or text and choose Properties.<br />
7. Locate the Device status area in the General tab of the Properties window that is now open for your hardware.<br />
Note: The Device status area surrounds a text box. You should see this in the bottom half of the window.<br />
8. The information in this Device status text box contains the current status of this particular device.<br />
9. If the hardware device is working properly, the text will look something like this:<br />
10. <strong>This device is working properly.</strong><br />
No action should be needed if the device is working. According to Windows 7's assessment, everything is working properly right now.<br />
11. If Windows 7 determines that the hardware device is not working like it should, the text here will list an error message and error code and should look something this:<br />
12. Error Message. (Code 00)\<br />
13. In case you see! mark on sound device then do let us know and we will provide you further stepos..<br />
</p>
<p>You may also try following troubleshooter: </p>
<p>Run the Audio troubleshooter and check if that fixes the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Open the Playing Audio troubleshooter</strong></p>

            Hi!<br />
<br />
Try this:<br />
Go to Start, type pr, choose Programs and Features. On the left side, click on Turn Windows features on or off. Find Media Features, expand it by clicking on the small +. Uncheck Windows Media Player, click ok and re-boot.<br />
<br />
Then do all of the above again, this time check-marking Windows Media Player and re-booting once again.<br />

    <title>Windows 8 File Search Freeze - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> backwoodsman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 File Search Freeze</h2>
                    The current issue relates to searches from the start screen only. When searching from the desktop via File Explorer everything runs okay.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>While trying to locate a file I start to type on the start screen and the search dialogue opens trying to find Apps by default; sometimes the counters next to Settings and Files may indicate that something has been found. More often nothing will be found
 until I select files and rotating circle of dots will display until the search completes. However when I start to enter some search terms the search will start only for the rotating circle of dots to freeze after about 10 seconds and the search totally hangs.
 Enter a different search phrase and it may be found but one thing is consistent, if a search fails using a&nbsp;particular&nbsp;phrase it will&nbsp;always&nbsp;fail on that phrase.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried both refreshing and resetting the OS;&nbsp;probably&nbsp;about six times since Windows 8 was released(!) and I always ensure that my BIOS and devices drivers are up to date, however the problem still remains.</div>

    <title>On-Screen Keyboard Issues on the Surface Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tau tau  say:</h3>
<h2>            On-Screen Keyboard Issues on the Surface Pro</h2>
                    <p><em>Exhibit A</em><br />
<strong>Full Keyboard - covers typing area</strong><br />
Whenever you use the full keyboard, if your input area is below the keyboard you won't be able to see what you are typing...<br />
<br />
In the example below, the twitter input field for messaging is below the keyboard therefore you can't use this keyboard for more than half of the screen.<br />
<br />
IMO the keyboard should push the edge of the screen up so you can still scroll the browser and find the typing area. Something in the style of the current horizontal multi-tasking mode but as vertical split to accommodate the full keyboard.<br />
<br />
The full keyboard shouldn't be an overlay it should take up it's own space and push other apps up.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/84a74774-be15-4f55-a549-1f8b3c4ca692?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/84a74774-be15-4f55-a549-1f8b3c4ca692?upload=true" /></a><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><em>Exhibit B</em><br />
<strong>Split Keyboard -&nbsp;</strong><strong>covers typing area</strong><br />
The split keyboard covers anything you might be writing. This completely defeats the purpose of having a split keyboard in the first place.
<br />
<br />
An easy fix is to keep it as an overlay but make the grey area fully transparent. Right now this is very hard to use.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0924d20c-cca2-400b-9236-07f7a2db3112?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0924d20c-cca2-400b-9236-07f7a2db3112?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><br />
<em>Exhibit C</em><br />
<strong>"Small" Keyboard is very awkward to use<br />
</strong>Have you ever tried typing a paragraph with a keyboard that is above or on the side of the input field? It is really hard and incredibly awkward. Not to mention that you can't type anything with 2 hands.<br />
<br />
This feature to me is completely useless as an everyday writing tool.<br />

<p>Fixing this issue is very important as Surface Pros don't come automatically with a keyboard.
<br />
<br />
As it stands these devices are quite useless as keyboard-less tablets. You can only use it to swipe feeds and take sketches.</p>

<p>Hi Tau Tau,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to our community to let us know about this concern you have related to your On-Screen Keyboard with your Surface Pro.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Definitely this is a feedback that we have raised so in a new update we might get options to have different set ups with the on screen keyboard when used with some applications while in view mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if used in tablet or reading mode you shouldn't have any inconvenience when typing,&nbsp;I tried with Twitter and Instagram on a Surface Go. Now some other options that we&nbsp;recommend:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - if you want to type in view mode is to tap the second option from the second line of the on-screen settings you have there, it will allow you to move the on-screen keyboard over the screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 - In the search bar type On-Screen Keyboard and select Open. You should have a different &nbsp;keyboard with the option to size it the way you want (tap gently on one of the corners and slide around the screen), also you can&nbsp;move it around the screen and you
 have an option to "Fade" so you can see what is behind the on screen keyboard. These are some of the options we have available right now. Again this feedback is appreciated, hope that helps a bit.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
        </p>

<p>i agree with the criticism about the on screen keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the Surface Go has a smaller screen so if used in "portrait + tablet" mode; in websites like the WhatsApp webapp, where there is an input field at the bottom of the screen, the keyboard always blocks the view of what you are typing (unless you use the onscreen
 keyboard in "<em>Exhibit C"&nbsp;</em>above).</p>
<p>
</p><p>i dont know about the complexity of adjusting the height of a full screen window, but it would be useful if this feature could at least apply to a browser.</p>

            I'm a new Surface Pro owner and I encountered this "oversized" keyboard problem while I was setting up the device.&nbsp; I couldn't see what I was typing.&nbsp; It was so annoying I immediately regretted my purchase.&nbsp; How could the designers not see this problem
 out of the gate?

<p>Seriously, the update is the issue. Just check out David Cox's Lord's of Shadow twitter page. When I tried with the second disc and it wouldn't work, but when I put the first disc in, it prompted for the update. They just didn't release the patch with the
 DLC like they should have. I updated and am now half way through beating the DLC.

<p>Yes, the update was the issue, now it's okay. Anyway, I'm very disappointed, since the game doesn't explain the ending from the basic LoS and the DLC you can finish in one hour or one and the half. Reverie was much better than Resurrection (the final fight
 with the Forgotten One is very similar to one with the Dark Knight Golem but the Forgotten One is tougher and has a nice 'array of attacks')</p>

<h2>            3D Builder&#58; any way to &#34;mirror&#34; an axis&#63;</h2>
                    I want to flip an object along one axis (to get a mirror image).&nbsp; I tried to scale with a negative number to flip it that way, but the object disappears.&nbsp; It would be very useful if you made a negative scale do the flip operation...

<p>Imagine if the tables were turned and the English speaking people would get Another language during update! This is really making me angry, i cant use windows in Swedish to be honest and i&nbsp;did not&nbsp;pay for this version so&nbsp;why do i end up with this!&nbsp;Its stupid
 to assume that just because i live in sweden i want the Swedish version!</p>

            <p>Seems I found the solution even if its not a perfect one.</p>
<p>From settings--&gt; Region &amp; languages i can make English default. This changes the menus and stuff to remain in English BUT the **** part is i now have to switch between keyboards all the time. I could add Swedish keybord to English language and remove the
 English keyboard but that seems to remove the ability to assist on spelling and such. Hope this helps someone and saves them time.

            <p>Hi. I have the same issue, but my version is in German. However, when I try yo download the language package, it simply will not do it. I constantly get an error message, and that is the end of it.</p>
<p>And well, German is not my mother language... I just happened to buy the computer in Austria...</p>

            <p>Hi there, and thanks for the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I left a screenshot here: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/language-issues/32ac8923-b8e6-4389-98cf-a65cc77e7da2</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Win8.1 in German, and I switched the language into English (I actually do not speak good German). The funny thing is that the keyboard in English remained installed when updating to Win10, but all the text turned back to German. I could also see English
 US present under "Language and Region", but well, without the possibility of activating it. The download also failed when I tried getting another English package (UK) or Spanish. I will try to remove English US and see if the download works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somebody at the Microsoft Answer Desk ‏told me that the issue is likely happening because I probably had a "single language" Win8.1 (but I was able to change it into English), and that my solution is to buy a Win10 Home in English and... well, pretty much
 make a clean install of the OS. I am not quite happy with this solution, as you can imagine.</p>

<p>I'm sorry that your having a hard time playing on Live. &nbsp;from what I've read on your post. &nbsp;It seems that your connection may be the issue. &nbsp;Here are some things you can try to see if we can help your connection.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Try running a speed test on your internet connection.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Reset modem and or router (Both if you have them) &nbsp;</p>
<p>3. If you are running on a wireless connection try switching to a wire one. &nbsp;Some people find that this works best. &nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Check if your NAT is open and not switched to Moderate or strict. </p>
<p>Hope this helps &nbsp;:)</p>

                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never used Microsoft repair services before just fyi. My Xbox One X has a hardware issue as far as I'm aware. I tried everything possible to try and get it to work but I'm resorted to sending it in for repair. I have 3 Years warranty still attached
 to the xbox (It's only 1 month old).</p>
<p>My question is: If they can't fix it, will they send a replacement directly to me free of charge?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologise for my naivety. New to this.&nbsp;</p>

            As your console has the three year warranty when you create the service order I think it may give you the option to request an advance exchange console be sent to you and you can then return your old console.

<p>Hi there,</p>

</p><p>The repair center will first attempt to repair the device and will send you a fully functional device if it is not able to repair your original. I do not believe that the option for an advanced exchange is available any longer. Also, there would be a hold
 on your credit card for the full amount of the device if you were to go with that option.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've followed the steps in regards to error code E1050000008007045D. Said I should do a full restart but every time I boot the console up it will take me to the troubleshoot screen. When I click restart console to factory settings, it will just take me back
 to troubleshoot screen. It's a cycle. I can no longer go back to my xbox home page, it just boots up on troubleshoot screen with error code. Anything I press will just cycle me back to the troubleshoot screen. Next step was to put it in for repairs, so here
 I am. I've already opened a repair order with Microsoft and will take it down to UPS pick up tomorrow. It's just a same unit repair which, looking from the billing, costs me nothing because i'm within my warranty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess what I'm trying to ask is will there be any unexpected charges when they either fix or send me a new xbox? I'm within the warranty period. It's only 1 month old. I'm just worried.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick response,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, E105 errors result in repair orders. Worry not though, if the device is under warranty, there will be no charge at all.&nbsp; Microsoft would not charge you for a defective device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that you get the X repaired quickly so that you can get back to gaming as soon as possible. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey there bud thanks for keeping in touch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Short answer, no, if the console is under warranty (which we understand it is) there will be no charge whatsoever from the repair center regardless of what ends up being the problem they will either repair or replace free of charge. We hope this helps clarify
 this situation but let us know if we can further assist in this or any other matter!</p>

<h2>            Running CHKDSK Deleted My User Account</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am dealing with an issue: running CHKDSK /f /r /x removed my user account that previously had no known issues</p>
<p>
</p><p>A little history:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using an old PC with Windows Vista. I came home to find that PC had shut off and would no longer power on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of fixing it, I decided to get a newer computer. Not brand new, but still an upgrade for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new computer came with Windows 8.1 (with an offer to upgrade to Windows 10 for free).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using an external dock to access my old hard drive. Everything seemed fine until the dock plug got knocked loose from the wall.&nbsp; I powered it back up and suddenly some folders were inaccessible or corrupt. The previously full hard drive now showed about
 1/2 full.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran CHKDSK /f /r /x a couple of times and many of the files reappeared again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran CHKDSK /f /r /x one more time, but this time, it removed my user account from my old drive in the dock (E:)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to recover this user account to be sure no important files were left behind. I believe everything important was back up, but I'd like to get in there to be sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were no known issues with the old drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more note: I thought I upgraded to Windows 10, but after pressing WIndows-X and looking at "system", Windows 8.1 is still displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this enough information to get some help recovering my user account on the old drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Joe G.</p>
<p>Houston TX</p>

            <p>Hi Robear</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased this computer June 2, 2016 (Thursday) from Fry's Electronics as an "open box". The model is Acer AXC-603-UR, 4GB RAM, 1TB HDD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My user account was removed from my old drive, which the new computer identified as having an error (there was no known issue prior, although the old computer losing power could have created some problem.)</p>

<p>So it was&nbsp;a used/demo/floor model&nbsp;computer, not a brand-new, never-been-used-by-anyone-else computer which was sold to you "As Is," correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you format the HDD &amp; then do a clean install of Windows 8.1 before you started using the computer online (or pay someone else to do it for you)?</p>

<p>I have no idea what "my user account was removed from my old drive" means. Did you (or someone else)&nbsp;attempt to transfer personal data&nbsp;from the Vista computer to the Win8.1 computer or...?</p>

            <p>Hi PA Bear</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not format the HDD and do a clean install of Windows 8.1. It came with 8.1 installed (or it installed it when I set it up, honestly, I don't remember now) with the option to upgrade to 10 for free. But I did not format the HDD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After setting up the "new" computer, I removed my old drive (a WD 500GB Sata that was almost to capacity) from the old one (the old PC lost power while i was away from home and would not come back on), put it in a USB dock and check the directories to make
 sure it was still good. Everything checked out fine, all of my data was there. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Later, I noticed the dock wasn't getting power, and saw that the plug had been knocked from the wall (probably my dog). I plugged it back in, and that's when the new computer identified a problem with the drive. Now the drive showed less than 50% space used,
 but I could still access all of my personal files through my user account folder "Joe" (The "Joe" was removed from the "Users" folder, now the only folder in "Users" is "Public".)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After running "CHKDSK /f /r /x" twice, the "Joe" folder disappeared, preventing me from accessing all of my personal folders - documents, music, and so on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to regain access to "Joe".</p>
<p>

            <p>First, let's make sure everything else is OK with the used, possibly-refurbished Win8.1 computer before we worry about the external drive or the data on it. [The "Recovery" part of this forum's name pertains&nbsp;primarily to&nbsp;<em>system
</em>recoveries (i.e., "Something's wrong &amp; my computer's not working - how do I recover from this?"), not recovering data from an external drive. Yes, it's very confusing.]</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Assuming Win8.1 64-bit...</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll need to do some "digging" here. Please answer <em>each of the following </em>
[admittedly tedious]<em> diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without</em> quoting this post: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the used ("open box")&nbsp;computer from Fry's?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Lenovo; Acer)?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1c. Has Windows 10 ever been offered or&nbsp;installed since you acquired the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Is your current Win8.1 User Account OK? cf. <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/user-accounts-faq#1TC=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/user-accounts-faq#1TC=windows-8</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>3a. What is the <em>full name</em> of your currently-installed <em>third-party</em> anti-virus application or security suite (i.e.,
<em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em>), if any, and <em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription
</em>(if any)<em>&nbsp;expire?</em> </p>
<p>
</p><p>3. What third-party anti-malware applications (i.e., <em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em>) are installed, if any?&nbsp; What third-party firewall, if any?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer<em> since you bought it?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">when</span> you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Now for&nbsp;the tedious part =&gt;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>6a. Is KB3154070, KB3156013, KB3156016, KB3156019, KB3155178, KB3156059, KB3153171, KB3153704, KB3153199, KB3156017, KB3142030, and/or KB3155784&nbsp;listed in
<strong>Installed Updates </strong><em>(not <strong>Update History</strong></em>)<em>?</em> [1]</p>
<p>
</p><p>6b. How about KB3138615, KB3123862, KB3035583, KB2976978 and/or KB3044374?</p>
<p>
</p><p>7a. What Update Version &amp; KB number are displayed in the <em>second line of text</em> in IE11's Help | About [<strong>Alt+H+A</strong>] tab; e.g.,
<strong>Update Version: 11.0.54 (KB1231231)</strong> ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>7b. Is Firefox <em>version 46.0.1</em> (or higher) and/or <em>Google Chrome version&nbsp;</em><em>51</em> (or higher) or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Is <strong>Adobe Flash Player v21.0.0.242</strong> installed? TEST HERE USING&nbsp;INTERNET EXPLORER
<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt; <a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>9. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic;
<em>System Mechanic</em>; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Total System Care; Glary Utilities; Registry Booster;
<em>McAfee QuickClean</em>; <em>AVG Quick Clean</em>;&nbsp;<em>AVG PC TuneUp</em>; Norton Registry Cleaner;

    <title>Com&#47;LPT ports missing after installing Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris f_london  say:</h3>
<h2>            Com&#47;LPT ports missing after installing Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I have seen a number of similar posts on this subject. I have a Lenovo H330 desktop that had a number of serial COM ports. I upgraded to Windows 7 and they all vanished.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had made no changes to BIOS and have checked that there is no BIOS option that I could change that would disable COM ports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked that the LPT/COM ports were not hidden.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried adding COM's ports manual using the device manager, which seemed to work - but the COM ports did not work (CODE 10) as the addresses they wanted to use had already been assigned).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried&nbsp;deleting all USB&nbsp;entries - which&nbsp;was one of the suggestions made to&nbsp;one other Windows user who had reported this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas on:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(a) why the LPT/COM ports vanished after the Windows upgrade and&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) what I can do to get my COM ports working again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need the&nbsp;COM ports so I can use an old Elite&nbsp;flight simulator product, which scans for COM ports when it loads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Many thanks for your feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All drivers are up to date and there are no outstanding Windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also still have no LPT /&nbsp;COM ports showing in Device Manager,&nbsp;unless I&nbsp;install them&nbsp;manually - and than they don't work due to conflicts (e.g. PCI bus)..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where next? The Registry? Could it be a hardware problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>

    <title>Xbox One Oneguide unable to find ANY cable box models - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One Oneguide unable to find ANY cable box models</h2>
                    
<p>At the point in Oneguide setup where you set up the xbox one to communicate with the cable box, you can either choose to let the Xbox send power signals to the box or manually enter you cable box brand and model. After failing the send power signal method
 multiple times and with varying distances/angles between the kinect and the IR receiver for my DTA (the device I use for cable is a Cisco DTA 170HD), I tried to use the manual entry method. I entered Cisco for the brand and when prompted for the model I tried
 various searches (D, DTA, DTA170 DTA170HD) and none of these yielded results, meaning my Xbox could not control my cable box functions.</p>
<p>After doing some digging, I found a YouTube video where a user set up his OneGuide with the same DTA, so I knew it should be possible. I got on the phone with Xbox support and sadly we were not able to resolve the issue. In the course of exhausting every
 possible solution (including resetting to factory defaults), we even tried entering cable brands and models known to work based on the forums. None of the searches for these models yielded any results either, leading me to believe that my Xbox is having trouble
 accessing the list of cable box models that it is supposed to be searching from.</p>
<p>Has anybody heard of a problem like this before or have any ideas how it could be resolved?</p>

<p>I suggest you start everything from scratch again and if the problem persists if your Xbox one is still out of warranty I would bring it in for service. Hope this was helpful.
