    <title>Searching for a question mark in a string does not work on - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Searching for a question mark in a string does not work on Outlook.com.</h2>
                    <p>This should be a simple task but I am not able to get outlook.com to find a string that contains a question mark in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using the advanced search and attempting to enter a string such as "today?". I would like not to get all messages with today in them, but just the ones that match the full string including the question mark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The escape characters \?, '?', "?" don't seem to do the trick and I have not been able to find documentation on line the describes how to do this. I have to believe that it is simple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully this is a simple answer that I am overlooking.</p>

            Nokia 6110 might not be compatible with your nissan qashqai,<br />
as you are using a Nokia product with a non Nokia product<br />
<br />
It's better to contact the manufacturers of your car system.

<h2>            Day&#47;Week view control in Outlook 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    
<p>I use the week view on my calendar in outlook and towards the end of the week, it mostly shows past appointments, since it stick to Monday-Sunday. How can I change my week view to show the current day and 5 or 7 days in the future? I have googled and searched
 for over an hour and can't believe this is so hard to find. How is this not something common? Who wants to see Monday-Wednesday of the past part of the week on a Thursday? I wan to be able to set appointments for the next week. When I click and try to select
 days on the left-side calendar, it reverts everything to month view.</p>

<p>hi jlinmpls,</p>
<p>in outlook for mac, it’s not feasible to set the calendar week view to start as the current day.</p>
<p>we can only change the start day to a specific day of week view and set the work days for work week view in preference -&gt; calendar.</p>
<p>however, i think it’s great idea if the calendar is able to start as the current day. we suggest you submit feedback via the “smile face” in the right upper corner in the outlook client. many features have been designed or upgraded based on customers’ comments.
 your understanding is appreciated.</p>

Dear Folk:<br />
<br />
This is a long post; but I've done my best to give you all the details I've dug out of the system thus far that appear to relate to the questios(s) asked.&nbsp; I'm also having a bit of a problem in actually getting the forum to take the post, so I may have to break
 it into pieces by just "replying" it, piece by piece, to my original post.<br />
<br />
ERROR: 0x800106be; MSSE Service STOPS During Scans and The Scan Halts Permanently.<br />
<br />
PROBLEM:&nbsp; Whenever I attempt to perform an anti-virus/malware scan of my computer's HDDs, the scan almost always terminates somewhere around the one-third to halfway point and, by way of two actual examples only, I receive(d) the following error code(s): 0x800106be
 (02 Sep 10); 0x800106ba (03 Sep 10). <br />
<br />
SCAN TYPE:&nbsp; Custom:&nbsp; Drives C: D: E: and F: ; and Full scans -- i.e., usually when the scanner is scanning on more than one drive.&nbsp; I did have one instance when a "Custom" scan initiated on the C: drive only resulted in the stoppage of the Antimalware service;
 but that was an anamoly:&nbsp; the service stoppage usually occurs when (a) I am disconnected from the internet, and (b) the MSSE scan shifts from one drive to another.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
SUMMARY:&nbsp; MSSE Antimalware "service" crashes (halts) if I try to initiate a full scan or a custom scan while disconnected from the internet.&nbsp; The crash of the service appears to occur when MSSE moves its scanning focus from the C: drive to the D: drive.&nbsp; This
 NEVER happens if I am connected to the internet during the scan, however.<br />
<br />
Note:&nbsp; I have the following drives:&nbsp; C: D: E: F: .<br />
<br />
A Quick scan never leaves the C: drive; but both a Full Scan and a Custom scan that has been set to scan all four drives always leaves the C: drive at some point.&nbsp; The crash occurs at the front part of the D: drive scanning, BUT ONLY if I am disconnected from
 the internet.<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
When I check Event Viewer - "Application," however, there is a final "information" message at the top of the message list's telling me that the O/S has in fact restarted the Antimalware Service; BUT the scan itself remains nevertheless HALTED permenantly and
 must be manually re-initiated.&nbsp; Once the scan is re-initiated manually -- without doing anything else -- the manually re-initiated scan does in fact scan to completion, and I know it works, because the re-initiated scan did pick up a piece of adware and destroyed
 it on at least one occaision.<br />
<br />
That makes two days in a row and consistently happening, back to back attempted scans, so the error apparently is duplicating somewhat consistently.<br />
<br />
I have listed several detailed Event Viewer Errors beneath my name below; otherwise I have omitted the byte and/or word information that accompanies the Event Viewer messages inasmuch as the Application and Event Viewer messages are numerous, and the byte details
 are a bit lengthy.&nbsp; Hence, after whoever has undertaken to assist me has read them and the problem is solved, a moderator might want to delete most. or all, of them just to get the space back on the Help forum.<br />
<br />
Two errors, of two general types, appear in Event Viewer EVERY TIME:<br />
<br />
(1)&nbsp; "Application" Errors:<br />
---------------------------<br />
<br />
(a)&nbsp; MPSampleSubmission:&nbsp; "The description for Event ID ( 5000 ) in Source ( MPSampleSubmission ) cannot be found. The local computer may not have the necessary registry information or message DLL files to display messages from a remote computer. You may be

<br />
(2) "System" Errors:<br />
---------------------<br />
<br />
(a)&nbsp; Microsoft Antimalware Real-Time Protection feature has encountered an error and failed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feature: Behavior Monitoring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error Code: 0x80070006<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error description: The handle is invalid. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reason: The filter driver was unloaded unexpectedly.<br />
<br />
For more information, see Help and Support Center at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/events.asp.<br />
[Results:&nbsp; No results found or, if found, none applicable to "MSSE" or "security essentials"]<br />
<br />
(b)&nbsp; The Microsoft Antimalware Service service terminated unexpectedly.&nbsp; It has done this 1 time(s).&nbsp; The following corrective action will be taken in 15000 milliseconds: Restart the service.<br />
<br />
For more information, see Help and Support Center at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/events.asp.<br />
[Results:&nbsp; 4 forum posts; but don't seem on point and involve Forefront in complex server environments -- nothing for MMSE or "security essentials"]<br />
<br />
NOTE:&nbsp; Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is set to "Automatic" and lists as "Started" throughout; there are NO Error messages -- either app or systme error messages -- that relate at all to Remote Procedure Call (RPC).<br />
<br />
I have never had these errors -- any of them -- and have never had any Error reports like them, prior to installing MSSE and initiating a scan with MSSE.<br />
<br />
The online Help (web) instructs me to restart the MSSE service.&nbsp; When I go to the Microsoft Antimalware line in Services, however, the service is always actually in a "started" state; and, if I manually initiate a new scan -- even without stopping and re-starting
 the Antimalware service -- the scan actually begins again and does in fact proceed to completion.&nbsp; An "information" message tells me the "service" has restarted itself; but my scan is stopped nevertheless; so, apparently, once the app halts in a scan, it will
 not resume the scan on its own after the O/S restarts the service.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't use scheduled scans.&nbsp; What I have historically done, every day -- prior to installing MSSE and when I was using CLAMWIN alone for my anti-malware scanner -- has been, when I leave the office in the evening, to initiate a Custom scan of all four of my
 drives, turn off the monitor, and, the next morning, when I am back at work, check the results.&nbsp; I really don't want to get involved in doing "computer maintenance things" during the workday; but, after initiating a multi-drive scan with MSSE at the end of
 the workday, when I come into work and find that my anti-virus scan has halted about a third of the way through to completion, I am a little bit nervous about proceding to start using the machine since I can't really begin the workday with a known, "all clear"
 computer system.<br />
<br />
Also, I do NOT remain connected at all to the internet when I am performing any kind of thorough anti-virus or anti-malware or anti-spyware scan.<br />
<br />
I added MSSE to my machine last week primarily because of a recommendation that is fairly standard on the CLAMWIN site, to whit:&nbsp; use a second scanner, in addition to CLAMWIN; use one scanner for dailies and one for a "second opinion."&nbsp; Since CLAMWIN does not
 employ an "on demand" scanner, and doesn't run its scanner unless the User actually initiates a scan, CLAMWIN presents no conflict with an anti-malware program that does in fact employ "on demand" scanning.&nbsp; Obviously, one should disable the other scanner
 when initiating a CLAMWIN scan.<br />
<br />
<br />
QUESTIONS:<br />
----------<br />
<br />
&nbsp; (A)&nbsp; What on Earth could be halting the Antimalware "Service" during the actual MSSE scan, and, if you have any thoughts as to what might be halting it, HOW DO I fix it?<br />
<br />
(B)&nbsp; What could be causing the System errors?&nbsp; Since the Antimalware service does in fact re-start itself with no interraction on my part, is there a way that I can instruct the system to "CONTINUE" the scan after the service restarts?????&nbsp; There should be
 because my experience thus far with MSSE is that, if I manually re-initiate a new scan, the new scan actually scans to completion.<br />
<br />
NOTE:&nbsp; I have already uninstalled and re-installed MSSE once.&nbsp; I did, however, uninstall Windows Defender AFTER I had uninstalled and reinstalled MSSE.&nbsp; Could that be the problem????<br />
<br />
Microsoft writes the O/S; so, I am more or less assuming that the company's programmers know -- better than anyone else -- how to program to their own API's and the like.&nbsp; I've been using XP Pro for a good many years now, and I just never have had a service
 "die" on me -- out of the blue, so to speak -- while the app itself that relies on the service was active.&nbsp; I've tried various other anti-virus programs in the past, such as Bit Defender; none of their service executables ever died on me during a scan.<br />
<br />
Now, I didn't particularly like Bit Defender for other reasons, namely that it had a bad habit of gradually destroying archived ZIP and 7-ZIP archive files over time (common complaint with respect to Bit Defender) and it's user help was almost non-existent
 here in the States; but I can't say that crashing it's own "service" was one of the Bit Defender app's problems.<br />
<br />
OTHER INFORMATION:<br />
<br />
(A)<br />
CHANGED MSSE REGISTRY SETTING:<br />
<br />
I do have the following line in the registry set to "0":<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Antimalware\SpyNet]<br />
"SpyNetReporting"=dword:00000000<br />
<br />
I'm on dial-up right now so I try to keep the modem clear of all transmissions except the immediate because, dial-up just can't function if the computer system is trying to use it as if it is broadband; dialup can be servicable; but it can't handle a lot of
 chatter from "reporting" apps; the slowdown from "report" or "update" chatter just slows dial-up down to nothing and interrupts one's paycheck work.<br />
<br />
Just note that I certainly don't have any problems with sending "reports" on crashes and app failures and detected viruses; I DO in fact send them in; but because of the dialup connection I generally wait until the end of the day and send all that stuff manually.<br />
<br />
I do not see how turning to "OFF" a "membership" or "nonmembership" in SpyNet would bring down a "sevice."&nbsp; SpyNet membership should be a non-issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(B)<br />
Other apps that might be causing this:<br />
<br />
(1)&nbsp; SPYBOT:<br />
<br />
I do have Spybot installed but it is INACTIVE; and, when I do scan with it from time to time, when I do a major checkup for malware, spyware, trojans, etc., I perform the scan manually.&nbsp; So, nothing is set to "running" or "automatic" in Spybot:&nbsp; no "Teatimer"
 or anything else like that.&nbsp; I use NO resident-in-memory features of Spybot.&nbsp; Unless I manually invoke Spybot, all the program consists of is a bunch of one's and zero's stored on the hard drive and some registry entries.&nbsp; Thus, I do not see how a non-running
 program can interfere with MSSE's "service."<br />
<br />
Note:&nbsp; MSSE did in fact find a piece of adware today when I manually re-initiated the halted scan; so, BEFORE I had MSSE toast the thing, I in fact also performed a context menu scan of the offending file with Spybot, which also detected the same adware.&nbsp; THE
 MANUAL SPYBOT SCANNING DID NOT CRASH MSSE NOR DID IT "STOP" THE MSSE SERVICE!&nbsp; So, my tentative conclusion, which could in fact be an incorrect conclusion, is that the mere fact that Spybot is installed on the hard drive doesn't necessarily interfere with
 MSSE.&nbsp; As noted above, I don't "schedule" things to happen automatically in the box inasmuch as my own personal and work schedule usually inevitably conflicts with the XP scheduler app's timetable sooner or later; and, if I am working through the night when
 an automatic scheduler program begins firing off a bunch of programs to "do things" in my box, what I end up with is a "true mess" that can take hours to sort out.<br />
<br />
As you know, Spybot's been around for a very long time and is pretty good at what it does.&nbsp; I'd like to keep it around if I can.&nbsp; I only use it to clean things up and do a major manual scan occaisionally (usually I do a massive clean-up and adware/malware scan;
 and PC One Care Scan of "EVERYTHING" once a month -- all "manually," of course).<br />
<br />
(2)&nbsp; CLAMWIN<br />
<br />
ClamWin has no scan-on-demand feature, on purpose.&nbsp; CLAMWIN will only perform a scan if the scan is initiated either by scheduler or manually (I use "manual").<br />
<br />
I've been using CLAMWIN for about 6 years now inasmuch as, after I went through a number of proprietary anti-virus apps, none of them really suited, I switched over to CLAMWIN under the theory that, if the CLAM engine is good enough for ISP's and server farms,
 it ought to be good enough for my box; and, I must say, it has performed very very well over the years.&nbsp; If it has a fault, the fault is that sometimes CLAMWIN will generate a false positive, thus necessitating availing myself of the VirusTotal internet virus
 checking service.<br />
<br />
(3)&nbsp; CLAMWIN/SPYBOT SUMMARY.&nbsp; If NO processes at all in either of these apps are actually running, and if there is NO process in either of these apps that can spontaneously execute -- which I am absolutely positive is true here -- then for the life of me I
 cannot conceive of how the mere presence of these programs, stored on the hard drive, in completely NON-running and NON-active states, can in any way interfere with MSSE.<br />
<br />
(4)&nbsp; Windows Defender.&nbsp; I uninstalled this app completely in Add Remove Programs pursuant to the assisting MVP's instructions to do so on this Help forum.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; I never one time had a failed scan with Windows Defender or any other ERROR that occurred during
 a Windows Defender scan; I've been using Defender for years in tandem with CLAMWIN, and there were never any conflicts.<br />
<br />
MY SUSPICIONS:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; I perhaps need to set "more" of the reporting/SpyNet settings in the registry to "0" in MSSE, although I cannot see exactly "why" Microsoft would choose to initiate a communication with SpyNet during a scan -- particularly when I am NOT connected to the
 internet.&nbsp; I did enclose the registry settings for MSSE below, at the very end.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; There is a bug in MSSE pursuant to which the app itself will not continue an ongoing scan when the Antimalware service has stopped and restarted itself.&nbsp; I call it a "bug" inasmuch as if the Anti-malware service is stopping and restarting itself, but the
 app can't continue it's ongoing scan after the service automatically restarts itself, then MSSE has got a design flaw that any teenaged "virus kiddie" could expoloit successfully in his sleep.<br />
<br />
As it is, to defeat MSSE entirely would seem to require only that hostile code first execute to bring down the Antimalware service and thereafter proceed to infect and infest the target computer because, once the service is crashed, the scanner stops dead in
 its tracks; for all intents and purposes, MSSE is paralyzed.&nbsp; That kind of result more or less flies in the face of my personal experience over the last 19 years with Microsoft's programming.&nbsp; My experience has been that, aside from a very few annoyances over
 the years, Microsoft actually does a pretty good job of writing robust code; and I don't think I have ever encountered a Microsoft bug affecting the interaction of a service with an app or with a dependency in XP Pro.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; I do in fact have a "run" line entry for CLAMWIN that puts the CLAMWIN program icon in the Systray, but that is all that it does; CLAMWIN is not running, however.&nbsp; My understanding from the CLAMWIN forum is that this is just a "launching" icon and nothing
 more; in other words, there is a "ClamTray.exe" that runs; but I WAS EXITED OUT OF EVEN THAT PROGRAM BOTH TIMES WHEN I BEGAN MY ATTEMPTED MSSE CUSTOM SCANS.&nbsp; "ClamTray.exe" is NOT the CLAMWIN scanning program.<br />
<br />
Thus, I don't see how the mere presence of a data line in the registrty, when the program is in fact not running at all, could affect MSSE one way or the other.<br />
<br />
In any event, the ClamTray.exe run line is as follows:<br />
<br />
"ClamWin"="\"C:\Program Files\ClamWin\bin\ClamTray.exe" --logon"<br />
<br />
Again, that is NOT the ClamWin scanning program.&nbsp; I executed each of the choices available from the system tray icon of CLAMWIN, and that certainly did not crash the MSSE service (Open ClamWin; Download virus data base update; Scheduler; Display Reports; Check
 Latest Version; Visit ClamWin Website).&nbsp; An actual ClamWin "scan" cannot even be initiated from the tray icon.<br />
<br />
I initiated an MSSE "Quick Scan" while ClamTray.exe was loaded in the system tray; MSSE performed the entire scan to complettion -- no problems.&nbsp; So, I'm not detecting any conflict between ClamTray.exe and MSSE.<br />
<br />
I then initiated a "custom scan" of my C: drive while "clamtray.exe" was loaded in the systray.&nbsp; Contrary to my usual practice, I remained connected trhough the entirety of the MSSE scan of the C: drive.&nbsp; The MSSE scan completed with no problems whatsoever
 -- over a half million items scanned &amp; no problems.<br />
<br />
I then disconnected from the internet and repeated the MSSE "custom scan" of the C: drive.&nbsp; BINGO! BINGO! BINGO!&nbsp; The Antimalware service crashed and the scan halted permanently, notwithstanding that the actual Antimalware "service" had re-started itself automatically.&nbsp;
 The fact that the "custom scan" in this instance resulted in a stoppage of the Antimalware service is an anamolous result, and I have no thoughts as to why the service crashed in this test.<br />
<br />
I then tried again with a FULL MSSE scan, still disconnected from the internet, and the identical result happened; to whit:&nbsp; Antimalware service stopped and the scan halted and did NOT continue afterthe Antimalware service automatically re-started itself.&nbsp;
 Full scan DOES involve some MSSE scanning on drives other than the C: drive.<br />
<br />
Tried a third time.&nbsp; Same result.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; I did note one of the registry settings for MSSE that indicates the program is supposed to check for virus definitions pre-scan; but the app service is not stalling until the actual scan is about one-third to one-half the way through; so I don't see how
 a pre-scan signature check can kill the app's service after the scan is well underway.<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp; BSOD ERROR:&nbsp; I finally selected a custom scan and set MSSE to scan C:|Program Files on the C: drive; and I selected one folder randomly on Drives D: E: F: respectively.&nbsp; This scan, again disconnected from the internet, produced a BSOD and the following
 STOP ERROR message:<br />
<br />
STOP:&nbsp; 0x000000 (0xC000001D, 0xBF864CF4, 0xB31D6448, 0x00000000)<br />
***&nbsp; win32k.sys - Address BF864CF4 base at BF800000 DateStamp 4c220f9a<br />
<br />
On RESTART (reset is actually what I did), the machine booted up just fine; Microsoft Antimalware Service was in a "Started" state; BUT the MSSE icon did not appear in the systray (notification area).&nbsp; BOTH "msseces.exe" AND "MsMPEng.exe", however, appeared
 as running processes in Task Manager.&nbsp; When I attempted to manually launch the MSSEC User Interface manually, however, using the icon MSSEC had deposited on the Desktop during the re-installation of the program, the MSSEC app User Interface would not launch;
 the MSSE UI simply would not launch.&nbsp; On bootup, Autocheck stated that the drives were all clean and did not undertake a Checkdisk scan.<br />
<br />
The O/S produced a "WGAErrLog.txt" file that states as follows:<br />
D446F964-596-80004005_D446F964-495-80004005_D446F964-596-80004005_D446F964-495-80004005_D446F964-596-80004005_D446F964-495-80004005_D446F964-596-80004005_D446F964-495-80004005_D446F964-596-80004005_D446F964-495-80004005_D446F964-596-80004005_D446F964-495-80004005_D446F964-596-80004005_D446F964-563-80004005_D446F964-596-80004005_D446F964-529-80004005_D446F964-596-80004005_D446F964-529-80004005_D446F964-596-80004005_D446F964-529-80004005_D446F964-596-80004005_D446F964-529-80004005<br />
<br />
Which, although it might mean something to an MVP, means nothing to me.<br />

Description:<br />
The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck.&nbsp; The bugcheck was: 0x1000008e (0xc000001d, 0xbf864cf4, 0xb31d6448, 0x00000000). A dump was saved in: C:\WINDOWS\Minidump\Mini090510-01.dmp.<br />

<br />
The Minidump States as follows:<br />
Indecipherable.<br />
<br />
So, it seems, I've managed to go from bad to worse here and am truly stumped and in dire need of some help or guidance towards getting out of the conundrum that seems to have enveloped my box.<br />
<br />
I don't even know at this point whether I've got anti-virus/anti-malware protection (other than CLAMWIN) or not.&nbsp; I have NO launchable MSSE UI available to me.<br />
<br />
Dr. Watson tells me "No Faults Detected."&nbsp; Now I know why Dr. Watson was just Sherlock's sidekick; because I see a LOTTA errors and faults.<br />
<br />
OK, I "restarted" XP and then went to Safe Mode and launched MSSE.&nbsp; The UI launched but the red "unprotected" condition was how the UI came up (I launched it using the icon in Quick Start).&nbsp; This made sense inasmuch as the on demand service wouldn't be running
 in Safe Mode.&nbsp; But the UI did in fact come up.<br />
<br />
I "restarted" out of Safe Mode.&nbsp; The machine rebooted.&nbsp; Now the icon for MSSE appears in the systray notification area and tells me that I am now "protected."&nbsp; This time it did in fact complete a scan; but it's completed scans before only to fail the next time
 around.<br />
<br />
So, to top it off, it looks like not only am I getting some failures but I'm also getting some "inconsistent" failure results to boot.&nbsp; This ain't good; I need a little help here figuring this out.&nbsp; This thing is all over the map.&nbsp; I normally don't get very
 many errors in XP; maybe once in a blue moon; but this error error error stuff only started last Wednesday evening after I installed MSSE and started using it.<br />
<br />
If MSSE works out, and I hope it does, my game plan going forward is to perhaps use MSSE on a daily basis but hose the box out with CLAMWIN about once a week as a backup scan since ALL anti-virus programs "miss" things; and, as I understand it, one really should
 use two sets of scanning tools:&nbsp; one as the daily/nightly scan and the other as the "catchall" fallback on a periodic basis.&nbsp; I may use the "on demand" feature of MSSE or I may not -- most likely not, particularly since I routinely initiate an antivirus/malware
 scan before leaving work and do so every day.&nbsp; I might want to turn on the "on demand" feature while I am on the internet.<br />
<br />
But for years now, I have been using the following regime:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; XP updated firewall running continuously,<br />
<br />
2. nightly scan by CLAMWIN,<br />
<br />
3. Once or twice weekly manual scan of "EVERYTHING" by Windows Defender;<br />
<br />
3. Once or twice a month super-thorough manually initiated scan with Spybot,<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; Weekly full, custom, scans of "EVERYTHING" with the downloaded current, monthly, version of Microsoft's Antimalware tool.<br />
<br />
Thus far, knock on wood, I have not encountered a successful virus or malware or spyware attack.&nbsp; I know this regime works.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I really would like to do is incorporate MSSE into the regime since MSSE does in fact give me an "on demand" anti-virus scanning capability while I am on the internet.&nbsp; I generally avoid going to any risky sites on the internet; but, as we all know, even
 a safe site can have a virus, unknown to the webmaster, lurking about.<br />
<br />
So far, except for the halted scan problem, as well as the fact that many times I can't get the UI for MSSE to load problem, that I am experiencing, I like MSSE; for what appears to be a rather comprehensive anti-virus, anti-malware, anti-adware, anti-spyware
 app, it has a rather light touch -- unlike the other anti-malware programs which invariably are resource hogs, particularly if one has their "on demand" feature activated.<br />
<br />
Thus, if any of you folk spot a solution here, I would really appreciate it if you could help me out of the trap here.<br />
<br />
I'm no noobe when it comes to computers or Windows O/S's; but I'm afraid "services" and "dependancies", and customizing "service/app" interoperability is just an area of computers and computer programming into which I have never ventured -- mainly because I've
 never had a problem occur in that area.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the solution here is merely a simple turning to OFF of a couple of additional lines in the registry settings that relate to SpyNet so that the entirety of the SpyNet reporting is disabled; I really don't want the app trying to connect to the internet
 during the night.&nbsp; Plus, there is no way on earth that I am going to remain connected to the internet while scanning for malware -- ain't gonna happen; ever since I first installed Windows 95 I have always been super careful to allow nothing in my box to automatically
 initiate either an internet connection or a telnet or a modem connection.&nbsp; When I am not actively using the internet, the internet stays OFF.<br />
<br />
Alternately, perhaps there is some way I can instruct the Antimalware service to cause the MSSE app to continue its then current scan after the Antimalware service stops and restarts itself?&nbsp; I refuse to believe that Microsoft wouldn't have a way to instruct
 the MSSE app to continue its scan after its related service has halted and re-started.<br />
<br />
Any help or guidance you can give me will be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; I'm not shy about editing the registry -- been doing it for about 15 years now, and so far, knock on wood again, I've never had a corrupted registry problem.<br />
<br />
Do not hesitate to ask for more Event Viewer logs, or whatever, if you need them to crack this walnut.&nbsp; I'll be checking back periodically at the Help forum inasmuch as I would like to put this problem into the past tense.<br />
<br />
Again, sorry for the lengthy post; but you've got everything that I've got, I think.&nbsp; If you need more, just let me know.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
<br />

<h2>            Adding Custome MS Project fields to PWA &#39;Task List&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>Apologies if this is a repeat. I've been searching for weeks and have come across things that LOOK like the same question, but I just can't follow the threads to get to a final answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are on MS Server 2013, PWA. I've created custom fields in our project schedule template using both 'text' and 'number' fields. I've made sure they are 'enterprise fields', thus available to all projects and the BI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I publish my project file to the server (PWA) I can see the custom fields in the 'schedule' view as columns. I'm attempting to add those same fields to the 'task list' view of the project schedule. IS THAT POSSIBLE?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need my team members who do not have the license to view the PWA published schedule to be able to see these same custom fields in a general task list.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ONLY thing that has come close, is to NOT publish the schedule to PWA, but map it to a custom list at the time of the first publish. While this serves the purpose for my team members, it will not allow for other 'schedule' functionality in PWA and I
 will not be able to see updated project schedule data in the BI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!!!!</p>

<p>Hi Dale,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the tip. I changed the fields to 'roll down....' on the edit custom field page as you indicated. It's not giving me what we need yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been a champion of PWA for years, I'm afraid if I can't get a solution for this, it's a show-stopper for the client and they will abandon PWA altogether.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The custom fields are required by the client, (regulatory issue), need to be visible on the 'Tasks' page after the project is published and also need to be available via the BI for aggregate reporting purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to publish the schedule to two separate lists on the workspace? One which is automatically published when the schedule is published, then another generic 'custom' task list?</p>

<p>sorry - yes. Projects were published to PWA again. Perhaps I'm not clear on WHERE the custom enterprise field needs to be seen:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
We are working to transition our teams to using PWA, specifically referencing the ‘TASKS’ list which is created when an MSP file is published. NOT their personal ‘tasks’ list when they log into PWA.
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
They (and execs) need to be able to view the schedule as a whole w/o having MSP Pro License. We’ve attempted to have them access the PWA schedule (grid and Gantt) and have created specific views for them…. but they want an ‘at a glance’ ‘task list’ view.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
We require specific data to be included in our projects, for which we have successfully created Custom Enterprise Task Fields, which are part of our MSP file template and available to all projects.
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Here’s the goal:<br />
In the TASK list (which is created when a project is published to PWA), we need to add these custom fields so they appear as part of the viewable project schedule, just as they do in the on-line PWA schedule.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Is there a way to do this?</p>

    <title>Word for iPad track changes glitch - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobhcc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word for iPad track changes glitch</h2>
                    There is a serious problem with the way track changes works. &nbsp;If you add a new word, that shows up as an addition (different color). &nbsp;If you quickly change that word it will only show the new word; but if you wait a minute and then change the word, it
 will show the first word as deleted (strikethough) and the second word as an addition. (different color ). So instead of communicating clear comments to another party, what they see, essentially, is not only how you changed their language, but how you changed
 or corrected your own language while you worked on the document. &nbsp;This happens even if auto save is not on. &nbsp;Essentially makes track changes worthless. Am I doing something srong or will MS fix in an update?

            <p>Is there a reply to this issue? We have an editor that would like to work on her iPad. That requires Word .docx file format, track changes, and comments. Ability to add and remove tracked changes and comments and compatibility sending the file on to a PC
 user (the author) for use of the tracked changes. We're trying to decide if we should allow her to work on her iPad or insist (as is our standard) she work with a PC.</p>

<p>This is so frustrating. I have disks with hundreds of docs where I saved from Office or Word 97 that came in MS Works. I thought MS 2007 would open them in a flash - or Windows Office XP - but both give me errors that the convertor fails. I followed MS suggestion
 and fix but it only opened the doc to zeros without stopping to show me the error message. The exact error message was : word cannot start the converter mswrd632.wpc</p>
<p>I've tried everything and really need to read and or convert these simple documents. I'll be very thankful and grateful for any help. They are important documents.</p>

<h3> birdwood school  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 - Security Distribution List Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a local AD which is synced to Azure so it can be integrated with Office 365 for mail, password sync and user sync is on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a group that shows up under 365 and AD under Azure called "_All Teachers", it is a security distribution list, when I attempt to hide the group as our users keep sending to it but it isnt in use, I get the error stating that the object is being synchronized
 with an on premise AD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot remove/hide this group under Azure AD or Office 365 admin, in addition the group does not actually show under our local AD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I remove this if the local object doesn't actually exist?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Domain is syncing regularly and persists after sync)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Tyler</p>

            Fixed by remoting into Azure AD via powershell instead of Office 365, ran Remove-MsolGroup with object ID and resynced, group was then removed.

<h2>            Instagram &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; - how to delete</h2>
                    I hope someone can advise. &nbsp;I do not want my 11 year old daughter going on instagram. &nbsp;She installed it once and and I have now enabled the account so that she has to ask me if she wants to download anything. &nbsp;However my question is, having downloaded
 instagram once, I have now deleted it from her phone, &nbsp;will she be able to upload it again automatically without my permission as it will be in the app download history (so to speak)? &nbsp;Many thanks
                </div>

            <p>I think that the parental controls will take over and she'd have to go through you to download anything further, even if it's been purchased before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The simplest way to find out would be to attempt this yourself on her phone (i.e. you pretend to be her) so that you can see for yourself what happens.</p>

<h2>            6 months of very poor Skype experience. Nothing works. May be my account to blame.</h2>
                    <p>I feel that after many many attempts to have a good working Skype that it is my account saved on your servers is the culprit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I experience all kinds of issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following issues occur after fresh install of New Hard drive, Fresh Windows 7 pro and Skype latest install...</p>
<p>Calls not going through happens a lot. This is the more serous current issue.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Skype ring sound keeps going even after answered calls. So I cant talk to people as its annoying.</p>
<p>Other times I cant answer my calls coming in.</p>
<p>Many other issues as well.</p>
<p>I work at a place where I have access to 11 rendering only PCS as well as 2 Workstations I use.</p>
<p>Please take this serous because I have INSTALLED fresh, logged on, and tried to use Skype on 4 separate pcs. Seems that after a day or two Skype fails every time. ? There&nbsp; is no PC I seem be able to Skype on. Currently I am using a New High end PC only 4
 months old. SKype messed up days after installing it. What makes this even more unbelievable is Just a week ago I installed a New hard drive SSD 1TB and proceeded to install Skype again. Guess what 2-3 days later same problems arise very time. Is this something
 that is saved on Skype servers sent to my pc like user preferences or something?</p>
<p>I really believe my account needs to be looked at, rebuilt or deleted entirely. Cant be a technical hardware or software issues IMO.<br />
I would hate to loose all my contacts however If i create new account and delete old one. The people I work with are having Zero issues with there Skype and i just dont get it.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks Clarence Olsen</p>

<b>I am assuming you are referring to Spell Check in Outlook.com</b><br />
<br />
If you are using a lower version of Internet Explorer when accessing your account,
<b>by default you must click the "Spell Check" link for it to function.</b><br />
<br />
Outlook.com has a Manual Spell check button on the top next to Options.<br />
<b>It does not appear unless you are writing an email.</b><br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fjfeauw.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1pZ2nl5tZgE_87Wsml0Rkf69Wryg11fKeFnQlmeGWkuS1aZTVuA3_XFrG6gmCNDAuQT9AlYireAIRh6C-w0CBGMQTlpuxzLkV8%2fspell%2520check.jpg%3fpsid%3d1" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>If you are using Internet Explorer 9 browser, or any updated browser, the Spell Check feature will not be found&nbsp; because it is already integrated within this browser's system.</b><br />
Meaning, once you have misspelled certain words, it will automatically be detected by the system. Notice that when you have a typo, you'll see it right away because it will appear with a red underline in it.
<br />
<b>Right click the error to correct it. </b><br />

    <title>Windows 10 micro stutter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paragondevil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 micro stutter</h2>
                    <p>After I updated to Windows 10 I am experiencing micro stutters everywhere. Its just hangs for 0.5 seconds every 20 seconds or something. However when I am playing games it doesn't even stutter at all. Quite annoying and I have no idea what is wrong with
 my laptop can't even watch youtube or type this out without having seeing the computer stutter unless i kept a game minimized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried updating the Intel Graphic driver doesn't seem to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer specs</p>
<p>Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 - 3610QM CPU @ 2.30 GHZ</p>
<p>8 GB RAM</p>
<p>Intel HD Graphics 4000 / Nvidia GTX 680M&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update 1:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found out that once I end task explorer.exe the micro stutter stopped. Plus I did a SFC scannow and I got an error.&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/64301a79-9397-463e-b27a-96072426a68f" /></p>

<p>
</p><p>Update 2:</p>
<p>I realized the issue was that the picture slideshow as the background changing wallpaper every 10 seconds which stutter every 10 seconds.&nbsp;Changed to a static wallpaper and the problem is solved!

            <p>paragondevil,</p>
<p>Ouch! explorer.exe is not something you can just shut off! It underlies all of your desktop functions, start menu, icons, everything. So, that's not going to be a good solution. But, all the time you are running Windows, explorer is busy doing a bunch of
 background tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Indexing the file system, watching all the storage locations, refreshing the desktop, etc. So, it's likely that on your machine, one of those background functions is keeping explorer extremely busy, detracting from the overall performance of your machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the list of possibilities, ranges from a failing hard drive (don't be alarmed, it's just one of the possibilities) to a mapped but missing network location, with dozens of other cause in between.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a new problem to Windows, and so I suggest a thorough search on the Net for "Explorer slowing down the computer" or something like that and reading what others have done to diagnose and fix this issue. You will see way more information that you
 want to sift through, so make yourself a nice list of the possibilities in Word or Excel and then rearrange the list in order of easiest / quickest to try, down to last resort fixes like reinstalling Windows. Then just run through them one at a time. The truth
 is out there! (cue music)</p>

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If you mean you want to let the manger to access these documents but not other ones, you can grant him access permission only on these documents to achieve that. For example, you can create a folder
 in a library, share the folder with the manager, then put all the related documents into this specific folder. If the manger has no permission to access the whole library, he will only be able to see the items in this specific folder.</span></p>

    <title>Windows Defender randomly starting a scan&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Defender randomly starting a scan&#63;</h2>
                    I recently did a full scan of my computer and nothing was found but a few minutes later I came back from doing something and my computer had started a quick scan. As soon as I moved the mouse the scan stopped. Earlier on today I had a similar experience
 where another program started without me clicking on it. Is this something to be worried about or is it just me being worrisome?

    <title>Editing a template by removing combo box - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iron hayden  say:</h3>
<h2>            Editing a template by removing combo box</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded a customer database template for Access that is almost perfect for me,&nbsp;but I&nbsp;want to make&nbsp;one change. I have&nbsp;never&nbsp;used Access before, and while my knowledge is limited, I am a fast learner.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This template serves as a customer database and has an order tracking feature. In the&nbsp;order management feature, there is a table that includes a product list, quantity, unit price, discount, and extended price.&nbsp;The product list field is a drop down box and
 I am required to select a product and price&nbsp;from those that are entered into the system. Ideally, I'd like to turn off this feature and allow the user to type their own unique&nbsp;details into those fields. How do I make this kind of change on the table?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found the "Design View" tab...but don't know where to go from there.</p>

            Without knowing which template you are referring to we cannot be categorical, but I doubt very much that you should be doing what you say you want to do.&nbsp; The table to which you refer appears to be a referencing table in a relationship with a Products
 table.&nbsp; It most likely includes a foreign key column such as ProductID of a long integer number data type which references the numeric primary key of a Products table, which is probably an autonumber.&nbsp; You may see a text value for product in the referencing
 table, but that almost certainly will not be the actual value in the column.<br />
<br />
If you were to allow values to be inserted into a referencing table which do not have a match in the referenced table to which they are related you would be undermining one of the basic principles of the database relational model, and opening the database to
 the risk of inconsistent data.&nbsp; Relational databases are based on formal principles for very good reasons as they ensure the integrity of the data.&nbsp; You can do what you wish while maintaining the correct structure as it is possible to type a new value, i.e.
 a product name, into a combo box and have a new row inserted into the referenced Products table by putting code in the control's NotInList event procedure.&nbsp; This code will probably need to open a form, to which the new product name is passed, so that other
<br />
As you are new to database development in MS Access you would be well advised to do some background work on the general principles and mechanisms of designing a relational database.&nbsp; There are many sources for this, both on-line and as publications, but a good
 start would be Crystal's tutorial at:<br />

For examples of the use of the NotInList event procedure in various contexts take a look at NotInList.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />

            <p>I am using Access 2007 and the template I downloaded is called "Order Management Database" as found here:
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/results.aspx?qu=Order+management+database&amp;ex=1&amp;origin=TC001018547#ai:TC001018548" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also downloaded the template called "Customer Orders Database" as seen here:

http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/results.aspx?qu=customer+database&amp;ex=1#ai:TC001018547</a>|</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either of these templates will work for my needs, but they both have the same issue.

<br />
That's not the table.&nbsp; That is a subform on the main form and it is BOUND to the original Order Details table but the query for the subform has the extended price calculation done there (where it should be).&nbsp; As Ken has stated - you should have a list of products
 maintained and they select from that list and if they need to add one that doesn't exist, you can utilize the Not In List event.&nbsp; But you need to be careful with that as well so things don't get so mucked up that you have the same product entered more than
 once, etc.

            <p>If I am understanding your business process correctly, you have a very non-standard ordering process...most everything is a custom part.&nbsp; I have seen this in Job Shops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might get away with adding a&nbsp;ItemDescription (Text 255 field) to the Order Details table and subform.&nbsp; I would still keep the Product link and add a part Called Custom to use by default....thus keep all the standard features like a base price.</p>

Yes, that is spot on, Jack. Thanks for your suggestion. That may be just the fix I was looking for. How do I add the Text 255 field?

<h3> gamer3916  say:</h3>
<h2>            Anyone else bought a HTC Touch in Canada&#47;US&#63; GPRS Problem</h2>
                    I bought one a week ago, and I've tried few days to get connected to GPRS but still couldn't. I called my service provider (Rogers) and get all the information for GPRS connection, tried many times, nothing at all. I also called HTC US customer support
 line, and they are not familiar with this product. <br />
<br />
I removed my SIM card and inserted it into another cell phone and the GPRS works fine.<br />
<br />
I noticed that in the Comm Manager in my HTC Touch, the "Data Connection" is grayed out, I can't touch it at all. Maybe this is the problem?<br />
<br />
So, anyone else has a HTC Touch? Does your GPRS work? Then what's the status of that "data connection" button?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

            I am not sure, actually. Called HTC's customer support in US and Taiwan, but still no answers yet. I guess my only option is to try their Europe line???<br />
<br />
It's a new phone, especially in North America, and even those customer support staff are not familiar with it yet.<br />
<br />
Any way, when first turn on the phone, it asks for country/operator, but Canada or Rogers are not in the list. The only thing I could do is to ignore that page, and go ahead. When I called Rogers, they told me all the parameters to use GPRS (apn, username,
 password), so I go to settings and modify those parameters myself.<br />
<br />
After that, I disabled the wifi and then opened my internet explorer. It did tried to open a GPRS connection, but one second later, it reported that the connection was ended by the other party.<br />

<p>But you should be able to go in and create a NEW connection and enter the settings manually.&nbsp; Why not try doing it again with a fresh entry....</p>

    <title>Office 2019 Lost Tile in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 53hat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2019 Lost Tile in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I installed Office Professional 2019 64 bit on my new computer. This is the stand-alone product, not 365. I had a little trouble getting Outlook to work, but after some research, was able to find and upgrade to Outlook 2016 and access all my info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the features I really liked was a Windows 10 Tile that when clicked gave me access to all the installed office products, as well as a list of all recent office files, as well as other options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After an Office update, I was having trouble accessing all office products, and was getting messages that I had to log in to my Microsoft account. After some unsuccessful attempts, I think I deleted the tile while trying to figure out what was wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I eventually got everything running, but cannot find a way to restore that Tile. I would think it is some type of startup file and is a .exe-any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;<br />

            That is the tile with the orange Office icon, called Office? It's a Windows store app - reinstall it from the store.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7a82b631-a4fa-424e-9938-b6b839ff4ee8?upload=true" />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spoke too soon. I'm almost certain it is the application that was installed-has the exact look and feel. However, it is not accessing Office installation (stand-alone 2019). Instead, it is bringing me to Office 365 on the cloud. Any Suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tom</p>

<p>As far as I know, that app is designed for subscriptions and won't work with the retail apps. I have a retail copy installed on one computer and it works the same here - going to the online version, not opening my installed apps.
<br />
<br />
And 2 seconds later (after I reset the office app) , it makes me out to be a liar, I was able to open Access - Word needed to be opened in word online then i clicked the button to open in the desktop app. (Time to check the default app settings).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my apps pinned to the start menu and the ones I use the most pinned to the taskbar - that Office app is just an extra step and doesn't offer any benefit.
