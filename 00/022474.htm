<h2>            Suddenly getting tons of spam emails</h2>
                    <p>Hello all, and Microsoft Staff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using Outlook as my main email provider for over 5 years, and I have never faced an issue all until now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just about a month ago, I started receiving not less than 5 to 7 spam emails a day offering fake gift cards, and asking me to sign up for credit cards and bank loans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I I always reported such emails as spam, or phishing emails from the Outlook PC website but it still doesn't matter, I still receive emails from the same servers and about the exact same topics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First such emails were filtered as spam by Outlook and never made it to my Inbox, now they all make it to my inbox and nothing ever gets caught as spam!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its also getting worse, just today I received an phishing email from a fraud server acting as PayPal claiming that a phone number (a fake one) was added to my account. I jumped out of my bed when I saw it before I realized it was fake. I clicked the link
 in the email to update my info and noticed immediately that the URL in the address bar was not even PayPal, but it was just a phishing site that looks identical to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course I didn't submit my login details, instead I felt like trolling the **** out of whoever did this by entering fake email info, fake password, fake billing address and fake credit card number.. Because you know, if your going to waste my time, I might
 as well waste yours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need your help sorting out. I tried reporting the emails as I mentioned earlier but it just seams like getting worse. I have blocked tons of email addresses so far but it seams I am wasting my time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two factor authentication on, and a strong password to I am confident that no one has access to my account but me. I never gave the password to anyone, and never left my account logged in on any public PC. Never.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<h2>            Does E71 come with U-APSD &#40;Unscheduled Automatic Power Save Delivery&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    I'm using E71's WiFi features for quite some time now and it seems to me that my battery is running out quickly even if I'm not having Internet activity (WiFi is connected though). I was wondering if E71's WiFi conserves power when there's no acitivity
 on the Internet (the connection is established though).

            The term U-APSD is used in wireless networks supporting the IEEE 802.11e Quality of Service standard. It was introduced in order to support power management in QBSS. In essence, it involves a QAP delivering downlink frames which belong to a specified access
 class to power saving Stations automatically. The Unscheduled variant is triggered by a Station receiving either a Delivery or Trigger enabled frame from a particular access class.<br />
<br />
IEEE 802.11e-2005 or 802.11e is an approved amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard that defines a set of Quality of Service enhancements for wireless LAN applications through modifications to the Media Access Control (MAC) layer. The standard is considered of
 critical importance for delay-sensitive applications, such as Voice over Wireless IP and Streaming Multimedia. The amendment has been incorporated into the published IEEE 802.11-2007 standard.<br />
<br />
Since Nokia E – 71 has<br />
# WLAN IEEE 802.11b/g<br />
# WLAN Security: WEP, 802.1X, WPA, WPA2<br />
<br />
So I can safely say that there no other alternative but to switch off ur wifi as and when possible

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 930</h2>
                    <p>I bought my Lumia phone about a year and half ago.It worked great until last summer the battery icon started showing up with an ''X'' on it,it wouldn't charge and kept restarting all the time until it finally gave up on me and wasn't reacting at all.I bring
 it to the store I bought it in Vip Croatia.I handed it to them and they said they will send the phone to my adress in about 2 weeks.It's been 7 months I called them and they said the phone was soaked in water and too damaged to fix.The only problem with that
 is that the phone never actually got wet.</p>
<p>The warranty expired and I'm without a phone right now...the device isn't cheap and I really can't afford to buy a new one right now...</p>
<p>Can Microsoft send me a new one?</p>

<h2>            Opening a PDF with Edge, in Microsoft Office 16</h2>
                    <p>Hello all.&nbsp; I have Microsoft Office 16.&nbsp; I have discovered to my dismay that rather than offering the option to open a PDF with Edge, it automatically converts it to an editable Word document.&nbsp; The resulting document is a mess and totally unsuitable for
 my purposes.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to change this default?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not a techie, so please answer in basic terms...and please don't tell me it can't be done!</p>

            Hi Carolyn
<br />
<br />Right click any PDF file, choose 'Open With' - Choose Another App
<br />
<br />Important - Check the box marked 'Always use this app to open pdf . . .'
<br />
<br />If Edge is not in the list, scroll to the bottom and click 'More Apps'
<br />
<br />Edge should appear in that second list . . .

            Hi C
<br />
<br />When trying to set a file association with Edge, are you right clicking a pdf file on your hard drive or from the web?
<br />
<br />You need to right click a pdf file on your hard drive to set the file association with Edge
<br />
<br />For any file on your hard drive, you should have a lot more options than that, you should have minimum, there options - Open with, Send to, Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, Properties, Rename, create Shortcut

<p>Hi again, Dave.&nbsp; I'm right-clicking on the document from my Documents file, not from the Web. (If I'm understanding the distinction you're making...)&nbsp; Some (but not all) of these PDF documents were originally attachments from an email, including court documents.&nbsp;
 One was a document I created by scanning.&nbsp; Would the origin of the file matter for any reason?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have discovered that if I go through File Explorer, I can "open with"; however, when I do that,&nbsp; I do not see an option to always use Edge (or anything else) to open PDF files.&nbsp; Can you point me to where that message would typically be displayed?&nbsp; (I remember
 it well from the previous version.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.&nbsp; I appreciate your suggestions.</p>

<p>Hi, Dave.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.&nbsp; When opening the document from File Explorer, I had just been choosing Microsoft Edge, since that was one of the immediately available options.&nbsp; I hadn't even tried "Choose another app."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried that option, again in File Explorer.&nbsp; Microsoft Edge was already highlighted, and I was presented with the option to always use that app to open pdf files.&nbsp; I selected this option and clicked OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried opening the document from its normal situation, within Word.&nbsp; Again, I did not receive the option to "open with"; again the only options were "Open" and "Copy path to clipboard."&nbsp; When I chose "Open," I again received the message that the document
 would be converted to an editable Word document. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought perhaps a restart was necessary, so I restarted and performed the operations again.&nbsp; No change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked to see what the default app is for opening pdf files...it's Edge.&nbsp; But that isn't what's happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really frustrating.&nbsp; I don't know how this "thinks."</p>

<p>When you try to open a document within Word, Word will always try to open it. You should open PDFs from File Explorer instead. Alternatively, if you add the classic Open dialog to the QAT, you should get the Open With option when you right-click on a file
 in that dialog. The screen shot below is from Word 2013, but you should be able to do the same in Word 2016.</p>

                    <p>HI, i have a problem on my pc, where I want to create an outlook profile, for my pop account. But the problem is when i create account and it connects to server, when it should open outlook, it crashes with message "an unexpected error has occurred". And
 I can`t open outlook.&nbsp;<br />
What i have tried:<br />

Try and to open in safe mode<br />

fix PST file with SCANPST</p>
<p>Try fixing office in online solution</p>
<p>create new mail profile</p>
<p>updating office to newest edition</p>
<p>Tried creating another local user</p>

            Hi ArunasDe,
<br />
<br />My name is Pedro. I'm an Independent Advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />You took all the reasonable steps, the last thing to try in my opinion is set up the account with this tool.
<br />

<br />Give it a try and let me know how it goes.

            Thanks for answering, i tried that program you listed and i got really confused, the option to check when my outlook is not working it kept on asking my microsoft account, even though i put in my correct password. So i chose other option, that admin wanted
 to check this program and when i opened outlook with an error it found that service BITS wasn`t working/running, but when i checked it was running and was set on automatic delayed, and another thing that it found was outlook shortcut on start menu folder was
 not present, but when i checked it was right there in that folder :D<br />
So after i made that BITS service to automatic (without delayed), outlook started :D<br />
I`m really confused as what helped for outlook to work :D

            I don`t have any other mail protocol for now, maybe I will have the time to check that option if outlook, won`t start again. And about creating profile in another windows profile, i did that and it still didn`t work.
<br />
So for now looks like outlook works outlook diagnostics tool helped :D<br />
Thanks guys for all the help. :)

    <title>External domain users to authenticate to SharePoint Online - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markrab  say:</h3>
<h2>            External domain users to authenticate to SharePoint Online programatically. Possible&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, there's a lot of confusion about this, so hopefully I will be able to get a straight answer from experts around here. We are trying to connect our app to Sharepoint Online and it all works fine as long as the users have the share the same domain as the
 SharePoint site. Like MyDomain.com. Any other external user that has anything different from MyDomain.com as long as they have an MS account they can log using browser only, but log thru app fails all the time. For external users with no MS account like a
 vendor or supplier that we have to share documents with, they are not able to log at all browser or app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question is that the way SharePoint Online should work (like by MS design)??? I thought that the while point of SharePoint was to allow proper sharing, I would understand if the whole issue is connected to licenses as using external domain will not require
 paid seats, but if this is the plan, why not explain clearly so that people understand how to use the application?</p>
<p>Don't mean to rant or anything, but this was something that was working and apparently after last few updates, this was broken but no mention of why. So just trying to get an answer to help all other people</p>

<p>Hi Marcus,</p>
<p>As answered in the thread from MSDN forum by Reken Liu, it is not feasible to authenticate external domain user to SharePoint Online.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">“The fact is external users cannot authenticate against Office 365 programmatically. When an external user use UI to access SharePoint Online(Office 365), the user will be redirected to the external service (for example,
 outlook.com)for authentication first, and then the external service will redirect a security token to Office 365. The authentication process is like a kind of federation between Office 365 and external service, so basically Office 365 login service cannot
 recognize external users' username and passwords. To authenticate Office 365 in an application, please consider to convert external users to internal users in your tenant, and you may purchase Kiosk licenses for the particular external users.”</span></p>

<h2>            Conditional Formatting to compare cells&#63;</h2>
                    I'm having a bit of an issue with Excel 2013. &nbsp;I'm using Excel to record both experimental data (currently in cells B4:J29, but that will grow as I add more data) and target data (in cells B2:J2). &nbsp;Is there any way to use conditional formatting to compare
 the experimental data in a given column (each column records a different data point) to the same column's target data and highlight a match? &nbsp;Thanks!

<p>
</p><p>To better assist you with this concern, we would like to know if you have tried to check the

    <title>Lumia 635 unable to utilise text messaging after update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nerodog  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 635 unable to utilise text messaging after update</h2>
                    <p>I run windows 10 on a Lumia 635 and had no complaints until last week when a large update was pushed out. This has left the text function on my phone virtually unusable. The keyboard and the black bar on top of that for predictive text now obscure the message
 that you are trying to write. How can you write a message when you cannot see it? If you do manage then you'll need a combination of luck and skill to try and hit the very top edge of the "send" icon as that all that remains visible.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the keyboard the menu bar that should appear with every new text has just gone so I cannot actually start a new text with anyone, I can only continue "established" conversations. The missing menu bar also has the delete function so I can't
 start a text and I can't delete a text either.</p>
<p>I have soft reset umpteen times</p>
<p>backed up and did a hard reset with full restore and tried every suggestion on every Microsoft Forum I can find and nothing helps. It's very nice having a phone that is capable of all kinds of "smart" features but the reason I need a phone is to contact
 people by phone and text and now my text ability has been removed.</p>
<p>This is very poor, a supposed smart phone that cannot manage to text. </p>
<p>I am also aware that by rotating your phone to Landscape it resizes the keyboard and the missing features come back but has it really come to this, "Your Microsoft Windows 10 Lumia 635 is packed full of the latest apps &amp; features, it just can't do text messages
 unless you turn it sideways"</p>
<p>Lumia 635</p>
<p>Version:1607</p>
<p>OS Build: 10.0.14393.67</p>
<p>Firmware revision number: 02040.00019.14484.24001</p>
<p>Hardware revision number: 6.1.0.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be extremely grareful if anyone could offer any help at all.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>why should I?</p>
<p>I spend good money buying a phone. </p>
<p>you encourage the users to upgrade claiming it to be a better easier to use, more friendly OS.
</p>
<p>only to find it is exactly like the pc version of the OS, buggy and not at all compatible or finished.</p>
<p>the very thing that makes it more hilarious is this is a windows phone that isn't compatible with your newly updated OS.

            You are correct. Handnt noticed this issue initially but you are correct. A phone that has pretty much become unusable, the call 📞 button is just visible, let's wait for next update, will prob disappear completely!

<h2>            Lumia 830 audio not working except with headset</h2>
                    <p>My Lumia 830 audio just went silent when I was using it. I performed a soft reset,didn't fix the problem. Turned phone off and took out the battery and restarted,didn't work. Checked the audio settings and everything was fine but still no sound. When I connected
 my headset I was able to hear my ringtone and other notification sounds but when I took it out the phone went back to silent. I have missed a lot of important calls because of this problem which I believe is a firmware issue. Please fix this problem asap.</p>

            <p>Hi ChineduEmesiani,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your entry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that you are getting Audio issue&nbsp;on&nbsp;your Windows Phone , for some reason it may be an hardware issue and your Windows phone is acting as a headset is plugged on it and the phone audio connection is disabled. if this the case you need to send your device
 for repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this issue is software related, the soft reset should resolve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

            I bought the phone online from amazon,if you're saying that a firmware update won't fix the problem and the phone requires repairing,then that's my faith in Microsoft devices going down,because I just bought the phone in November last year and I have to
 fix it already? And I wasn't careless with it

            <p>Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/01d61d0f-497f-40f0-a4f0-13cb70fbff5c" title="ChineduEmesiani">
ChineduEmesiani</a>. Try performing the following suggestions:</p>
<p><br />
1. Make sure that the <strong>Ringer</strong> volume is not set too low. On the <strong>
Start</strong> screen, press <strong>volume up</strong> key several times to see the number increases in the upper left corner.</p>
<p>2. Check if the issue is with a specific ringtone: Go to <strong>Settings &gt; ringtones+sounds</strong>. Under
<strong>Ringtone</strong>, open a list and choose an item. Tap on a <strong>play</strong> button to preview the ringtone.</p>
<p>3. Make sure that call forwarding is switched off: On the <strong>Start</strong> screen, tap
<strong>Phone</strong> &gt; <strong>...</strong> &gt; <strong>settings</strong> and switch
<strong>Call forwarding</strong> to <strong>Off</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have already performed all of the suggestions above, recover your phone's software using the
<strong>Windows Phone Recovery Tool</strong>:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-ph/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Hi EAsonA,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all of the above. My phone has the same problem as the other customers above. This happened when my phone was about 3 months old.&nbsp; I took my phone to the official dealer/repair shop in Nairobi, Kenya. The customer service was horrible. It was atrocious.
 Despite this fact, I left the phone with them. After a month and half, they called me to pick it up and that the repair had failed and that the motherboard is damaged. This is bogus. The rest of the phone is completely fine. It does exactly what it was designed
 to do except the sound. Clearly the could not properly diagnose and fix the problem. The experience was very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My solution:&nbsp; I had to get a Samsung Bluetooth headset to make and receive calls. It is both an inconvenience and blessing. It is an inconvenience&nbsp; in that I must use the bluethooth&nbsp; headset at all times - a blessing in that the headset comes in handy when
 I am working, or when my hands are busy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The takeaway: Microsoft need to teach its staff both people and technical skills.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            I've tried everything possible,no success. I've learnt to live with a silent phone,but I've decided to sell it soon,hopefully I'll get a good price for it despite it being silent. I love the windows phone, but I'm going to try a different phone and platform.

            Hmmm. Sorry to hear that. I wish you the best. I wanted to get a Surface tablet too but after my experience I am hesitant. Like you I really like the Windows Phone OS and&nbsp; since I travel quite a bit with my work I was thinking of fully integrating into
 their ecosystem but I guess I will have to use&nbsp; windows for Android or IOS Apps.

            Does your 9300 have the latest firmware on it? Version 5.22 seems to be the one, I had a similar problem with my 9500 some time ago but when I got the firmware flashed at my local Nokia service centre the playback is much better. Video playback still seems
 to be an after thought on the communicators though imo.

            On the phone keypad, type *#0000#. The phone will display the software version number, anything lower than v.5.22 and you'll need to take it to your nearest Nokia service centre for an upgrade. (This is free if your phone is less than 2 years old and you
 are having problems with it).

<h2>            Email Still Stick in Outlook Outbox</h2>
                    <p>Hi there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an email that was too large stuck in my Outbox. I have tried the steps listed in https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2663435, but no action (Delete, Move, Edit) does anything. I get the "... Outlook has already begun transmitting this message"
 error even thought I'm working offline, and have made sure to completely kill the previous instance through Task Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody have any other ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook 2013 / Windows 7 </p>

            <p><span>Hello,<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To resolve this issue we need more information. Let us know the following:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What is the type of email account you had setup in Outlook 2013? For example POP3, IMAP, Exchange Active Sync (EAS) or Microsoft Exchange. To check the type of email account configured
 in Outlook 2013 click on <strong>File &gt; Info </strong>&gt;<strong> Account Settings &gt; Account Settings</strong> drop-down. EAS account refers to Hotmail.com, Outlook.com or Live.com email accounts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try the following step:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Put Outlook 2013 into Offline Mode from the Send/Receive tab. </p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Close Outlook 2013.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Open Task Manager and make sure to end all Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Office related processes.
</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Reopen Outlook 2013.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Check if you are able to delete the email from the Outbox.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the above step does not work, then temporarily disconnect the computer from the Internet or Wi-Fi connection. Follow all the steps mentioned above from Step 1 to Step 4 in the
 exact same sequence and check if you are able to successfully delete the stuck email from the Outbox. If it works, you may reconnect to the Internet/Wi-Fi.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try the above steps and let us know if it helps.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Thank you.</span>

    <title>Preferences and Recent Files lost, Office for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Preferences and Recent Files lost, Office for Mac</h2>
                    <p>On a frequent basis, about once per week, my Recent Files list and some Preferences are wiped out and replaced with the default (as if I had just installed Office). In addition to losing the Recent Files list, the "pinned" files list is also lost.</p>
<p>I started noticing this in Nov. 2018. It has persisted since then despite taking several steps to try and resolve it. Any advice on stopping this would be valuable. I depend on the Recent Files as part of my workflow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notes on Installation and Use:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have Office version 16.21 through an Office 365 subscription. I allow it to update automatically.</li><li>I use Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. The Recent Files problem impacts all of these.</li><li>I use Outlook and OneNote. The Preferences problem impacts these.<br />
</li><li>I use Skype for Business. It's not clear if the problem impacts this.</li><li>I use work-provided credentials as my Office365 ID</li><li>Third party plug-ins: EndNote X8 (Word), Adobe Acrobat (Word)</li><li>Computer is MacBook Pro 13-inch, 2016</li><li>OS is macOS Mojave 10.14.2 (problem started while 10.13 was installed)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting steps already taken:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uninstall and re-install Office</li><li>Log out of Office365 account and log back in</li><li>Stop logging in to two Office365 accounts (work, personal)</li><li>Upgrade macOS to the latest version</li></ul>

<p>Hi TJRabbit,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Sorry for the inconvenience it brings to you.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Recently we find that there are many posts which mentioned the update of Office caused the resetting of preferences and issues in recent list.</div>
<div>
<p>Since we test from our side and we cannot reproduce the issue, we would like to suggest you click the smile face in Office applications to send the feedback to the product team directly to let them know the issue.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>

<p>As suggested, I logged out of my Office365 account. The problem has not recurred since then, so the "local user" seems to be fine. However, by doing this I've lost access to my synchronized OneNote files, so I do not want to operate in this fashion long
 term.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does the fact that the "local user" works fine on this computer and my Office365 account works fine on another computer mean? Is there a next step I can take?<br />

<h2>            Mysterious white boxes started in Word but now stay in one place on screen....</h2>
                    I was working with a pdf converter and after downloading the document made some changes then saved them and closed the document. After the document was closed and no other word docs were open but the app was still open and active, two white boxes appeared
 on my screen. &nbsp;If I clicked on another application I could no longer see them but when I opened word or not, old doc or new or no doc open at all, the boxes reappeared. &nbsp;Any clue?

            This is just a hunch, but it sounds like Word might be trying to display 1 or 2 dialogs, but only gets as far as drawing the rectangle where they should appear. If you can create a screen capture (Command + Shift + 3), you can upload the .png file to here
 using the square icon with a circle and jagged shape in it.&nbsp;

<h2>            Lost and Forgotten Password</h2>
                    
<p>I have forgotten my password to Outlook 2002.</p>
<p>I needed to change my IDP provider userid and password to be able to receive my email on my smartphone.&nbsp; Both the web and phone based email work successfully.</p>
<p>However, I am no longer able to use my Outlook on my computer.&nbsp; Appaently, changing the web info caused a disconnect with Outlook.&nbsp; The IDP is not willing or able to assist me.&nbsp; Is there someone in the forum who may help?</p>

<p><span>Outlook is just an application that helps you send emails from the computer without logging on to the webmail every time typing in the username and password. When you first time save the user name
 and password it is saved in outlook but it cannot be changed in outlook.</span></p>
<p><span>It provided access to the emails even when offline for pop account and the features like calendar and address book to save email related data.</span></p>

            Hello WayneHayes1960,
<br />
<br />It looks like you have setup a Connected Account on Outlook.com and it is failing to sync properly as expected.
<br />
<br />If you are on Outlook.com beta, go to: Settings (Gear icon) &gt; View all Outlook settings &gt; Email &gt; Sync email (see screenshot)
<br />
<br />If you are using Outlook Classic, head over to this link directly: <a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/options/connections" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/options/con...</a>
<br />
<br />See: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/remove-a-connected-account-from-outlook-com-0b9a6b95-ff1b-46c1-bf60-d6b3b82c5ac8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/remove...</a>
<br />
<br />Remove the Connected Account and you are good to go.
<br />
<br />Cheers!

            Excel&nbsp;depends on your printer driver. If&nbsp;the printer driver doesn't support legal size, Excel won't show it. You may need to update your printer driver.

            <p>Hi Ken,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only no, but the products you described would actually conflict with MSE and you'd have to choose only one to install at the same time anyway (plus you already have the best choice and if you were to decide to change, except for SCAM products that are
 worthless or dangerous - meaning of the commonly accepted alternatives - those are the last two I would choose and not only because they cost money, but because there are quite a few free ones that are far better and almost as good as MSE).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't travel so this isn't critical for me (and adds time to startup), but if/when I did I would lock the computer with a BIOS password so nobody can use it at all to login or boot to a CD or Flash drive or get in by any reasonable means.&nbsp; It's not 100%
 (what is?) but it will keep out all but the most advanced and sophistcated hackers with special tools - and that means it'll block 99% of anyone who might try other methods if you're away.&nbsp; When booting, the screen briefly flashes the key to enter the boot
 nenu or boot setup or boot configuration (usually F2 or F12 but it can vary).&nbsp; Once there it's a matter of scrolling through the option until you find the part on how to enable and input a BIOS password.&nbsp; Use a strong password but
<strong>do not forget it</strong> because you'll be in trouble if you do as we aren't allowed to help you get past that and as I said it isn't easy even for experts with the right tools.&nbsp; This is really an aside and optional and up to you - but I sure would
 put it back if I travelled with it any more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, there are ways to improve your security.&nbsp; Since my work is more risky than average users, I tend to use more products and scan more frequently than most need - but you can decide which to add and how often to use them.&nbsp; I also have other types
 of security products that work differently that may be worth considering.&nbsp; Everyone should do the part that follows in bold.&nbsp; Everything suggested here is totally free - but like MSE, that doesn't mean they aren't the best for what they do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Here's what I do (and it isn't 100% but nothing is, and in some cases only catches things after they've already gotten into the system, but it's a good process while remaining reasonable and they can all work together - as proven by the fact that I
 use them):</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I use MSE for real-time protection and run scheduled daily quick scans with a scheduled bi-weekly full scan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I update and periodically (every couple of weeks or so) run full scans with Malwarebytes:</span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><span>and SuperAntiSpyware:
</span><a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a><span> and ESET online scanner:</span><a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</span></a><span>
 Get only the free versions. Any that also have paid versions include features like real-time protection that cannot be used along with MSE anyway (in these cases), so there's no point in spending the money anyway.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I use WOT </span><a href="http://www.mywot.com/en/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.mywot.com/en/download</span></a><span> to help identify safe and dangerous web sites.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I use Secunia PSI </span><a href="http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/</span></a><span> to make sure all my programs are updated and current (since updates often
 plug security holes in the software and thus can be important as many people never check and/or update their software unless prompted - and this way I don't need to check everything since notifications and sometimes updates are automatic).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I always follow the following advice from Stephen Boots - MVP:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure that the Windows Firewall is enabled. </span></b><span>No other firewall truly offers better protection or is needed. This one is perfectly fine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure that all important/critical updates, including service packs for the operating system and programs are installed from Microsoft Update (Windows Update).</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure Internet Explorer is at version 8 or 9 and updated with all patches.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-In Internet Explorer 8 or 9, use the SmartScreen Filter.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure that IE Internet Security settings are at least set to medium-high (default).</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Enable the pop-up blocker in IE.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-On Vista and Windows 7 make sure that User Account Control (UAC) ON and not running with elevated privileges.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure that Windows Automatic Updates are set to at least notify, but the preferred setting is to download and install automatically. If you update manually, be sure to update as soon as possible after being notified of available updates.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-<u>Make sure that installed applications, especially Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Flash, and Java are at their latest versions. Many vendors are regularly updating and patching for security holes.</u></span></b><span>Secunia PSI mentioned above can help
 automate this a lot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Never click through links from unknown sources and use caution even if they are from a "trusted" source.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Never open unsolicited email attachments.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Practice safe web browsing. </span></b><span>No adult sites, no peer-to-peer file sharing sites, no sites offering cracks or free software that you know can't be true, lockdown Facebook to only Friends on EVERYTHING, use WOT mentioned above, use
 Task Manager to close all open instances of your browsers if you ever get a suspicious pop-up {as opposed to clicking the red button or Cancel to close it which could be all it takes to infect you as they may have other code than just what those things commonly
 do}, double check all links in browsers and emails by hovering over them or otherwise checking to see if what they say and where they say they are directed match what is really there {many scams say</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.microsoft.com</span></a><span>
 or user @ microsoft.com but turn out to really be </span><a href="http://www.youarehosedbecauseyouclickedthis.ru/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.youarehosedbecauseyouclickedthis.ru</span></a><span> and when you click you find out why that's the name} and I could
 go on but you get the idea.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>-Always use a standard user account unless you have a specific need for an administrator account. Then switch, do the administrative task, and return to the standard account. This greatly limits the access of any type of infection of intrusion into
 your system since administrative access isn’t in place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Kosh</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>P.S. OOPs, I see Steve beat me to the submit button (again - LOL) so you'll see some duplication, but there are differences and I've included some&nbsp;things that make mine longer but I think offer some additional considerations for you and also consider
 it's a laptop.</span></p>

                    I have Office 2010. In WORD, I can save a file to "pdf" format. I recently was informed at a Federal Court that I had to save the form in "pdf-a" format. I have not heard of "pdf-a" format prior to this encounter. Can WORD save the document in "pdf-a"
 format? How is "pdf-a" format different from "pdf" format. WORD 2010 can save a document in a "pdf" format, but there is no selection for "pdf-a" format.

            Yes, you can.&nbsp; When you save as PDF or when you use the Create PDF/XPS Document (via File &gt; Save &amp; Send), some additional choices and an options button will appear in the dialog, near the bottom.&nbsp; Click the options button, and there you will see the choice
 to create an ISO 19005-1 compliant file (PDF-A).<br />

<h2>            Find and Replace Questions</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Firstly any help appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span>I have a word document setup with a table of two columns. First column is headed as Find and the Second is headed as Replace. In each column I have multiple entries.</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to use this file as a find and replace criteria to correct other word documents.
</span></p>
<p><span>If possible via batch processing multiple files at once, if not by batch then individual.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>thanks,</span></p>

            The basic Find &amp; Replace user interface is not really suited for batch processing.  
<br />
<br />This article makes 2 suggestions, record a macro using all of your find / replace (all) words. Then you can replay the macro in subsequent documents. and it also points to a batch tool:
<br />SAVING FIND AND REPLACE OPERATIONS – BATCH REPLACE MULTIPLE FILES
<br /><a href="http://wordribbon.tips.net/T011136_Saving_Find_and_Replace_Operations.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://wordribbon.tips.net/T011136_Saving_Find_...</a> 
<br />
<br />and this tip extends on the macro idea it ends with a link to an example batch macro:
<br />Getting Rid of Hidden Text in Many Files
<br /><a href="http://wordribbon.tips.net/T012463_Getting_Rid_of_Hidden_Text_in_Many_Files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://wordribbon.tips.net/T012463_Getting_Rid_...</a> 
<br />
<br />This is the tool that the article above links to:
<br />HOW TO FIND &amp; REPLACEALL ON A BATCH OF DOCUMENTS IN THE SAME FOLDER
<br /><a href="http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/MacrosVBA/BatchFR.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/MacrosVBA/BatchFR.htm</a>
<br />Article contributed by Ibby 
<br />The following code, if stored in a Global template, will perform a Find &amp; ReplaceAll in all of the documents in a specified folder. The FindReplace dialog is displayed for the first document only. The user sets the parameters in the dialog and presses Replace All and then Close. The user is then asked whether to process all of the files in the specified directory – if Yes, the rest of the files are processed with the settings as entered in the original FindReplace dialog.

<br /><a href="http://www.rlvision.com/genius/about.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.rlvision.com/genius/about.asp</a> 
<br />Replace Genius is a free, versatile automation utility for manipulating text and data files, including Word documents and Excel spreadsheets. Think of it like a Find &amp; Replace command on steroids!
<br /> It is built to process each line according to the rules you set. With ten specialized functions and a rich set of options and filters it will let you quickly process your data to suit your unique needs.
<br />
<br />************************************
<br />
<br />Another, approach is to try to bring  'REGEX" into Word. RegEx (Regular Expressions) is a find/replace tool separate from the built in F&amp;R.  
<br />
<br />USE REGEX ADDON FROM A MACRO
<br />The native Find in Office programs, with or without wildcards, doesn't support disjunction of the kind you're asking about. To put it succinctly, Find is not regex.
<br />However, real regex -- at least, Microsoft's implementation of it -- is possible in a macro by including a reference to the "Microsoft VBScript Regular Expressions" library. Some version of it (I think 5.5 is current) is part of each Windows version.
<br />Here are a couple of articles about it (the use of regex in Excel is the same as its use in Word, but the surrounding code would be different):
<br /><a href="http://dotnetslackers.com/Community/blogs/dsmyth/archive/2006/09/09/Regular-expressions-with-Word.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://dotnetslackers.com/Community/blogs/dsmyt...</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.macrostash.com/2011/10/08/simple-regular-expression-tutorial-for-excel-vba/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.macrostash.com/2011/10/08/simple-reg...</a>
<br />Building on those examples, you could write a macro that lets you enter a regex expression into an InputBox, assigns that expression to regEx.Pattern, and selects or highlights each match.
<br />
<br />VBA REGULAR EXPRESSIONS WITH WORD
<br /><a href="http://dotnetslackers.com/Community/blogs/dsmyth/archive/2006/09/09/Regular-expressions-with-Word.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://dotnetslackers.com/Community/blogs/dsmyt...</a>
<br />Surprisingly Word's search feature doesn't allow regular expression patterns, which is a bit rubbish, but that doesn't stop them being used.
<br />
<br />USING REGEX IN WORD
<br /><a href="http://www.macrostash.com/2011/10/08/simple-regular-expression-tutorial-for-excel-vba/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.macrostash.com/2011/10/08/simple-reg...</a> 
<br />’ll go through a simple tutorial for using regular expressions for VBA.  This is a great quick start guide for people who have used regular expressions before in other languages.  Just as a review, regular expressions are used to match patterns in strings.  This is a powerful tool that can help you data cleanse and data mine.  The directions are the same for Microsoft Access as well.

<p>Hello Orpheus,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried looking this up using a search engine and came up with 2+ million results.&nbsp; From what I can tell from glancing through there,&nbsp;is that it is a computer operating system error, not a Ovi Suite error.&nbsp; Something to do with "mapped drive assignment,"
 but I am not familiar with it.&nbsp; Might be why Nokia support does not have an answer for you.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I do not have one either, however I would say to try looking around in computer help, rather than Ovi Suite help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Hi Orpheus,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try uninstalling all your previous installations related to Nokia like OVi Suite, PC connectivity solutions, Nokia Connectivity cable driver... and then later download and intall the latest version of OVi sute from the following link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ovi.com/suite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ovi.com/suite</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also while installing, keep the downloaded exe file in the same drive to which you will install the OVi Suite to avoid any drive mapping related issues.</p>

    <title>Xiaomi MI4 with Windows 10 Mobile -Dialer BUG- - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carlos l.d.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xiaomi MI4 with Windows 10 Mobile -Dialer BUG-</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>There's a bug in the dialer. When making or recieving a phone call, the screen switches off immediatly (even if the sensor is not near the face). At that point you cannot finish the call or whatever you need to do, becasue there's no way to switch on the
 screen.</p>
<p>You have to wait the caller to finish the call to get control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The proximity sensor is ok because I tested under Android (MIUI 8).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi Carlos,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you performed a soft reset or hard reset if needed? This will quickly reboot your phone, the latter will set your phone to factory settings which erases all apps and files. We suggest performing first a soft reset and let's see if that can rectify the
 issue. To know more about soft reset and hard reset, click <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/wiki/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d">

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thank you for attention.</p>
<p>No method solves the problem (hard or soft reset).</p>
<p>It seems the control of the proximity sensor. In Whatsapp calls ans Skype calls behaves the same.</p>
<p>Any more tip?</p>

<p>Hi. Not working. No case and tried double power button. I don't&nbsp; know how Xiaomi releases a beta without the phone working reasonably.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>from my humble point of view:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- there's is a bug in the firmware that manages de hardware of the sensor control (the same hardware works pretty well under Android) -&gt; XIAOMI?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- the dialer software has no control when the sensor is not controlled. Always relies on it. &nbsp;I'm not a developer professional but it seems not very useful to me that the dialer loses control when a piece of hardware behaves strangely in a Phone (don't forget
 the smartphone is a Phone). -&gt; MICROSOFT</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case I'm disappointed about the low care in the MI4 Windows 10 mobile solution from XIAOMI/MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to report my feedback in an official way. Where do I do it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>I, too, am having this same problem for the first time this morning. Whenever I try to open and save a new document, Word crashes and the new document is not saved in any way. I have tried to do that with both no content in the new document and with new
 content. I have tried saving it to multiple different locations on my hard drive, using numerous different names. This is happening after last night's Windows update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried both File&gt;Save, File&gt;Save as&gt;Browse, and clicking the Save icon. I have both browsed and just tried to save in the default folder. I can open previously existing documents, edit them and resave, just not a new document. No other error occurs.</p>

            After posting the above message, I checked Windows Update and found that not everything had been installed. Doing a manual update and computer restart resolved the problem.

<p>Hi Moja,</p>
<p>Thanks for the fast reply. I checked for updates as the reply below suggested, but the computer is fully updated. I also tried saving it while in safe mode, but it still crashed.</p>
<p>1. I tried both ways, and it crashes both ways.</p>
<p>2. I only tried saving to a local drive.</p>
<p>3. It does seem to occur only in a particular document, but it also occurs when I try to copy-paste the text into a new document and save that.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c52b6d19-6b42-4495-99d6-184e40f58104?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c52b6d19-6b42-4495-99d6-184e40f58104?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>4. There does not seem to be a specific error, rather it first shows the message that it has "stopped working" then it restarts, and when I try to open the document I just saved it shows that message about it having been moved.&nbsp; I have not included a screen
 shot of the product information as it won't let me upload the reply then, it says it is too long. It is "Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016", and it is activated...</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Oliver</p>

<p>Hi Jan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I've tried all the methods in the article you linked, and several from the one that Doug linked... It is the strangest thing, I'm able to save other documents. I am just going to retype it in a new file and hope that works! Copy-pasting to a new document
 renders the new one unable to be saved, so... Thanks for the help, if it starts happening with other documents I'll be back!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>

            Hi sknajmul,<br />
<br />
Where did you download this application? As we have checked this one, it is not compatible with the model of your device.
