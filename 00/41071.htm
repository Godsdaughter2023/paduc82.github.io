<h2>            Live Mail now rec&#39;d in MIME Format&#63;</h2>
                    Since Live Mail update, why am I receiving ALL mail&nbsp;as a&nbsp;"multi-part" message in MIME format? How do I correct this?

            It's the sender that decides the format of the message, and most HTML messages are multi-part. What difference are you seeing after the update?

            <p>That is (part of) the markup of a typical HTML mail message. This would normally be converted for display.</p>
<p>Are we to understand that what you posted above is what you see in the reading pane or message window when you select a message in the message list? If so, please give details of your operating system and your version of Internet Explorer.</p>

            Being I did a System Restore (twice now) it doesn't happen. Once Live mail updates, that's all I get is "MiME"! I even cleared "temp files" previously and it didn't help. I use IE9, 64 bit, Win7 Home,&nbsp;8 gig Ram with 1 Tig Hard Drive.&nbsp;A bit frustrating
 when sending mail and the reply is "What was that" (in MIME format)? If I allow the WL update, mail doesn't convert!

            <p>Sorry, I took your original post to mean that messages you <em>received</em> were being displayed as markup. Now it sounds as if messages you
<em>send</em> are being received by others as markup. Please clarify - is it messages you receive or messages you send or both that display this behaviour?
</p>
<p>In WLMail's main window, press Ctrl-Shift-O for Options. On the <em>Send </em>
tab, click <em>HTML Settings </em>under <em>Mail Sending</em>.&nbsp;In the <em>Encode text&nbsp;</em>dropdown, select
<em>Base 64</em>, then&nbsp;repeat your experiments.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your kind&nbsp;reply. It happens in both sending and receiving. Here's one I just rec'd a few moments ago:</p>

<p>Maybe this helps figuring out why the WLM update messed up everything. </p>

</blockquote>
<p><br />
Yours is the only case of this behaviour that's been reported in these forums, and I haven't seen any similar case anywhere else - ever. That's in six years since this program was first released. If the error goes away if you roll back the update, then it's
 clear that installing the update caused the error. However, it seems to be unique to your machine.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your operating system? (E.g. W7 Pro SP1 64-bit)</li><li>What is your version of&nbsp;Internet Explorer? (E.g. 9.0.8112.16421 update 9.0.6)&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>If you select a message in the message list and press Ctrl-F2, what do you see?</p>
<p>The only cause I can think of is that you have security software (anti-virus, spam filter) that is intercepting and modifying your messages before they reach WLMail or after they leave it, for sent messages. Could this be the case?
</p>
<p>For the example you quoted above, could you please select this message in the message list and press Ctrl-F3. This will reveal the source of the message as received by WLMail. Please mark what you&nbsp;see down to and including the bit you quoted earlier and
 then press Ctrl-C. Then use Ctrl-V to paste into your reply; the forum software will remove any email addresses in there, but you may wish to substitute 'x' for any bits you'd rather keep private. This may show us what's going wrong.</p>

 Pro"?&nbsp;Yet, it didn't occure prior to the WLM update. What I get after your suggestions is the same as I get when going into properties below:</p>

<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Which version of Microsoft Word are you using?
<br />
<br />Please note, if you are using the built in word processor in Windows 10: WordPad or Notepad, you can't use it to save templates.
<br />
<br />You need to use Microsoft Word which is included with Office or Office 365.

                    <p>Hi! </p>
<p>I am getting a&nbsp;Blue screen Error with file FSVID.dll stop code 0x000000EA (0x8A485DAO, 0X89D4A008, 0XBA4EBCBC, 0X00000001) the&nbsp;driver gets stuck in an infinate loop. Is this a malware problem or just currupt versions of the same FSVID.dll any way to fix
 this without a clean install can still run safemode with networking or possibly back up with Linux CD but really would preffer not to have to do any of that!? I have a legitamate version of windows XP Pro,&nbsp;with a Vostro 400 but I still have the original Dell
 recovery CD but not sure if that would help with a driver issue like that? </p>
<p>(also the thought of having to back up almost 500GB on that hard drive to an external drive&nbsp;is daunting)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apologies for any typos as I am writing with a totally messed up screen from safe mode it looks a little like the Matrix.</p>
<p>Any help or information on this subject would totally help, thanks a bunch in advance... hope you have a great week</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            The fsvid.dll is not an XP file, can't find any explanation on the Internet for it (except those places that garan-tee to fix all your DLL problems), could be a Dell file, you can try out those ideas from RoBRoBrr, but if you can get in Safe Mode and on
 the Internet, you can upload your crash dump files to your SkyDrive and somebody can take a look at them - and you can use something like BlueScreenView to look at them yourself.<br />
<br />
Here's how:<br />
<br />
Provide more information about your system and information from the most recent crashes.
<div><br />
<div>Click Start, Run and in the box enter:</div>
<div><br />
<div>msinfo32</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All,&nbsp;Copy and then paste the information back here.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to&nbsp;be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This will minimize back and forth Q&amp;A and eliminate guesswork.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Download BlueScreenView from here:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Unzip and run it (BSV installs nothing) and let it finish scanning all your crash dump files. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you double click on of the dumps, you will get some information about it (including the&nbsp;Caused By Driver field) and you may be able to spot the problem right away - especially if&nbsp;you see a pattern in the dumps where the Caused by Driver field is the
 same (start with that&nbsp;driver).</div>
<div><br />
<div>BlueScreenView tries to locate the right driver or module that caused the blue screen by looking inside the crash stack. However, be aware that the driver detection mechanism is not 100% accurate, and you should also look in the lower pane, that display
 all drivers/modules found in the stack.<br />
<br />
Sometimes BlueScreenView will implicate XP files as the cause of the crash (ntoskrnl.exe, win32k.sys, hal.dll etc.) but they are probably not the real cause of the crash (BSV does the best it can) and you need to look at some other crash dumps or use the Windows
 debugging tools to dig a little deeper into the crash dump to find the real cause.<br />
<br />
You would have to either gather up some more example crashes and look through them, or find some where XP files are not the "cause" or you could upload your crash dump files to your
<a href="http://explore.live.com/skydrive-get-started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SkyDrive</a> and somebody with the Windows debugging tools can help take a look at them in more detail.<br />
<div><br />
<div>Select (highlight) one or more of the most recent dump files by clicking them and holding&nbsp;down the Ctrl key to select multiples files. &nbsp;Try to select just the most recent ones that&nbsp;relate to your issue (maybe five or so dump files to get started).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click File, Save Selected Items and save the information from the dumps to a text file on&nbsp;your desktop called BSOD.txt.
<br />
<br />
Open BSOD.txt with a text editor Notepad, WordPad, etc.), select all the text (Ctrl-A), copy all the text to the Windows clipboard (Ctrl-C) and paste the text from the clipboard (Ctrl-V) back here in your next reply.
<div><br />
<br />
<div>Here is an example of the BSV report from a single BSOD that I initiated on purpose that&nbsp;shows the cause of the crash as the i8042prt.sys driver belonging to Microsoft Corporation:</div>
<div><br />

==================================================
<div><br />
<div>Send the BlueScreenView information from the last 5 memory dumps (if you don't have 5 memory dumps yet, send the most recent ones you have).</div>
<div><br />
<div>While you are waiting, please do this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Perform some scans for malicious software, then fix any remaining issues:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Malwarebytes (MBAM):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</a></div>
<div>SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.superantispyware.com/</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>They can be uninstalled later if desired.</div>
<div><br />
Reboot your computer and troubleshoot remaining issues.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it is easiest to just upload the memory dump files from your most recent crashes to your SkyDrive (everybody has a SkyDrive for sharing file).&nbsp;&nbsp; Then somebody that already has the Windows debugging tools can take a closer look at things and figure
 out what is going on.<br />
<br />
The memory dump files from the recent crashes and BSODs are usually in this folder:<br />
<br />
<br />
The files will be named something like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
You need to upload the most recent ones...&nbsp; maybe 5-10 of the most recent crash dump files ought to be enough if you have that many.&nbsp; If you do not have that many, send what you do have.<br />
<br />
Getting started with SkyDrive:<br />
<a href="http://explore.live.com/skydrive-get-started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://explore.live.com/skydrive-get-started</a><br />
<br />
After you get your files uploaded and are looking at them on your SkyDrive, you need to "share" your folders/files so others can see them.<br />
<br />
Here is a link that tells you how to do that:<br />
<a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-skydrive-change-access-permissions-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://explore.live.com/windows-live-skydrive-change-access-permissions-faq</a><br />
<br />
Then choose the "Get a link" button.&nbsp; When you click that, a window will open that contains the link to your SkyDrive files.<br />
<br />
Copy the contents of the box "Copy this link to share:" by selecting the link contents (it will all become highlighted), press Ctrl-C (copy) and then come back to the forum and in your next message press Ctrl-V to paste the contents of the link back here.<br />
<br />
What you paste back will look something like this link to my SkyDrive:<br />

    <title>hacking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joegonzalezxj  say:</h3>
<h2>            hacking</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am 65 going on 66 middle of next month. I have an IQ of 140 ; undiminished by age, rather amplified in scope and range. I do have some memory problems - short term ; but at my age, you
</p>
<p>have to ail of one thing or the other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was TOTALLY hacked last October, towards the middle of the month - 2014, that is. At the outset.</p>
<p>what baffled me was that hardly any tech I consulted would believe me. Now, I have never been prone</p>
<p>to hallucinations, so it was quite disturbing to have these ' young engineers ' rebut me. But, live and learn, as the saying affirms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some did do some checking ( 10% ), and their findings - access to my system by IP numbers I knew,</p>
<p>and other details, soothed me. But, they all of course, wanted money for the fixing to go on. It was also</p>
<p>my first exposure to the scammers that abound. I had to learn, rather sorely, since, retired, my gross intake places me almost ' below poverty-level ', that ' Microsoft-certified ; implied no type of liaison with MS. The deep-web is a lair of thugs, undisguised,
 brazen and carrying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I said, - what can you call it when you want to navigate to Netflix and ' some-wind ' lands you on the gossip pages of some ' entertainment star-studded journal ?'</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This happened towards a 10 year stint working for Twitter. Working ? Oh, yes - work it was ; up to 14 hours a day, depending on how many Pages ( of mine ) I had to tend to. But receiving some pecuniary return for my many and diverse, rather successful
 ventures ? Not a chance. My classification, if I have to state one, was ' intern without pay.'</p>
<p>By this I mean to say, the net - on the surface - did not present any insurmountable obstacles ; and</p>
<p>I paid a yearly amount to have techs for the ' back-of-the-house ' ( internal ) malware, virus, etc. issues.</p>
<p>But le me make haste to my point. I was hacked by a cam girl, now 25-26 years old I had met at WIKI.MyFreeCams.com. Before my first venture there, I saw that the place was tagged SAFE by both</p>
<p>Norton Symantec and McAfee.</p>
<p>And there I met this cam-girl, 18 at the time by the model name Totyjust ( I happen to know what she says is her real name, if anyone should care ). She looked lost and scared. Yep ; I figure&nbsp;- an 18 year old, already enmeshed in this type of criminal-circus
 ? So, while not declaring myself the spotless lamb, I began to tutor her on the good things of life.</p>
<p>Let me shorten for brevities sake. That was 2009. 2014, near year's end, she ( and a group of fellow miscreants ) hack me. And she's still on board, tho' I've reported her filed complaints with the FBI's</p>
<p>IC3 division ( internet crime ), the FTC - identity theft ; my bank had to put ALL my accounts under</p>
<p>fraud-watch, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Like I say, she's still on board.&nbsp;By now, I have sorted then problem out with techs ( experts, levels 1 and 2 ) ; my bank has physical evidence, I have taken my PC to an equivalent of the GEEK SQUAD, yet - no remedy.</p>
<p>She corrupts and commands any and all browsers alike. She DOES NOT fear the law one tiny bit, she gives every indication of being a sociopath - no remorse, no regret, and devilish falls short of the&nbsp;many traps she daily and nightly sets. In one metaphor
 rather nasty, she's a huge&nbsp;big pimple on the butt, which cures not or goes away.</p>
<p>So, how DID WE CHANGE COMPLETELY 1 SYSTEM OF COMMUNICATIONS, WHICH WAS WORKING RATHER WELL, for this new SYSTEM, which - even if it were capable to transmit telepathy, HAS SUCH HUGE AND IRREPARABLE VULNERABILITIES ?</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I am a poor man, and no shame at all about it - just circumstance ; but since the hacking began, I've spent 5Ks ( non-returnable ) trying to regain my citizen rights to PRIVACY and</p>
<p>many other personal violations.</p>
<p>If you think this problem is chicken-feed, think again.</p>
<p>I remain, grateful to all of you who've followed this tale of pain and woe, and ask - WHAT CAN BE DONE ?</p>
<p>For one thing, I want this girl's name to be known from here to Siberia and plus. I desire she never works on the INTERNET again. This seems to be the only remedy that phases her.</p>
<p>I am open to any and all suggestions,</p>
<p>TX again</p>
<p>J</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, its been some - month and a half ? - that the BIG-GIVE-AWAY began. The big-huge-bargain-basement giving away of W 10 to just about anyone with W 7, W 8, W 8.1, etc. Now, that is a good thing. Or is it ? Let me state it this way. Since the big give-away
 began, all technical help for the Windows system I work with has come to practically a stand-still. I have what I believe is called an Assure ( Azure ? ) contract, thru which I am entitled to numberless resolution cases involving viruses, malwares, etc. Today
 is no different ; I happen to suffer an URGENT matter, yet, calls back to me from Answer Desk - as there is no way to get thru - are about 10 hours in the waiting ; and trying to chat, I was informed I was number 141 in the line.</p>
<p>So, my question is : WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON ? For God's Sake, Mr. Gates, you could have arranged the big-giveaway a little better !</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I signed a contract with MS Answer Desk last November because I have the very serious, **** and thieving presence of a hacker
</p>
<p>in my system. Systems, I should better say, 'cause I've had the original 7 this laptop came with, then 8.1, and then I offered myself for testing 10, and was accepted. In all these instances, my hacker packed a bag and came along. Now today, some 15 days
 before my Assure contract expires - and which I was ready to renew, - I was told by a ' tech supervisor, ' that all my reported alarms a, nd calls for help in the hacker issue, had been judged, by Microsoft as ' bogus.' As if I really had nothing else to do
 but pay for a tech contract, and then take the pains to bother MS techs about a non-existent ' ghost.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>The gall ! The insult !</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have nothing more to say. If you find this worth of discussion, then please by all means, do so. If not, let this note state openly that a poor man was robbed of money, time and expectations by a ridiculous outfit calling itself a corporation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heaven will judge !</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; U guys sure took me for one big, bumpy, scheming, fibbing ride. You know, I totally closed off all relations with Google, Google-Chrome and Google+, and anything Google henceforth for akin behavior. So, just because you happen to understand and use logarithms,
 u done figured u can rule the world, right, BG and all the little poppas ? 50B u might have, but common-sense and knowledge of life and the world, u are totally in lack of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ur wonderful communications systems, driving p the global progress as a bona-fide racing Ferrari burns rubber and goes from 0 to sixty in 3.2 seconds, are - well, apparently, messing up everything. THAT ONE VULNERABILITY, called HACKING sends shivers
 up your spines...and the worse part, is that, any hood - even one who didn't graduate from first-grade, can HACK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; How truly embarrassing. You had already daydreamed yourselves up higher than Einstein.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If it were up to me, I'd disentangle myself from you kinda like...immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Just one question, Lords of the Universe - just how long do ya figure your empire to last ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For you've sold yellow tinsel in place of gold bullion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And now that this all has been said, let me add - u are more cut-throat competitive than at the outset of the 20th century any conglomerate brought-down by anti-monopoly laws.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I know this is anonymous, so - lucky for me ! But as far as you go : don't sell me no more products ! Atrocious is a poor word</p>
<p>to describe your used-car lot methods. Refund me for anything I've paid for, and still have pending to add to ; and FORGET ME</p>
<p>is an order of my predilection I pass-on to you. Advise ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Go sell in Bangla-Desh ! I'm sure you'll find open-mouthed derks to buy your junk.</p>

            <p>Kindly explain the exact issue you're facing so that we'll be able to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly refer the following link for security checklist of Windows 7:</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/security-checklist-for-windows-7</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd suggest you to set the User Access Control setting to Always Notify (the top most option). Further, make sure you are authorizing the right application to make changes to your PC whenever you see any notifications. So once this setting is enabled, without
 your knowledge, no hackers can get into your PC.</p>

            <p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have recently posted at least 2 notes which many, within this community, might see as offensive and totally out-of-place.</p>
<p>I admit this. And in my ' defense ' - if ever one could be mustered - I can only say, " I am a straight-shooter. I tell it like it is. At</p>
<p>least from my perspective, which I work hard to hone each day."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But I also recognize I have anger-management problems, and I sadly try to see life in black and white definite separations, instead of a myriad mix of greys and the pretty palette of rainbows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; From an exclusively Spiritual vision, which surpasses my merely earthly ones - you could say in an imbibed, ferocious Elmer Gantry way, - I can quote an ancient Sage. " No good action is exempt of a quota&nbsp;of evil ; no evil action is exempt of a quota
 of grace." My very conscience assails me after an outburst, and I can find - at those moments - neither Peace or Rest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; However you place it on the weights of Justice, anger hasn't a place to stand. It is an overall evil, though we are all prone to its - somewhat irremediable at times - tempests.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Life IS NOT - either an easy or a done - DEAL. Whether sculptor or gardener, you have to daily chip away or prune, whichever case may attain. When still a babe just entering the woods - at 20, living in Greenwich Village, NYC - a song made the rounds
 which for a while was a best-seller. And the title said it all : " I never promised you a rose-garden."</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I am sorry for offending ; for blowing my top. Many times I criticize today's young people for constantly getting F- in civility. I</p>
<p>was extremely uncouth, and uncivil as you can get.</p>
<p>You cannot sit down at peace talks, with hands brandishing '45s and 9mms. It just does not work.</p>
<p>So, once more, I apologize, though my hacker is still aboard and MICROSOFT has done little or nothing to rid me of the pest.</p>
<p>Let bygones be bygones, I suggest,</p>
<p>and keep amiable communications and relations in first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>J</p>

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have always used Windows ; not acquainted w/ other systems. And even now, I categorize my know-how as ' dummy.' Though Answer Desk at Microsoft never gave credit to my word or requests for help,
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer Desk took my money and ' faked ' that they believed me. I found that quite reproachable. But, as is said "
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have spent 5Ks on techs -not receiving the real help I needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of days ago, I was reading an article on September's issue of ' Wired '. It said that the only security system that had never been breached was TrueCrypt, and the article explained perfectly why. It is still downloadable. But so difficult for
 me to map out, as a dummy, that I uninstalled it the next day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; All I really would would like - along with my W7 - is a couple of safe-browsers, where I am not being inspected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, do u have any suggestions ? I have been on W 8.1 and 10, but the hacker packed her traveling and came along.</p>
<p>Other than just shutting off indefinitely the Internet, what could you suggest, sir,?</p>

<p>Hey rich12788,</p>
<p>Please check the compatibility of the games cited above on Windows 7 Compatibility Center.</p>
<p><strong>Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade</strong></p>
<p>This game, as can be seen from the report below, is not compatible with Windows 7.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=conquer renegade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=conquer%20renegade</strong></a></p>
<p>As for Far Cry, there is no information available with us as in whether the game is compatible with Windows 7.</p>
<p>See this:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Software&amp;p=Far Cry&amp;v=CRYTEK&amp;uid=2&amp;pf=0&amp;pi=0&amp;s=far cry&amp;os=32-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Software&amp;p=Far%20Cry&amp;v=CRYTEK&amp;uid=2&amp;pf=0&amp;pi=0&amp;s=far%20cry&amp;os=32-bit</strong></a></p>
<p><br />
You may think about changing the compatibility settings for this game and test the same.</p>
<p>Here’s where you can get the information on how to achieve this.</p>
<p><strong>Make older programs run in this version of Windows<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</strong></a></p>
<p>However, quake and quake 4 are compatible with Windows 7.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=quake" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=quake</strong></a></p>
<p><br />
Your system configuration meets the system requirement to play these two compatible games. Now here goes my question:</p>
<p>Are the games Quake and Quake 4 installed properly in Windows 7?<br />
If that is the case, what happens when you load the games? Any error message worth noting down?</p>
<p>You may try the trick of running the games as Administrator.<br />
To do so, right-click on the shortcut of the games and select “Run as Administrator”.</p>
<p>Does this help in loading the games?</p>
<p>It could also be the drivers. Do you have the latest graphics card drivers?</p>
<p>Select the appropriate product family and product from the webpage below to get the drivers.<br />
<a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx</strong></a></p>
<p>Alternatively you may visit your system manufacturer’s website to get the required drivers.</p>
<p>Your system manufacturer is the exclusive provider of driver updates.&nbsp; If the required driver update is not available at the laptop manufacturers’ website, it is recommended to contact the manufacturer directly, to see if an updated driver will be made available
 in the future.</p>
<p>Referral link for driver updates:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly<br />

<p>If you still face the same problem with the compatible games, please post back the error message so that we can troubleshoot on the same.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>The option is shown as Previously Windows Installations.</p>
<p>How to Delete and Remove the Windows.old Folder on Vista or Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://www.kodyaz.com/articles/delete-windows-old-removal.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.kodyaz.com/articles/delete-windows-old-removal.aspx</span></a><br />
<br />
===============================================<br />
<br />
If needed :<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Open an <strong>Elevated Command Prompt<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Start - type in Search box -&gt; CMD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top&nbsp;- Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN</p>
<p><br />
How to Open a Elevated Command Prompt in Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/783-elevated-command-prompt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/783-elevated-command-prompt.html</a></p>
<p><br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> The Prompt probably looks like C:\Windows\System32&gt;<br />
<br />
Type this at the prompt and then hit ENTER</p>
<p><br />
CD\</p>
<p><br />
Now the prompt should look like C:\&gt;</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<strong>3:</strong> Type this at the prompt and then hit ENTER<br />
<br />
DIR Windows.old</p>
<p><br />
Should look like C:\&gt;DIR Windows.old&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It should return <br />
<br />
Directory of C:\Windows.old<br />
<br />
and show the contents of Windows.old</p>
<p><br />
That is just to make sure the Windows.old&nbsp; folder is under C: (the C Drive) - if not STOP</p>
<p><strong><br />
<br />
4.</strong>&nbsp;Type this at the prompt and then hit ENTER</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;Attrib -r -a -s -h C:\Windows.old /S /D<br />
<br />
Should look like C:\&gt;Attrib&nbsp;-r -a -s -h C:\Windows.old /S /D<br />
(there are SPACES between&nbsp;Attrib&nbsp;and&nbsp;-r and -a and -s and -h&nbsp;and&nbsp;C:\Windows.old and /S
<br />
and&nbsp;/D). The C:\ is the drive Windows.old is located on.<br />
<br />
It should return you to the prompt C:\&nbsp;&nbsp; if it shows and ERROR&nbsp;then STOP - check the command<br />
and if it was typed correctly you are not in the correct spot. You may need to run the TAKEOWN<br />
command :<br />
<br />
TAKEOWN /f Windows.old /a /r</p>
<p>and repeat&nbsp;Step 4 - were you using an Elevated Command Prompt? Are you logged to an<br />
ADMIN account?<br />
<strong><br />
5.</strong> Type this at the prompt and then hit ENTER<br />
<br />
RD /s&nbsp;Windows.old<br />
<br />
Should look like C:\&gt;RD /s&nbsp;Windows.old <br />
(there are SPACES between RD and /s and Windows.old )<br />
<br />
Will return&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows.old, are your sure Y/N&nbsp;&nbsp; type Y<br />
<br />
(If you get a message that you do not have Ownership Rights then issue this command<br />
and hit ENTER <br />
<br />
TAKEOWN /f Windows.old /a /r</p>
<p>and repeat&nbsp;Step 5 - were you using an Elevated Command Prompt? Are you logged to an<br />
ADMIN account?<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>6:</strong> Type this at the prompt and then hit ENTER<br />
<br />
DIR Windows.old</p>
<p><br />
Should look like C:\&gt;DIR Windows.old&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp; and hit ENTER</p>
<p><br />
It should return <br />
<br />
Directory of C:\<br />
<br />
File Not Found</p>
<p><br />
Which confirms it is gone.<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
7.</strong> Close the COMMAND window<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. </p>

<h2>            Skype Beta&#58; Selective Screen Sharing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Owning a high resolution monitor means I cannot share my full screen with others, as everything looks tiny to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the classic Skype version, you could choose between sharing just a window and the full screen. Window sharing thus allowed me to only show relevant parts of the screen space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in the new beta version I can't seem to find the option to share just a window. Screen sharing defaults to full screen mode. From the corresponding support page there is no hint at window sharing either:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34680/how-do-i-share-my-screen-in-skype-for-windows-10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something or has the feature been removed? In the latter case how do I address my problem?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Since there is no option in Skype for Windows 10 to choose a specific&nbsp;Window to share, the&nbsp;best I could suggest is for you to use the Classic version of Skype Application which is the Skype for Windows Desktop. It can be downloaded from the

<h2>            Windows 8 Error Code&#58; 0xc0000185.</h2>
                    I got home after school and when I turned on my computer it was working fine. Then all of a sudden it said "your pc ran into a problem it couldn't handle" then it reset. After it turned back on it went to a blue screen which said "A required device isn't
 connected or can't be accessed" it also gave me and error code:0xc0000185. &nbsp;I pressed f8 to go to startup options but it brought me to another blue screen that said "the application or operating system couldn't be loaded because a required file is missing
 or contains errors. It pointed out the File: \ Windows\system32\winload.efi. Error code: 0xc000000f. If anyone could help me out I would really appreciate it

            <p>Hello Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This issue with the error message which you are getting might occur due to any recent software or hardware changes on the computer that might have corrupted any system files.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">So, </span></span>I would suggest you to boot your computer in safe mode and then check the status. Safe mode, start Windows in a limited state where only essential programs are started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to the steps provided&nbsp;below to boot your computer in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The trick is to hold the Shift button and mash the F8 key, this will <em>sometimes</em> boot you into the new advanced “recovery mode”,&nbsp; where you can choose to see advanced repair options.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn8.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f03%2f650x274ximage31.png.pagespeed.ic.zHte_Eo_ef.png" height="274" width="650" /></p>
<p>You will need to click on the Troubleshoot option.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn8.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f03%2f511x500ximage32.png.pagespeed.ic.ftK7mUB1cE.png" height="500" width="511" /></p>
<p>Now select Advanced Options.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn8.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f03%2f509x500ximage33.png.pagespeed.ic.Ka8cTrg5bI.png" height="500" width="509" /></p>
<p>Now choose the Windows Startup Settings option, by the looks of things we were never meant to find Safe Mode.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn8.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f03%2f650x381ximage34.png.pagespeed.ic.J3Dk0QcKYa.png" height="381" width="650" /></p>
<p>Finally hit the Restart button.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn8.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f03%2f650x347ximage35.png.pagespeed.ic.r7Sf0hLCRJ.png" height="347" width="650" /></p>
<p>Like magic, when your PC reboots you will be able to boot into Safe Mode from the familiar looking Advanced Boot Options screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn8.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f03%2f624x480ximage38.png.pagespeed.ic.ITlffbJuSl.png" height="480" width="624" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could not boot to Safe mode then you might need an installation media to perform further troubleshooting steps. If you have an installation media you may try to perform System restore to previous date when your computer was working fine by following
 the steps provided below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a) After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>Press any key to boot from CD or DVD</strong>". Press
 any key.<br />
b) Select the correct time and Keyboard type. <br />
c) Click <strong>Repair your computer </strong>in the lower left corner.<br />
d) Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> from Choose an option screen.<br />
e) Click <strong>Advanced options </strong>in Troubleshoot screen.<br />
f) Select <strong>System Restore</strong></span>.<br />
g) Follow the onscreen instructions to restore the computer to an earlier point before the issue occurred.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If “System restore” fails, then try performing an
<strong>Automatic repair</strong> from the advanced boot options and check if it helps.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Money in old Skype account doesn&#39;t transfer to new Skype for Windows 10</h2>
                    Hi. Am unable to find a way to get support from Skype other than through this Community portal. I have both the previous version of Skype and the new version for Windows 10. I have money in the account on the old Skype which does not transfer over, nor
 my contacts or that matter, when I open the new version. Is there a way that all the account information, including the money therein, can be transferred over into the new version of Skype? I do recall having tried to do so some months ago but gave up in frustration
 as nothing actually happened after following the instructions. Any information to assist with this would be kindly accepted. Cheers, Stephen

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/0d540f31-d062-4861-8715-7d0d435001ae" title="SteveWillo">
<p>
</p><p>If you have created your old Skype account under Skype name and the other Skype account was created under your Microsoft account, these two Skype accounts will have two different log ins on Skype. Skype contacts will not be merged unless you logged in at
<strong>login.live.com </strong>using your Skype name and password and from there,&nbsp;it will prompt you to enter your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you forgot the password for your Skype account, you may follow the steps below to recover the account.
</p>
<p><span>To do this:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Go to the <a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Reset password link </a></span><span>page.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Enter the email address you registered when you created your Skype account, and click
<strong>"Continue"</strong>. From there, you'll be able to see the Skype account under your email address. If you have more than one Skype Name, reset the password for each account. Then,
<strong>click on Reset password</strong>. </span></p>
<p>

<h2>            Is the windows 10 upgrade portable on other device&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In your Windows 10 Q&amp;A you've written:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>"Once you’ve upgraded to Windows 10 using the free upgrade offer, you will be able to reinstall, including a clean install, on the same device. You won’t need to purchase Windows 10 or go back to your prior version of Windows and upgrade again.</p>
<p>You’ll also be able to create your own installation media like a USB drive or DVD, and use that to upgrade your device or reinstall after you’ve upgraded."</p>
<p>
</p><p>From this text, I understand that my Windows 8.1 license does not turn in a Windows 10 license. The only thing that happens is that i get a free licensed Windows 10(and end up with 2 licensed windows's). Since from what you've written is "on the same device"
 , i get that the new Windows 10 key is somewhere in the laptop's/computer's BIOS.If you have 2 laptops: Laptop nr.1 with Windows 8.1, and Laptop nr.2 with nothing installed.... After you upgrade Laptop nr.1 to Windows 10, are you allowed to install the Windows
 8.1 on Laptop nr.2 ?</p>
<p>If somehow, you are misfortunate, and Laptop nr.1 that had Windows 10 crashed and burned (and I mean really burned), are you allowed to use that Windows 10 on another PC/laptop?</p>

            Can I reinstall Windows 10 on my computer after upgrading? 
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Yes. Once you’ve upgraded to Windows 10 using the free upgrade offer, you will be able to reinstall, including a clean install, on the same device. You won’t need to purchase Windows 10 or go back to your prior version of Windows and upgrade again.</p>
<p>You’ll also be able to create your own installation media like a USB drive or DVD, and use that to upgrade your device or reinstall after you’ve upgraded.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM licenses </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the end user license agreement:</em></p>
<p>15. UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer use
 the software you upgraded from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>17. TRANSFER TO ANOTHER COMPUTER. a. Software Other than Windows Anytime Upgrade. You may transfer the software and install it on another computer for your use. That computer becomes the licensed computer. You may not do so to share this license between
 computers. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will users who take advantage of the upgrade offer for Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 also be able to obtain recovery media?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft recently noted the following options available:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;<em>With Windows 10, you can create your own recovery media and back up the pristine state of the operating system and preinstalled software. If things go wrong and you are unable to refresh or reset your device successfully, you
 can boot the device using recovery media and reset to the prior pristine state.</em></p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also initiate a clean install by doing the following:</p>
<p>You can do a clean install a couple ways.</p>
<p>Press Windows key + i</p>
<p>Click Update and Security</p>
<p>Click Recovery</p>
<p>Under Remove everything and reinstall Windows, click Get started</p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>At the Sign in screen</p>
<p>Hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power icon on the screen</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Click Troubleshoot</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Click Reset</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I reinstall Windows using the recovery partition? </strong>
</p>
<p>Windows 10 will be reinstalled.</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will I get a product key, can I get a product key?</strong></p>
<p>By default, Windows 10 builds are pre-keyed, meaning, you do not have to enter a product key and should not be prompted to enter one even after Windows 10 has completed setup.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><em>Microsoft tells me that it will be possible to do so. And that a key part of this process is that it will save a product key tied to the previously upgraded PC or device in Windows Store. This is how Windows 10 will later know that the install is allowed:
 It’s “one of the benefits of the new delivery system,” a Microsoft representative told me.</em></p>

</p><p><strong>Will ISO media be provided for the final release? </strong></p>
<p>Yes, you will be able to download ISO media for Windows 10 RTM. </p>
<p><em>Please note, you might have to download the appropriate edition of&nbsp;Windows 10 for the version/edition of Windows you are upgrading. If you upgrade to the wrong edition, ie. Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 10 Pro, you will have to purchase a license

<h2>            USB 3.0 HUB Causes USB Devices and Ports to Malfunction and Blue Screen &#91;Win10&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone, yesterday I bought a TP-LINK UH700 7-port USB port (powered) for my Win10 Home 64-bit laptop which is plug-and-play and had some interesting issues with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly I connected the USB hub to the laptop and started to move some USB devices from laptop to the hub. I connected my gaming mouse and its lights lid for a few seconds (didn't work at that moment) and then the USB hub's indicator light for mouse's USB
 turned off with mouse's lights. It wasn't working. Then I plugged my laptop fan which was using 2 USB-ports and the fan was working but its expansion usbs weren't. Then I disconnected my mouse from the hub and put it back on its old USB port and it didn't
 work with the USB it used to work until a minute before. Then I tried the same with my 2-USB gaming keyboard to the hub, it didn't work too and when I plugged it back on its old USB-port, it wasn't working too. So I tried to restart my computer. Shut down
 doesn't take more than 10 seconds in usual but it took like 4 minutes and then I got a BSOD giving me error: "DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE" and then restarted itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the same things again and all the same including BSOD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then while only the USB-hub was plugged in with no devices connected to it, it didn't cause an error at all. Then tried the same things with disconnecting USB-hub from power outlet and just using the USB-connection. Also tried to use the hub on a clean boot.
 All the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I also realised that the USB-port that I connected the USB-hub wasn't working with other devices too after I try to connect a device to the port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I talked with TP-Link support who said that this kind of a problem has never been encountered before. After that, I tried to use the USB-hub with my father's macbook in which I didn't have a problem at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to disable USB Selective Suspension which also didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made some research on the internet but didn't see anything related to my problem. A USB-hub causing a BSOD is just insane and I am at the point which I can't just do something more at least with my current problem troubleshooting knowledge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I would be glad if you post a fix for this or any ideas that might fix it.</p>

            I fixed it by disconnecting/reconnecting all the cables a few times which was pretty interesting but I couldn't find anything explains it so gave up on finding its reason. I had that issue once again two days ago which was pretty odd after 3 weeks with
 no problems but it fixed with a reset so trying to not care about it.

<h2>            xbox 360 wireless receiver for pc only has a 5 inch range&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    I just bought this xbox 360 wireless receiver for pc and after the&nbsp;ridiculous installation, I found it only has a range of 5 inches! To trouble shoot this problem i turned off all my other 2.4ghz items just to see if there was any&nbsp;terrestrial interference
 but still the range of 5 inches remains. Next i tried different controllers and they still only worked literally right next to the receiver. Is this a common problem with these things and is there a way to fix it?&nbsp;

<br />
1.Do the controllers work correctly at range?</span></p>
<p><span>2.What installation problems are you facing on the computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When you plug in the receiver it should automatically install and start working on Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong>Try fresh or fully charged batteries in the controllers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>If the problem persists,&nbsp;the receiver&nbsp;may be defective since another controller is experiencing the same problem.</span></p>
<p><span>They may try exchanging it at the store or contact Microsoft: </span></p>

            Hi Ha, swapping a HDD for an SSD is no problem, it is a minor change, that will not affect your Windows licence . .. 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

            Hi Ha,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. Unless your change your motherboard, your license entitlements will not change.
<br />
<br />If you had your Windows 10 license activated previously, you got a digital license. You will never need the product key again once you get digital license. Since, you have a digital license, hence when you do clean install, the license information is automatically picked up from Microsoft activation servers. Windows will activate your Windows license from this information.
<br />
<br />Make sure the version installed is same as it was previous. For example, if it was Windows 10 Home, you need to install Windows 10 Home only not Windows 10 Pro. If at any point during installation it asks for the key, choose you will do it later on / skip.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.       
        </p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />First, check the type of license installed on your system.
<br />
<br />1. Open administrative Command Prompt.
<br />
<br />2. Type slmgr /dlv and press Enter key.
<br />
<br />3. Note the Product Key Channel section Windows Script Host box:
<br />
<br />If it mentions OEM &lt;method&gt;, you’ve OEM license installed.
<br />
<br />If it says Retail, you’ve retail license installed.
<br />
<br />If it mentions GVLK, VOLUME_&lt;method&gt; then you’ve volume license installed. Note that GVLK stands for Generic Volume License Key.
<br />
<br />Retail license have the transfer rights, while OEM license is tied to motherboard and can't be transferred to other machine.
<br />
<br />Refer this guide to learn how to transfer your license:
