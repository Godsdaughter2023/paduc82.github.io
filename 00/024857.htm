    <title>Restoring Inactive Mailboxes within Federated Domain - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Restoring Inactive Mailboxes within Federated Domain</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>My company has a policy that the mailbox of all leavers must be retained indefinitely, as such the process for leavers is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mailbox is added to an indefinite in-Place Hold rule within Exchange Online compliance management
</li><li>User account in Active Directory is disabled </li><li>Azure Active Directory sync deletes the Office365 account, mailbox is now inactive
</li></ol>
<p>Today I carried out a test of attempting to restore one of these inactive mailboxes following the steps at&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn894100(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn894100(v=exchg.150).aspx</a></p>
<p>This step failed at the last command where the New-Mailbox cmdlet is used.</p>
<p>The error received was "The parameters passed to the cmdlet represent a managed account, which doesn't match the namespace state, which is federated."</p>
<p>The question is then how do I restore an inactive mailbox on a federated domain?</p>
<p>I expect the answer may involve creating the account on the on-premise Active Directory but this also brings to mind a potential issue. &nbsp;If a new user had a name matching an old user (our naming convention is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***) then will this
 new user end up with the previously inactive mailbox?</p>

<p>Thank you for any assistance you can provide. &nbsp;I realize there is an alternative method to use Shared Mailboxes for Leavers but I expect that is not best practice, plus we have had issues in the past of shared mailboxes staying visible on Global Address
 Lists.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Liam</p>

<p>Hi Liam,</p>
<p>We can’t use New-Mailbox -InactiveMailbox because this is a federated mailbox. We have to identify a process to recover inactive federated mailboxes on litigation Hold. Generally, we can use the following methods. As a tip, the target mailbox should be different
 from inactive mailbox.<br />
1. &nbsp;Validate you can see the SoftDeletedMailbox<br />
Get-Mailbox -SoftDeletedMailbox alias | fl DisplayName,Guid,ArchiveGuid,LegacyExchangeDN<br />
2. &nbsp;Create a new On-Premise AD user and sync to Office 365 – (ex. *** Email address is removed for privacy ***)<br />
3. &nbsp;Assign Exchange Online license for the new user. This will create a new/blank mailbox.<br />
4. &nbsp;Make sure the new mailbox is accessible.<br />
5. &nbsp;Restore old mailbox to newuser’s mailbox.<br />
New-MailboxRestoreRequest -SourceMailbox a1c0cc8b-243d-4575-8258-cd4b805cd20a -TargetMailbox *** Email address is removed for privacy *** –AllowLegacyDNMismatch</p>
<p>I have done some tests, and find if a new user has a name (email address) matching an old user, we cannot get outputs from Get-Mailbox –SoftDeletedMailbox. You understanding is correct. Given the situation, we just specific different target mailbox to work
 around the issue.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Johnny Zhang<br />

    <title>Word 2013 Stopped Printing Black Using An HP Printer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cullywaggoner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2013 Stopped Printing Black Using An HP Printer</h2>
                    <p><span>I have Microsoft Office 2013 Home and Student Edition.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Word has decided today that it no longer will print Black ink from my HP 7520 Multi-function Printer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It did so while I was printing cards it just stopped when I did the next print as I was adjusting the placement of graphics in the document, which is a Membership Card template I want to use.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>At first I thought it was an HP issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The print cartridges had ink, so it was not that.<span>&nbsp; </span>I tinkered with all the printer settings and nothing worked.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then I tried printing the same graphics using Paint and it worked and they turned out the way it should.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then I printed a letter, in Word, just words, no graphics and it would not print in Black.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>So I got on Microsoft Chat, Chris P, Case# 1304973157 and he was useless.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have been in IT and using computers almost as long as Microsoft has been around.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So I do all the basic and most of the advanced things way before I check with Tech Support.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Not that any of that matters because Microsoft Tech Support asks the stupidest questions you can imagine.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I was pressed for time, but Chris P had me take the steps to “repair” Word online.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Needless to say this was just a reinstall and repaired nothing.<span>&nbsp; </span>
When I got back a few hours later I tried again and still no black printing so I tried Microsoft again.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I get Jeramie C from Microsoft next.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To call him an idiot would be a complement, he’s working his way up to idiot.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;He asks</span>&nbsp;a series of really stupid questions like, is the "Black Ink Cartridge in the Printer?" I had enough and cussed Microsoft out, he was doing nothing to
 help.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Jeramie C said it would cost me $99 to $149 to buy the support needed to fix the issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>No, there is no guarantee that they could even fix it, as the other options they suggested failed, but I could buy a whole new Office and Student and start all over again for what Microsoft asks for in support.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>So does anybody in the Microsoft Community have any idea why Word will not print black?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Did&nbsp;I accidently change a setting and not know it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Or is this Microsoft's way of extorting more money out of us?</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Any help is greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thank You.</span></p>

            <p><span>It’s not the Font Color.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I use Automatic all the time, only change it when I need to change a Font color.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Letter I printed as a test was using Automatic and should have printed black, but it printed blue instead.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The initial problem did not involve the Font, it was graphics.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have JPG’s which are the logos for the organization on one side.<span>&nbsp; </span>
The lettering in the JPG is black with a yellow glow outline, they were printed green with a yellow outline.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the reverse side of the card is another JPG of a Pine Rockland photo.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In front of it is Text that uses white with a thin black as a color to make it stand out against a normally darker background.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However since Word is not printing black the picture is washed out green.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I did not change any settings to begin with, it was printing just fine at the start of the day, it stopped printing black while I was continuing to print.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I tinkered with the HP Printer, even changing ALL the Ink Cartridges, even though the ones in the Printer did have ink.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I did later play with the Advanced settings trying a few of them to see if that helped and it did nothing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There has to be a reason why Adobe Reader and Microsoft Paint can print the same graphics just fine, but Microsoft Word refuses to use black ink to print them correctly.<span>&nbsp;
</span>As it is daily I have Word change stuff on me by itself, mostly it resets to Calibri 11 all the time, even when I have Saved my preferences several time.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Most of Word’s quirks I put up with but this one needs to be fixed and Microsoft is unwilling and unable to do that.

            <p>Telling us you have been around since computer chips were carved in flint doesn't help us understand what you have done.&nbsp; If you don't tell us, we just end up suggesting repeated tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, some of my suggestions will be contradictory, but you are well into the twilight zone of trouble shooting.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your description of the problem lead me to the same idea as Doug has.&nbsp; One or more of your colors is not feeding properly. Yes, that is contradicted by being able to print correctly from other applications.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>If you have not already done it, run the self clean process on the printer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried checking with HP to see if this is a known problem?&nbsp; Maybe they have a fix.</p>
<p>
Have you recently upgraded the printer driver?&nbsp; Win 8/8.1 and Office 2013 are not a new combination, so they should be thoroughly debugged by now.
</p><p>
</p><p>You are using the latest drivers, try installing some older drivers from the same or closely related printer families.&nbsp; I found that solved a problem (no duplex printing) I had in Win 8 with an older HP printer.&nbsp; The most current drivers disabled that key
 function, older ones still worked with Win 8 but also restored the function. </p>
<p>
Since you say you can print correctly from other applications, I agree, the problem is likely somewhere in the Office / Word environment.&nbsp; So the next thing to try is working through the following collection of "standard" word/office trouble shooting procedures.&nbsp;
 The key one being starting Word (and later Windows) in Safe mode.
</p><p>
</p><div>
<strong>Trouble Shoot Word</strong>
<div>
<strong>A General Starting point when Word does something unexpected</strong>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>As a general rule, when something seems to be going wrong, or at least not the way you want it to go, in Word “menu’ go to Tools and then Options, in Word “ribbon” go to File then Options, and study all of the various options, both turned on and
 off.</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>You may even get lucky and find some other settings that you want to try that have nothing to do with the current problem.</p>
<p>When I was teaching Word and other Microsoft Office programs at a private business college, I had three rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always check Tools Options</li><li>When in doubt, right-click on something</li><li>If you’re wondering how to set up a special kind of material in a document, consider whether Word tables are suitable. The placement officer of the school came to me several times and asked how I thought she should set something up. Each time the answer
 was, “I’d use a Word table.” By the fifth time she had stopped asking--she got the point.</li></ol>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<div>
<strong>A good, simple quick fix is “Boot your computer”</strong>
<p><span>The simplest fix is shutting down your computer normally and restarting it. Often subtle “corruption” happens to create unusual effects. Shutting down and restarting the computer resets all of the loaded software, often clearing
 up strange problems.</span></p>

<strong>Trouble Shooting Procedures for Word problems that occur when you start or use Word 2010, 2007, 2003, or 2002

part of this procedure is disabling addins. If you want to take a shortcut, check to see if you have a BlueTooth device driver or addin, ie “send to Bluetooth”, installed. Disabling BlueTooth is rapidly moving to the top of my Office trouble shooting process.
 Blue Tooth drivers have been identified as the cause of problems with many different “random” symptoms. If you have BlueTooth, disable it in control panel, device manager and possibly as an addin in Office apps.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It’s not that I think there is anything inherently bad with Blue Tooth. The problem is with the people writing the drivers.</p>
<div>
<strong>Shortcut to Start Word in Safe Mode or Excel in Safe Mode, Hold &lt;CTL&gt; key when clicking on icon or
<span>using the Start menu search window and entering </span>WINWORD.EXE /a<span>&nbsp;
</span>or<span>&nbsp; </span>WINWORD.EXE /safe<span>&nbsp; </span>Don’t Assume ANYTHING!</strong>
<p>Don’t assume some part of the trouble shooting processes listed below doesn’t apply to you. Often there are things going on in the background that you just aren’t aware of. For example, when installing software it is all too easy to have an unwanted
 app installed if you don’t carefully read every screen. </p>
<div>
<strong>Uninstall Recent Software</strong>
<p>At this point, you have also think about any software or plugins that you may have installed on your computer. Annoyingly, this problem with Word can be caused by a program that is completely unrelated to Word!</p>
<p>Did you recently install some new hardware? A printer, scanner, label machine, web cam, tablet, etc? Have you installed any software? If so, uninstall it and see if the problem goes away.<span>&nbsp;

<span>Another thing to consider is the mix of 32 and 64-bit. Many people have found that trying to mix 32 and 64-bit elements in the print stream simply does not work. So, if you are using 64-bit Office, as a final solution you may want to try
 uninstalling and re-installing 32-bit Office.</span></p>

<p>You have an 'advanced' problem. Something that is totally weird. The "normal" fixes that work for 99% of problems won't help you. But you have to get past front line support.&nbsp; Be prepared to waste a lot of time with them.</p>

</p><p>Yes, front line MS Support is manned by "script monkeys".&nbsp; They have very limited tech skills. As you say, their JOB

<strong>REPEATEDLY</strong> asking to be transferred to a supervisor or 2nd level support.&nbsp; Even when you get transferred, the first people who you talk to probably won't be able to help.&nbsp; Work with them for a while and then ask to be transferred again.

            <p><span>While I have not
<em>“been around since computer chips were carved in flint”</em> I have been around since they had “Turbo Buttons” on PC’s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Apparently nobody is really reading what I wrote, the same way the Microsoft Chat Techs were not reading what I was typing either.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So let’s start over.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I was trying to use Word to print Membership Cards for a Non Profit I am on the Board of.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I was printing them 2-Up on 4x6 Index Cards.<span>&nbsp; </span>It involves JPG graphics and Word Text over a JPG picture and was working quite well when I started.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The first ones were not quite right so I was resizing and spacing the text and graphics and printing cards one at a time as I measured and check where the cuts lined up.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then for no reason at all the printing&nbsp;started to go&nbsp;bad, I thought it was the HP Printer, except it showed enough Ink and gave no Error Messages.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The “Set Up” or “Photo” Black Ink Cart was empty, but surely it was not the cause as I had another Black XL Ink Cartridge installed, the&nbsp;"Set Up" Cart has been empty for awhile with no issues before.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I went out to buy a narrow 564 Black Ink Cart, but it is wider than the “Set Up” Cart and would not fit.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Removing the “Set Up” Cart gave Errors and the Printer refused to work, so I slowly went about eliminating all issues and even went so far as to install 4 All New Ink Carts, still it failed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At some point I decided to use Microsoft Paint to print the exact same graphics and see how it turned out, it turned out just fine.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I tried Word again and again it failed to print Black Ink.<span>&nbsp; </span>In all my years I’ve seen a lot of really stupid things happen, but nothing like this.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So one by one I tried all the Advanced Settings in Word for Print.<span>&nbsp;
</span>None of them changed ANYTHING.<span>&nbsp; </span>I hadn’t changed anything before, but Word likes to automatically change things on its own.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I don’t know what Microsoft Engineer thought Calibri 11 is best, but they are stupid and wrong.<span>&nbsp; N</span>o matter how many times I change the Font, even save the changes, Word will change it back.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The ONLY work around I have found is to change the Member names and Membership Level in Word then SAVE it as a PDF and then use Adobe Reader to Print it as that
 actually works.<span>&nbsp; </span>I should NOT have to do this.<span>&nbsp; </span>Microsoft Word SHOULD work the way it was at the beginning of the day, but it won’t.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I should NOT have to pay another $99 to $149 to have Microsoft fix this issue when clearly they CANNOT.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Would I have gotten a refund if they failed to fix it, no not really.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’ve seen Microsoft do some really stupid things lately.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Ever since Gates and Ballmer stepped down Microsoft has been one mistake after another.<span>&nbsp;
</span>My Windows 8.1 “upgrade” wiped out my Bluetooth capability so what used to be an easy Bluetooth transfer between Laptop and Cellphone now requires me to e-mail the pictures to myself and pull them from e-mail on my Laptop.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I complained to Microsoft about Fresh Paint and wish they never removed Paint from Windows, they said Paint was there.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When I said it’s not on the list of programs Windows shows on my Laptop, Microsoft said I had to use Search to find it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Sure enough Windows does not know it is there unless you Search for it, but it is and it works SO MUCH better than that craptastic Fresh Paint.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So here I am stuck with yet another stupid Microsoft problem, this one really stupid and nobody seems to know how to fix it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Yes, I tried all the suggestions so far and nothing worked.<span>&nbsp; </span>
So what other solutions does anybody have?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have never used Word Tables ever and never had issues, I can check, but doubt that is the issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I did an Online Fix that Microsoft said to do, including the Reboot and it failed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>HP does not see any problems and except for Word not printing black there aren’t any.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A Microsoft Script Monkey sitting in a Call Center in India asking me if the Black Ink Cart is installed is only going to **** me off.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I appreciate the help from the Forums as I guess Microsoft can’t be bothered to care.&nbsp; I did ask for a Supervisor, but none came to the phone and I hung up.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I wish I had never upgraded my XP PC with Office 2000 Pro as that thing was all but bullet proof.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Well, that was thorough. Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree with your observation, the problem is in Word.&nbsp; I wouldn't expect any of the "advanced settings" to have the effect you described.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
If I understand correctly, the problem is an JPG image file is not printing correctly, but only when it is printed inside of Word. The only other thing I can think of is that the image file that is causing the problem has become slightly corrupt and can no
 longer be handled correctly by Word.&nbsp; Do you have another copy of the image file you can try. In an older version of the file, maybe a backup or the original source?
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>No new ideas.&nbsp; Is one of the things you tried doing a full re-install of OFFICE?&nbsp; That is using the "fix it" tool to completely wipe Office, then installing it again.</p>

<p>I suspect that's the answer right there. As Doug previously mentioned, some inkjet printers go into "photo mode" when you print anything smaller than Letter size, using a composite black instead of ink from the black ink cartridge. If the mix is not exactly
 right (one color is low), you'll get an off-black. In your case, it sounds like you have a separate black cartridge for photos, and the fact that that was empty may well be relevant. Looking at

            I did do a Reinstall or Repair Online as mention above, it was what the first Microsoft Tech told me to do and it failed.&nbsp; I also printed a different file using the same graphic and it also did not print black, so I don't think the JPG file is corrupt,

            <p><span>I understand fully that it COULD be that the “Set Up / Photo” Black Cart, but here’s the kicker.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1). I’ve printed photos (not 4x6) in the past with no issues<span>&nbsp;
</span>and I assumed the Set Up Cart was not needed as I’m sure it was empty long before the day I started printing the 4x6 cards</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2). Word printed several 4x6 cards perfectly before it just stopped printing black.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Could be that the Set Up Cart did have ink in it and ran out, but I never got a low ink warning and as stated before I assumed that Cart was empty for a while.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3). The page I printed in Paint was Letter size and fed from the Main Tray so the Printer was not in Photo Mode and I also printed 4x6 cards from the Main Tray as
 well as part of the test and still not black printing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4). But here’s the best part.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Logging into the Printer Online and looking at the Ink it shows me the Part#’s for the Replacement Ink Carts, except there is NO Replacement Number for the Set Up one.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Note the Cart came with the Printer and says Set Up on it, but on the Online Printer Window it says that Cart is Photo.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>5). The normal size Black Cart is wider than the Color ones and will not fit.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I did not see a “Photo” Black Cart in the Store, I saw the normal one and the XL one.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I will go back and look for a “Photo” one, but I still don’t think that’s the problem.&nbsp; If I do replace it with a "Photo Black" Cart and Word does work, I'll update this thread.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Just for fun let’s say it is the HP printer going into Photo Mode because I used the Photo Tray and the Photo Black Ink is out.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Why would it only not print black using Word and not Adobe Reader?<span>&nbsp; </span>
I printed the 4x6 cards from the Photo Tray and Adobe Reader prints black ink and the cards look great.<span>&nbsp;
</span>What is Word doing differently than Adobe Reader and why?<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s the real question here.</span></p>

    <title>One drive for business share fails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lee eskriett  say:</h3>
<h2>            One drive for business share fails</h2>
                    <p>We have a client trying to share a one drive for business folder with some users in our domain. When we get the link to the share, clicking on the link gives a 404 error. If I use a mobile to do this, I get a very small file with an extension of .dms but
 the mobile has no idea what to do with it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked the 3rd party to try sharing this with my personal email rather than my domain office365 account and to a gmail address, it works perfectly. I'm able to see and download documents in the folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set up a folder in my one drive for business and shared back the other way with the 3rd party, again this worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue only seems to be use trying to click their links. Any ideas what could be causing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lee.</p>

<p>Hi Lee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>404 usually means that the server could not find what was requested. Was there any changes made to the file/folder such as it being moved to a different location after it was shared?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest asking the third party to re-send the invitation and trying the link on a different network outside of your corporate environment and see if it helps.<br />
</p>
<p>Right now, we would like to narrow down several possibilities:</p>
<p>1. Network environment.</p>
<p>2. Changes on the shared file/folder.</p>
<p>3. Account (and domain) related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would also like to get the detailed steps and actions the third party took to share the folder. A folder can be shared in a variety of ways, including a link that anyone can open, or only specific people can open. If possible, please take some screenshots
 of the steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sheen</p>

<p>Hi Sheen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes this is still an issue and its happening with invites from multiple sources. The folders haven't been changed since they were shared. If I get the share link to my personal gmail account, it works fine on our corporate network. The issue is if it is
 shared to our office365 emails. As we are the recipient and not the sharer of the content, I can't get screenshots of the share process however as multiple senders from different companies give the same result, this suggests there is an issue somewhere. The
 link we get just goes to a 404 page but I've no idea why we cant see this link especially as if I get it to my gmail, it works fine on the same network using the same internet connection and firewalls.</p>

<p>Hi Lee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for that piece of information. As you are getting the 404 error on shares from different companies, we still think it's related to your network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't confirm, but there might be a difference between sharing to a Microsoft account and a work/school account, which is why the former works while the latter gives you the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried a network outside of your company and see if it works while using your corporate account?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also suggest adding Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges to your whitelist and see if it helps:</p>

<h2>            Opening old files in office 2016</h2>
                    I have installed office 365 Home &nbsp;(2016) on two laptops after uninstalling the old versions first. The new office opens all the files in word and excel etc. but as
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">read only</span> in compatibility mode. Therefore I cannot save the files with their original names. How can I overcome this problem. Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

            <p>"Compatibility Mode" simply indicates you have opened a file created in an older version of the application. The file format cannot handle some of the new features in your version of the application, so those features have been "turned off".&nbsp; You can remove
 this flag by using SAVE AS into a new file in the current file format.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>To remove Read only</strong></span>
</p>
<p>Go to File menu &gt; Options command &gt; Trust Center option &gt; Trust Center Settings ... button &gt; File Block Settings option.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>The action taken is controlled by the radio buttons at the bottom. You probably have "open in protected view" turned on.&nbsp; You can leave that and just "uncheck" the file versions in the Open column you most commonly work with, or change the radio button setting.&nbsp;

                    On the start screen of my new Nokia 521 Lumia Windows 8 phone, is the "ME" tile. Click on the ME tile, you are supposed to be able to update your profile picture from fb. To outlook. But it continually gives the message that it can't update at this time.
 Is there a way to fix it? Thank you.

<h2>            Dream League Soccer on windows phone &#40;v8.1&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So... I used to play this game called "Dream League Soccer"... and then I got a windows phone. Yeah...</p>
<p>
</p><p>A quick search in the store showed that it was not available. I wasn't too bugged by this, but recently I searched online about the game. And it turns out that it&nbsp;<strong>is</strong>
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/de-at/store/p/dream-league-soccer/9wzdncrfjlvd?rtc=1&amp;SilentAuth=1&amp;wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Microsoft Store showing dream league soccer is available.">
available for windows phone</a>. I checked the system requirements and it works on Windows Phone 8.1, and the windows store site I checked was for my region (so it should be available here). But, trying to get it on my phone results in the store opening and
 going to the App Details like any other app with the difference that I cannot click "install" (there is no such box to click on).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right under the app icon it says:</p>
<p>"<span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)">(!) This app is not available for your device. Tap here for more info.</span>"</p>
<p>Tapping:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">"<span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)">App not available</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)">This might be because the app isn't available in your country or region, it was removed from the Store by the publisher, or it's exclusive to a different mobile provider.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)">If your phone software is out of date (Settings &gt; Phone Update), it's possible that updating will fix the problem.</span>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, as I said above, I do not think it is my "country or region" and I have the right software requirements (no need to update). So I thought it must have been "removed... by the publisher." Yet from searching online it seems it is still available (or was
 a short while ago). Furthermore, whenever this subject was breached in any other type of forum, the link to the store was given which was said to work and the problem seemed to have been solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it doesn't work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So can someone clear this up for me? Is the app still available? Has it been pulled? Am I doing something incorrectly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, most importantly, can I ever hope on playing it again?</p>
<p><br />

<p>Your phone can only install apps that are available in your region.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; It looks like the app is available for 8, 8.1 and 10&nbsp;phones in Germany, not the US.</p>
<p>If you search online using a PC it is only available for PC in the US.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So, the app has not been pulled, it is still there, just not available for US phones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users change regions on the phone all the time to get Cortana to work for them but they have to keep the phone set to that region for it to continue to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know the outcome if you changed regions, got the app and changed back to US. If you do you are on your own.</p>

<p>That is just asking you which language you want to see the page in, not an error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I said it would be available in Germany, right. Not Austria, not US</p>
<p>You have to use the store on the phone, not links. That is the quickest way to see.</p>

<p>What I meant with "<span>(it gave me the error message as above)</span>" was:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-------</p>
<p>Right under the app icon it says:</p>
<p>"<span>(!) This app is not available for your device. Tap here for more info.</span>"</p>
<p>Tapping:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">"<span>App not available</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This might be because the app isn't available in your country or region, it was removed from the Store by the publisher, or it's exclusive to a different mobile provider.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If your phone software is out of date (Settings &gt; Phone Update), it's possible that updating will fix the problem.</span>"</p>

<h2>            Trying to get rid of Trojan&#58;JS&#47;Flafisi.D threat</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I received a message that my&nbsp; Windows Defender had discovered a threat.&nbsp; I went to Windows Defender and found that the following threat appeared in both the Quarantined Threats and the Allowed Threats.&nbsp; Both said that this threat was severe and needed to
 be removed but there are no instructions for removing.&nbsp; I ran a quick scan and the results said No Threats Discovered.&nbsp; I have also purchased Malwarebytes which also does not detect the Trojan:JS/Flafisi.D threat.&nbsp; I don't know where this came from but there
 seems to be some sort of connection to my Adobe Flash (which I keep getting a message to upgrade/but I have not).&nbsp; thanks for the help in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>This threat wouldn’t normally appear in the <em>Allowed threats</em> list without some kind of user intervention, so I can’t say for sure what’s going on there. But most likely you don’t have any issue, since this threat isn’t being automatically downloaded
 to your hard drive by the fake Adobe Flash Player update page, even though it was previously being detected in the browser cache as soon as the malware page appeared:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dac1a187-0567-4b1d-9ed1-ea313a4619a9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dac1a187-0567-4b1d-9ed1-ea313a4619a9?upload=true" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows Defender’s threat detection scheme for all threats, including Trojan:JS/Flafisi.D, was recently changed in an effort to avoid confusion caused by the repeated detections, and to avoid some of the technical issues with Defender’s detections
 that I pointed out in these threads:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Windows Defender now waits for the download to be initiated by the user before it detects and takes action on the threat, so the detection path has changed to the download destination, but with the source also being clearly identified as a web file:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/330d78f1-9d8b-4083-9290-6af3234ea202?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/330d78f1-9d8b-4083-9290-6af3234ea202?upload=true" /></a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I think this probably will help prevent people from jumping to the conclusion that their PCs are infected when they see these detections, with the downside being that users will no longer have any advance warning that the download is a malware file.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, we need to be clear that although this change in the way that Defender handles threat detections was made in the context of the MSN malvertising issue, it doesn’t in any way represent a resolution for that issue. The malvertising issue will only
 be resolved when the fake Adobe Flash Player update screens; the Tech Support Scam pages; and the rogue ads have all completely disappeared from the MSN portal pages. And things actually have been looking a lot better lately with respect to the MSN malvertising
 issue, so I’m hopeful that were making some headway on all fronts.</span></p>

<p>dear greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks so much for the reply.&nbsp; do I now "clear history" for both the quarantined threats and the allowable threats? and when I go to view tv channels on my comcast online tv it says to "update adobe flash player".&nbsp; I have not done this because I was afraid
 this might initiate the same threat.&nbsp; so I have not been able to view any television channels online, a service which I am paying for.&nbsp; thanks again.</p>

    <title>Cannot start Microsoft Outlook 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> honest abe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot start Microsoft Outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>Following&nbsp;a drive reformat and reinstall of Office 2010, we can no longer open Outlook.&nbsp; All other office applications open and work fine, but trying to open Outlook displays the simple Outlook message "Cannot start Microsoft Outlook."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have searched the online solutions and none resolve the problem.&nbsp; Most solutions refer to the error message "Cannot start Microsoft Outlook. Cannot open the Outlook Window.", which is apparently due to a different problem and is resolved by resetting
 the nav pane or creating a new profile.&nbsp; Several other users have also experienced&nbsp;our&nbsp;exact problem, but, like us,&nbsp;never appear to have received a&nbsp;sure-fire solution.&nbsp; The dilemma is that most the common solutions simply generate the same error message ("Cannot
 start Microsoft Outlook.").&nbsp; Here are some observations:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>The problem occurs even following a fresh re-install of Office 2010.</li><li>In some cases, Outlook 2010 was&nbsp;previously installed successfully&nbsp;on the same machine.</li><li>Trying to start in 'Safe Mode' (Run Outlook.exe / safe) gives the same error message indicated above.</li><li>Trying to&nbsp;reset the navpane (Run Outlook.exe / resetnavpane)&nbsp;gives the same error message indicated above.</li><li>Trying to access the 'Mail' item in the Control Panel (View 32-bit Control Panel Items folder) gives the error message that there are not enough memory resources to run the application.</li><li>Problem occurs both in Windows 7 (64-bit) and Windows Vista (64-bit)</li><li>There is no Outlook folder under Users/ [username]/ AppData/ Roaming/ Microsoft.&nbsp; Perhaps because Outlook 2010 has never successfully started.</li></ol>
<p>In our opinion, it is a travesty that even a fresh reinstall will not fix the problem.&nbsp; If you have a solution, those of us experiencing this frustrating problem would be most appreciative.&nbsp; We have now been unable to resolve this problem after almost a
 year and find it frustrating that Microsoft is not more responsive to such perplexing issues.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<h3> mike 1430  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2016 64 &#40;Home365 on Windows10 Pro&#41; CRASHES randomly in NTDLL.DLL. Fault bucket 120525083559, type 4 Cab Id&#58; 0</h2>
                    <p>This crash occurs totally randomly every five hours or so. This time I was away from keyboard, then Left clicked AND CRASH!</p>
<p>But the TWO errors appeared the same as the my previous crash when I was just typing text. Another time deleting characters from a macro. (And no, I don't have any weird addins)</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI: I spend all my time editing a 1800KB .docm and its macros which is in a Dropbox directory. Recently wrote out as .RTF &nbsp;and back into .docm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I had similar problems with Word 32 on this machine and on my Win 10 64 Home machine, but didn't get crash info back then. These crashes are NOT new and date back to last July insider's version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hunch is that even though File/Options/Save Autorecover is 120 minutes, that "feature" is somehow causing the crashes. Disabling this feature results in MORE FREQUENT crashes!)</p>

<p>Hi Jose</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have taken a screen shot of defender trying to clean up the Trojans. Doesn't look like I can attach the word doc here though.&nbsp; Have added as an image below. Hope you are able to view.</p>
<p>I have also followed your advice relating to 'disc clean up'. Have used it five times; however,the temporary 'internet files' will not clean.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Vlookup by conditional date</h2>
                    <p>Hi community,</p>
<p>I am wanting to use a vlookup formula that is based on greater than or less than a specific date. I have provided a dummy sheet with an ideal correct table. &nbsp;Thank you!</p>
<p>https://1drv.ms/x/s!AmEnasLDulc3gxyayGu6dkVKOeSA</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am thinking it is something along the lines of....</p>
<p>=IF(Table1[date]&lt;1/1/2011,VLOOKUP(Table3[customer],Table1,3,FALSE),VLOOKUP(Table3[customer],Table1[#All],4,FALSE))</p>

<h2>            SNDS Blacklist</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">I have numerous times submitted support tickets to Microsoft via the below link:</p>

<p>
</p><p>In my SNDS account I show various subnets for IPv4 showing up as "<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Blocked due to user complaints or other evidence of spamming</strong>". There is no details provided, no links to click on for any explanations. I have explained
 this to Microsoft support via email response with screenshots and they still respond with canned responses that make no sense. Like robots that cannot comprehend anything, really.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The IPs are all clean across RBLs including SpamHaus. Plus, I'm already signed up with JMRP too. Everything to fulfill their requirements is already and has been done for years.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">They all have: </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">- rDNS, SPF, DKIM, DMARC</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Microsoft support is still not helping and this is affecting business. I demand proper support and resolution to this.

            Hello 
<br />How are you
<br />
<br />I have read some cases like yours from IP blocked, for that reason, most of the comments that have been filled in the support forms, as well as the automated responses, I have also received faster responses and actions through telephone support with Microsoft. , since you speak directly.
<br />For what I recommend you try with the support via phone 1 (800) 642-7676 or support through live chat

<p>It's immaterial if the IPs are clean at SpamHaus, Microsoft maintains its own BlackList of domains and IPs and that information is not available to the public.</p>
<p>Your only option is to change the IPs of your mail servers in the hopes that will get you off the list.</p>

    <title>Win 10 - Start Menu Microsoft Office Icons Not Functioning When - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brettlb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 - Start Menu Microsoft Office Icons Not Functioning When Clicked and Cannot Be Altered</h2>
                    <p>When I open the start menu and type the name of an office program (e.g. word, excel, powerpoint, etc.), clicking the icon it does nothing. Is anyone else having this problem or know of a way to fix this without uninstalling and reinstalling Office 365?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened after uninstalling Office 2016 (from Add or Remove Programs) and installing Microsoft Office 365 for Business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's just annoying that Windows won't allow me to just update the icons by right clicking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a screen cast to let you know what I'm talking about: *****</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can still access office programs via, "My Office" or creating custom shortcut linking to the new programs. It's just faster for me to hit the windows button, type, and hit enter than minimizing what I'm doing, clicking the icon, and being frustrated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No effect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to be that Microsoft 365 doesn't install icons or shortcuts in the start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed a fresh version of 365 on a brand new install of Windows 10 Pro and the icons are simply completely missing. I can only access the programs if I manually make shortcuts or if I open the My Office application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answers to my question are appreciated but useless. Thank you for your time but I'm&nbsp;just gonna work on this alone.&nbsp; Feel free to close the thread. I can't deal with anymore of these basic and baseless answers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It looks like an update has been applied to my version of Windows that fixed this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No offense but none of the responses below were helpful. I'd suggest that if you don't understand an issue, don't respond with some half minded response or "fix-all" that typically doesn't fix anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd close the topic but I'm not seeing an option to do so. I'll be ignoring this thread from here on out.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I went into recovery and tried to do a reset, was away from my computer when this was being done but upon returning later the system was stuck at 64% installed and then kept restarting after the fact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried pressing the F2 key on restart which used to open my recovery function, this isn't even working, neither is installing from a DVD or USB and when it comes up 64% complete it doesn't give you time to hard reset the system to enter advanced settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone give me any advice or pointers on what to try please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at an absolute loss here.</p>

<p>64% continuous reboot, been there a few times with my Surface Pro 3. If you can not get access to the Start button to do the SHIFT+Restart then try the one below</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can access the advanced startup options/safe mode menu by:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depressing the Shift Key while clicking on Restart at the Login Screen (Bottom right corner).</p>
<p><br />
Manually shutting down (forcibly) three times in a row will bring you to the same screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a working Windows 8.1, or 10 machine, see&nbsp; Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Recovery\Create a Recovery Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create a Recovery Drive and use that to boot from in a faulty machine and try accessing the advanced startup options/safe mode then.</p>

<h2>            Is there any way to allow cell text overflowing into next cell even though next cell contains a formula resulting on an empty cell&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a formula in several cells (let's say from A1 to M1), only&nbsp;the formula on A1 gives a non-blank result, the formula in all other cells result on blank sell ("").</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if there is a way to allow cell text on A1 overflowing into B1,&nbsp;C1, D1, etc even though these next-cells' formula results on "", empty cell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            sorry not that I know of. That is more a feature of Word, allowing text to keep flowing.
<br />
<br />You would have to set up formulas to split the data.
<br />
<br />You can set the text to Wrap inside the Cell so you can see all of the text.
<br />
<br />Can you give us an example of what you want to do and a more full description of WHY. Maybe we can come up with something based on your description.

            Hi Rafael,
<br />
<br />Sorry that is not possible in Excel, each cell is treated as independent data
<br />
<br />All you can do is, right click that cell, choose Format cell, then in the text section, set text to wrap and set the cell height to automatic . . .

I am having an issue with placing an order. When I click to buy credits I am redirected to an page where it asks me to update my "billing address". Country is the only thing that is filled.

<h2>            Outook 2011 for Mac &#40;14.2.3&#41; on OSX Mountain Lion 10.8 cannot connect to EWS via WPAD automatic proxy settings.</h2>
                    <p>OSX Mountain Lion 10.8 and 10.8.1 tested</p>
<p>Office 2011 for Mac 14.2.3</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outlook 2011 for Mac cannot connect to Exchange server (EWS) via WPAD Autoproxy Discovery proxy settings. (using basic auth)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If network connection has proxy&nbsp;configured&nbsp;with either...</p>
<p>a) Auto Proxy Discovery&nbsp; (WPAD)</p>
<p>b) Automatic Proxy Configuration&nbsp; (PAC configuration URL)</p>
<p>...Outlook <strong>cannot</strong> connect to Exchange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>n.b. WPAD/PAC configuration works fine with all other clients/browsers etc. Windows, OSX and iOS devices. (DNS 'wpad' based, not DHCP option)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If network connection has proxy configured manually with both options..</p>
<p>a) Web Proxy (HTTP)</p>
<p>b) Secure Web Proxy (HTTPS)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assume this is a problem with the Outlook client? Is there a fix to support WPAD proxy settings on OSX 10.8?</p>

            I am experiencing the exact same issue. &nbsp;I thought it might be a Mountain Lion issue but you are correct that all other apps seem to work fine with Automatic Proxy Configuration enabled. &nbsp;This issue is particularly problematic when using VPN software.
 &nbsp;I truly hope MS resolves this soon or at least provides a work around. &nbsp;And I don't mean manually configuring both options as a workaround as this kills VPN clients.
<div><br />
<div>BTW Lync exhibits the same behaviour.<br />

            <p>I'm not so sure Outlook needs to be corrected in any way. It still looks like an auto discovery issue for Web Services to me and would need to be addressed on the server-side.<br />If you add the settings for the server manually for the account, does it work then?<br />Can you get auto discovery to work in Mail for the same account?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Corentin</p>

            Who said anything about auto-discovery? &nbsp;Fact, prior to Mountain Lion upgrade Outlook and Lync worked when behind a corporate proxy configured through PAC file. &nbsp;After upgrade to ML Outlook nor Lync will connect if auto proxy config is enabled. &nbsp;Even 'Check
 for updates' fails to connect, again fine when not using auto proxy config. &nbsp;

            I've go the same issue. When connected to any network that does not require a proxy - everything works fine. When connected to a proxy via Auto Proxy or Proxy Config (PAC) neither Outlook nor Lync works. I am using Outlook/Lync 14.2.3. Prior to Mountain
 Lion (on Lion 10.7.3) this worked perfectly well.
<div><br />
<div>Did Apple change something to make this stop working? Or did they fix something that has now exposed a Microsoft issue? Either way - this worked and now it does not - one or both of these vendors need to get their act together and fix the issue.</div>

            <p>Well Outlook and Lync didn't change before and after you migrated to Mountain Lion, so it sounds like a potential DNS issue to me.<br />I mentioned Auto-discovery because that's a big culprit when it comes to issues like this one. The second likely suspect is DNS configuration.<br />Are you using the same network settings as before migrating to ML?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Corentin</p>

            Everything has stayed the same. Auto Discovery or Manual config yields the same result. How is this a DNS issue?
<div>The only change was the upgrade to Mountain Lion.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hence - back to my original question: Did Apple break something or did they fix something that has now exposed an existing, previously unknown MS issue?</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you really feel this is DNS and can provide some insight into why you think this and offer up some possible suggestions to test I would be more than willing to do so.<br />

<p>Hi Tith</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;the other problem I wasn't too specific on is I only want to the top heading listed in the TOC on the master doc, so I don't have a huge TOC I only want to see each appendix start page not every section in each appendix.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>That's possible, too :-)</p>
<p>The trick is to delve a bit more deeply into the "Insert Table of Contents" dialog box. If you click on "Options" you'll get a list of styles that Word currently "sees" as valid for building a TOC. By default, these will be the styles Heading 1, Heading
 2 and Heading 3, which I assume you used.</p>
<p>Just delete the numbers in the boxes next to the Heading styles you do <em>not</em> want to include :-)</p>
