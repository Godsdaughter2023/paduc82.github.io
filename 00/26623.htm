<h2>            How do I install Publisher 2010 after installing Office 2010 Home and business&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So I bought Office 2010 Home and Business, but it doesn't have Publisher 2010, and to get it I either had to buy the Office 2010 Professional, or the standalone Publisher 2010.&nbsp; Since I didn't need Access, I chose to save a bundle of money by just buying
 the Publisher 2010.&nbsp; In the past, I have installed other office type programs over more basic versions of office (like office 2003 small business&nbsp;with Access 2003) and never had an issue.</p>
<p>I installed Office 2010, and afterward saw that it showed I had all the programs from Office Professional installed.&nbsp; Curiously, I clicked the Publisher shortcut and found myself in a trial version.&nbsp; I figured the people at Microsoft would be smart enough
 to have a way to just enter the key from my full version of Publisher, but that was not the case.&nbsp; The only key it would accept would be an Office 2010 Professional key.</p>
<p>So I ran the install from the Publisher disc and when it completed successfully, I launched Publisher.&nbsp; I went to the Help screen to make sure it was the full version and it still showed it was a trial!&nbsp; Again, the only options it gives are to enter an Office
 2010 Professional key.</p>
<p>I attempted to get support, but it turns out that to even ask what you have to do special to make Office 2010 and Publisher 2010 work together, I would have to pay even MORE money (something like $250 more).&nbsp; What the heck?!?&nbsp; So I searched for an answer,
 and there was one thread here that had the same question - how do I install Publisher after Office has been installed and NOT end up with a trial version.&nbsp; The asnwer posted was to remove the trial version.&nbsp; So I tried that.</p>
<p>I uninstalled the Publisher trial in the add/remove programs in Windows 7.&nbsp; The icon for Publisher was still there, but most of the files were now gone, and I could not launch Publisher at all.&nbsp; So I went to the win7 version of add/remove programs and uninstalled
 Publisher 2010.</p>
<p>Then I put my disc back in for Publisher 2010 and installed it.&nbsp; I launched it and it is STILL THE TRIAL VERSION!&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, does anyone know (for real this time) what the method is for installing Publisher 2010 and have it actually work.</p>
<p>Forgive me if I am very angry about this, I don't like wasting hours trying to get software working that should work already.&nbsp; There is NOTHING unusual about installing Office 2010 and then installing a different Microsoft program afterwards, so I don't
 understand why this is so difficult.&nbsp; I also don't like when companies want to charge you to get a program to work that you paid for, particularly when it is NOT an unusual situation.&nbsp; This computer is brand new, has Windows 7 Pro cleanly installed on brand
 new hardware, and only has these 2 programs installed.&nbsp; There is NOTHING else other than Microsoft software installed at this point (other than drivers I suppose), so why is this company's own software conflicting with itself?&nbsp; Hopefully I will get a quick
 response here as this computer will be sent offsite once working, and this issue is holding all that up.</p>

<p>Nope that link only shows you how to buy the key if you don't have one, not what to do if you already bought a full version of the standalone software, but I found the answer.&nbsp; When you are at the help screen (the File--&gt;Help, not the help button) where
 you can see if you are activated and all that, there is a link that says something like "how do I remove the trial version".&nbsp; This link leads you to a help screen that tells you how to remove the software using the control panel.&nbsp; DO NOT DO THIS, IT DOESN'T
 WORK.&nbsp; It will only remove the files, and reinstalling the software even from a FULL VERSION will only result in you still having a trial version.</p>
<p><strong>Instead</strong>, if you choose the option for licensing, you are presented with 2 choices, to upgrade to a full version or to remove the trial version.&nbsp; (Oddly enough, clicking the link that is practically directly below this button does NOT do
 the same thing.)&nbsp; This option actually takes the "trial version" status off the&nbsp;full version, and since I had already installed the full version, the next time I launched Publisher, it was a full version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's give it up for the most OBSCURE an MISLEADING solution possible.&nbsp; Perhaps they should have a small meaningless icon in the bottom left of the screen that you have to click while holding ctrl to get to the point where you can make the software you installed
 from a CD using a full version CD key actually be a full version.&nbsp; I think Microsoft has their head so far up their own @$$ they no longer have a clue.</p>
<p>What a waste of time.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            On exiting, I get this message&#58; &#34;Microsoft Word has encountered an error and needs to close . . .&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>This problem occurs usually after I exit Word. The program closes, and *then* I receive the error message. I have tried to delete the data file from REGEDIT (there is no data file). I have tried to deleted the options file from REGEDIT (there is no options
 file). I have uninstalled and reinstalled Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007, and the problem persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, after running Diagnostics, I am sent to a link that is no longer live. That is VERY unhelpful.</p>
<p>Please, there must be a fix for this problem!</p>

            I had the same problem, also on iPAD Air 2, iOS 9.0.2. I deleted the application, and installed it again. It start working. The same happened with Excel. You will have to reconnect the applications with Dropbox, OneDrive, etc. again, and you will loose
 log of recent files, etc.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The report in Admin Center cannot automatically generate and email out to specified recipients. Admin should export the report manually.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Generally, if you want to get the report, the admin’s permission/rights are required. So the guidance should be right. For further customize permission,
 you can only customize admin roles as below capture (Office 365 Admin Center &gt; Users &gt; Active users &gt; Choose a user &gt; Edit Roles):</span></p>

                    <p><em>Original Title:</em> Unblock and recover hotmail email account *VERY URGENT*</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello, </p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been using the account *** Email address is removed for privacy *** for over 15 years and now the account is blocked. &nbsp;All my private and business emails run through there, so it is practically my LIFELINE! :-/</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My Account has been blocked, so I tried to retrieve it, by providing my last passwords, email addresses of persons I last corresponded with, subject lines and names of folders I have created. &nbsp;HOWEVER, I kept getting the message that my identity could
 not be verified- even though I entered information in all the fields and AM 100% SURE that the information is correct. &nbsp;So I filled out another form- and could not be verified. &nbsp;Then it said I could not retry due to multiple unsuccessful tries, I should come
 back in 24hours. &nbsp;This has been going on for three (!) days, and now I am getting an email suggesting I create a new email account. &nbsp;THAT IS NOT AN OPTION FOR ME! &nbsp;I NEED (AND REALLY DESPERATELY NEED) access to the account that I am the owner of. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Please help me.</b>&nbsp; I have all my professional correspondences running through my hotmail account *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. &nbsp;I am so helpless!
<b>&nbsp;Please, please, please unblock my account!</b> &nbsp;Please!!!!!!</div>

            Dear Cherry,
<div><br />
<div>The Escalation Agents are of no help at all. &nbsp;Even though I get a message saying my identity was validated on May 26, I am STILL getting generic answers, telling me to re-enter my information for validation. &nbsp;This is really frustrating! &nbsp;I have been writing
 endless messages for a whole week now!</div>
<div>My alternate email has a typo (it needs a hyphen in between) and my phone number has changed. &nbsp;:( &nbsp;The reset link is set to a wrong email and I am anxiously waiting for someone to help unblock my hotmail account....</div>
<div><br />
<div>Can someone please look into this matter and unblock my account? &nbsp;PLEASE?</div>

<h2>            Error when syncing Samsung Omnia II with Windows 7&#40;64 bit&#41; &#38; Outlook Professional Plus 2007</h2>
                    
<p>Machine: Dell Precision M4400; Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU *** Email address is removed for privacy *** 2.67 GHz</p>
<p>4.0 GB RAM 64-bit Operating system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been attempting to sync either of my smart phones with my laptop and continue to get the following error: "Exchange ActiveSync encountered an error. If this condition persists, please contact your System Admin. Support code: 0x85010014"</p>
<p>I don't understand why it continues to try to sync with Exchange when I simply want it to sync with Outlook. I have uninstalled &amp; reinstalled Office Professional Plus 2007 and also WMDC. Syncing with my phone had worked fine until about a month ago, when
 I uninstalled Office and accidentally loading Office Ultimate 2007. I have since uninstalled Ultimate and replaced with Professional Plus, but still having these issues.</p>
<p>Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pete</p>

<p>The 0x85010014 error&nbsp;is an Outlook error which is usually resolved by uninstalling then reinstalling Outlook.&nbsp; (see this FAQ at Chris DeHerra's website:<a href="http://www.pocketpcfaq.com/faqs/activesync/tshoot-as4x-85010014.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pocketpcfaq.com/faqs/activesync/tshoot-as4x-85010014.htm</a>)</p>
<p>That said, I do not know why it is trying to sync via Exchange although I have seen that question in these forums but I'll be darned if I can find it.&nbsp; I'll continue to look for it and will give you the link if I find it.</p>
<p>I might try deleting the partnership then re-establish to see if that does the trick</p>

            Hi Jack, Thanks for the info, did what you instructed and I have the same error yet. Here is a little more detail. When the sync attempts to go through it's processes I receive an error that states the following: The file "C:\pwidrick\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook\outlook.ost"
 is in use and cannot be accessed. Close any application that is using this file, and then try again. You might need to restart your computer. I have closed Outlook and tried it and then receive an error stating: "Synchronization cannot be started because you
 are not able to log on to the network and access information. Restart your desktop computer ans synchronize again. If the problem persists, contact your network administrator." Same issue, did it and same result upon restart. This is very frustrating as when
 I initially tried to sync, it wiped out all of my contacts, calendar, etc. Thanks, Pete

            I'm not sure what to offer on that Pete.&nbsp; I might consider trying a new profile to see if it works (but that is just me stabbing in the dark to find a&nbsp;potential solutions).&nbsp; There is a fellow who is often on the forums (Brian Tillman) who is an Outlook
 MVP.&nbsp; He is&nbsp;incredibly knowledgeable on Outlook.&nbsp; I'll send him a note to see if he can offer anything.

            <p>Hi JA&nbsp;- Thank you for participating in our preview builds for W10.&nbsp; Can you please confirm your build number you're on?&nbsp;&nbsp;What's the make and model of your wireless network adaptor (I'm assuming you're not wired in)?&nbsp; Curious, if you do have an Ethernet network
 port are you able to test to see if you're still having connectivity issues?</p>

<h2>            internal email marked as a spoof - Rule in EOP</h2>
                    
<p>in conjunction with o365 eop phone support, i developed an anti-spoof rule in eop &nbsp;that basically if an email has my domain.com and is sent from the outside is send to quarantine for review, there is couple internal smtp relay exception and salesforce.</p>

<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d2d8929e-80c6-4a14-bcef-a788039188a5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d2d8929e-80c6-4a14-bcef-a788039188a5" /></a></p>

<p>but some emails are matching the rule and i am not sure why? when i review the header looks like the email went out to protection.gbl and come back</p>
<p>any idea why? this example was sent by internal user to a dynamic distribution list</p>

<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/52d61ca7-1bbf-4630-9e48-e7014b94d036" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/52d61ca7-1bbf-4630-9e48-e7014b94d036" /></a></p>

<p>Hi Tanus,</p>
<p>To better understand your scenario, I’d like to confirm the following points:<br />
1.&nbsp;Please let us know why the transport rule is for external sender but the example is about an internal sender.<br />
2.&nbsp;About the subject “internal email marked as a spoof - Rule in EOP”, is this internal message marked as spam?<br />
3.&nbsp;Please provide the full message header.</p>

<p>1.- that is exactly why I posted the question. The email showed did match the rule. As a past of the rule the message is reported to me, so we can review false positives or some relays or approved partners emails that might be caught in rule.</p>
<p>2.- this internal email, match the rule and it was moved to the quarantine as a part of the rule actions. Not marked as a spam</p>
<p>3. I sent you the headers already via private message</p>

<p>hi tanus,</p>
<p>thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>based on my understanding, the issue is that this internal email has been to the quarantine, which should be directly delivered to the recipient. and the issue may be related to this transport rule. if anything is misunderstood, please correct me.</p>
<p>to narrow down the issue, could you provide the information as below?<br />
1.&nbsp;what is the condition “sender’s domain is ”? please provide the screenshot of detailed transport rule.<br />
2.&nbsp;do you have other transport rules? if so, please temporary stop other rules and then sent the same email, will it still go to quarantine?<br />
3.&nbsp;if it still goes to quarantine, to check which part trigger it, please provide the message trace result of this message.</p>

    <title>ADFS Logging in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nxg33k  say:</h3>
<h2>            ADFS Logging in</h2>
                    <p>I have stood up ADFS v3 on 2012R2 with O365. I have some users that are unable to login to websites with their domain credentials. All tests pass on&nbsp;testconnectivity.microsoft.com, and all users are in the same OU. My account I can login both internally
 and externally on multiple devices without issue, however a handful, that I know of, just get stuck in a loop. When going to portal.office.com they are redirected to my external ADFS server and prompted for credentials, however the users with issues never
 get past this. If the attempt is with an incorrect password is made it prompts invalid username/password, but a with correct password the login page simply reloads. I have had them test with their credentials on&nbsp;testconnectivity.microsoft.com and everything
 passes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am stuck on steps to try and open to any suggestions. I simply cannot seem to find commonality between the users having issues.</p>

<p>Hi NxG33k,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What are the differences between the affected users and the others?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Which clients are used to login, Outlook desktop or OWA? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. I understand that these users have issues in external network, what’s the result when they login internally?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. About these affected users, were they created on-premise and then synced to online or created online but afterwards were matched with local AD objects?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thanks,</span></p>

<p>The main difference for most of them is they are VPN users, wither it be Site-to-Site or mobile client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All users use Desktop applications and can login without issue. Email through Outlook, Skype chats, and docs function properly. Only when trying to access web applications does the issue arise. Some find the search feature our Outlook.com more responsive
 when searching archive due to caching on their desktop application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Logging in internally has the same result for the users that are having this issue. In relation to your first question, I have one user that is internal and not VPN of any kind that is experiencing the issue. All users are in the same OU. She first noticed
 the issue when trying to access Outlook.com on her phone, which was external at the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The users were created in both locations and then matched afterwards. I came to this job and there was multiple passwords, and over the course of the past year and a half have been combining these usernames and passwords. First with connecting our VPN to
 AD, and then with connecting AD to O365 with just a password sync. I have recently made the change to ADFS due to publishing RemoteApps and having activation issues. The ADFS has resolved the activation issues for O365 but has created this new issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neil</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit, something else I want to add, most of the users have had a username change at some point. The users on the Site-to-Site were an acquired company, and came across with a different UPN, poor planning. Other users had a name change, married. I have 2
 that I am not aware of a name or UPN change that are having the issue.</p>

<p>I responded in PM as requested to protect privacy, but here is the response with generic info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our domain is company.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the Outlook Web App, essentially anything that would redirect to login.microsoftonline.com that would then redirect to our ADFS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the users when we added them to our business, a new UPN was stood up newcompany.com. We brought that into our O365 to continue to receive their email during the transition. I have since, prior to ADFS but after password sync, changed everyone
 to company.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everyone now uses 1 UPN, company.com.</p>

<p>Hi NcG33k,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authentication methods of all these domains are <strong>Managed</strong>. However, at least one of them should be
<strong>Federated</strong> if you have AD FS deployed in your organization. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you please share with us your detailed steps about how you deployed your AD FS?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, there’s an article regarding AD FS that could be helpful to you: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/3061192/step-by-step-video-set-up-adfs-for-office-365-for-single-sign-on" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    Maybe you don't, already, know this...
<p><br />
One can use Direction keys to scroll the Start menu items, listings.&nbsp; Just open Start menu and begin tapping the Direction keys... can go up, down &amp; sideways AND works on BOTH the contextual Left side AND the Live Tiles Right side.&nbsp;Makes moving around the Start
 menu, looking for &amp; finding things there a cinch.&nbsp; Try it, works really well, might like it better than mousing.</p>

            Yeah, adding the Ctrl key with the arrow keys does some interesting stuff too--all way too slow--my old WebTV box worked like this--only way to highlight the hyperlinks without a mouse.&nbsp; Reminds me of my "smart" TV that also doesn't have a mouse.

            This message is not exactly bogus, but it is misleading. Here's the usual solution. Go to Format | Columns and click on the preset picture for One (even if you already have 1 selected as the number of columns). This will check the "Equal column width"
 box in the dialog, which allows Word to set the width of the column to the width of the margins, allowing you to change the margins. Repeat for all affected sections.

<h2>            OneDrive Share a Document</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We are using OneDrive for business we have E3.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm trying to share a document from a user in the office to a user on the Ipad or Iphone and am<br />
having some issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; First on the Ipad in OneDrive I still don't see the -Shared With Me Folder-.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I decided to test having the user hitting oneDrive<br />
on their computer not signed into Office online : share the document.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were able to share the document and send a link for me to click on.
<br />
On the Ipad I cannot click the link it's not in the correct LINK format to just click and go to the document - same thing on the Iphone.&nbsp;&nbsp; I then went to my<br />
desktop and could click the link fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Please let me know if I should be doing something different.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

the <strong>shared with me</strong> folder is located in their own tab, which is the

<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=af98e668-128e-4f0d-ba81-7d08f7ad1663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3daf98e668-128e-4f0d-ba81-7d08f7ad1663" /></a><br />
<br />
i would also like to remind you that this only applies to files shared within onedrive for business. files that are shared via a site library can be found in the
<strong>sites</strong> tab beside the <strong>shared</strong> tab.<br />
<br />
i was also able to open a shared link via iphone, although in safari, the edit function seems to not be working.<br />
<br />
would you please try using another browser (preferably chrome) and try opening the link? additionally, can you specify how the link format is incorrect? what is the behavior when opening the link via an ios device?<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

<p>Hi Sheen,</p>
<p>On the Ipad I have downloaded the OneDrive for business app and when I open the App I do not have the Shared with Me folder. &nbsp; I have the shared with everyone but not the Shared with Me. &nbsp; When I am on my computer I can see the Shared with ME folder.</p>
<p>Also, &nbsp;while in the in the OneDrive for business App on my ipad I clicked on the document then hit the little man in the lower left corner to share the document &nbsp; I chose the person and sent it an email. &nbsp; The email did not have an attachment and the document
 was not in their Shared with me folder. &nbsp; </p>
<p>On the computer signed into Office365.com when you go to your OneDrive for Business there is a folder that is Shared with ME. On the Ipad - Iphone and the OneDrive for business on the Computer the folder is not there.</p>
<p>When I am on OneDrive for business app on the Ipad and I click to open a document and the document opens and I click on the Pencil/Paper on the bottom in the middle right it takes me to the document &nbsp;and if I use the little Man in the top right of the document
 to share - I use the persons email address and the user receives the email on their computer and receives the link to the document and has to sign into office 365 online then it takes them to the document. &nbsp;Once they have opened that Document on the computer
 it does then show in their shared with me folder. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I think part of the issue is that the Shared with me folder is not accessible on the Ipad or the Iphone OneDrive App. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I did download Google Chrome on my ipad and I still do not have the Shared with Me folder. &nbsp; &nbsp;Is this something that is not available on Mobile? &nbsp;I had asked the question before and was told it was not. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>At least I have figured out how they can open the document on their devices just not sure how they are going to save them to see them at a different time. &nbsp;And the one Drive App does not help with File Sharing from the Iphone or Ipad. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>Karen </p>

<p>actually shared with me section is just a view that shows the documents or folders that other users have shared with you in the web. for the onedrive app (https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/microsoft-onedrive-cloud-storage/id477537958?mt=8), “shared” section
 is same as “shared with me” as you can see the two below screenshots:<br />

<p>also i have done tests via the two ways as you have mentioned:<br />

<p>after inviting the people, the file will be displayed in the user’s “shared” section for iphone or ipad and “shared with me” section for web. so, to investigate to your situation, could you help us clarify the following information?<br />
1. does this issue occur to all the users in the iphone or ipad?<br />
2. can you see the same view for “shared” and “shared with me” section?<br />
3. about the abnormal page, could you capture a full screenshot for our troubleshooting?<br />
4. could you let us know the version of the onedrive app you installed? we are now using onedrive app in the apple store instead of onedrive for business app, with the onedrive app, we can login to it with both the personal and office 365 account. if you have
 installed the onedrive app and it's&nbsp;not the latest version, please update it to see if this issue persists.</p>
<p>meanwhile, as the files or folders that someone has shared with you are actually physically stored in the original user’s library, “shared” or “shared with me” is just a view of the shared files list, if users wants to see them at a different time, they
 can consider opening the files with their office 365 account and downloading them.

<p>Kerwin,</p>
<p>I have taken a screen shot of my folders on the Ipad using the OneDrive App. &nbsp;I would prefer to send that in a private message. &nbsp;Could you send me the instructions. &nbsp; &nbsp;I can tell you that I DO NOT have a Shared or Shared with me folder on in My ONEDRIVE
 APP on the Ipad. &nbsp;It shows my folders but not that one. &nbsp; I am not using Safari or Chrome &nbsp;just going to the APP store and downloaded ONEDRIVE.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Karen,</p>
<p>To better clarify the situation, could you let us know the following information?<br />
1. Is your iOS system the latest?<br />
2. How about adding a different Office 365 account in this IPad?<br />
3. Does this issue occur to other mobile devices?</p>
<p>To collect the screenshot, I have created a workspace for you. You can access the private message and upload it to the workspace via the link below:<br />

<p>hi karen,<br />
<br />
based on the screenshot you sent us, we can confirm that you are using the old <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/onedrive-for-business-replaced/id655772279?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
onedrive for business</a> app. you are correct that this would make a difference. we are no longer updating the onedrive for business app; instead, we are focusing on adding new features to the
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/microsoft-onedrive-cloud-storage/id477537958?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
onedrive</a> app, which supports both your personal and work account.<br />
<br />
regarding your concern of your personal and business files in the same space, i would like to explain that even though both accounts exist in the same app, files are separated per account. you are able to choose between your personal account and work account,
 switching between both accounts will switch the files available on each account.<br />
<br />
please refer to the pictures below:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;you are able to switch between the two accounts in one app.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=55499baa-5b09-4a6b-b16e-8d79577f785f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d55499baa-5b09-4a6b-b16e-8d79577f785f" /></a><br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;files on your personal and work account will be separate.<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;personal files will show up in the <strong>files</strong> tab if you choose your personal account in the account switcher menu.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=a5face41-5559-41d0-a661-89a081172f69" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3da5face41-5559-41d0-a661-89a081172f69" /></a><br />

    <title>Converting Word to Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jane_p  say:</h3>
<h2>            Converting Word to Excel</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Word document with tables which I want to convert to Excel. I wasn't sure how to even start to convert so I decided to copy and paste the cells in the Word table to the cells in Excel.</p>
<p>What I find is happening is that if there are 2 or more lines in the Word cell when I try to copy multiple cells those lines are pasting on the next row down in Excel. I can get around this by copying the document cell by cell and pasting the content directly
 in the cell bar instead of the cell itself.</p>
<p>Is there any way to copy more than one cell from a Word table and paste it so that&nbsp; the 'enter' command in Word is translated to Alt Enter (new line) in Excel? Or is there any other way to do this?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Problem with Outlook connector</h2>
                    Outlook Connector in Office 2010 (32-bit) is not sending/receiving correctly with my Outlook.com account (our own domain). The problem is only occurring for one user. Webmail works fine, as does POP3 - however, there are subfolders to the inbox, so POP3
 is not a viable solution.<br />
<br />
I repaired Office and even created a new profile. I even set the account up on a completely different workstation (also Win7 64, Office 2010 32-bit with latest Outlook connector) and ran into the same issues. I have also disabled anti-virus to make sure it
 was not causing a problem. Here is a sampling of the logs:<br />

            <p>Hi Jannie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description you are facing issues with Outlook connector account . Let me assist you with the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the issue occurs on multiple computers, It seems like the issue<span><font>&nbsp;
</font></span>might be with the email account itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Create a test Hotmail account for that user and configure the same in Outlook and check if the issue persists</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the result.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Jennie,</p>
<p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the other accounts are working fine in Outlook, the issue seems to be specific to that particular account. Hence you have to contact the service provider for further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Powerpoint 2011 Add-Ins</h2>
                    Hello! I have Office for Mac 2011. Trying to add an add-in for an interactive response system (Tools&gt;Add-ins&gt;Add New....nothing). I do not see anything in the box (I should see a .ppa file but I see nothing). What am I doing wrong or how do i find it or
 create it?

            Since you make no mention of having done so I have to ask: Have you placed the file in the:<br />
<br />
<b>HD:Applications:Microsoft Office 2011:Office:Add-Ins</b> folder?<br />
<br />
That's the preferred location, which is defaulted to by the dialog you're using. If the file is stored elsewhere, either move it to that folder or use the dialog to navigate to wherever you have it stored.<br />

            Can you get into the VBA editor? &nbsp;Tools | Macro etc.
<div><br />
<div>If not, it might be that VBA wasn't installed (Jim? &nbsp;Is it optional as it is now in the Windows versions?)</div>

            I believe it is optional but can be added later using&nbsp; custom install.<br />
<br />
Is it also possible that the add-in was explicitly written for the PC version in some way that prevents it from being recognized?<br />

<div><br />
<div>Possibly, but I don't think that'd be the cause (or the symptom). &nbsp;Alex mentions that the Add New button is grayed out. &nbsp;PPT wouldn't know that there was a problem with a "prospective" add-in until after you click Add New and browse to the add-in file.
 &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hmm. &nbsp;Under Windows, I'm pretty sure that policy settings can prevent a user from installing add-ins. &nbsp;Is there anything Macquivalent?</div>

            Well, about <i>that</i>... There is no "<b>Add New</b>" button :-) but I was hoping I wouldn't have to point that out :-)<br />
<br />
When you go to <b>Tools&gt; Templates &amp; Add-Ins</b> it brings up an <b>Add-Ins</b> dialog where there is an
<b>Add...</b> button. That button takes you directly to the <b>Choose an Add-In </b>
dialog which is basically an <b>Open</b> dialog with no buttons other than <i>Open</i> &amp;
<i>Cancel</i>... but it opens directly to the ~Office:Add-Ins folder by default.<br />
<br />
My thought was that if the file wasn't recognized as usable it would render as dimmed because that folder is 'trained' to recognize only usable Add-In files. Even Excel .xlam, .app files, etc. stored there will be dimmed when PPT accesses the same folder &amp;
 there is no option to specify other file types.<br />
<br />
PS: The OP's reference to "<i>an interactive response system</i>" was one of the clues that caused me to think along this line as a possibility.<br />

<div>OK, granted. &nbsp;It just says "Add". &nbsp;But ...<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt; When you go to&nbsp;<b>Tools&gt; Templates &amp; Add-Ins</b>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;.... you know you're not in Kansas any more. &nbsp;You're thinking of Word, Toto. &nbsp;;-) &nbsp;In PowerPoint, it's Tools | Add-Ins. &nbsp;But the behavior from there is as you describe it.</div>

<div>&gt;&gt; My thought was that if the file wasn't recognized as usable it would render as dimmed because that folder is 'trained' to recognize only usable Add-In files. Even Excel .xlam, .app files, etc. stored there will be dimmed when PPT accesses the same folder
 &amp; there is no option to specify other file types.<br />
<br />
Yep. &nbsp;You'd need to navigate to wherever the PPA/PPAM files are stored (but notice that OP also mentions "I should see a PPA file ...". &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Alex, have you tried clicking Add and then browsing to where you're certain your PPA file is installed?</div>

Yeah, you're right, of course... but now I get to stick it to you -- Turnabout is fair play :-)<br />
<br />
He's already gotten to the point where he can <i>see</i> the file listed in the Choose an Add-In dialog but it's shown in gray &amp; can't be selected... That's what got me to thinking it might be constructed in such a way as to prevent Mac PPT from recognizing
 it as a valid add-in.<br />

<div>File or no file? &nbsp;Sounds like no visible file to me. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>But in any case, I don't *think* PPT peers inside the file to determine whether it's valid. &nbsp;I think it shows the user the file types it's willing to accept; if the user picks one that has urp-making content, that becomes apparent later. &nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Nokia 3110C Messages deleting Problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I have been using Nokia 3110 Classic for about 2 months and I am facing a weird kind of problem.....<br />
<br />
Whenever I delete messages from my Inbox or any other folder, they delete very slowly, it takes a long time to delete about 10 seconds for 10 messages....<br />
<br />
I have also updated the software of phone but the problem still remains... Usually my inbox contains about 400 to 500 messages and it takes a very very very long time to delete....<br />
<br />
Please Help ME...........</p>

            Ahan.....!!!! I have done it also infact phone memory is almost empty but still the problem continues. My friend also has the same phone and whenever he deletes the messages they got delete in the blink of an eye it takes just about hardly 10 seconds to
 delete 200 or 300 messages, pretty fast...... isn't it? So why it is so slow on my phone???

<h2>            What happened to my emails&#63;</h2>
                    Hi - I had a Hotmail account for years...almost two decades.&nbsp; I have not logged in to my account in a while.&nbsp; When I logged in this evening I was taken to Outlook and there were none of my previous emails.&nbsp; Where did they all go??&nbsp; How do I get them back?&nbsp;
 Thanks!

<p><strong>3. </strong>You are using an e-mail client or a third party spam filtering software to access your account.<br />
This often happens when using the Pop3 protocol to retrieve your mail and the option “Always leave a copy of the message on the server” is not selected.</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong><strong>The account was marked as “Inactive."</strong> Accounts become inactive if you don’t sign in via web browser at least once a year.</p>

<p>
</p><p>When I tried to change my account user photo I got a message saying that an Admin had turned off the feature but I still got the account picture to change but persons who I email even for the first time still see the old picture.</p>

<p>Hi Alexandros,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Changing the picture on your Outlook profile might need permission especially if your account is connected to a domain or an Exchange server. We'd like to know if you're using a POP3, IMAP, or Exchange server. Are you subscribed to Office 365 for Business?
 Also, what version of Outlook are you using? You can check this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-version-of-Outlook-do-I-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> to know
 the version of your Outlook. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using microsoft exchange for my current mobile device, I am not sure what mail server I am using for my laptop but it is the default app windows 10. Also my past devices may have &nbsp;Pop3 or IMAP but they &nbsp;have been inactive for a while. Except for my
 kindle which also uses an exchange server. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My email is connected to microsoft office &nbsp;but not a 365 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As &nbsp;for versions of Outlook I am using outlook.com on the browser.</p>
