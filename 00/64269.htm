<h2>            Can&#39;t update, reset, or reinstall</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a really strange problem. I can't seem to update, reset, or even reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't update: When trying to update, it stays on "checking for updates" forever. Left it overnight even.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't reset: When trying to reset, it gets stuck on "getting things ready" at 100%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't update fresh: Firstly, I couldn't create an install USB (using the Windows Media Creation Tool) on this machine because it got stuck on the updates part. I had to create it from another machine. Secondly, when booting into this install USB, it couldn't
 see the install disk. I don't understand that because it can see the disk in the current version of Windows 10. It asked me to point it to the storage drivers</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had manually upgraded to Creators' Edition. I'm using a Dell XPS 15 9550, so don't think there should be driver problems with the storage device. I was reading somewhere that windows update service can have problems, but it appears to be running fine from
 the Services app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be nice. I want to fresh install Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>With help from Dell, they directed me to the XPS 15 BIOS, where I changed the hard-drive setting from "Raid On" to "AHCI". Why RAID was on for a single drive, I don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I got it installed. It appears to be stuck with BSOD issues, though. Working on it.</p>

<p>My original question was solved, as I described above. The hard drive was set up in a Raid configuration, and changing it to AHCI enabled the bootable USB to see the hard drive. Installation was easy after that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The BSOD errors are another story. Still happening. I think it's a hardware problem. Working with the manufacturer, since it is still on warranty.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Upgrading to a Family Account</h2>
                    
<p>I've been a Gold subscriber since 2004 and my Wife has had her own gold account for the last 2 or 3 years.... with the Family Gold plan I figured it would be great if we could sign up for that instead and then have a couple of extra gold accounts that our
 friends can use when they visit.</p>
<p>My question is this... if I sign up as the primary account, what happens to the remaining subscription time on my Wife's account?</p>
<p>I had assumed that I could simply identify both accounts and since I've already paid for $120 worth of Gold subscription it would just average the remaining time and I'd pay the $99 re-up a when time ran out.</p>
<p>Going through the process on Xbox.com however they want me to pay $45 to upgrade my account to the family plan, and that's fine IF I get credit for the remaining subscription balance on my wife's account when I add that to the family plan as well.</p>
<p>I couldn't find anything in the documentation that told me anything about what happens to subscription time for anything but the primary account.</p>

            <p><span>Hello Dreamer, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your question in Microsoft Community. We are glad to assist you.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To help you suggest steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>What was the complete error message that you were receiving with the blue screens?
</span></li><li><span>Were any other significant changes made to your computer prior to this issue?
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try following the methods given below in order to troubleshoot the problem.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to disconnect all the external devices plugged in to your computer, and try to check if the problem persists.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to boot your computer using
<strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong>. You can follow these steps to do so.
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Restart your computer by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong>, clicking the arrow next to the <strong>Shut Down</strong>, and then clicking
<strong>Restart</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. (If the Windows logo appears, you'll need to try again by shutting down and restarting your computer.)</span></li><li><span>On the </span><span><span>Advanced Boot Options</span></span><span> screen, use the arrow keys to highlight
</span><span><span>Last Known Good Configuration (advanced)</span></span><span>, and then press Enter.</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Refer: Using Last Known Good Configuration
</span></strong></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3: </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Safe Mode </span>
</strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Boot the computer in Safe mode and check if the issue persists. Follow these steps to start the computer in safe mode.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click the link and follow the steps “<strong>Start your computer in safe mode</strong>”
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not exist in safe mode, try to perform a clean boot and check.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Perform Clean Boot.
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You need to boot the computer to

            <p>Hello:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for answering :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) what do you mean by complete message? Are you referring to the numbers that appear on the blue screen detailing the error? I understand they mean
<p>
</p><p>2) I had this <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">issue </span>not longer after installing my NEW computer with its new operating system. The place from where I bought it connected the parts and installed the basic software (windows, office, etc all
 original), I only connected the cables in my room the way they said I should. I started using it and didn't make major changes when this problem started. I took my computer for they to examine it, but they said everything was ok and installed
<strong>something </strong>that may have needed update (AI suite II....don't know what that is). The problem stopped so I thought it was fixed, but some weeks later it started again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, it doesn't happen frequently or when I'm using a specific program....it just happens. I need my computer for work, so I continue to use it despise this problem, using my programs, crossing my fingers it won't happen again....I hate it!</p>
<p>The programs I have installed are the same I had on my previous computer (or updates), except for windows 7 and office 2010. I never experience something like this before......</p>
<p>If I have to uninstall a program I wouldn't know were to start.....maybe windows 7? moxilla firefox? office? corel? don't know.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reading articles in the internet (official microsoft sites) I'm almost certain those STOP numbers mean that the problem is hardware, not software?</p>
<p>The only external devices plugged into my computer are my printer (which is the same I had before), my speakers and....well, there's a house network but it was there before this computer and its issues, and besides, the other computers plugged to it doesn't
 present problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Moreover</strong>, it's not the only issue I have, but is the most problematic. I'll mention the others to see if they are related to the main one:</p>
<p>1.- Windows media player doesn't show subtitles even though I have them correctly installed. This started randomly like a year ago.</p>
<p>2.- Somethings when I want to reproduce files (music or video files) one after another by selecting them in their respective folders, it says that it can´t. The file is ok, and can be reproduced another time. In addition, I have some of them since before
 this new computer and never presented this problem which began on day one (the day I started using my computer......the technician didn't know why. It only happens when I play many files one after the other. weird.)</p>
<p>3.- Windows Explorer began to restart itself when I was using it. The message said it wasn't responding. I found a solution on internet and this stopped, but I never understood why this happened.....it was so sudden.....2 months ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I blame windows 7 since I never had these problems with Windows XP, but everyone say my computer and this software are ok. But it's not OK and I still don't understand what those numbers mean :(</p>
<p>No virus was found. No technical problem was found (the technician had my computer on a whole day and he said nothing happened). Not a thing.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I don't understand what is going on, I don't know if formatting the computer and installing everything again will help at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm frustrated. Help :(</p>

    <title>Why do I keep getting kicked back to story mode. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phishpond  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do I keep getting kicked back to story mode.</h2>
                    
<p>Finally loaded up online and did the intro thing. Now whenever I try to play I end up getting kicked to story mode . Usually only takes about 5 minutes or so before it happens . The message that comes up says " you have been kicked from this session by other
 players " . I killed one player by mistake . Was robbing a store and went to shoot the clerk . Turns out that I was to close to him and ended up pistol whipping him. Was one other guy but he stood in the middle of the road shooting at me so I just ran him
 down . Is it really that easy to kick someone or is this a glitch ?</p>

<p>When online was first launched within two hours of gameplay I was kicked four times for no reason at all. Just minding my own business robbing stores and whatnot (all four times), then out of nowhere, BAM "you were kicked by other players".</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>After that and the bugs/connection issues I decided to play single player until it was patched. I recently started playing online again and have not been kicked, although I'm expecting it to happen eventually.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I just wish these poor sports that try to horde the lobby with their friends and kick any unknown person out, CAN actually start up a private friends only lobby and never have to kick anyone. It really ruins the game when people kick others for no reason,
 or when somone is better yet they try to say they were cheating and kick them for being better.</p>

<p>I've been "kicked by other players" countless times now. The first few times was believable, but now I'm saying it's a bug/glitch problem. It's even telling me I'll become a "bad sport" if I keep leaving games when it isn't my fault it wants to kick me without
 registering that I have completed the mission. I would say it maybe connections issues of some sort or server problem as sometimes I can't connect to friends lobbies and instead have to be invited to a mission then join through the free mode option post game.</p>

<p>I believe that you can use the Windows Easy Transfer tool found here START&gt;All Programs&gt;Accessories&gt;System tools</p>
<p>Ammoung other things, here is what it copies for Windows settings:</p>
<p><span>User accounts and settings. </span>Desktop backgrounds, network connections, screen savers,
fonts, <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Start menu options</span></strong>,
taskbar options, folders, specific files, network printers and
drives, and accessibility options.</p>
<p>I hope this helps</p>

<p>You can do so using that tool, just un-check the file transfer options and only transfer "personal settings".</p>
<p>If you're feeling bold, you can try to migrate the hives from the registry, but I'd recommend against that because of the risks associated with importing registry files.</p>

            Hi Solo, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />I wouldn't say that's an issue with the keyboard but maybe a setting within Windows.
<br />
<br />Probably the quickest and easiest way to resolve it would be to reset your keyboard settings to default. Here's a link with instructions to do that:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-keyboard-settings-default-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-keyboard-s...</a>
<br />
<br />You could also try booting into Safe Mode to see if it's a service or background app causing the issue:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12376/...</a>
<br />
<br />Hopefully that helps! Please let me know how you go. Thanks!

            In that case I'd say it is a hardware issue. If another keyboard works correctly but the Sculpt doesn't, you might need to contact the store from which you purchased it for a repair or replacement!

            Thanks Elizabeth23.<br />
<br />
Am not at the offending computer at present but I don't think the issue is Malware because I had just completed a fresh install of XP Pro following a Raid BIOS failure and reformat of the hard drives.&nbsp; I connected to the Internet to download and install AVAST
 anti-virus (basic free version) as my first task and then went to set a restore point before starting to install various software back onto the computer.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, I will give it a go and let you know and also post the other information you requested.<br />
<br />

            <p>Okay, system restore service should be started and automatic and it depends on the RPC service also which should be automatic and started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does Avast have an option to disable system restore?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>also what is the version of srclient.dll?&nbsp; should be 5.1.2600.5512</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when you reformatted did you have sp3 on a cd or flash drive to install before going on line?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>windows update will not work with sp2.</p>

            Thank you for that.&nbsp; I have installed both MBAM and SAA and run a full scan.&nbsp; No success.&nbsp; Have tried to load msinfo32 and it does the same thing as rstrui. Looks like it must be a dependency object that has not installed? Is this RPC to which you are
 referring?<br />
<br />
Have searched for srclient.dll and cannot find it.&nbsp; Another unusual thing is the normal XP search is not available but an Outlook/Office search facility has been installed (even though I have not installed either on the computer yet) and it is telling me that
 everything needs indexing and does not do it.&nbsp; I searched in the Windows folder using DOS from the CMD window using&nbsp; dir sr*.*/a:s/s.<br />
<br />
Starting to look like something wrong with install and maybe needs to start again.<br />
<br />
No, I did not have SP3 on flash drive but cannot remember whether I downloaded it or copied from another computer over the LAN.<br />
<br />
Have obtained an WPPro slip stream CD with SP3 and may try reinstalling with that if you think that's a good idea.<br />

            Just for the halibut, take a look at these things for these symptoms:<br />
<br />
Search Companion&nbsp; (emptiness with just Rover the search dog)<br />
User Accounts&nbsp; (emptiness with only title bar)<br />
Windows Update (from Internet Explorer - emptiness)<br />
Help and Support&nbsp; (may not work at all)<br />
System Information (msinfo32)&nbsp; (may not work at all)<br />
<br />
<br />
Give this a whirl:<br />
<br />
It sounds like your jscript.dll file has somehow become unregistered, so you can reregister it.<br />
<br />
There are probably a couple other things that don't work that you don't know about yet, so fix them all at once.<br />
<br />
Reregistering these DLLs is okay even if they do not need reregistering.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter the following commands one at a time.&nbsp; Click the OK button to execute each command one at a time.<br />
<br />
regsvr32&nbsp;&nbsp; jscript.dll&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Message:&nbsp; DllRegisterServer in jscript.dll succceeded)<br />
regsvr32&nbsp;&nbsp; vbscript.dll&nbsp;&nbsp; (Message:&nbsp; DllRegisterServer in vbscript.dll succceeded)<br />

See how things look now.<br />

This was a fresh install after a RAID 10 failure (driver, not BIOS as I said previously).&nbsp; The computer has an Intel entry level server board. The RAID drivers were downloaded from Microsoft on another computer, copied to a floppy disk and installed during
 the Windows setup (F6 for other drivers).&nbsp; The Master Boot Sector was deleted and the disks were formatted as part of the process.<br />

The only software installed since the new setup has been all of the Windows updates including SP3, Acrobat Pro 8, Avast anti-virus and the two programmes suggested by

            Not at he location of the offending computer now so any suggestions will need to be done later.<br />
<br />
Nothing changed after the system restore (sr.inf - install).&nbsp; In fact the System Properties window did not even have a System Restore tab.&nbsp; I located a copy of srframe.mmf and srdiag.exe from another computer and copied them into the system32/restore folder
 and this then enabled the System Restore tab in the System Properties window but nothing else.<br />
<br />
Yes, I have made all files (system and hidden) visible.&nbsp; I believe that I found srclient.dll but cannot check until later.<br />
<br />
There are no errors in the event viewer.<br />

<h2>            What does the symbol mean--a laptop icon with a green box around it, within a blue box with an &#34;x&#34; and a minimize symbol&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was trying to close an adobe acrobat reader document (my new laptop user manual) on a brand new Gateway NV56R38u laptop.&nbsp; When I right-clicked, chose "more", and hit close, I didn't get back a desktop or anything I expected.&nbsp; I saw a blank screen with
 2 icons and what looked like a back button on the top left (which I clicked, but didn't do anything).&nbsp; Anyway, after spending time searching on google, I decided to try to open the doc back up (which I did by clicking 1 of the 2 main icons that appeared instead
 of the desktop--the one with the "user manual" name, not the "browse" icon).&nbsp; So after opening back the user manual, I tried alt/F4, but got an error message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>The group or resource is not in the correct state to perform the requested operation</em></strong></p>
<p>and DID get a desktop back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, the 1 symbol/appication icon &nbsp;remained.&nbsp; It is what looks like an application window, since it has what looks like (on top right) an "application close" "x" to the right of an "underline" "minimize button"&nbsp; This is all circumscribed by a light blue
 line, forming a rectangle with rounded corners.&nbsp; There is another rounded rectangle within---a lime-green one.&nbsp; In the middle of all that is what looks like a symbol for a laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone know what process or service&nbsp;may have caused that symbol to appear, if it was supposed to indicate an error, whether it has any meaning to it, and, if so, what it means?</p>
<p>Also, should I click the "x"?&nbsp; Right-clicking and/or left-clicking on this symbol or icon does nothing.&nbsp; {[pausing to check something else]}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried hitting F1, but only got a wierd box pop up that overlaid the laptop icon box, that said "identity card", and "users guide"; and, (suprise), when I closed that out, the unknown laptop icon box disappeared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. I had to go to another (Windows 7) box to post this question, since it would have taken a few weeks to do it on the Windows 8 laptop.</p>

            Hi Empiri,<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to boot the computer into safe mode. Starts <span>
Windows</span> with a minimal set of drivers and services. If a problem doesn't reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers and services as possible causes.<br />
<br />

<br />
If the issue is fixed in safe mode, then I would suggest you to perform clean boot and remove the program that is causing the issue.</span><br />

            I have a B&amp;N Nook and an Amazon Kindle Fire. My Lenovo N500 Windows 10/64 laptop does not detect either device when connected via USB. Hardware troubleshooter advises restarting but this makes no difference. I have tried using a different laptop , Lenovo
 T510, running Windows 7/64. Neither the Nook or the Kindle are detected on that machine either. Both were detected when that machine was running XP/32. Neither the Nook nor the Kindle are detected on my Windows 10 desktop. Both worked when that machine ran
 XP/32.

<p>i haven`t used the tuning options throughout the world tour mode,but now i am doing the event list i want to do a bit of easy tuning as i am useless at it.</p>
<p>looking around online i can only find ones for your phone that you have to pay for and the one that has been removed from the forza forums as the guy was charging for it which is basically against the code of conduct.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>so are there any free good ones i haven`t found?</p>

<p>In a simplistic nature, lower the rear suspension, springs dampers, tire pressure. Do this even for AWD. For FWD, keep the tire pressure about even, but still lowering the rear will keep the FWD from pushing through corners.</p>
<p>World tour gets more difficult as you progress... you can just do a regular upgrade, in leu of manually tuning the car in game. It's not as great, but will help with your performance index.</p>

<p>I basically went through 10 years in the world tour and didn`t feel the need to tune my car at all, and still never lost a race.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I moved on to the event list thinking i had only a few races to finish up,like in forza 3 ,but there are hundreds of races to do so i thought i may as well do a bit of tuning.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Cheers for the tips.</p>

<p>The one that was on fm.net is FREE up to Forza 4 version 4.5. A lot of work has been put into the Forza Basic Tuning Calculator which makes it worth the small fee asked to get the latest update version 4.6</p>

<p>A small fee is not worth it IMO. You can get these things for free or have others help you. I have a copy of the F4 calculator and did not see it as worth any money. A lot of work may have went into it but giving it away for free and then expecting money
 for an update is against the ToU.</p>

    <title>Win 10 trouble with Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eereyn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 trouble with Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro which I bought with Win 8.1. &nbsp;It worked fine except for a problem with the network card which gave me a lot of trouble. As soon as Win 10 was made available I updated to Win 10. &nbsp;I haven't had further problems with the network
 card, but I have had a bunch of other problems that I never had before. &nbsp;Suddenly, my screen would start flashing off and on (from picture to black and back again) for several minutes. &nbsp;It still does this on an intermittent basis. When I first loaded Win 10,
 Edge, Cortana, and the Start Menu worked OK, but very quickly they quit working. &nbsp;Now they rarely work. &nbsp;If I reboot several times they may or may not begin working again temporarily, but they quickly quit again. &nbsp;I can click on them and nothing happens (except
 with a right click on the Start Menu and Cortana, both of which bring up a separate menu, but nothing with Edge), though the Edge logo will pop up for a split second then disappear again. Otherwise it is useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other problems include a cursor that jumps around on the screen while typing, including skipping extra spaces while typing. &nbsp;(One tech thought it might be a very sensitive touch-pad, but adjusting the touch-pad did not make any difference.) &nbsp;In some menus,
 when trying to drag through the menu looking for a file, the menu will quickly snap back to the beginning if I don't quickly find a file and click on it within less than 5 seconds. &nbsp;Then I have to go dragging through the menu again from the beginning over
 and over until I can locate the file or files I need and click on them before it snaps back to the beginning again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am having slow starts at times while I sit and wait, staring at a blank screen until it decides to give me a working screen, and this is with an SSD. &nbsp;It never did that before. &nbsp;Also, when trying to exit a PowerPoint presentation, there is often an
 extended delay in getting out of Presentation mode. &nbsp;There are just a bunch of things that don't work right in Win 10 that I never had trouble with in Win 8.1 over a period of two years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched the Windows discussion boards and followed the advice I found for others--which they always claimed never resolved their problem--but nothing has helped. &nbsp;I updated both my Lenovo Software and Win 10. &nbsp;I ran System Maintenance, but it reported
 "No changes or updates were necessary." &nbsp;I ran Scanhealth, and it reported "No component store corruption detected." &nbsp;I ran Restorehealth, and it reported "The restore operation completed successfully. &nbsp;I ran Scannow, and it reported "Windows Resource Protections
 did not find any integrity violations." &nbsp;I ran Powershell and AppWPackage. &nbsp;I rebooted the computer twice after that, but the Start Menu, Cortana, and Edge are still not working. &nbsp;I expect the other problems will continue as well, but they are on an intermittent
 basis, so I will have to wait and see what happens. &nbsp;I have been to local techs here and they have not been able to figure it out. &nbsp;I'm looking for someone with more technical skill that can recognize the source of a problem and offer some help. &nbsp;I am a professional
 (professor) and use my computer for my work. &nbsp;I need it to function well, and it is very frustrating to experience all of these problems.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Eereyn,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>I regret the inconvenience caused to you. Let me help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Do you see any error code or error message on the screen?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Run SFC Scan</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Click on the below link and follow the procedure to perform a SFC Scan.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Run DISM Tool</span></strong><span><br />
I would also suggest you to run the System update readiness command. It detects incorrect manifests, cabinets or registry data, it may replace the incorrect data with corrected version available. Follow the steps.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press&nbsp;<strong><span>Windows key + X</span></strong>.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click&nbsp;<strong><span>command prompt (Run as administrator)</span></strong>.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. Press&nbsp;<strong><span>Enter</span></strong>&nbsp;key after each command:
</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 1.5in"><strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</span></strong><span>
<br />
<strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></strong>
</span></p>
<p><span>To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type&nbsp;<strong><span>Exit</span></strong>, and then press&nbsp;<strong><span>Enter</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3: Update Drivers</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to install the latest video card driver’s from the manufacturer’s website and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check if it resolves the issue. If the issue persist, I suggest you to perform a clean boot and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Start your computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your game
 or program. This kind of startup is known as a "<strong>clean boot</strong>."</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the below link and follow the procedure to perform clean boot. Check if it helps.</span></p>

<p>Thanks for the co- operation, but after running the trouble shooter it asked to reset the window store and I did so, but the app still freezes/loading at the license agreement page.</p>

<p>I think Asphalt 8 on PC depends on Xbox and Facebook account. Both of these need an email.</p>
<p>You can't create an email while you're under 16 or 18.</p>

    <title>Why does Skype show people in my contacts that I never talked to and - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why does Skype show people in my contacts that I never talked to and have deleted from my phone&#39;s contact list&#63;</h2>
                    I had a falling out with someone and deleted their number from my phone. I have never talked to this person on Skype before. I have the option to sync contacts on, so I'm confused why Skype is showing this particular person on my contacts list when I've
 deleted them from my phone. Also, this person also appears twice on my list, one under a username and one under a "live" generated username. Do they have two separate accounts? When I clicked on their name to open a chat box, it just says "Say hi to ___ with
 a wave" and I cannot see their "Last seen" activity, so I have no idea if they recently were active/made the account after we had our falling out. Does this mean they set their status to "Invisible" ?&nbsp;

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the Outlook link you provided and it says I haven't Added or Deleted anyone at all in my list, as in I literally have no one in my contacts list. I don't remember ever adding anyone while under my Outlook account. I don't have their e-mail saved
 anywhere, aside from a few e-mails from Gmail, however I just checked my Google account contacts and they are not in there either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This person was in my iPhone's contact list via their phone number before I deleted and blocked their number on my phone. I only now noticed two of their accounts on my Skype contact list just recently. This person uses a Mac book which may explain why one
 of their accounts was created using an e-mail (I'm assuming this is the one with the random live generated id).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried turning on and off the option to Sync Contacts on Skype to try and refresh my contacts list but they are still there. Is it possible that they are showing up on my Skype because they have me added in their contacts list still?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Stew,</p>
<p>

</p><p>The error occurs with many reasons such as backing up a custom library with a folder under your user profile, backing up folders that are not present on your computer, and more.
</p>

            <p>I ended up telling Backup to only make an up-to-date image file every day. Really frustrating that it is so difficult to make something not give you error messages on something that is not in fact an error at all.</p>
<p>What I found alarming also was when I was backing up files as well as an Image file how the backup size was growing day by day, even though I had set a size limit on the backup, it exceed the size limit I set.</p>
<p>I find it frustrating when I have to install a additional program to do something that is actually already on my computer but does not do things in the manner you would like it to.</p>
<p>I am now using "Copy To Syncroniser" to do the backups of my files. Maybe Microsoft should consider some of the features in this free program to make backup work better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks from Stew.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I know Microsoft has not acknowledged this as not only is this not in "any" terms of service (TOS) that I agreed to, it is also not ethical to do. The latest update from CCleaner from not only two Windows 10 desktops but also from my Windows 10 laptop and
 tablet. All "new" versions of CCleaner. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1) There is nothing wrong with CCleaner as an application. </p>
<p>2) CCleaner "DOES NOT" hinder any sort of updates from Microsoft.. at ALL. </p>
<p>3) There had to be some sort of "cleaning" that CCleaner does, that Microsoft does not like.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Not only have I worked in Information Technology for over 25+ years, I am also certified in vendor neutral I.T. certifications such as CompTIA A+. Additionally, I train others "nationwide" in I.T. certification prep.. I can say.. that this type of behavior
 is "very" unethical. Seeing how this post has been up since Dec 17th, and this just happened to me.. this should prove to everyone.. that the update that Microsoft has with this uninstalling behavior "is" designed as planned. And they think they are in right
 to do so as the issue still has not been addressed by them.. nor has it been corrected!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
CCleaner works just fine here on Windows 10 - presently running the latest <br />
5.13.5460 64 bit (also have a 32 bit machine running same for it).<br />
<br />
I do not use or recommend the Registry Cleaner section as it, like all Registry<br />
Cleaners/System Optimizers, can cause issues while actually fixing nothing.<br />
<br />
Not exactly sure what your present issue is. Possibly check with Piriform Support<br />
and their Forums.<br />

            <p>1) There is nothing wrong with CCleaner as an application. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any utility suite &nbsp;given to Joe Public which includes a registry cleaner is NOT in my list of safe applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) CCleaner "DOES NOT" hinder any sort of updates from Microsoft.. at ALL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) There had to be some sort of "cleaning" that CCleaner does, that Microsoft does not like.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes. Start with registry cleaning, unless of course the owner of the computer has 'forced' stuff in registry. Registry cleaners have not been necessary in any Microsoft operating system since XP. Orphaned entries are ignored and do not slow anything down,
 so why clean them out? The days of restritive registry sizes are LONG gone.. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 does what it has to do. I assume that you have re-installed CCleaner..

</p><p>As regards cCleaner this not an isolated incident. Windows 10 is&nbsp; removing applications without warning or explanation. It removed Speccy here and on other computers. Windows 10 is exhibiting a characteristic I do not recollect seeing in earlier versions
 of Windows.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Speccy was removed originally because it was not Windows 10 compliant. The latest version<br />
is and runs fine - 1.29.714.<br />
<br />
As I said CCleaner works well here and I am not sure what Tom's issue really is so I am awaiting<br />
clarification from him. Of course any decisive answer probably will come from Piriform.<br />

No, I start CCleaner manually without issue.<br />

Also do not use its Monitoring.<br />

<h3> markc123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Calendar - how do I set default account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want to be able to enter events on my Windows 10 Calendar app which will then sync with the Google Calendar app on my mobile phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If&nbsp;I enter events on my phone they eventually appear on my desktop calendar.&nbsp; So it works well in this direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I enter events on my desktop they default to the Outlook calendar and don't sync with my phone.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how I can resolve this ?&nbsp; Is there a simple way I can change the default account which the Calendar uses on my desktop so that it syncs with my phone ?</p>

<p>You can't execute a .dll file in the same way that you run an .exe or .com program. It has to be called using rundll.</p>
<p>You may want to register or reregister it. If so, open a Run window (Windows Logo key+R), type regsvr32 jetimage.dll (note the space) and press Enter.</p>
