<h2>            Email Disappearing from Inbox and Incorrectly Marked As Read</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Office 365 Outlook for email and keep having a couple of issues. I'm not using any kind of client (other than the email also goes to my iPhone). I use the web based version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first issue is that email will disappear from my inbox after about 2 weeks, and then it's gone. Cant find it in deleted or anywhere. I've even started flagging messages for follow-up, hoping they won't vanish, but they do. Even filtering for flagged
 messages won't show the ones that have disappeared. I've searched my settings for retention and sweep policies, and can't find what I'm doing wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second issue is that sometimes unread emails will spontaneously mark themselves as read, even though I have my preferences set to "do not automatically mark as read."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is driving me absolutely nuts! Any thoughts?</p>

<h2>            Hotmail Access Problems</h2>
                    Dear Community,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can't sign in to my hotmail account. When I try, I am sent to a screen with a red horizontal top bar that says "Account Suspended". This screen asks me to enter my country, which I do. The screen then asks me to input a complete credit card number, security
 code and "expiry date".&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I didn't fall for this obvious scam but I do need to get back into my hotmail account. I have requested and received several single use codes from Microsoft, inputted them but have had no luck thus far.</div>
<div><br />
Please provide your suggestions and thank you in advance!</div>

    <title>Out of inbuilt storage on Windows 10 Phone &#40;Lumia 730&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> canplaynow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Out of inbuilt storage on Windows 10 Phone &#40;Lumia 730&#41;</h2>
                    <p>EDIT: Previous title, 'Out of storage space on Lumia 730'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Lumia 730, running Windows 10. I upgraded to windows 10 few months back. I have been facing issues regarding storage space for the past few days. My device storage is completely used up, which makes it nigh impossible to update or use services
 like WhatsApp, which for some reason can't be transferred to the SD Card. Microsoft Edge has also stopped working since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what storage sense has to say;</p>
<p>7.28 out of 7.28 GB of internal memory is exhausted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now here's an insight into the device storage,</p>
<p>-4.01 GB of that space is System reserved (Really!?)</p>
<p>-3.16 GB of the space is taken up by Apps &amp; Games. However none of these applications can be moved or uninstalled since they come with the OS (ex: Edge, Mail &amp; calendar etc). WhatsApp excluded.</p>
<p>-Pictures take up 0 bytes, since they're all saved on an SD Card</p>
<p>-Similarly Videos take up 0 bytes.</p>
<p>-Mail &amp; Messaging takes up 88 MB of space</p>
<p>-Documents take about 6.62 MB of space, which are mainly OneNote files.</p>
<p>-The Other folder takes up 864 KB</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the only App I can remove is WhatsApp, which would free up about 254 MB of space, temporarily resuming functionality. But it&nbsp;does not help much and does not tackle the core issue.</p>
<p>Does this mean that an 8 GB Windows Phone is incapable of running purely on inbuilt storage. If so, this is a serious flaw.</p>
<p>Heck, I can't even run the phone WITH external storage. All my internal storage being filled by the OS itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A resolution to this issue would be greatly appreciated.</p>

    <title>Problem getting correct values when copying Concatenate formula - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marybowmanzw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem getting correct values when copying Concatenate formula</h2>
                    <p>I have done this a thousand times, but yesterday I started having trouble with the Concatenate formula.&nbsp; I have a spreadsheet with 16000 rows that have names formatted thus:&nbsp; xxx,xxx.&nbsp; I need to add a space between the comma and the first name to return
 a value of:&nbsp; xxx, xxx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have successfully parsed the name into two fields by using the Text to Columns function.&nbsp; Now I want to put the fields back together using =concatenate(text1,","," ",text2).&nbsp; I get the correct results on the first row where I created the formula.&nbsp; But,
 when I copy the formula down the remaining rows, I get the same value that is returned in the first row, not the values for the fields in the subsequent rows.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using various Paste Special options, but get the same results.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that I have found that will change the results in subsequent rows is to click on the
<em>fx, </em>then click Enter<em>.&nbsp; </em>That makes the formula return the correct value.&nbsp; But, I can't see myself going through that process 16000 times!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a new bug?&nbsp; I have used the Concatenate function many times before and have never run across this particular problem.</p>

<h2>            How to fix wrong-automatic time &#38; date&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am completely annoyed with my phone displaying the automated time and date that is supposed to be correct. I had to hard reset my phone some time ago and to my surprise the date and time was wrong by a couple of months. I fixed that by manually setting
 the date and time. Today, I had to soft reset my phone and again the automated date and time are wrong by a couple of months.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Info:</p>
<p>Date as of having the phone reset: Monday, 4 November 2013</p>
<p>Time as of having the phone reset: 12:37PM</p>
<p>Carrier: O2-UK</p>
<p>Phone: Nokia Lumia 925</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here's how it looks like on my phone: It's showing the wrong automated time and date.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a222b38-3281-496b-a365-2dc2bfc4268c" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8954de7f-30b6-424a-89dc-6518b9d4b8ff" /></p>
<p>How do I resolve this? Manually setting the date and time isn't a proper solution as to what's the point of having it on automatic then? Is this a current bug that is not yet resolved?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>-Sorry for the big images. I tried making them smaller and putting them next to each other, but they come up back to their original sizing when I save it.</p>

            Hi&nbsp;Jan B_1994,
<div><br />
<div>I've seen this before and the issue last time I saw it was that there were some issues with either the cell carrier towers or the local carrier routers, as they are what your phone syncs to when in automatic mode. It is possible it might be an issue with
 the towers to which you are connecting.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would contact your cell carrier and talk to them to see if one ore more of their towers need to be reset and/or fixed (regarding time).</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope this helps!<br />
David</div>

<p>I tested this out and it also closed on me.</p>
<p>I then noticed something called Photos Add On</p>
<p>had just been added to the Start/Apps.</p>
<p>I looked in the Store and Photos Add On had just been</p>
<p>Modified and version is 2017.35081.13920.0.</p>
<p>What it is/does I have no idea, but Remix worked fine after this.</p>

    <title>Error 1719, &#34;The Windows installer service could not be accessed. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> judi and bill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 1719, &#34;The Windows installer service could not be accessed. This can occur if the Windows installer is not correctly installed&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Error 1719 states .."The Windows installer service could not be accessed. This can occur if the Windows installer is not correctly installed"</p>
<p>How do I get the installer installed correctly.?? My computer is a HP with windows 7 installed. It came with Home Office and Student 2007 installed. I was NOT able to get a code from Microsoft that would work to open up 2007. So I uninstalled it. Maybe the
 installer went with it..?? When I try to install the office 2010, I get about 60% into it and I get the error message. The computer is about 8 months old. I also bought a new Laptop and it came with Windows 7 and a trial version of Office&nbsp; Home and Student
 as well. Again, I was not able to get a code that opened it up on the Laptop. I did not uninstall it on the laptop. I did get the 2010 version to install on the Laptop. How ever it was refered to as an Upgrade. On the Desktop it was considered to be an Install.</p>
<p>Please advise.. Thank you</p>

    <title>Unable to edit Outlook contact - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian d. hart  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to edit Outlook contact</h2>
                    <p>Outlook 2016<br />
POP Mailbox (no Exchange involved)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When&nbsp;I open some contacts (not all)&nbsp;and click inside the notes, the cursor does not appear.&nbsp;I can drag and select text inside the notes, but then cannot copy, insert, or otherwise modify anything inside the notes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So then I found that the Format Text tab is missing from ribbon when I go to this contact. It is not, however, unchecked when I look at the ribbon customization.&nbsp;But if I click the white up or down arrow to go to the prior or next contact and then return
 to the problem contact, the Format Text appears, and I can edit my contact. But the next time I go to this contact, I have the same problem. I tried copying this contact to another Contacts folder, but that contact had the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already ran ScanPST, and it repaired errors, although I am not sure anything was relevant to this, and it did not solve this problem anyway.</p>

            Hi Brian, 
<br />Are you using a utility to sync to a server - such as iCloud or a gmail sync utility? 
<br />
<br />What is the message class? You can add the Message class field to the view to find out. Right click on the row of field names, choose field chooser  in one of the 'all fields' lists (this field is the same in all item types), find and drag 'message class' to the row of field names.

<p>There is no "row of field names" for contacts in Business Card view. I can probably switch to List view to get Message Class on the list when I get connected again with my client that is having the problem. But what is the theory regarding Message Class
 specifically in relation to why the Format Text tab would be unavailable until I navigate to another contact and back again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a very simplistic system: just a local .pst file receiving mail from a single POP mailbox. No utilities or server sync. The user would never have a reason to change any settings&nbsp;(except by accident!).</p>

<br />That there is a custom form is use that doesn't support editing.

<p>I reconnected with my client and checked. All contacts are of Message Class IPM.Contact. But some allow editing, while others have no Format Text tab until I click up arrow (previous contact) or down arrow (next contact) and then return. Then the Format
 Text tab appears, and I can fully edit the notes and save changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But note this odd thing also. After navigating to another contact and back, I was able to then highlight and copy all text from the Note in one of the problem contacts. I create a new Contact and pasted the copied notes into the Notes for the new contact.
 It appeared roughly twice as big as the text in the original contact, even though the format, when highlighting text in either contact is Arial 20. Not sure that is relevant or helpful, but it was a bit of a nuisance. I had to highlight all the newly-pasted
 text in the note and change it to Arial 10 to get it to appear the same as on the problematic contact. I then populated all details (phone, email, etc) for the new contact and saved it. The new contact works perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as I browse through other contacts, a seemingly random set of them have notes that are non-editable, and no Format Text tab, until I use the record navigation arrows at the top to go to another contact and then back. So it is evidently something that
 is contact-specific but is not retained once I navigate via the record navigation arrows to another record and back. And it is not just complex ones that have this problem. There are contacts with dozens of lines in the notes that have this problem and contacts
 with no notes that have this problem. The converse is also true.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still mystified. He says the problem began in the last few days--first noticed it yesterday.</p>

            The name is just a friendly name, it doesnt have anything to do with synchronisation mechanisms. You can rename it by going to settings, system, about. Or renaming it via a computer by right clicking it on file explorer and renaming it.

<p>
</p><p>I´ve removed the device under my account and added it again, but it still shows ¨LUMIA 1020 Microsoft Lumia 950 Dual SIM¨ It must be deep inside the phone itself with no way of changing it. When I was setting up the 950 I opted for importing the settings

<h2>            SHow can  I remove dots that appear instead of spaces when I press the &#34;delete&#34; key&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Suddenly the "delete" key started to insert dots instead of cancelling letters or number, and I am unable to find a way to restore the delete key to its normal role.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Somehow the "number lock" key was inadvertently touched and transformed the "Delete" key in the number pad section into a "dot" producer instead of a
<br />
"blank" producer.&nbsp; Perhaps my experience may be helpful to someone else that finds the number lock on and its action transforming keys in unexpected ways.&nbsp; Thanks to all who helped.</p>

<p>Hi Jim,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this error, if you are using Office 2013, I'd suggest you refer to this KB to install the hotfix and create a registry then check the outcome:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2863871" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2863871</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using Office 2016, please check if you have updated your Office to the latest version:16.0.6741.2021. If not, open one of applications, click File-&gt;Account-&gt;Update Options-&gt;Update Now to update. Then check the outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, I would like to clarify the situation by confirming the following things:</p>
<p>1. Based on your previous post, it seems like you are the external user of a another company. Is that right? If so, could you tell me what the specific permission you have in that site. How about when the internal users
 on that organization save the access web app as package?</p>
<p>2. How about in your own team site, create a test access app, open it from client, save it as package?</p>
<p>3. How about changing to other browsers?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Iris</p>

<p>I am using Office 2016 and I am working on a client's team site and I am a team member with edit permissions. The same error also occurs if I log in as one of my client's team members. I have tried Internet Explorer and Chrome and have disabled my firewall
 and antivirus and still get the same error. Note that I do not get the error when using my 365 team site. Also, I have been able to access my client's team site without this error in the past. My work around was to take a backup snapshot that I had previously
 saved and add it to my team site, then open it in Access and save it as a new app with the name that I wanted to use and I then took that app and added it to my client's team site. &nbsp;Obviously, this is not the desired solution, but it does isolate the error
 to my client's team site, where it had previously worked. </p>

<p>i have not tried to perform the save from my client's location, but that would be my next option. also after upgrading to the latest version of office 2016 i get this error when i try to open the database in access, so i am worse off than before upgrading.</p>

<p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>Thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>This may be a credential conflict issue. Please do these then check the outcome:</p>
<p>1. Clear the Credentials in your Windows Credential Manager. [Go to <strong>control panel</strong>-&gt;search
<strong>Credential Manager</strong>-&gt; click <strong>Windows Credential</strong>-&gt;remove all credentials under
<strong>Generic Credentials</strong> section].</p>
<p>2. Open your Access application, sign in with your work or school account which has edit permission for site.</p>
<p>3. Then navigate to the site, open Access web app by launching local Access app then try save as the app to check the outcome.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, I'd suggest you test using another account and change to another computer to check the outcome to narrow down the issue.
</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Iris</p>

<p>As a work around, I have found that switching the user in my local copy of Access to one of the site users allowed me to save the database as an App. I suspect that it has something to do with the credentials or possibly that my 365 is hosted through GoDaddy.</p>

<br />Try some of this methods and see if one works for you. 
<br />
<br />Random Numbers
<br />To generate a list of random numbers, select cell A1, click on the lower right corner of cell A1 and drag it down.
<br />Note that cell A1 has changed. ...
<br />Select cell C1 and look at the formula bar. ...
<br />Randbetween. ...
<br />If you want to generate random decimal numbers between 50 and 75, modify the RAND function as follows:

                    <div><b>Original Title:&nbsp;</b>"Outlook Syn Issue"</div>
Hi All,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have recently moved from Entourage to Outlook 2011, primarily because we had a server upgrade to SBS 2008, which was now supported by Outlook 2011. (I could only use Outlook 2011 with SBS 2003 if I used iMap).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I exported all my mail from Entourage to Outlook 2011, and for the most part it has synced with SBS Exchange all is&nbsp;working&nbsp;very well. However, it seems to give me constant Sync errors:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Could not synchronize record: &lt;Email Subject&gt;</div>
<div>Operation would change object type, which is not permitted.</div>
<div>Error code: -19760</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have searched this error on the net, and it primarily relates to READ receipts, and the answer is to delete them. However in my case, I have deleted all of the READ receipt emails, but it is happening on lots of normal FW and RE emails also - which i
 need to keep and cannot delete.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have run the updates and patched the Mac / Office with all available updates, and out IT guys tell us that the SBS if fully patched and up to date.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas on where to turn?</div>

            Hello PhilipTrumble,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for posting to the Microsoft Answers forum! I recommend that you try deleting all information that you've imported into Exchange from Entourage. Next, &nbsp;remove your Exchange account from Outlook, and then reconfigure your account. Once doing so,
 use the steps in the link below to import your files from Entourage:</div>

<p>Yes, thanks Gloria.&nbsp; It turns out that an old 2011 version of Office was embedded in my system, so that everytime I downloaded Office 365 and installed it, my MacPro would still be referring to the 2011 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The trick was to totally trash the 2011, restart the laptop, then reinstall 365.&nbsp; Now I can "Edit in Excel" from OneDrive, and it works like a charm.</p>
<p>

<p>2) When printing a group calendar I would like to keep all private appointments from printing, any suggestions?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Lumia Phone Bugs and Suggestions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david_ledger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia Phone Bugs and Suggestions</h2>
                    <p>The following is a list of bugs I've found for the Lumia phones, I will be updating this as I find new bugs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Maps: <br />
Voice navigation doesn't give voice instructions unless the speech language is set to English UK, this is pretty silly as I think anybody would prefer an English sounding voice over no voice instructions at all. This really should only take a tiny amount of
 effort to make it work correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Double tap to wake</p>
<p>Cannot double tap to wake on lumia 650, this really is shooting yourselves in the foot, the more fluid the use of windows phones looks to the public the more likely people will want a windows 10 mobile. Also as people often naturally do the double tap (because
 of other phones) to wake thing it feels clumsy to not have it work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Settings doesn't search all settings, this is really annoying for example, searching for Cortana yields nothing. nor does searching double tap (which it should find within personalization, lock screen).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sleeping phone's screen flickers, this looks pretty ****, looks like its crashing, I understand its likely the screen refreshing once every few seconds and because your likely running at a low clock speed the time it takes to refresh is much longer. Please
 pre-render the screen and use a buffer with a DMA channel or something to get a faster render the flicker is annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Improvement Suggestions:</p>
<p>1. Getting Cortana to work should be more clear and out of the box instead of having to click settings from search then clicking try Cortana.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Ability to map internal storage or SD card to network, similar to one drive but I currently cannot choose to sync my entire internal storage or SD to one drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Be able to delete emails n whatnot from the notifications shown when you swipe down on the screen, I hate double handling emails. Once when I swipe to remove the notification and once some time in the future when I open the inbox and delete the emails.
 I have 6 inboxes this is annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p />

            <p>MS never leverages the community as a means for taking bug and suggestion reports. You have to use the feedback app on your phone to report for problems and suggest new features. This is the only way your voice reaches the MS engineers and they would look
 into the matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the phone screen flickering, check if your phone is up-to-date. The flickering is not intended. Please give more details about the problem. Does it happen every-time?</p>

<p>2;Show number of voicemails by phone icon on tiles screen.</p>
<p>I am so frustrated with this phone it worked great until latest update it replaced my land line phone and now that I'm looking for a job I really need it to work properly. Come on Microsoft let's get this FIXED!!</p>

            I'm only asking for things to work like they did when I first got the phone. It used to be that when I pulled down the notification screen (the one with the 15 square gray tiles with the notifications below that) and tapped on Wi-Fi it would connect automatically&nbsp;and
 show the network name within the tile, now it just reads "available" without connecting, that doesn't seem quite right, I&nbsp;thought it was a shortcut so&nbsp;I wouldn't have to go settings&gt;network &amp; wireless&gt;Wi-Fi&nbsp; then choose desired network. It also used to show
 the number of voicemails and messages by the messaging and phone icons on the live tiles screen

<p>
</p><p>I have a 950 XL Dual SIM&nbsp;and I can tell you:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. On the Notifications screen I can just touch the WiFi tile for it to connect (or disconnect)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If I have missed, say,&nbsp;3 messages then I have a "3" on my Messages Tile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. If I have missed, say, 3 phone calls then I have a "3" on my Phone Tile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone phones me and I don't answer, I get a count on my Phone tile <em>and
</em>a count on my message tile. This is because my carrier sends me a message when I have a missed call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this doesn't help you, except to show that the features do work. Maybe there is some other issue with your phone.</p>

            <p>Ahhh Thank you so much! Now I have an option to check. I thought it was the phone that recognized the messages and voicemails. I'm headed to the carriers store just as soon as it opens. This is a killer phone, people that I show it to just about have their
 jaws drop to the floor look back at their phone, and you know what they are thinking.
</p>
<p>And yes this does help me, Thanks Again!</p>

            <p>Ok I just got home from carrier's store and the helpful associate did a SOFT RESET for me and seems to have resolved my issues with both automatically connecting to Wi-Fi and messaging/voicemail icon notifications. Hopefully it will hold. Apparently 30 shutdowns
 doesn't do the trick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you all for your replies and advice. I hope that this page or thread will help someone with similar issues.</p>

                    If it is possible to do so, I would like to be able to share (internal) contacts between three (or more) different domains, each held in different places. Is this possible and how?<br />
<br />
As part of a group of companies I need to be able to email all employees in all companies, but I don't want to have to remember or guess email addresses - historically the email address format has not been consistent - initial.surname, forename.initial, forename.surname,
 ...<br />
<br />
Each company has a different email server or provider - Office 365 in some cases, but not the same account, SBS 2011 in other cases. I do have administration rights to each environment. I use Office 365.

<p>Hello Jack,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post. As you need to send emails to all the employees in all companies, the GAL(Global Address List) cannot be shared to the external users.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your requirements, you can take the following suggestion as a workaround:</p>
<p>1. Let each company <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-distribution-lists-in-the-office-365-admin-center-b1ffe755-59e5-4369-826d-825f145a8400" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
creates a new Distribution List</a> and add their employees to this Distribution List.
</p>
<p>2. Go to <strong>Exchange Admin Center(EAC)-&gt;recipients-&gt;groups</strong>. Click and edit the Distribution List. Go to
<strong>delivery management</strong> and choose <strong>Senders inside and outside of my organization</strong>. This will enable the users outside the organization send message to this group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you can use your Office 365 account send emails to these groups. If you still have any questions, please feel free to let me know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016, How to change the header of the reading pane&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I prefer to have my reading pane at the bottom of the screen, and then there is this huge waste of space created by the message header (wide dark gray area in the screenshot below, displaying sender and title information). How can I adjust the height of
 this message header? This header is using space of at least 8 lines of message, when maximum height of 2 would be sufficient....</p>

<p>I Agree with&nbsp;AdamWaw&nbsp;- Outlook 2016 does not appear to have anyway to minimize or remove the Ridiculously LARGE Header in the Bottom
 Preview Pane view. Internet search shows many previous versions allowed one to HIDE the header (Which would allow more room for the user to view more important info - as in previous versions)</p>
<p>I fix computers for a living - this is a big complaint among Outlook users that were used to previous versions of Outlook...</p>

<h2>            Is there a way to preserve, keep the metadata in a file in C Drive after uploading it to SharePoint Online</h2>
                    <p>As an example, PDF documents have a created date and/or a modified date as in property of the file when it is residing in the C Drive of Windows 10- Windows Explorer shows that data in a column as well.
</p>
<p>But when, or&nbsp;after,&nbsp;it gets uploaded into SharePoint Online, the metadata as in date in the PDF file in C Drive as seen in the Column in the&nbsp;Windows Explorer&nbsp;is all stripped, deleted from the document; and the document expresses a date modified, as of the
 day, it was uploaded into SharePoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there someway to preserve this data when uploading it into SharePoint Online?</p>
<p>(There is a native SharePoint App called <a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Set-up-an-Asset-Library-to-store-image-audio-or-video-files-96532BF6-DC72-4F82-BF0A-21EF945C4D04?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>"<em><strong>Automatic metadata extraction for image files</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you upload image files to an Asset Library, any existing metadata for the file is extracted and promoted to any available corresponding columns in the library. Automatic metadata
 extraction is supported for the following image file types: BMP, GIF, ICO, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF".</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to have automatic metadata extraction for documents being uploaded into document library and promoted to corresponding column in the library? I understand the author name, version history et al is also lost for the Word document after it
 is loaded into SharePoint. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thought, I have only tried uploading option, do you think there is any other option such as " drag and drop" or "copy and paste" which may preserve, keep the metadata.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At times its essential to know the birthday and modified date of a document as preserved on the C Drive but deleted when uploaded to SharePoint Online.</p>

            Hi Fortune Mile,<br />
<br />
In SharePoint online, there is no out of box feature to keep the metadata in a file when uploading file. But it can be possible using SharePoint CSOM in PowerShell or using
<br />
If you want more detailed information about using SharePoint CSOM, I suggest you post a new thread in our
 for expert help.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your understanding.<br />

            I don't think you can watch youtube videos within the browser of the phone.<br />
<br />
I don't think there is anyway to stream them unless maybe if you go to <a href="http://www.m.youtube.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.m.youtube.com</a>.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work i don't think there is any more ways to do this.

<p>
</p><p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I have exactly the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to use mobile view to speak from because I can change the size of my text with a 2 finger spread &amp; it re aligns &amp; justifies everything. But now with my normal size print I have these massive margins left &amp; right the size of which is dependent on the
 zoom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It used to be independent of my zoom &amp; now I have to get to about 270% before my margins are reasonable. At 210% in mobile view the margins are ridiculous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The document was created on my PC in word in office 365. My normal font is arial 11.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I save the document to one drive, pick it up on my ipad &amp; read it in word using the mobile view which, I agree with Spockit, has changed.</p>
<p>I don't use print layout to speak from as my normal font is too small &amp; I can't do a 2 finger zoom &amp; re justification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your attention to our problem.</p>

<p>Hi Sherry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Line spacing &amp; margins in Word doesn't solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My document is perfect in Word. I publish it and print it out &amp; it looks great exactly as I want it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I want to "preach" it from my ipad mini. The margins are exaggerated in mobile view at 200% which is the view font size I need for speaking from the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used docs to go for a decade because of its ability to expand &amp; justify easily. Then when Microsoft created Mobile view I thought great at last I won't have to use another program but as I said, recently the view has changed &amp; how mobile view presents
 the page is different to 6mths ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've solved it. Please tell the others in the original thread.</p>
<p>So under learning tools I can change the column width &amp; the text spacing if necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
        </p>
