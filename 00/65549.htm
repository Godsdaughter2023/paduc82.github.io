    <title>New installation of windows full operating software on new SSD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnradnedge  say:</h3>
<h2>            New installation of windows full operating software on new SSD hardrive</h2>
                    Hi, I would be grateful if someone could give me a steer in the right direction please on purchasing windows software. Owing to having problems with my laptop and not being able to recover/ restart / reboot the system after numerous attempts. I had windows
 7 installed as a factory installion, which was updated to window 10. Because of the problem i was thinking of buying a new pc but since decided to upgrade my laptop by installing a new SSD harddrive and load the new harddrive with a either windows 7 or 10
 full operating software. However after reading the numerous options on the web and on the Microsoft site, I'm a bit confused which would be the best option to install the software on a new(empty/blank) hardrive, with regards to installing from a DVD or USB.
 Would be grateful for price of the software too. <br />
<br />

            Hi John, you can reinstall Windows 10 on a new SSD or hard drive at any time, you will not need a Product Key, activation will be automatic  and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

            If you had your Windows 10 license activated previously, you got a digital license. You will never need the product key again once you get digital license. Since, you have a digital license, hence when you do clean install, the license information is automatically picked up from Microsoft activation servers. Windows will activate your Windows license from this information.
<br />
<br />Make sure the version installed is same as it was previous. For example, if it was Windows 10 Home, you need to install Windows 10 Home only not Windows 10 Pro. If at any point during installation it asks for the key, choose you will do it later on / skip.

<h3> geminisunshine  say:</h3>
<h2>             Outlook 2007 sending issue</h2>
                    Using Outlook 07. All working perfectly except some email appears to be sent, leaves the sent folder and doesn't appear in outbox, yet is not received by those i email frequently. At first, I managed to find a timing option and upped the time from seconds
 to the longest minute option. SEemed to fix a problem with large emails but simple small emails are now getting hung up.&nbsp; Any help out there? There have been no error message. No recent changes I can think of.&nbsp; When I send a test message I get it ok.&nbsp; when
 i send a simple message, that works too. when I send a spread sheet attachment, it doesn't send. Sending seems somewhat arbitrary as i cannot get a simple message out to someone this evening.&nbsp; All was working ok last night and nothing unusual happening today.
 I did disable my Kaspersky email editing to see if that was the fix. Nope. Really need some help here!

            Ensure you auto send receive (polling) is not set for less than 10 minutes.<br />
Uninstall your Kaspesky anti virus, reboot your PC, reinstall Kaspersky *without* the outlook integration - you still will have virus protection since your AV has real time scanning -<br />
Retest.<br />
You should also ask your recipient to check their mail via web access to insure its not blocked at their end&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 update 1709 is stuck in an endless loop. It freezes at 82&#37; every time and forced to start over.</h2>
                    <p>This past week there has been an endless cycle of Windows automatically downloading 1709 feature update, forcing a restart when I do not want it to, and then having to restore a previous version once it freezes at 82%. I have a stable ethernet connection
 so that should not be the issue. It's possible the computer is outdated enough to not be supported anymore:</p>
<p>

<p>System Manufacturer: Acer</p>

<p>Processor: Pentium(R) Dual-Core CPU E5700 @ 3.00GHz (2 CPUs), ~3.0GHz</p>
<p>Memory: 4096 MB RAM</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way I can have these updates complete or completely disable them or should I switch to Linux?</p>

<p>My PC is certainly not an old Pentium system. I have an 8-Core AMD running very fast thank you. Your simple answer does not take account of the fact that I have been running Windows 10 fine until special upgrades occur. The root of the problem is clearly
 that the upgrade ignores my Monitor and deals with it as a Basic Monitor as it sees it as NonPnP despite previously treating it as PnP.</p>
<p>Restore gives me the correct driver which is monitor.sys.&nbsp; After an update to 1709 the Basic Monitor Display driver replaces the monitor.sys driver which is logged as the last event during the update install. The Event Log shows:</p>
<p>Event ID 410</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 400</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 440</p>
<p>Basic Display\0000 was started.</p>

            I was under the impression that Windows 7 was losing support and didn't want the security flaws involved. I've had basically no issues up to this point besides random taskbar problems.&nbsp;<br />

<p>My question was actually about losing my graphics driver after update 1709. Windows 7 pro never gave me any trouble and, mostly, Windows 10 has been OK for me too until now.</p>
<p>As most people who have used Windows 10 will know, it's really only viable to go back to Windows 7 if you've upgraded to 10 very recently. However, when Windows 10 has been running for some time, a lot of time and effort will have been invested and your
 apps will be totally different to those you used on Windows 7.</p>
<p>As a result, offering this as an option is worthless to most users. What we need is realistic solutions to the upgrades to undo the damage they cause.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This upgrade has caused close to mayhem of the community forum is anything to go by.</p>
<p>If I sound a little harsh it's maybe because I have spent hours on a third season with support chat guys only to be in the same rubbish position of display resolution of 1280x1050 when my monitor has a native max resolution of 1920x1080; all because the
 upgrade 1709 removes the on-board graphics drivers that came with the motherboard which worked perfectly. It replaces them with Microsoft Basic Display Driver.</p>

            I woke up this morning to find my computer was in even more of a loop, it would look to restore to a previous version and before it was done, would restart and do it all over again, never making it to the desktop that I'm used to.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I had to spend the majority of my day trying to get a new Operating System of Linux through a flash drive and backing up some important files but some were lost forever. Now I'm trying to figure out how to work Ubuntu but it's a real pain in the ass because
 it's so different and I can't get my computer back to the way I wanted it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To top it off, I try to use a previous product key I have to get Windows 7 but Microsoft gives me an error when I know it's correct. So frustrating.

<br />
Feliz Navidad to you and yours ! Here's hoping that you have a Happy Holidays and Pr√≥spero A√±o Nuevo.<br />
<br />
I was just poking around the update forum to see if or when MS is going to issue a fix for the font issue that resulted from the installation of KB2753842.
<br />
<br />
As to the state of these forums ... that's <i>precisely why</i> you don't see me here. &lt;wink&gt;<br />
<br />
Take care, amigo<br />

<p>
</p><p>On 8/17/17, &nbsp;I logged into my account as I normally login (as I have done for years!) &nbsp;I updated my credit card info to add credit to my account and all my contacts, their phone numbers, my credit card &nbsp;and my phone associated with this account was available.
 &nbsp; I received an email (from Skype) and bank account showing the money was taken from the account. &nbsp;I tried to login in on the 8/18/17 as I normally do (for years) and I couldn't login into my account. &nbsp;I had to use the forgot my password option to get into
 my account. Once I got into my account, my contacts that I have called regularly aren't in the phone list, my credit is no longer available and my phone number isn't associated with my account! &nbsp;My account was a new account and everything that was there for
 years is no longer there! &nbsp;I would like to have my account restored to what it was on 8/17/17 to include my credit, which wasn't much but it was my money! &nbsp; &nbsp;My email is the same as it has been for years along with the associated phone number, I haven't changed
 anything! &nbsp;So please explain to me what happen! &nbsp;Please restore my account, to what it was on 8/17/17 or before that date!</p>

<h3> dannyschectman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Broken window boot manager</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I was trying to delete a os from my computer (I had two on it). But I decided to keep Windows and delete the other one. I missed a step on resetting everything. And I think window boot manager isn't working because when I started my computer back up it
 shows a black screen with the title "GNU GRUB version 2.02 beta2-Ubuntu3" and right below that text is "Minimal BASH-like line editing is supported. For the first word, TAB list possible command completions. Anywhere else TAB lists possible device or file
 completion." Is there any way to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Danny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret for the inconvenience. Before we conclude that the Windows Boot Manager is broken, we need to see if the issue is related to Windows at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, this&nbsp;issue might happen<span>, if GRUB can't find its requisite files. This can have numerous issues.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In this case,&nbsp;we need more information&nbsp;about your system, especially which hard drives or solid state disks are installed in your computer and how they are connected.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Few more details we need to know are as follows:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>What do you mean when you say '</span>I missed a step on resetting everything'?</li><li><span>On which drive you installed Ubuntu and (if you know) on which you installed the bootloader?</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>There is a chance that the grub installation on your hard drive is broken. In that case, you need to update/repair grub using Ubuntu live CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Write to us with the required information for us to be able to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>

            <p>1.) there is one 500gb HDD in my laptop. So I installed both os's there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.) what I mean by reset everything is I didn't run bootrec.exe to fix the boot manager after deleting the partition on my hard drive containing Ubuntu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.) because there is only one hard drive, Ubuntu, Windows 10, and the boot loader where all installed there.</p>

<h3> roderickvaught  say:</h3>
<h2>            I&#39;m having problem accessing messenger from Facebook from pop up search squares.</h2>
                    I have Windows 10 as my operating platform and my search engine is Microsoft edge. I'm new to windows 10, so am starting to take notice to certain things that aren't just right. I'm also using Office 365 program, but have not opened to all files know everything.
 I've noticed that I can't access messenger from Facebook unless I access F/B from the search pop up at bottom left corner. However, if I click on Facebook from one of the pop up squares, I can't click into messenger from F/B. I also can't click into messenger,
 by going onto Facebook from the message notification button, in lower right corner. I'm wondering if it's because my only search engine is Microsoft wedge and not google,&nbsp; which is what I've grow use too.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Are you logged on as Admin?<br />
<br />
Try these to clear corruption in case it has a role.<br />
<br />
1. Run DiskCleanup - Start - All Programs - Accessories - System Tools - Disk Cleanup<br />
<br />
2. Start - type in Search box -&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list&nbsp;-&nbsp; RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; - &nbsp;RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
sfc /scannow<br />

</span><br />
<br />
3. Then run checkdisk - schedule it to run at next start and then Apply OK your way out then restart.<br />
<br />

<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Then do this -&nbsp;use the Hidden Admin Account to lower your account to&nbsp;user (to lowest level) APPLY/OK&nbsp;
<br />
then go back and reset&nbsp;it to Admin APPLY/OK - this helps clear corruption. Do this a few times. Do the<br />
same for other accounts that might have problems. Then if needed you can also reset your passwords
<br />
in the accounts. Remember to leave your account as Admin and the others at the level you wish.<br />
<br />
Make another&nbsp;Admin Account&nbsp;(or TWO) with your password&nbsp;and use it to fix the others when needed.
<br />
(just to repair with, not to use as regular account, a safety valve) Always keep a spare ADMIN&nbsp;account.<br />
<br />
DO NOT LEAVE THE HAA ENABLED OR USE IT DAILY. If it corrupts you are toast!<br />

<br />
You can run the Hidden Admin Account command from the Command Prompt from here if needed.<br />
<br />

<br />
If you can't access your old account you can still use an Admin to migrate to a new one (remember to always<br />
leave an Admin Account that is unused except to test and fix).<br />

    <title>How to block Steam etc. games on Windows 10 with Microsoft family - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rosebpbc  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to block Steam etc. games on Windows 10 with Microsoft family account</h2>
                    <p>I set up Microsoft Family on my kids computers specifically so I can create profiles that will block their games etc. during the time periods when they are to be doing homework etc. since they need internet access but I don't want them on programs / apps
 / websites that are not ever going to be homework related.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In reading about it and where I manage my family online, it says I can block apps and programs from the recent activity. I assume that means any apps or programs. however, when I try to block steam or a steam game from the recent activity I don't see an
 option to do that.&nbsp; How can specific programs on a Windows 10 computer be blocked for a specific account? I would think for teenagers, the ability to allow them computer use / internet access for homework but block everything else would be the main need for
 parental control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rose</p>

<p>Hi Rose,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to know how the Steam client was installed on your child's computer. Were you the one who installed the Steam client to the computer? Please note that the Microsoft Family has its own limitations and part of this could be the Steam client that
 your child is using. For your reference, kindly visit the website provide below:</p>

Once that's fully complete, launch FH3 again and try to navigate back to Hot Wheels Island. Did that help?</p>
