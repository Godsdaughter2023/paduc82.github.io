<h2>            Netflix &#34;Live Starz Play&#34; not working with Windows 7 Home Premium</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;am trying to&nbsp;run "Live Starz Play" available at Netflix.com on my new PC running Windows 7 Home Premium with no luck. The Netflix page opens in IE9, I see it display "connecting", then "connecting to media",&nbsp; then it just says "ready", but there is no
 live stream. This worked on my old PC running XP and IE8. The "Watch Instantly" videos play just fine.</p>
<p>Also, I tried running the live stream from WMP, but I get this error "Windows Media Player encountered a problem while playing the file.". When I select the "Web Help" button on the error window that pops up it takes me to this page, "<span>Windows</span>

            <p>I also use Win7 Professional and Starz Live Play was working up to a few days ago. Now Starz Live no longer works and states movie is unavailable so i called Netflix and they told me there is a disput between Sony &amp; Starz showing Live Starz&nbsp;Streaming and
 that Starz stopped Netflix from showing these LIVE Streaming movies for the moment. Netflix stated they would post when STARZ allows them to show live streaming again! This really sucks and i wrote a protest letter to all involved. Sorry for the bad news and
 recommend to protest.</p>

<h2>            How to download Visual Studio 2010 &#40; 32 bit &#41; to a 64 bit laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just downloaded Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
32bits</span> to my laptop( 64 bit ). But when i click on setup.exe, it says: setup will insall the following components;</p>
<p>-Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 64bit prerequisites</p>
<p>-Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this mean that the program automatically downloads the 64bit version or the program is in 32bit but the prerequisites are 64bit ? I am trying to open a previously constructed library in Visual Studio 2010 32 bit so I have to have the 32bit version of
 Visual Studio 2010, otherwise it gives compiler error for that library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help in advance :)</p>

<h2>            Fujisu Scanner fi-5110E0X2 in Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Fujitsu scanner fi-5110E0X2 that I would like to continue using in Windows 7 Professional 64-bit though the maufacturer is not willing to update the driver for the scanner. My question is:</p>
<p>Can I install and run the driver for the scanner in Windows Virtual PC / XP mode and expect it to work?</p>
<p>This would be the only reason I would have need to install Virtual PC at this time and I do not want to make the effort if there is no hope of the scanner working.</p>

<h2>            file suddenly disappeared from a folder</h2>
                    I was about to download a utility program. My browser is set to ask a location to send the file to. I clicked the browse button and clicked on the destination folder I wanted. The folder had least 30 to 60 files in it. My screen flashed momentarily and
 when I looked at the folder again it was empty. How can I find them?

<p>What is the full path name to the destinatioo folder?&nbsp; From what you did, I have no idea why this happened unless it was some type of malware instead of a real download file (or the malware was included in the donload file or some type of file corruption
 that suddenly affected this particular folder or something else entirely).</p>
<p>Go to Start / Control Panel /&nbsp;Folder Options / View and check the button to show hidden files and folders, uncheck the box to hide system iles, and uncheck the box to hide extensions of known file types (I really only wanted to enable hidden files in case
 they became hidden for some reason, but as long as you're here the other two choices may proved handy at some point in the future).</p>
<p>If you still can't see the files, do you know the names of any of the files?&nbsp; Let's do a complete search for one of them (if they moved rather than were deleted, they probably all moved to the same place).&nbsp;<span>To
 search the entire C: drive in Vista go to Start / Search Box and type in ‘&lt;filename&gt; or &lt;foldername&gt;’.&nbsp; As you're typing you'll see two hyperlinks appear just above where you're typing and one will say Search Everywhere.&nbsp; Click on that.&nbsp; That will do a quick
 indexed search and bring up a dialog box.&nbsp; Click on Advanced Search.&nbsp; Click on the location drop down menu and find Drive C: and click on it. Check the box "include non-indexed, hidden, and system files (may be slow)."&nbsp; Then click on Search.&nbsp; You will now
 be searching your entire hard drive for the specified file.&nbsp; It may take some time.&nbsp; And yes, it's not a very efficient way of searching the entire drive for a file but that's how it's done in Vista.</span></p>
<span>
<p><span>Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.</span></p>
<p><span>Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or
 try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).</span></p>
<p><span>While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot
 to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<p><span>If that didn't find them or bring them back, then we need to consider them as lost.&nbsp; Here's the procedures for recovering lost files:</span></p>
<span>
<p><span>First check the Recycle Bin to see if they are there.<span>&nbsp;</span>If so, just restore them and you’re good to go.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have Vista Business, Vista Ultimate, or Vista Enterprise you may be in luck.&nbsp; They have what is known as Shadow Copies which are saves of deleted
 or modified files which can be retrieved in case the changes/deletions were done in error.&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/shadow-copy.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/shadow-copy.aspx</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 further information on how to use this feature at: </span><a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/howdoi/?p=145" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/howdoi/?p=145</span></span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
If you have Vista Basic or Vista Premium, Shadow Copies is not available; however, there's an alternative that's free and mirrors the functionality of Shadow Copies called Shadow Explorer.</span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/recover-files-with-shadow-copies-on-any-version-of-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/recover-files-with-shadow-copies-on-any-version-of-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Though it won't help you this time, it could very well save you in case this happens again.<br />
<br />
In case this doesn't work (not all files are available through Shadow Copies - it occurs periodically), here are some additional free recovery programs which might help.<span>&nbsp;</span>Files aren't actually deleted until they are overwritten (though
 they're no longer available through conventional methods).&nbsp; If you decide to try these recovery programs, you should stop using your hard drive<strong>immediately</strong> so you don't overwrite the data you are trying to recover.&nbsp; Slave it to another PC and
 run the recovery from that PC.&nbsp; Even now you may have permanently lost some of them if you're using that same PC.&nbsp; If you can't do that (slave to another PC), you run the risk of overwriting the data with every action you do on the PC (but you still may be
 able to recover some or most or even all of the files - it's a matter of luck).<br />

<p><span><br />
Only you can decide if the data is important enough to take the PC to a data recovery expert to recover the files (they will have better programs and equipment to do so than any of us do and than I provided above).&nbsp; Do NOT go to Geek Squad or any of those big
 store centers - they mostly don't know what they're doing - take it to a data recovery expert.&nbsp; It will cost quite a bit and they usually offer no guarantees.&nbsp; The decision is yours.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>
<p><span>P.S.&nbsp; I suggest a thorough check and cleaning of your system for malware.&nbsp;<span>You
 may be infected with malware which may have caused this problem and may still exist on the system. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem)
 download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and</span><span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a></span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Use removal tools when appropriate</span><span><a href="http://www.raymond.cc/blog/archives/2009/05/05/comprehensive-list-of-uninstallers-or-removal-tools-for-antivirus-software/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.raymond.cc/blog/archives/2009/05/05/comprehensive-list-of-uninstallers-or-removal-tools-for-antivirus-software/</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download, install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program
 (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span><span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a></span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span><span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a></span><span>
 and Avast at: </span><span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a></span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm</span></a></span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Start Button Functions &#40;right click&#41; aren&#39;t working</h2>
                    The new Windows 8.1 Start Button is a welcome addition but since I upgraded last week, only the bottom 4 functions actually work when selected (Search, Run, Shut down or sign out and Desktop).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All other functions (i.e. most of the useful ones) don't do anything at all. I'm running as an Administrator Account and can't see any way to fix this. Before upgrading I had previously noticed that I was not able to run a command session (cmd) from the
 Metro Start Screen and run as Administrator either.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Not sure what other functions didn't work properly before the update, but sure as anything, they don't work now.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas anyone?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>

            <p>Hi Greg, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Which version of Windows was previously installed on the computer? </p>
<p>- Have you checked if the issue reappears in a different user account? If not, give that a try.</p>
<p>- Which antivirus is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are a few things you may try and let us know the outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Disable antivirus software installed the computer and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Important Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you
 shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer
 is vulnerable to attacks. </font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">2. Run the System File Checker scan and check.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- In the Search Charms, type command prompt. Right click on Command prompt and select Run as Administrator.</p>
<p>- Type SFC /SCANNOW and press enter.</p>
<p>- Wait till the process completes. Restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there are errors found after the scan, then go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\&nbsp; and open CBS.log file to check for errors.</p>

            Hi,
<div>I have similar issues and in my case some of the Start button functions are not responsive. The Search, Run, Shut down or sign out and Desktop are ok. However all the rest of the functions take about about 20 seconds to obtain any respond.</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

            Hi - thanks for this. Part of the problem is that I can't get CMD to run as administrator. When I try to, it just doesn't do anything.
<div><br />
<div>I have no idea how to resolve this...</div>
<div><br />
<div>EDIT: Actually, cannot select Run as Administrator" but can select Properties and check Run as Administrator, which seems to have the desired affect. This would be an indication of something else that wrong though.</div>
<div><br />
<div>End result of the SCANNOW though was a large number of unresolvable/unfixable errors found and the original problem is still present. I have no idea what's wrong with the installation.</div>

<h2>            windows 8 360 &#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Just heard about the rumours.</p>
<p>For those that havent rumour has it windows 8 will be able to play xbox 360 games.</p>
<p>Looks like I was wrong to say cross platform windows - 360 play was dead as it might soon be that people can buy 360 games and play them on PC or 360.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the question is.</p>
<p>Do you want this ?</p>
<p>Is it good or bad news for gaming to have more PC gamers able to play 360 gamers ?</p>

<p>I think Its a great Idea, However gaming on the PC as always will move on Hardware wise leaving me the console gamer behind. I don't mind though as I don't play demanding games on my PC, that's what my consoles are for, PC Gamers V 360 Gamers? Sounds like
 It could get Interesting and fun!!</p>

<p>Wont happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PC wont be able to play the game naively because 360 games require calls from a very specific set of hardware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Emulation would also be very problematic as you'd be running a program which thinks it is 360 hardware, which in turn has to run the 360's operating system. Even last gen console haven't been emulated to what I'd call a decent level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is likely is that Live will be integrated into Windows 8 in the same way as it has been into their smart-phones.</p>

<p>saw this over twitter last night....doesnt bother me, the 360 is essentially a PC in a box, so..if they want to market such games on a PC platform let them...I will still be using my console when the next operating system comes out. MS have tried to get

<p>difference being this time though both will play the same disc, no PC and 360 discs only 360 discs. Also shadowrun is still going so 1/3 PC vs live games still going isn't bad considering 1 of the others was Lost Planet Colony edition (not 2 or standard
 version 1 the wierd extra expansion version they released)</p>

<p>There are an uncountable amount of variations of PC hardware out there, whereas the hardware in the 360 is identical. If they are going to make a 360 game that can deal with all the variations of PC hardware, then just make a PC game.</p>

<p>i don;t know the details by my guess is as most systems have enough memory to run 360 games maybe it will be something in the software to tell the hardware its a 360 not a PC somehow.</p>

<p>It's not just a matter of memory. It's the processor, the graphics card etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each processor for example deals with calls in a different way, that's not even bringing in dual, triple and quad-core processors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you have the graphics cards. You have ATI, Nvidia and Intel (spits on floor) chips-sets to take into account. Each respond in different ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>360 games require a set group of components. Despite the revisions made, the 360's hardware is technically&nbsp; the same today as it was when it launched.</p>

<p>As someone briefly touched on joypad vs mouse/keyboard setup would also be a big problem. Average FPS/RTS gamers on the pc would wipe the floor with "pro" 360 gamers as they just have more pinpoint accuracy and faster aiming, they also have alot more keys
 for hotkeying groups of soldiers etc in RTS.</p>
<p>People have disagreed with this over the years and you will usually find they have never at any point been a PC gamer. Anyone who has been, or does both knows that Keyboard and mouse reign supreme. The only instances where i would prefer a joypad would when
 playing sports or driving games.</p>

<p>Hi all:</p>
<p>I have a RDC program when I use Win XP(RDC Shell Version 6.1.7600 and Remote Desktop Protocal 7.0 supported) to connect&nbsp; Win 7 system<span><span>. And then<br />
</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>In my Win XP system, it can Play .wmv files, but can't play .avi and .mp4 files. (window media player version is 11.0.5721.5280)<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>In my Win 7 system, it can Play .wmv, .avi and .mp4 files. (window media player version is 12.0.7601.17514)</span></span></li><li><span><span>Now i use Win XP RDC to connect Win 7 system, and use window media player to play .wmv, .avi and .mp4 files in the remote desktop.</span></span></li><li><span><span>I find that playing .wmv file is smooth but .avi and .mp4 files are serious slowing.</span></span></li></ul>
<p>I know&nbsp; If the decoders are not present on the client then content will be rendered on the server using the server’s CPU/GPU resources (host side rendering). The compressed bitmaps and audio would then be sent efficiently over the network to the client.</p>
<p>But Why remote desktop displays so slow when client receice these compressed bitmaps?</p>
<p><span><span>How can i do to resolve this program?</span></span></p>
<span><span>Thanks all.</span> </span>

            Hi<br />
<br />
Depending on your choice of media player and the file's compression rate, the time it takes for the video to stream may vary.<br />
<br />
The file is hosted on a server which can "multi-cast" the same file to multiple users at the same time. When you click on the on the video it is partially loaded before you can access it. This is known as “buffering”. Now lets take a look on how to cut down
 on buffering time, stop slow streaming video and eliminate choppy PC video playback .<br />
<br />
Try steps from this link-<br />

<p>Hi Steve Diesel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I try steps form link of http://www.delete-computer-history.com/slow-streaming-video.html but the program is still exiisting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My root cause is that Playing media files are smooth in my local Win XP and Win 7 systems but playing .avi and .mp4 files are slowing in the remote Win 7 desktop ( RDC from XP to connect Win 7 ).</p>
<p>I know .wmv file is send by streaming (because .wmv file can be decoded in XP) from Win 7, so it is&nbsp; smooth in the remote desktop.</p>
<p>But .avi and .mp4 files are send by compressed bitmaps (because .avi and .mp4 files can not be decoded in XP) from Win 7 and they are slowing in the remote desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Above concepts are in the media redirection link-</p>

<p>I have an Epson V500 Photo scanner that will not open Windows Mail while trying to scan to e-mail. &nbsp;Epson has been unable to resolve the problem. &nbsp;Windows Mail is the default mail application. &nbsp;I have 32 bit Vista on my HP computer.</p>

            <p>Did this work before?&nbsp; That feature may not be available with Windows Mail.&nbsp; It may require full MAPI support and Windows Mail only has simple MAPI support, so it may not have that functionality and you will have to scan to a file and then create a new message
 and attach the scanned file.</p>

            Steve,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your response.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Scan to e-mail has never worked. &nbsp;I had problems with the character recognition feature in this Epson software, too, but the folks at Epson got me straightened out on that. &nbsp;It had to do with permissions. &nbsp;I have removed and downloaded the Epson software
 several times. &nbsp;I downloaded Windows Live Mail thinking it would work. &nbsp;No.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The last time I tried, I get to the "send file via e-mail." &nbsp;The choice of "windows live mail" is default, and when I click OK, it pops up an "attach to email window" and the message: &nbsp;An error occurred while starting the e-mail application."</div>
<div><br />
<div>This has always been the error message.</div>
<div>Thank you. &nbsp;Tom H</div>

            Deepak,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the response. &nbsp;When I push the scan to e-mail button on the scanned, a window appears (Send File Via E-mail). &nbsp;The scanner scans the object. &nbsp;The window offers a choice of e-mail software. &nbsp;Windows Mail or Windows Live Mail. &nbsp;I just recently
 downloaded Windows Live Mail thinking it would help. &nbsp;No.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I OK the choice of e-mail packages, I get an error pop-up (AttachtoEmail) with the message, :An Error Occurred While starting the e-mail application."</div>
<div><br />
<div>This message has appeared every time I try to scan to e-mail.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This issue applies only to attempts to scan to e-mail from Epson V500 Photo scanner.</div>
<div><br />
<div>No changes to the computer that I know of.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also have a Sony Viao, and I tried loading the Epson software on it to see it it would scan to e-mail. &nbsp;I couldn't get it to work there either.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Bummer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for helping.</div>

            <p>Well, the scan to email should work for WLM.&nbsp; See here for another product, but the software isn't likely different:&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/supDetail.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&amp;infoType=FAQ&amp;oid=139863&amp;prodoid=63084673&amp;foid=147272&amp;cat=30985&amp;subcat=30987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, after installing WLM, you might try uninstalling and reinstalling the Epson software, but you won't be able to get it to work for the mail app, as it does not support that functionality.</p>

<h2>            &#91;Q&#93; Any built-in network bandwidth monitoring tools for homegroup&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a combo Vista [2 boxes] / Win7 [5 boxes] home network.&nbsp; They're on MoCA and WiFi N.</p>
<p><strong>Does Windows 7 have some built in network bandwidth monitoring tools for me to observe the traffic on the entire network [and homegroup portion specifically]?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have instances where I'm trying to play HD content from one of the Win7 MediaCenter boxes and it will stutter.&nbsp; It doesn't happen consistently which makes me think there is some other process from one of the other boxes happening and using bandwidth.&nbsp;
 How best to troubleshoot?&nbsp; Media streaming/sharing is off for everyone except that one box which serves the others.&nbsp; Thanks -</p>

<h2>            Skype addresses of family  and friends - how do I recover this list&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I used to be able to see my contact list of friends and family members with their Skype name. Not their number. How do I get this? Also why would I call their landlines or cell numbers when I can use their Skype name?&nbsp; And I thought you only buy Skype credit
 when you want to make international calls?</p>
<p>
</p><p>like my Skype name is d**********. So why would someone want to call me via cell or landline when they can save money and use my username?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Skype-to-Skype calling is free, the only time you'll need Skype Credit or subscription&nbsp;is if you will call a mobile or landline. When calling, there is an option to call Skype or call mobile/landline, make sure to choose the option call Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regards to your contacts calling you&nbsp;on your mobile/landline, you can just advise them to call you on your Skype account. But if they really want to call you on your mobile/landline, that depends on them.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Crash - Event 10, Enhanced Storage-EhStorTcg</h2>
                    <p>Recently, I have been having unexpected crashes with Windows 10. I'm not sure if a certain application triggers the issue, but I do play video games. It always happens with those, but it has also happened while just browsing on Google Chrome. All my drivers
 are up to date. When the crash happens, my USB controls go out as well. I finally figured out how to view my Event Logs to see where the issue started. I've tried multiple "fixes" from what I have found online, such as adjusting power settings.. but no luck.
 From my research, it seems it has something to do with the SATA/SSD controls. The original discussion/question I found is from 2014 with Windows 8.1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://forums.crucial.com/t5/SSD-Archive-Read-Only/M500-MU3-Microsoft-Windows-EnhancedStorage-EhStorTcgDrv/td-p/143861</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Crucial MX 300 SSD4 running Windows 10. I also have a WD 1002FAEX for storage. ~I built this PC Feb 2017. I do believe the issue began towards the end of 2017, but has been happening more frequently the past couple months (which, I've also been
 playing games more since summer began).~</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, comment any other information that may be needed. I'm not too knowledgeable with the Event Viewer. I will try my best to understand any feedback given.&nbsp; This is what I found. Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Event 10, EnhancedStorage-EhStorEcgDrv</p>
<p>General:</p>
<p>A TCG Command has returned an error.<br />
Desc: AuthenticateSession<br />
Param1: 0x1<br />
Param2: 0x60000001C<br />
Param3: 0x900000006<br />
Param4: 0x0<br />
Status: 0x12</p>
<p>
</p><p>It then follows from an Event 41,Kernal-Power. I assume this is from the forced shutdown.</p>

            Hi M3dusa, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will I need to wait for the crash to happen again? This is all I found in that folder. Hopefully I uploaded it correctly. I will be away from my PC most of the day. I may not be able to reply until tomorrow. Thanks.</p>

            Hi M3dusa, the mini-dump file indicates your Network adapter as the root cause of your system crashes . .. 
<br />
<br />You should go to the support page for your device on the Manufacturers website , then download and install any network device drivers they recommend for your system . . .

<p>Okay, I have updated the network drivers. Had no issues until just now. A blue screen popped up this time. Stop code: IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was shown in the Event Viewer:&nbsp;</p>
<p>The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck.&nbsp; The bugcheck was: 0x0000000a (0xffffac0fc5125740, 0x0000000000000002, 0x0000000000000001, 0xfffff800e56a8d76). A dump was saved in: C:\WINDOWS\MEMORY.DMP. Report Id: b27f516b-b871-4346-8ee4-30cb11cd3c0e.</p>

<p>Dear Julie_S1,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for replying to my query. I am still a little bit unsure. I have to attend an interview via Skype next week and the fellow wants me to e-mail my Skype name to him. So, to be certain are you saying that I am to tell him that my Skype name
 is live:(mye-mail address) exactly as written? (replacing (my e-mail address) with my actual e-mail address of course) I have used Skype with my son and my grandkids and have never had to use my Skype name before. How with the interviewer make use of it to
 find me? Thank you so much for all your help in this matter. I truly appreciate it!!!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Lost Calendar Entries In Outlook After Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    Looks like I'm not the first person to face the issue of lost calendar entries after windows 10 upgrade, but can't seem to find a viable&nbsp;solution from the community board.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the calendar is still on my iPhone, but how do I export that info
 to outlook.&nbsp;Microsoft, anyone, please&nbsp;help with resolving this.

<h2>            Windows Mail freezes when typing responses and edits</h2>
                    <p>I recently downloaded Windows 10&nbsp;to a brand new computer factory loaded with 8.1&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having serious issues with it as it takes about 45 seconds to show when the "mail" tile is clicked on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even worse (making it almost un-functional), when I open an email and go to reply, as I type the cursor freezes and I have to wait up to&nbsp;around 40-50
 seconds to see my typed letters in my email.&nbsp; Often I have to retype my emails.&nbsp; This happens over and over again. with every response using Windows 10 Mail.&nbsp; It takes me minutes to type a simple short response.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I hate this new email if this is functioning as expected.&nbsp; This is a new...just out of the box (less than a week old) Dell laptop.&nbsp; I am now using my old laptop with Vista to respond to my emails....PLEASE help!</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant comment if this is the same issue, but I was having freezing problem typing with my Gmail (IMAP) account in Windows 10 Mail. It was driving me nuts as well. I could not find a solution online so I am posting a reply here in hopes it helps others.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The freezing would happen every time I started to type in a new email. (Or replied) But it would only last 10-20 seconds. Sometimes crashing Mail all together if it lasted longer. (Assuming crash was related. Might be me hitting delete or typing too many
 times while frozen.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed it happened more during business hours than at night. I also remembered Gmail enabled heightened security for Google Apps requiring a web login before allowing access. (Which I can appreciate.) When I added my Gmail account to Windows 10 Mail I
 had a pop up window requiring me to login via web before the account setup was complete.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I thought the two might be related, so I enabled (Or disabled based on your point of view.) 'Access for less secure apps'. Sure enough the freezing stopped. Its been a half day so far with no freezing with that account, but I never got 20 seconds without
 freezing before. Here is a link to a google page that I found that led me to the page that allowed me to turn it on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en</p>
<p>
</p><p>I consider this a Windows 10 Mail defect as it should not lock up trying to authenticate via web in the background. But as a workaround it has worked for me so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I suspect this procedure will also allow other mail apps like Windows Live Mail to work. You still authenticate with a username/password just not via web.&nbsp;</p>

            That's an error when running setup, not starting XP.<br />
It's you disk. Check for scratches and/or clean. If it still doesn't work, contact Dell for a replacement. When you get the disk,
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/11003/how-to-create-a-windows-iso-from-a-disc-using-imgburn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Hi Colin, <br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forums.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>From your issue description, I understand that the Solitaire game App is not working in your Windows 8 computer.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Are you getting any error message when you try to play the game?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest you to perform the following trouble shooting steps and check if the issue persists.<br />
