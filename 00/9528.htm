<h2>            Need VBA&#58; CLICK CELL activates macro</h2>
                    <p>hi,&nbsp; am looking for script that will activate a macro,&nbsp; simply by clicking on a cell in 1 specific column.</p>
<p>if helps,&nbsp; have seen the ideas:&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not Intersect(Me.Range(G6), .Cells) Is Nothing Then&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'this activates on hitting enter in cell,&nbsp; need for clicking left mouse button to activate.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Me.Cells(.Row, K4).Select&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'jump to different column, same row<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If ActiveCell.Column = 14 Then&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'is this supposed to work, might rather have this fixed to Range()&nbsp; if any of works at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if relevant,&nbsp; thought saw something like:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; withme.cells</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>is there anything similar to:&nbsp; withme.click.range()</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any ideas, thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>==========&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ANSWER:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; am going to use as a tool for fast cut &amp; paste rows&nbsp; (from up or down separate for now..).&nbsp; single click on any column you choose, maybe a sorting number formula column you would not normally click on during update records.&nbsp; this
 is for paste 1 record at a time during updating.</p>

<h2>            Extremely Tired of ActiveNon-Sync &#40;Support code&#58; 0x80883001&#41;</h2>
                    I have read various threads on this and spent many hours on the telephone to Sony Ericsson to try to fix the problem. I don't seem to find any answers. I'm new to this forum and am not sure if it has anything to do with Microsoft (other than the logo).
 Is there anyone at Microsoft who is able to fix the problem referred to the discussion with the title above? (See full trail elsewhere if you unsure as to the problem.) In summary, many users of Windows Mobile seem to face the same problem with this and similar
 error codes occurring, for me the error occurs at apparently random times. The error message means that one loses any data changes made on one's handset between syncs.&nbsp; As I have been travelling for 3 weeks, I find that I have lost considerable data. I have
 also discovered that all my notes have been wiped from both Outlook and my handset. This is more than frustrating, it is very expensive as I use Notes to record all my meetings, action plans and memoranda.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have Sony Ericsson Xperia (aka X1) handset. It replaced the P800/P900 series phones, which ran Symbian. Extraordinarily, the sync software between Symbian and Microsoft Outlook worked vastly better than Windows Mobile Active Sync 4.5. This is beyond belief
 in itself. What is more shocking is that no one at Microsoft seems to have any clue as to how to fix the problem. Can someone help me? What is causing the message (specifically "There has been a change made on your server that requires you to re-synchronize
 all items on your device. Please perform a manual sync." To be clear, there have been no changes on my server. Nor were there the last dozen times this problem arose.
<br />
<br />
Does anyone think that Microsoft should pay its customers for their wasted time due to the innumerable problems caused by software being released which is not fit for purpose (or, in the case of Office 2007 products, which have lost valued functionality and
 suffer from extremely poor navigability)?

Not only driving me crazy, HTC does not know how to fix, and it takes about 20-30 minutes to fully re-sync.<br />
<br />
And if that happens just before you walk out the door, frustrating!<br />
<br />
Let me know if any suggestions.

            <p>The answer depends on the "reason" why the blank page is there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turn on your Show/Hide button to show your non-printing characters so you can see what is going on.&nbsp; The button looks like a backwards capital P in your Standard toolbar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may find some empty paragraphs or an empty graphic at the end of the document, forcing the creation of another page.&nbsp; Or you may find a Section Break or Page Break at the end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Word cannot actually "have" a "blank page".&nbsp; A Word file is actually completely empty until you put something in it.&nbsp; When you do, Word lays it out from top to bottom, creating as many pages as it needs to do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My guess is that you have set a section break at the end of the document, and set that section break to start on a "Right Page".&nbsp; Word then assumes that the first page you produced is a right page (if you are working in English), it fills that page, then
 realises that to get the next section to start on the next "Right Page", it must insert a blank page after the first to be the "Left Page".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remove the section break, and the document will automatically contract to be one page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or you may find a heap of empty paragraphs at the bottom of the document.&nbsp; Delete them, and all will be well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turn on your Show/Hide and you will immediately see what's wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

    <title>Students not able to edit their class OneNote sections - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sevenvinton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Students not able to edit their class OneNote sections</h2>
                    
<p>I have created a class OneNote notebook from the 'Site Contents' section of my Sharepoint site on O365.</p>
<p>I have been using OneNote successfully since 2007 so I consider myself to be an expert user. I have also used several OneNote notebooks with my classes in 2015 that were created using the 'Class Notebook Creator' on my sharepoint sites.</p>
<p>This year when I created this class notebook the students reported that they were unable to edit pages within their section of the notebook. This was not the case for all of the students, but certainly most of them were unable to edit their section of the
 class notebook.</p>
<p>I tried to edit the student section of this class notebook using a test student account and was unable to do so.</p>
<p>I also noticed that the 'add students by group' feature did not work when the class notebook was created from the sharepoint site - that is: it did not pull in the students from the group that was imported from active directory.</p>
<p>As a test I created a new class notebook for this same class from my 'tile menu' using the 'class notebook' option, and using this method the population of all of the students from the active directory group was successful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this new notebook the students were able to edit their section of the notebook.</p>
<p>I then had each student test these notebooks side by side so that we could eliminate any computer, browser, or network issue, and we found that the students could only edit their section of the new notebook (created from the tile menu), but they still could
 not edit the notebook created from the sharepoint site.</p>
<p>My question is: Is there a bug with the permissions on &nbsp;the sharepoint side with c;lass notebooks, or is this problem caused because of the way our school has organised its permission groups in sharepoint?</p>

<p>hi seven,</p>
<p>when you create a class notebook in sharepoint, the permission for using this notebook is associated with the sharepoint group and the class notebook doesn’t support sharepoint groups. if you want to add student groups to your class notebook, please set
 them as ad groups or modern groups. for more detailed information, please refer to the “<strong>add your students to your class notebook</strong>” section of this article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/getting-started-with-the-onenote-class-notebook-a-walkthrough-for-teachers-28666b8e-b0ae-48fe-b001-1874f5f6db58" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Thank you for the prompt reply Fraser,</p>
<p>It answers part of my question, but not all of it.</p>
<p>This does explain why the group cannot be picked up by the OneNote Class Creator when launched from a sharepoint site, however, it doesn't explain why the students could not edit their sections when these students were added individually using the class
 notebook creator. I have done this many times before from a sharepoint site and it has worked every time until this year - my only thought is that the updates to allow 'group' population of the students is somehow interfering with the individual members.</p>
<p>Just to clarify - are you saying that 'distribution groups' can be used to populate members of a class notebook when this notebook is initiated from an individuals onedrive, but these groups cannot be used for class onenotes on the sharepoint side?</p>

<p>Hi Steven,<br />
<br />
There may be some misunderstanding.<br />
<br />
From <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Getting-Started-with-the-OneNote-Class-Notebook-A-Walkthrough-for-Teachers-28666b8e-b0ae-48fe-b001-1874f5f6db58" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>, we can know that distribution lists and SharePoint groups are not supported for the OneNote Class Notebook app.<br />
<br />
For a normal OneNote notebook file, we can grant permissions with SharePoint groups. SharePoint groups are defined for a specific site, and can’t be used for another site or site collection.
<br />
<br />
You can find more details about the groups from the article below:<br />

<h2>            Outlook 365 read mail frequency</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to make use of my Office 365 subscription by using Outlook 365 as my mail client. I just find that it takes forever to get my mails on the screen which makes that I have to use my old mail client again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to change the frequency of getting the mail from the server but I cannot find the setting for that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

            Hi Johan,<br />
<br />
May I know whether you are referring to delay receive email messages from the connected accounts using Outlook Web App? If so, set up the connected account to forward messages to the Microsoft Exchange Online account. By doing this, messages will be received
 in near real-time.<br />
<br />
Moreover, there is no frequency setting options in the Outlook Web App. I would suggest you please visit the link

                    I mover publisher 2007 from PC with XP to PC with Windows 7 Pro. The web site is no longer viewed on line as it was when I was using XP.&nbsp; I did change the IE Tab&nbsp; option so that I can view it as before, but no one else can. Is there a solution? Thanks,

                    My son used my computer for a school project. When I got back on Word my top and bottom margins were gone and I cannot restore them to 1" margins. I have used the margins settings in page layout. But nothing works. The setting shows that I should have
 1" margins but they are not there. Nothing I have tried works short of uninstalling and reinstalling. A friend suggested that I do that. Can I do that?

<h3> sinton32  say:</h3>
<h2>            Onenote for iPad - &#39;couldn&#39;t sync&#39; message</h2>
                    <p>Searching for a solution to this persistent problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of my onenote notebooks are particularly large so the fact that I am having some sync problems worries me in case I ever have much larger notebooks in onenote. Sync on my desktop onenote apps for windows and mac is working fine however when my ipad
 tries to sync some of the notebooks it shows a message at the top that says '[notebook name] - couldn't sync'. I tap on the hazard triangle logo and then it gives me: 'error code: 0xE4010640 can't sync onennote recycle bin/deleted pages'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed that this is a particular problem if I have deleted notes in a notebook and they are sitting in the deleted notes section of a notebook (i.e. before the 60 day auto-deletion occurs). The ipad seems unable to complete a sync if these items are
 not permanently deleted. If I then go and manually empty the deleted pages section then sync seems to work fine. As deleting notes is quite a common action for a user this is resulting in frequent sync problems with the ipad. I have a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have read posts where people are advised to copy and paste their notes into a new notebook and delete the old notebook. This seems quite a hassle to sort out this frequent sync problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. A onenote support article suggests closing and reopening a notebook on the ipad. Again if it is a large notebook then this seems very time-consuming as the user needs to wait for the notebook to sync and download onto the ipad again</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. My current workaround of manually emptying the deleted pages section also takes too much time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Are the three workarounds the only suggested course of action for this frequent sync problem of is there something else I can try? Is anyone else having this problem? Do MS know about this bug and are they working on a fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am experiencing the same issue as the original poster.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I am using the latest version of OneNote on both iOS and MacOS</li><li>I am able to access OneNote from the web, however changes do not always sync to the cloud, especially from the iPad.
</li><li>Yes, this does not solve the issue, and is incredibly time consuming because of how slow OneNote sync is. &nbsp;This is not a practical solution, especially since it rarely, if ever, works.

            <p>To answer your questions. Like&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/1d6a1cb2-1f27-4197-8317-c817fef26fd4" title="PaulEd2017">PaulEd2017</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I am using Onenote for ios version 15.30.1 and mac version 15.29 both of which are the latest versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I can access OneNote through the web, that is not the issue. My issue is the length of time that sync takes and the fact that the ipad does not complete sync (please see details in my original post)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I have not tried logging out/in. I'm pretty good with this kind of stuff and I can see that this is a systemic software issue with the ipad app and would not be solved long term by logging out and then back in again. As&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/1d6a1cb2-1f27-4197-8317-c817fef26fd4" title="PaulEd2017">PaulEd2017</a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;
 has said, this would also take too long as the sync is so slow. This is a frequent problem and logging out and in again is not a viable option in the long term.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried both your suggested step of creating a new notebook with one file (which still took HOURS to sync) and tried the steps listed in the community thread before I posted here. None of my notebooks are particularly large, and even if they are, OneNote
 should provide a warning indicating that the notebook is approaching its file size limit, or a progress bar that indicates exactly which section failed to sink to make fixing it easier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point in time, the only thing the link you shared told me is that this has been a persistent issue for many people since&nbsp;<strong>2015</strong> which I find unacceptable for a paid, cloud based product. &nbsp;Are there any other solutions which actually
 work, other than erasing everything and starting over? I am seriously beginning to regret switching to OneNote</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>The various suggestions from users, which don't always appear to work, are not practical. I should not have to create a new notebook and move content over to solve a syncing issue. This needs
 to be fixed by the Microsoft dev team. Resetting the Onenote ios app is also not practical as it would then need to resync everything, taking too much time.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>You suggest that it is to do with the size of notebook but like&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/1d6a1cb2-1f27-4197-8317-c817fef26fd4" title="PaulEd2017">PaulEd2017</a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;none
 of my notebooks are very big, so it cannot be an issue to do with size. I appreciate that you are trying to help but this seems to be a bug that MS needs to sort out to do with syncing. Can you confirm that MS know about this bug?</span></span></p>

<p>An honest answer would be:</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if you have resolved your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am using ipad 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how I did it,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to account --&gt; Add a service --&gt; key in your email address (although it's the same email already in your ipad onenote account) --&gt; key in password --&gt; OK (no additional account is added to the list, but now the syncing problem is no more).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Previously i remembered one page just couldnt sync (the other pages were OK). so i just edit that page in my other PC (by just adding a space, ie. press spacebar once then press enter), then sync the changes. --&gt; then go to ipad, sync --&gt; alrighty the
 page sync is complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope it helps.</p>

            I have had this problem on my iPad Pro. I find that it is fixed if you got to the iOS "settings" app, scroll down to the list of apps, find OneNote, tap on the last option "reset OneNote" and then choose "Delete login credentials". You then have to sign
 back into your Ms account when you try to use OneNote, but after that, everything syncs again properly.

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro TP Build 10130 - NT Kernel &#38; system process</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was looking at the task manager how much resources Windows 10 Pro TP Build 10130 uses.</p>
<p>I found something interesting about the process called "System" ( NT Kernel &amp; system process), when I started my PC (Dell D630) it was consuming 56MB, 30 minutes later it was consuming 5MB.</p>
<p>When I compare this process vs my other computer (Windows 7) it uses 48k only.</p>
<p>Is this normal? I don't remember seeing this process uses so many resources in Build 10074.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>

    <title>Why does the SEND &#61;&#62; button disappear sometimes when I&#39;m - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff a. davis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does the SEND &#61;&#62; button disappear sometimes when I&#39;m adding text to the hyperlink &#38; website link that I&#39;m emailing from my Windows 10 phone&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span><span>I've only had this happen maybe 10 or 20 times of the many times that I've tapped … Share &gt; Outlook Mail to send a site and add a few lines of text that I've Copied off of the site
 on my Lumia 950. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>It's frustrating and the only workaround is to go back and try doing it again. That has always worked. But you need to be careful not to lose track of what you were trying to do.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I put together a combo of PrintScreens showing evidence of what I'm referring to and I'll attach it below.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Feel free to move this into "Mobile Environment".</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>For some silly reason, this Hub site won't let me put this in Mobile Environment like I could if I were on my phone. That should be fixed too.
</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Sure, the site would then need to tell you not to check the "Save a local copy of diagnostics &amp; attachments ..." if it noticed that a user is on a computer &amp; picks Mobile Environment
 and obviously, the site can tell what type device you're on or it wouldn't be changing the drop-down in the Category Selections list.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I submitted this over at the Feedback Hub but since I was on my desktop computer, the Hub could tell that and it wouldn’t offer me “Mobile Environment” so I stuck it in Device &amp; Drivers
 &gt; All Other Issues and I told them they could move it wherever they wanted to.</span></span></p>

<p>Jack, I just had it happen again but this time when I was sending a Photo and not Sharing a site link from EDGE.</p>
<p>See how the =&gt; SEND icon has disappeared?</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c2a566e3-0816-43f5-8f8c-766ca1bda8ef?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c2a566e3-0816-43f5-8f8c-766ca1bda8ef?upload=true" height="803" width="407" /></a></p>
<p><span>This time I'd been in Photos and I held on one and picked Share &gt; Outlook Mail. Then I filled in my own email in TO: easily by just typing the first letter of my email address and up pops a list of email addresses that I've Sent To recently that had
 started with that letter. (handy!)</span></p>
<p><span>Then I filled in the Subject line.</span></p>
<p><span>Then I tried to start filling in the Body Text. But the Windows 10 Mobile OS for Email Creation has a flaw &amp; more than ½ the time there will be blinking cursor lines both at the end of the TO: line, as if to add another address AND it was also flashing
 a line in the Body Text section.</span></p>
<p><span>So, since you've scrolled down, you only see the one in the Body Text section so you start typing.</span></p>
<p><span>When your typing isn't doing anything, if you've had it happen before, you already know to go Delete it from the end of the TO: and scroll down again and tap in the Body Text area to add your words.</span></p>
<p><span>Then, sometimes there's <strong>mysteriously NO SEND =&gt; BUTTON</strong>! I’ve never been able to figure out how to get it back. I've tried tapping in every place on the screen even after scrolling it up &amp; down.</span></p>
<p><span>So, this has happened to me both when sending a site link directly from EDGE &gt; Share and also from Photos &gt; Share.</span></p>
<p><span>In all instances, I've tapped in FROM:, TO:, SUBJECT and BODY and none of them make the Send =&gt; icon reappear.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The only workaround is to hilite your Subject line, Copy / Paste it into the Body Text section, Copy that whole section and hit the
</span><span>ß</span><span> or Windows key at the bottom of the screen. Then go create the email again, maybe this time by starting in the Inbox section and not in the Photos section.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Now I can write a new email since I have all of my thoughts already written &amp; I can just Paste them in.</span></p>
<p>I'll post this over in the Feedback Hub in the Mobile Devices section. I trimmed it down to &lt; 1,000 character description so it can meet their "rules".</p>

<p>I've had it happen to me a few times lately and I think that this might happen if I've rushed and the phone's OS is still trying to catch up. I say this because I think a few times if I wait, it finally switched from what I showed in my Question to what
 it should be with the Send =&gt; icon shown.</p>
<p>This has happened to me when I've been Sharing an EDGE URL and also when I'm Sharing a Photo.</p>

<br />
Is there any way for you to save the CSV file directly to disk instead of opening it immediately in Excel?<br />
<br />
If you can, open the CSV file in Notepad and take a look at the syntax of the file.<br />
<br />
The problem might be:&nbsp; the data separator in the CSV file does not match the controlling separator (I believe it's the list separator) in your Regional and Language Options control panel.<br />
<br />
In that case, you might import the CSV file into Excel instead of opening the file directly.&nbsp; Use the Data / Get External Data / From Text operation, which gives you the opportunity to specify the column separator.<br />
<br />
Even so, I cannot imagine why you would see only the headers.&nbsp; Instead, I would expect mangled data:&nbsp; several "columns" of data in one cell, for example.<br />

            <p>Hi Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>Yes I've tried saving the file first, no difference.&nbsp; If I open it in notepad, no difference.&nbsp; Comma delimited on the headers and absolutely no other data.&nbsp; I'm hoping there are some other 360 users on here who will see this post so we can tell&nbsp;360 this
 is not an excel issue.&nbsp; I really appreciate your attempt though.</p>

<br />
That should be evidence enough.<br />
<br />
Let's be clear here:&nbsp; when I say "save the CSV file directly to disk <u><i><b>instead</b></i></u> of opening it immediately in Excel", I mean you are given the option to save the CSV file to disk, either by a typical download pop-up with two choices (open in
 Excel or save) or by an option provided by the CapOne user interface (e.g. a separate Save radio button).&nbsp; Right?<br />
<br />
If so, and if the CSV file contains only the comma-delimited headers, how could it be an Excel issue?&nbsp; (Rhetorical.)&nbsp; I presume the CSV file is created by the CapOne server, without any interaction with your computer, much less Excel on your computer.<br />
<br />
Since you are in contact with CapOne ("Capital one <u><b><i>says</i></b></u> it is an excel issue"), they should cop to the problem once you send them the CSV file or tell them about it.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

            <p>I concur with joeu2004 100.1% (which is about what Capital One charges me as interest on their card) - if when you save the CSV file directly and all you get is the header, then there is something wrong at there end and it has nothing to do with Excel, as
 proven by the fact you didn't use Excel to get the file, and you examined it with Notepad, again keeping Excel out of the loop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seems C-O has as much of a problem with their 360 product as someone else has with their 365 product line.</p>
<p>You <em>might</em> give them one more opportunity to point the finger at someone else: ask if their site is web browser version&nbsp;dependent.&nbsp; I know that some financial sites don't work "quite right" with some versions of Internet Explorer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or you might just jump ahead of them a bit, download and install Chrome and see if you have the same problem with downloading the CSV file that you have with your current browser, which I'm kind of assuming is a version of IE.&nbsp; If you have the same results
 with the CSV file downloaded using another browser, you've now not only pointed the finger right back at them, but you can give them the bird too!</p>

            <p>Though Windows 10 itself had enough issues due to its early release, the larger issue for many is the type of thing you are describing as "turning into Apple", since over the years that has become the most common type of customer that Microsoft now serves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past the Windows operating system was designed for programmers, primarily because it was running on a general purpose computer with an open interface which allowed anyone to develop an application to do whatever they required.&nbsp; Over time though, Windows
 has become more of a platform for the operation of certain commonly provided applications, with fewer people doing their own development or providing software to small groups of people, whether free or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other thing that has changed is the massive amount of malware and other software trickery that now exists, most of which is beyond what a typical person can recognize.&nbsp; This has forced Microsoft to close many of the easy to access API and other interface
 access&nbsp;points within Windows in order to protect the user, in many cases from themselves.&nbsp; In doing this though, they make things more difficult for the individual home or small developer, since it's now virtually required that they use items like certificates

 another undesired side effect of the heightened security required to protect Windows from the potential attack by malicious developers, which of course affects everyone.</p>

<h2>            18323.1000 can&#39;t be installed.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have been inactive quite a long time (I was just fine with 18305), but now I think, as a Fast Insider, it is necessary to upgrade to the latest build(s).</p>
<p>Well, one sad story:&nbsp;<strong>18309 ; 18312 ; 18317 ; 18323</strong> didn't work. I can't install them via Windows Update.</p>
<p>Ok, you may give me advice like "Delete SoftwareDistribution, Reset WU, etc.". But none of them work.</p>
<p>Even making an ISO from UUP doesn't work any more, because it won't convert after successful download.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help me?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Pep J.</p>

<p>You didn't say which build you have installed on your PC.&nbsp; If you have a really old build, you will have to do a clean install from that ISO you made.&nbsp; Some time ago, MS stopped letting really old builds be updated to the current build.<br />

<p>What I have to say is, that the <strong>3rd</strong> time downloading 18323 was a huge success, by the way.</p>
<p>The first and the second time, after successful download, will say an ERROR message: UUP file cannot be found in specified directory.</p>

            It's good to hear that you have had success on your third try. These last few builds have proven to be so problematic to me where it sometimes stretched into days when I was trying to do it through Windows Update. The only way I got 18317 to install onto
 my system was to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewadvanced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
download the ISO</a>,&nbsp;do a clean install of 18290 and then let Windows Update do it's thing. Windows Update had a few minor bumps getting to 18323, but nothing serious.

<h2>            OneNote Cannot Sync &#40;Error 404&#41; &#38; &#40;Error 500&#41; on iPhone</h2>
                    <p>My desktop versions of OneNote 2013 and 2010 can communicate with my SkyDrive without issue. I think the root cause is when I first started using SkyDrive I deleted all the default folders and created my own structure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tests Attempted:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deleted existing 'Documents' folder on SkyDrive</li><li>Login to OneNote on iPhone with *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, &lt;email address removed for privacy&gt;&nbsp;get 404 error, observed that the Documents folder is automatically created on SkyDrive</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Login to OneNote on iPhone with a different Microsoft account, works fine</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Deleted existing 'Documents' folder on SkyDrive</li><li>Login to OneNote on Android with *** Email address is removed for privacy *** &lt;email address removed for privacy&gt;, works great, documents folder created, personal (web) notebook created.</li><li>Then login via iPhone app, get Error 404</li><li>Try again to login via iPad app, get Error 500</li><li>Delete the app from both 'i' devices, reinstall, but still get error 404 and 500.</li></ol>
<p>Since the Android version of the app was able to create the default folder and notebook I've no idea why the two IOS versions of the app fail to load. I honestly can't think of anything else to test. I've read every thread I've been able to find on this
 site as well as google. Seems like they all end in never getting an answer, or the answer is to delete the Documents folder.</p>

            I had same problem but I fix it. I found that I am not deleted original Documents folder from SkyDrive. And not deleted all books of OneNote. Folder was just renamed and in other folders of SkyDrive there was another books of OneNote. So when I founded
 it I deleted it all and I started OneNote from iPhone. It created new original folder with new OneNote book. I tested in iPad and MacBook - it works. &nbsp; &nbsp;

            1. What is your version of Skype? Did you try to uninstall and reinstall it.
<br />
<br />Uninstall - Windows Key+I &gt; Apps &gt; Scroll down to Skype &gt; Uninsall
<br />Reinsttal - Go to Store and reinstall
<br />
<br />2. As an alternative, you can also download classic Skype

            Yes it has been uninstalled and reinstalled several times. It seems ridiculous that the only solution to this problem is to just not use the new version of Skype and to continue to use the old one.

    <title>No notification for all-day events - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lo&#239;c pelletan  say:</h3>
<h2>            No notification for all-day events</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I encounter a bug that is really annoying me : I don't receive any notification for an "all-day" appointment. No sound, no vibe. The phone is switching on at the remind time, a pop-up appears, but without any sound nor vibration.<br />
<br />
I don't have this behaviour when the appointment is not an "all-day" event.<br />
<br />
I verified my settings, I even hard-reset, and I always have the bug.<br />
<br />
I tried to clean the notification queue using some softs and tutorials (like <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=333521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=333521</a>) and the bug is always there.<br />
<br />
Somebody has an idea to resolve this annoying bug ?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.<br />

An all day event will notify you (if it works) ironicly just before midnight of the all day event. Not sure if you want that

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your answer.<br />
<br />
My device is a HTC Touch HD, with the french stock ROM.<br />
<br />
My all-day events are configured to remind me 12h before the event. I used it on my HTC TyTN II for 1 year without a problem, and it is a really nice feature, to be notified that a birthday or others all day events are coming.<br />
<br />
I made many tests : soft-reset, hard-reset, search in the registry, clean the notification queue.... no solution yet.<br />
<br />
The last test I made (about 10min ago...) : I flashed my device again with the stock ROM, and, when the device is ready just after the flash, I add the vibration for the notification "Reminder" in the settings, add an "all-day" event in the calendar for tomorrow,
 and set it to remind me 505 minutes before (=&gt; 15h35).<br />
<br />
I waited, and the same problem appeared : the phone lights up, and display the "Reminder" pop-up, without any ring nor vibration :(<br />
<br />
I searched everywhere, but I just don't find any solution for this problem.<br />
<br />
If I create the exact event, but without the "all day" parameter, I just got no problem at all.<br />

            I'm assuming that you are syncing with your PC's Outlook.&nbsp; Are the reminders showing on your PC with sound?

<p>I don't sync with my PC. I use an exchange server. <br />
I set a reminder for my "all-day" event.<br />
<br />
In fact, when if I create&nbsp;two appointments with the exact same settings, but one "all-day" and one not "all-day", the reminder for the all-day will not ring nor vibrate and the reminder for the not "all-day" will ring and vibrate.<br />
<br />
If I'm not wrong, there's only one place to choose the "Reminders" settings and it apply to all reminders (appointments - all-day and not all-day -, and tasks).</p>

            I can select if there'll be a reminder or not, and when the reminder will appear.<br />

            It seems the new ROM (2.03) for the HTC Touch Diamond has the exact same bug.<br />
It seems to be a WM6.1 build issue, cause there's no difference in the registry between the previous ROM and the new.<br />

            I can confirm this issue. I have a recently bought HTC Touch Diamond 2 with a UK stock ROM. No all day event reminder sounds.....very annoying. Any fix for this yet?

    <title>MSWord 2010 not shutting down properly - Multiple instances of - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deniselantz  say:</h3>
<h2>            MSWord 2010 not shutting down properly - Multiple instances of Winword.exe&#42; running in Windows 7</h2>
                    I've been having to manually shut down Winword.exe instances from the Task Manager in order to save files, delete files, etc.
<br />
<br />
- First thing I noticed was sometimes not being able to delete files or change file names in Windows Explorer w/error saying that the file is already open. I would check the Task Manager &amp; find multiple instances of winword.exe running in the background even
 though Word was closed &amp; some of the files it was referring to had not been open in a long time. Other times I would have the problem &amp; go the task manager but not see any Winword.exe files running... strange.<br />
<br />
- More recently I've been opening files and finding that I'm not able to make changes for several minutes. Most often I notice this in Excel (I'm in there a LOT), but I'm 99% positive that it's happening in Word also. It seems to gets resolved when I close
 the Windows Explorer window.<br />
<br />
- Now I'm noticing files being opened in "Read Only" mode for no apparent reason (as if it were already open) - maybe this is just another symptom of the problem that could have been happening all along &amp; I just didn't notice it?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I could be wrong, but I suspect the issue is related to opening files from Windows Explorer and/or launching multiple instances of Word (or Excel). Maybe it has to do with the View feature in Windows 7 for Explorer.... but when I posted this in the
 Windows forum I was told that I need to be posting here instead.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, I've seen some other posts on similar or the same issue for MS 2010 as well as for some older versions of Word, etc. -- both in the Microsoft forums, and in outside forums, but many do not have solutions offered, and those that do don't seem relevant
 to this case -- i.e. referring to plug-ins I don't have, etc. or pertaining to conflicts between older OS or older versions of Word.<br />
<br />
Any ideas? Thanks!!<br />

            Success! I believe I found resolution to my original problem here:<br />
<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-files/cannot-delete-or-rename-a-word-file-through/09413397-b380-4fa3-bb49-159f3353f948<br />
<br />
Now I can rename &amp; delete DOC files without issue. Hopefully it will also resolve the other 2 issues which I think are related.<br />
<br />
Turns out it WAS the Preview Pane function in Windows 7 that is causing the problem.<br />

<p>I have selected my default font (Arial) and size (12), and these work for first para. and signature.
<br />
In between everything changes to Calibri 12. How come? and what can I do to keep continuity throughout each email?</p>

            I am sitting here just shaking my head, Jim... totally agree with you.<br />
The problem continues for me almost all of the time and I have simply given up on getting a real answer. You see the ones above.<br />
I either change it if it's an important email, or explain to friends that it's out of my control.<br />
I use Gmail for all of my own business communication, and find it totally trustworthy and efficient.<br />
Strange how this never happens there or on BigPond email service, and as you say, never before on Hotmail.&nbsp;
<br />
All I can say is... hmm. Seems we must grin and bear the ever-growing gremlin invasion.<br />
Suggest the Outlook people get out there and look - maybe even find some answers!<br />

            I don't send the message until I correct the font by highlighting it and changing it to my default. This is time consuming and shouldn't be necessary. Don't you clowns check for glitches like this before you force this ill conceived and unwanted mess on

            <p>The motherboard of your phone has died. Take it to an authorised service place to have that confirmed. As the phone is probably out of warranty already, the cost of the motherboard replacement, even if it is possible, will be higher than the cost of a new
 handset. </p>

<h2>            Excel hyperlinks are downloading the files from sharepoint not opening them on my PC</h2>

</p><p>I have a table containing some simple info and each row has a link to a file associated with the row.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click the link, it has defaulted to the sharepoint link and thus downloads me a copy rather than opening it on my PC.</p>

<p>Hi Craig,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for sharing your experience on our forum.</p>
<p>First, I need to confirm if you are using Excel online.</p>
<p>If so, based on my test, if you open the Excel file on Excel online, it will download the files when you click the link.</p>
<p>As a workaround, I suggest you open the file on Excel client, it will jump to the file when you click the link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the situation, we welcome and encourage you to share your ideas through&nbsp;<a href="https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/274580-excel-online?query=open%20link%20not%20download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">User Voice</a>. It is the best way to perfect

<p>Hi&nbsp;Craig,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to confirm if you add the local file links to a local workbook and when you click the link, it downloads the file instead of opening the workbooks in local Excel client. If not, please share your steps to add the link with me so that I can test for
 you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to my test, when I add the links of local workbook to a new one, with a click of the link, the workbook will be opened in a new window in Excel. If I add a link of workbook in SharePoint to local workbook, when I click the link, the workbook will
 be opened in Excel Online in browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, following are my steps to add the link to workbooks, if they are not the same as yours, please let me know:</p>
<p>Insert tab&gt; Link&gt; Find the location of the workbooks I want to insert on local drive&gt; OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand your situation and provide help for you, please help confirm some information:</p>
<p>1. What are your Office product name and full version number?</p>
<p>You can capture a screenshot refer to this article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/about-office-what-version-of-office-am-i-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
