<h2>            ALL BROWSERS NOT WORKING AFTER WINDOWS 10 UPGRADE - Google Chrome, Opera, Mozilla FireFox and even Internet Explorer EXCEPT Microsoft Edge</h2>
                    After upgrading to Windows 10. ALL my browsers not working. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and even Internet Explorer.&nbsp;I uninstall and reinstall. But the reinstallation failed. Now I do not have anymore working&nbsp;browsers (since I have already uninstall
 them thinking that reinstalling them back it will work) to surf with EXCEPT for the Microsoft Edge. Windows 10 Microsoft Edge browser is OK but I don't like it.&nbsp;What a catastrophe. Please tell me what should I do to fix this ? In plain English please. I am
 no Tech savvy person. Thank you a million.

            <p>After upgrade to Windows 10 was unable to load new pages into Opera browser. Microsoft troubleshoot program did not work even after changing to Windows 8 compatibility settings. Finally it just declared the program incompatible.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I was not satisfied with that result so did some fiddling. Found that turning off Opera Turbo setting allowed Opera to work. Windows 10 not compatible with the Opera Turbo setting.</p>

            This is such a Bummer indeed. What should we do now ? I wonder if Microsoft is doing something about it now. And they better fix it fast ! Btw, do you know how I can revert back to Windows &nbsp;8?&nbsp;

            Hi. You better not waste time trying to resolve the issue. I would suggest that you just revert back to your previous Windows version. You can do that by clicking the settings button and look for restore option. Hurry. This option is only available for
 1 month from the date you install Windows 10. Let's Microsoft resolve the issues and glitches themselves. I bet it will take a long time.

<p>
</p><p>Ok so the problem I had was only edge would work, not chrome or firefox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turned out to be the bitdefender firewall. I turned it off an everything worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the bitdefender uninstall kit (found online) and then downloaded the win 10 bitdefender install file.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alls good. Hope this helps</p>

            <p>Did you have any virtual private networking (VPN) software installed prior to updating to Windows 10? &nbsp;If so, try uninstalling that software, reboot, and try each application again for Internet connectivity. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My scenario: &nbsp;I upgraded to Windows 10 on August 17th. I constantly received messages from all of my Internet related programs stating unable to connect to the Internet. Surprisingly my network connections were reporting connected to the Internet via a home
 Wi-Fi connection. Also to my surprise the new Windows Edge browser was the only thing able to browse the web. After some research I noticed some people having the exact same issues and who also have various VPN software installed prior to the OS update. Most
 people with this problem have Cisco VPN. Me personally I was using HMA VPN Pro! (from hidemyass.com). A link on their site cited the same issues for Windows 10 and gave suggestion on a fix, the one above being the best. After uninstalling the VPN software
 and restarting Windows all of my programs are now working as they should. I have since reinstalled the VPN software and it is connecting as usual also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps. Here is the link to the HMA VPN website with the suggestions that helped me:

            My issue was related to AVAST. I had to remove the AVAST version which was previously installed with the original OS. Then I downloaded the new Windows 10 compatible version and all my browsers work now.&nbsp;

<h2>            Things marked with security shield is not allowing me access.</h2>
                    I have been trying to add a user account and set up parental controls for my ten year old, but I cannot access anything with a windows security shield next to it.&nbsp; I can't change my user name either.&nbsp; I have tried everything from turning off the firewall
 to trying various ways of creating a new user account.&nbsp; My account is the only account and therefore the administrator account.&nbsp; I have a Dell desktop and Windows Vista. Any suggestions??!!!

            Your user account may be corrupted and need to be repaired.&nbsp; First, to activate the hidden Administrator account to gain access to the sytem see the following:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/en-us/default.aspx?&amp;lang=en&amp;cr=US&amp;guid=&amp;sloc=en-us&amp;dg=microsoft.public.windows.vista.administration_accounts_passwords&amp;p=1&amp;tid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055&amp;mid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 you can try <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/enable-the-hidden-administrator-account-on-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/enable-the-hidden-administrator-account-on-windows-vista/</a>. &nbsp;Use this account to reset your acciount as an administrator account (if necessary) and to create a new user account (an administrator account if you
 prefer).&nbsp; Once you have completed what you need to do with this hidden administrator account, deactivate and hide it again.<br />
<br />
Here's how to repair a corrupted user profile: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</a>.&nbsp; I don't think your user profile is entirely corrupt, but perhaps some small parts aren't functioning as they should (hence your inablility to access those particular files).<br />
<br />
There may also be something wrong with your system files so let's check them:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / More Programs / Accessories / Command Prompt and right click on Command prompt and click run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no errors it could not repair (if such errors occur, post back here).<br />
<br />
I hope one of these possible solutions servers to resolve your problems.&nbsp; Good luck - and please post back in any case to let us know how things went.

<p>I do enjoy rpg's but I've given this game countless opportunities knowing that if I stuck with it I would see why it's so "incredible" but I gotta say... I'm trading it in this weekend to help pay for madden 2013.. **** it... The control scheme is too complex,
 the menu is too confusing, you die way too easy, the crafting is complex &amp; when u finally brew something good luck using it cus you have to "meditate" to even be able to drink a potion.. wich you can't do in a battle so when you wander unknowingly into a big
 battle you'll just have to die &amp; start all over from your previous save.&nbsp; I've given it it's chances time &amp; time again but this game is just crap imo.</p>

<p>I have to say I just got this game. After the tutorial it told me I should play on easy which I scoughed at because I play everythig on hard. I am glad I took some of its advice because this game harkens back to when games where actualy challengening. If
 they made them more like this and Dark Souls than I would be in gamer heaven.</p>
<p>I have made the mistake over and over of not saving often. Losing 2-3 hours of gameplay because I drained all my potions and kept wandering the woods.</p>
<p>But that is my folly.</p>

<p>I want to like this game more.. It's ok, but a bit long-winded in the story telling at times.. I understand that it's a so-called mature game with no thrills and spills like many other rpg's.. but the story can be lackluster at times.. I would rather read
 the book instead.. however, i will keep going on with this game.. The mechanics and unique fighting style is getting easier also.. besides i love rpg's and thisi is a new approach, so kudos to that</p>

<p>Definitely a fresh entry to the stale console rpg market. I was happy to see they were able to transfer almost all the content from the pc version if not all. The graphics didnt even take that hard of a hit so if anything you have to give CD Projekt credit
 for doing a good port. All the content that was released in patches would surprise alot of you that never touched the pc version when it first released. So puts anything else from CD Projekt on my radar due to their commitment.</p>

<p>It's not complicated to play IMO, but the controls are TERRIBLE!! The left stick is way too "wobbly" it's hard too make precise movements and that can be very annoying. &nbsp;Also, after playing for 3 hours, I realized I'm "watching" more than "playing." &nbsp;This
 is a movie not a game. &nbsp;It's a movie that sometimes let's you play for a few minutes, and then the movie continues. &nbsp;Seriously there are way too many cinematic cutaways, Mass Effect 1-3 has a lot too, but I still felt like I was playing more than this... I
 also don't get the whole meditation thing, why is it so limited when you can do it??? I don't think it's worth playing this all the way through w/the "wobbly" controls and excessive cutaways... &nbsp;</p>

<p>Yeah at first i think everyone feels lost and confused and it definitely is very hard to get into, and even harder to pick up after a while of not playing, but seriously it is not that complicated, B is dodge which is your best friend.</p>
<p>It just requires a lot of patience and actual thought, and really if you can't manage watching a few cut scenes this pretty much isn't the game for you, being mature it has a much deeper story that will fly right over most peoples heads since they just skip
 cut scenes and want to get back to mashing buttons.</p>
<p>As an RPG is felt fresh and different and stands out from the crowd, it has its problems for sure, but with todays age of super fast action games that hold your hand 100% of the time, its pretty obvious many people would just give up and go back to playing
 COD/Fifa. </p>

<p>Well I just finished this game and didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would, but calling it garbage is a bit childish. &nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>My opinions:</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>Great graphics </li><li>Great artwork </li><li>Nudie scenes </li><li>Combat (although some hate, I at least find it much better than Skyrim's trigger smashing)
</li></ul>
<p>.</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Story, way too political to the point where I found myself just pushing 'A' to skip through conversations. &nbsp;
</li><li>Only 3 places to 'explore' and the only one worth noticing is the first one. </li><li>If you haven't played the first game you will be lost in the lore. </li><li>Menus were clearly designed for PC gamers in mind. I found the map to be somewhat useless. Also tiny text everywhere.
</li><li>Although I did enjoy watching digital nipples, some of the sex scenes are laughable. &nbsp;I would have very much enjoyed just watching the women give me a lap dance. All the brothel scenes basically fall down to 'pay 100 coins to watch a 10 second sex scene'.&nbsp;
</li><li>Fable-like exploration. &nbsp;Meaning all the places are basically halls. &nbsp;If you go into a forest you cannot explore the whole forest, instead you have to follow the 'paths' within the forest.&nbsp;
</li><li>Lack of customization. &nbsp;I wore the same pair of boots, gloves and trousers since I started the game (I looked for better ones but only found a few that were worth getting). &nbsp;I was able to find and forge chest armor, but most of them just look boring. &nbsp;
</li><li>Arm wrestling and poker missions. &nbsp;Ya'll know what I'm talking about so no further explanation needed.
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>.<br />
Well the game isn't that bad, but it certainly wasn't for me. &nbsp;Hopefully The Witcher 3 will be much better. &nbsp; I do have a lot of respect for the developers as they're still 'underdogs' in the developing world and were able to pull this off. &nbsp;I will definitely
 support them in the future, although I did not enjoy The Witcher 2 as much as I thought I would.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Install Windows 10 from USB won&#39;t complete - stuck in loop</h2>
                    <p>My husband had some particularly nasty malware on his computer.&nbsp;Windows Defender found and removed five viruses.</p>
<p>After that we still had some things not working right (e.g. start menu was gone) so I tried to refresh the computer. It repeatedly failed.</p>
<p>I have made a recovery USB and wish to just reinstall W10.</p>
<p>Installation appears to go OK, the Windows Setup "Installing Windows" screen goes through five steps:</p>
<p>- Copying Windows files, check </p>
<p>- Getting files ready for installation, check</p>
<p>- installing features, check</p>
<p>- Installing updates</p>
<p>- Finishing up</p>
<p>
</p><p>It gets to "installing updates" and sends me right back to the initial "do you want to install" dialog box and then the whole process starts all over again. I've been through it four times now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I doing something wrong?</p>

<p>When I import it asks me to browse for a file? I'm not totally thick when it comes to doing stuff but this is totally beating me.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>well I had this question at first but I managed to find a work around that works for me.</p>
<p>I know this awhile after it was asked but I thought I add this just incase anyone stumbles across this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway you'll need a gmail account setup properly to your country (like the uk) ( I should also mention I only figured out how to do it on the windows phone but you may be able to follow along on the app on Windows 10 or any other program ) then you will
 need to sync it to your phone and ultimately to your Microsoft account. You do thi s by going to settings Emil accounts add a new one and select google or gmail then you will need to log into your account and then you are done, you can go onto the home screen
 and go onto the gmail shortcut. You may need to wait a few minutes, it it doesn't work you need to go onto the calender app and under setting and there should be an option the about what to sync. Like I said I only managed to do this on my windows phone (
 535 ) but you may be able to adapt this idea to any other program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Thanks, Adam</p>

    <title>Problem with exfat internal drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kmc009  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with exfat internal drive</h2>
                    <p>I formatted an internal drive as exfat. Problem comes up when I restart my desktop. The screen either sticks on a black screen with spinning dots after windows logo or sticks on a black screen with cursor after login for couple of minutes. It will be no
 problem when I chose to shutdown and boot up again. Not facing any of both situation. Only when I hit the restart buttom those problems happened. Manually remove the exfat drive also let computer restart normally. So I guess it would be something wrong with
 this format as an internal drive. The current version is Windows 10 1703 with the lastest update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks and sorry for my english.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
exFat is only for flash memory storage devices and external devices, not internal.<br />
<br />
For internal use NTFS.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

<p>Anyway the current problem I am having is regarding the Network Connection. It will often lose the network completely, this is indicated by a red X over the network icon on the taskbar. This started about a month or two ago.</p>
<p>I have tried multiple things I've found on this and other forums such as:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Flushing and renewing the IP from the command console</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Disabling auto IP assignment</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>The only things that worked to get the network back besides rebooting were:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Disabling and re enabling the adapter (Atheros 564A98) .. this no longer fixes the problem</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Disconnecting and re connecting from the network connections window in the control panel .. this no longer fixes the problem</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Running windows network diagnostics which, fingers crossed, still works to get the network back on</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really want to fix the problem though as it happens multiple times every week.</p>
<p>The laptop is rarely shut down, which may/may not contribute to the problem.</p>

<p>Yes. All up to date.</p>
<p>There are no speed/duplex options for the Atheros adapter?</p>
<p>Only for the Broadcom Netlink Ethernet (I do not use an ethernet cable)</p>

<p>Both of these sites have been returning "server not found" errors for the last week or so.</p>
<p>I've tried switching off my AV and firewall, switching PC, browser and DNS server. I'm all out of ideas. Anyone else having problems seeing these websites at the moment? Or did they just go out of business while I wasn't paying attention!?</p>

<h2>            xbox one stuck in 640x480</h2>
                    <p>So i've noticed this thread a bit and not many solutions but after a few hours of being nothing but relentless to get my Xbox to 1080p i finally solved it. <strong>(SOLUTION&nbsp;AT&nbsp;THE&nbsp;BELOW)&nbsp;</strong> I turned my xbox on and for some reason it was in 480p, but less than 12 hours ago it was perfectly fine.</p><p><br /></p><p>For me this is because i switch from my tv to my gaming monitor with HDMI&nbsp;extender cables when ever i'm just chilling on YouTube or a single player game to playing competitive with my friends. I'm not to sure if this is the actual reason or whether it's a hardware problem with my xboxs EDID. but none the less from what i could understand the only solution was either send my xbox off to microsoft to be looked at and fixed or my solution i have here.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong></p><p>Use a PC monitor and plug your xbox into it with a HDMI and then go to settings on the monitor and up the aspect ratio as much as you can to a bigge

                    <p>Our organization provides support for the blind I was thinking of the perfect mobile computer for these users. Since they don't need the screen at all, it would really just be a keyboard with a headphone jack and battery so they can use Narrator or JAWS.
 A Surface with the keyboard folded to the back would work really well for this, if it were possible to blank the screen and enable the keyboard when it's folded back. Using it normally with the kickstand is way too unstable on a lap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've disabled the touch screen, which gets us part of the way there. Is it possible to make the keyboard still active while it's flipped behind the Surface? I went to the Printers and Devices, and disabled a few parts of the "Surface Keyboard" device, but
 it didn't do what I wanted. If it's hardware, then it's impossible, but if it's software that does the disabling, it should be doable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas?</p>

<h2>            Right-click Context menu on the wrong side</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm working under Vista SP1 64x and I have a small problem in the Windows explorer. When I right click the Context menu appears on the left side of my mouse and not on the right. It is the same with with the second level of the context menu (the sub-menu do
 not appears on the side of the arrows). This happen only in the Desktop and in the explorer all the other program are responding properly.<br />
Does anybody know how I could change the side of this menu? It is quite annoying.<br />
<br />

            Hi lestons,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Vista Support forum,<br />
<br />
This sound like a problem with&nbsp;some settings with tablet features have been turned on.&nbsp; Here is the instructions on how to disable the feature:<br />
<br />
<p><span>Click Start, type
<strong>Tablet PC Settings</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Click
<strong>Tablet PC Settings</strong> link from the Start menu search results</span></p>
<p><span>In the Tablet PC Settings dialog, under
<strong>Handedness</strong>, select <strong>Left-handed</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>When this option is selected, the popup menus appear on your right-hand side, which is the default setting. One
 exception is that when there is not enough screen real estate available on the right hand side to display the popup menu, Windows displays the menu on the left hand side automatically.<br />
<br />

    <title>SP4 i5 Loss of Display&#47;Audio &#43; Clicking Noise - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> armando marquez-arroyo  say:</h3>
<h2>            SP4 i5 Loss of Display&#47;Audio &#43; Clicking Noise</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A couple weeks ago, I was watching some videos when suddenly the video and audio completely froze. I gave it a few minutes to see if it would recover, but it did not. I ended up doing a forced reboot (Power button for 30 seconds) and when I tried to
 power it back up, it energized but I receive no video or audio. I knew the machine was energized because the keyboard would illuminate, and the caps and FN keys would react to my presses. Another thing I noticed when I powered it back up was a strange clicking
 noise in the 1 quadrant of the machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I've conducted every troubleshooting step for "energized, but no video/audio" and it has resulted in the recovery of my machine. Is there any other solutions or explanations for this? Thank you for your time.</p>

            Armando,
<br />Do you even see the Surface Logo ? If you boot to the UEFI, do you see anything (settings, etc.)? <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023532/surface-how-do-i-use-the-bios-uefi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402353...</a> - I'm a little confused because you say "it has resulted in the recovery of my machine" which seems to indicate it has recovered and is working normally?
<br />
<br />If it is still in a bad state AND you see text in the UEFI, you may need to try a complete wipe and reimage (which you would need to do before an exchange if this proves to be hardware). 
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacereco...</a> and download a recovery image for your Surface. You will need a 16GB USB stick formatted FAT32. Unzip/extract the recovery zip to the formatted USB stick and then-
<br />
<br />To reset your Surface from a USB recovery drive:
<br />Step 1:	Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in (hold down the power button for 30 seconds).
<br />Step 2: 	Insert the USB recovery drive into the USB port on your Surface.
<br />Step 3:	Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the power button on your Surface.
<br />Step 4: 	When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.
<br />Step 5:	When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.
<br />Step 6: 	Select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset your PC.
<br />	If prompted for a recovery key, select Skip this drive at the bottom of the screen.
<br />Step 7: 	Select the target operating system you wish to reset. This refers to the current operating system installed on your Surface.
<br />Step 8:	Select Yes, repartition the drives, and on the next page, select Next.
<br />Step 9: 	Choose Just remove my files.
<br />Step 10:	Select Reset.
<br />	Surface restarts and the Surface logo displays while the reset process continues (this can take a while).
<br />
<br />If this does not work, you need an exchange. If you are in the US, you should go to the closest physical retail Microsoft Store <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/all-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations...</a> - outside the US, contact support <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/...</a>.

<br />That is not good news. You need an exchange. This really seems to be a hardware issue. I wish I had a magic wand for cases like this, but sadly, I don't. You will need to go to a store or phone support (links above).

<p>Same issue here too guys. Was a very grumpy ten minutes in my house. Mine is working now though. It had the orange light on the power brick. Turning the console on would turn the light white, there would be a beep and the the light would go back to orange.
</p>
<p>I unplugged everything and tried another plug in my house and it turned on and stayed on. Moved it back and it's fine now. Not very scientific but try unplugging and moving rooms. Worked for me.</p>

<p>I played my xbox first day and it worked great but then the next morning it didn't even turn on, well I think I figured out a problem, I moved my xbox onto a different tv and it worked, so I had an idea that it might been a problem with connecting my xbox
 with the tv so I went to the tv one guide an reset my settings and then went back to the original tv I first played it and it worked!! so if your having similar problems I suggest you, Move your xbox to a different tv, if it turns on then reset your settings
 on the "tv and one guide" and then you should be good to go back to your original tv. Hope this solves a lot of people's issues....by the way I never experienced any yellow light issues so I am not aware of that problem</p>

<p>Hi guys, worked perfect last night, then just a few minutes a go I pressed on ON the controller and nothing, the power brick has nothing either, but, when I plug it in and out, it goes orange just on the brick for a second then fades to nothing at all. The
 console has absolutely no reaction at all. Any advice?</p>

<h3> dom gambogi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Reset Failure Due to Attempting Windows 7 Installation</h2>
                    <p>Here is my problem and what my PC is:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Dell Optiplex 390</span></p>
<p>Core i5 2400</p>
<p>4GB RAM</p>
<p>500GB HDD 7200RPM WD Blue</p>
<p>GeForce GTX 1050 2gb</p>
<p>TP-Link N600 Wi-Fi card</p>
<p>BIOS version is A11</p>
<p>Insignia 400w PSU</p>
<p>note: this PC was purchased refurbished about 8 months ago, and I threw in some parts to make it somewhat gaming-worthy...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the Windows 7 ISO, 64 bit Ultimate, and used Microsoft's ISO2USB/DVD tool to extract and burn the iso to my USB drive, which is 16gb.</p>
<p>I turn off my PC, count to 5, then turn it back on. As the Dell logo appears, I press F12 to enter the Boot Menu. I select my Removable USB Device, and the screen says "Windows is Loading Files". The installer starts, I choose English, select Custom installation,
 select the install location to my C: drive, which has 184 GB free. I select yes, and the install begins. After about 5-10 minutes, an error box pops up, saying "Windows could not install required files. Make sure all files required for install are available,
 and reset the installer. I reset, same error. Going to some threads, I deduce that my memory is bad. I got rid of one of my 2GB sticks, since I pulled it from my dad's old PC. To be careful, I ran the memory diagnostic, and Windows says no errors were found.
 Assuming my copy of Windows 10, which I upgraded from Windows 7, was corrupted or had a virus, I downloaded Malwarebytes. I run it, and 19 threats were found, with most residing in the registry as a "Potentially Unwanted Program". So I quarantine the threats,
 back up some of my files that I wanted to keep, then reset the computer through settings in Windows 10. I leave my PC, and come back to it after around 20 mins. It was at 28% completed, so I left again. I come back, and my PC was off. I turn it on, go through
 the Dell logo, then nothing. A black screen, with no Windows logo or loading icon. Worried, I shut the PC off, and reboot. Same result, so I turned of my PC AND the power supply. Turn it on, and same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>TL;DR basically I don't know if I slaughtered my HDD, did something to my RAM, or my motherboard is dead. Please help me, because this was a $450 investment.</p>

<p>We appreciate the information that you've provided. To troubleshoot this issue, we'd like to confirm if you still have the Windows 7 product key. If yes, we recommend that you re-download the
<strong>Windows</strong> <strong>7</strong> <strong>ISO</strong> and use the <strong>
USB/DVD Download Tool </strong><span>to create a copy on a USB</span>. This tool is needed to create a bootable media to install Windows 7. To download the ISO and the Windows USB/DVD tool, you can refer to these articles below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download Windows 7 Disc Images (ISO Files)</a></strong>.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/windows-usb-dvd-download-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows USB/DVD Download Tool</a></strong>.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Afterwards, kindly perform a clean installation of Windows 7 but this time you'll need to format the partition. If in case that you still have important files that you need to keep or secure, we suggest that you back it up first. Kindly refer in this article:
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10/how-to-manually-backup-and-restore-your-files/45859954-c9c3-403f-b997-e96c8e001963">How to manually backup and restore your files</a></strong> for steps on how to back up your files.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you receive Windows Update error 80072ee2, the Windows Update servers might be experiencing an unusually high number of requests for updates. Close Windows Update, wait 10 to 15 minutes, and then run Windows Update again.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to perform Windows Update Troubleshooter and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>In the search tab type <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>and hit enter.</li><li>Select <strong>System and security</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Windows update troubleshooter </strong>and follow the onscreen instructions.</li></ul>

<h2>            Intel 6 series &#47;C200 Series Chipset family USB enhanced host controller 1C26, Win 10 x64 driver with wireless mouse &#38; keyboard fail</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a repeated problem with&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Intel 6 series /C200 Series Chipset family USB enhanced host controller 1C26,</strong> Win 10 x64 driver with wireless mouse &amp; keyboard, fails on cold start up or restart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 64 bit (all latest updates as of, 29. April 219), latest BIOS and other drivers too.<br />
<strong>On a cold start up Wireless mouse and wireless keyboard are dead, or at least no connection to the system. Every time!.</strong></p>
<p>The receivers for the Keyboard and mouse are connected to rear USB sockets - directly off of the motherboard (Asus P8Z68-V)</p>
<p>Problem started some months ago (after working fine for years). Very probably after one of the Win 10 Updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have uninstalled it in device manager and deleted drivers too, and auto-reinstalled&nbsp; with (I presume Latest) driver. But same problem as before on cold and restart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Error status:</strong></p>
<p>In device manager status reads:</p>
<p>"Cannot start. Code (10)</p>
<p>Insufficient resources to complete API."</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Temporary fix:&nbsp;</strong></span>works every time but annoying.</p>
<p>1. Connect a wired mouse to front USB panel on the PC</p>
<p>2. Open device manager - using wired mouse.</p>
<p>3 Scroll down to "Intel 6 series /C200 Series Chipset family USB enhanced host controller 1C26" where warning sign is visible.</p>
<p>4. Right click "Disable" and confirm "Yes"&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Right click on the Disabled, and select enable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>and then devices work again. This has to be done after every restart/power Up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting and reinstalling did not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a permanent fix for this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.cv</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The
<strong>code 10</strong> is mainly related to hardware and device driver issues or to compatibility issues between the hardware drivers and the additional software installed on Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>Typically, the device's hardware key contains a "FailReasonString" value, and the value string displays an error message defined by the hardware
 manufacturer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest to try the following troubleshooting methods and let us know how it goes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Reinstall drivers</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Right click on
<strong>Start</strong> button (Windows logo) and select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Right click on the device with the yellow marking and select
<strong><span>Update Driver</span></strong><span>.</span></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select
<strong><span>Browse My Computer for Driver Software</span></strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click
<strong><span>Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer</span></strong><span>.</span></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Make sure that Show compatible hardware is selected.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select the driver which looks similar to:
<strong><span>Intel(R) 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller<em>
</em></span></strong><span>and click <strong>
Next</strong> to install the driver.</span></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Reboot the computer and check the status.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Install the latest chipset drivers.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Download the latest chipset drivers from the system manufacturer’s support site.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<strong><span>Uninstall</span></strong><span>.</span></span></p>

<span>manufacturer’s support site.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3: Delete upper and lower filters.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>One of the possible causes of this error could be the driver filter that was either installed by a third party software or was corrupted. In this
 case we can try removing upper and lower filters in the registry.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> The registry is a database in Windows that contains important information about system
 hardware, installed programs and settings, and profiles of each of the user accounts on the computer. Windows often reads and updates the information in the registry.</span></p>
<p><span>Normally, software programs make registry changes automatically. You should not make unnecessary changes to the registry. Changing registry files incorrectly can cause Windows to stop working
 or make Windows report the wrong information.</span></p>
<p><span>Please take a backup of the registry. Follow the steps given in the article below:</span></p>
