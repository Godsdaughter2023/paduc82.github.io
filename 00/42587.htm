<h2>            WIndows 10 - Second monitor keeps resetting &#47; refreshing</h2>
                    <p>I am having an issue with Windows 10. I have a second monitor connected to my laptop via HDMI. Every 10 minutes or so, the second monitor will refresh / reset, as if I have unplugged the HDMI cable and then plugged it back in. The screen goes black for a
 couple of seconds, and all open programs get shifted back onto my laptop screen. I have updated Windows and the video drivers but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you installed the newest video drivers? If not download them from the manufacturers website - the Windows 7/8 &nbsp;drivers may or may not work.<br />
<br />
Since Windows 8 has not been released yet not all drivers are going to work with it. Some drivers are very specific about the operating system version, so you might have to wait until they release Windows 8 drivers.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
I suggest you to try installing them in compatibility mode.<br />
<br />
<strong>Troubleshoot Compatibility</strong><br />
<br />
This can help with some (but not all) programs/drivers:<br />
1) Uninstall the program if it's already installed. Then when you install/reinstall it instead of double clicking on the install file right click it and select "Troubleshoot Compatibility"<br />
2) Then click "Try Recommended Settings" and in the next windows click "Start the Program" to install it.<br />
3) After it installs see if it works correctly. Please note - some programs may not be able to run in Windows 8.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Yes I said I have installed the newest video drivers. Also this is an issue with Windows 10 not Windows 8.

            <p>Hi&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/2bb53da3-e23c-4938-9024-9ad36fb397f5" title="Michael6882563">Michael6882563</a>,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently started seeing this issue, in the same circumstances. It's only just started to do it, so my theory is that a windows update has caused the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It'll do it no matter what else i'm doing on the machine, with full screen video or a game running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running a machine with a NVidia Geforce 860m and Intel HD 4600.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just about to go through the driver update process on both to see if that clears it up, but I'm not confident.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rakesh - Windows 8 has been out for a while, and has been replaced twice... Windows 10 was released 29th July 2015, so your statement can't be a typo... can you clarify what on earth you are going on about? I'm guessing you've copied and pasted the wrong
 information?<br />

<h2>            F11 stopped working as it had been - 3&#47;9&#47;19</h2>
                    <p>One minute, F11 eliminated all toolbars at the top of my screen and the Taskbar at the bottom, to give me a

</p><p>The "after" image is normally what I see when I drag my cursor to the top of the screen. When I do that, these two lines slide down from the top of the screen, but they are no longer auto-hiding. Instead, they're always visible.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me get it back to where they are, once again, auto-hiding and only show up when I drag my cursor to the top of the screen? Thank you.

            Hello Tammy,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I request you to set up the Family Safety again.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<div>There are two ways to do this. The easiest way is to enter the complete file path:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>On the Start screen, type C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Parental Controls and press Enter.
<div>If you’d rather open each folder individually, follow these steps:</div>
<div>a. Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap Search.<br />
&nbsp;(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click Search.)
<div>b. Make sure that Apps is selected, and then enter Computer in the Search box.</div>
<div>c. Tap or click to open the Computer app. Open C:, open the Program Data folder, open the Microsoft folder, open the Windows folder, and open the Parental Controls folder.
<div>3) Delete all contents of the Parental Controls folder. This will delete any corrupt files. Your settings will be downloaded again from familysafety.microsoft.com the next time you sign in.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note that it’s possible for the files to become corrupted again. If you experience more problems with Family Safety time limits and PC activity reporting, just follow these steps again.</div>

                    <p>My new XBOX 1S has been working fine and then one day last week I turned it on and the microphone in the upper right screen had a line through it, and my new headset no longer works. It's not the headset b/c it works fine in my Switch. It's something in
 the XBOX settings, but I can't figure out how to get rid of that line through the microphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried restarting it. I've tried resetting it. I've tried unplugging it. I've tried all the things for many hours after much googling. It seems many many other people have this problem too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately it appears that Microsoft has introduced an incompatibility between controllers and consoles that is impacting the 3.5mm headset jack on some Microsoft controllers. It is unknown how long it will take before they release an update
 to fix that issue.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft stereo headset adapter is one possible workaround. Another workaround to the issue is the Microsoft Chatpad. While this may be a bit more expensive than the headset adapter, it has some added benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>keyboard for easier typing in messages etc, can also be used as mappable controls for games like War Thunder</li><li>Built-in volume, game/party chat mixer adjustment</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I know it's annoying to have to spend more money to fix an issue that is beyond your control however this will likely be the fastest way that you can resolve the issue at this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Any devices not working? Could be a phantom. It also could be your Card Reader - if<br />
so follow the tip below and then re-install the drivers (check with card reader maker or<br />
System Maker). Check all of your devices to see if any are not working.</p>

<br />
=================================<br />
<br />
In Device Manager - Right Click the device - UNINSTALL - when complete REBOOT.<br />
<br />
Don't be surprised if the device disappears or driver may try to load.<br />
<br />
If a device is still not working check the device maker, system maker, or motherboard<br />
maker for the latest drivers. If a PC remove ALL power and reseat the cards, memory,<br />
and cables - actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Clean out the dust bunnies<br />
and make&nbsp;sure the vents are clear.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Help&#33; Norton Update Has Led To The Blue Screen Of Death</h2>
                    &lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;
<p><span>Hi All,</span></p>
<p><span>Hopefully someone out there can help. I was using my Dell laptop tonight, and an Norton Internet Security 2009 window popped up stating that I needed to reboot
 to receive the latest definitions update. The option "Restart Now (Recommended)" was highlighted, and I wasn't working on anything important, so I hit okay to let NIS do its thing.</span></p>
<p><span>Well, when the laptop went to start back up again after the NIS update, I got the Blue Screen Of Death (BSOD). I'm sure you've seen it before, but it said:</span></p>
<p><span>A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>If this is the first time you've seen this stop error screen, restart your computer. If this screen appears again, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>Check for viruses on your computer. Remove any newly installed hard drives or hard drive controllers. Check your hard drive to make sure it is properly configured
 and terminated. Run CHKDSK /F to check for hard drive corruption, and then restart your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Technical information:</span></p>
<p><span>*** STOP: 0x0000007B (0xF78EB524, 0xC000000E, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since this was the first time I had seen the screen, I restarted my computer. When I did so, I got the usual Dell screen, but it was followed by a black screen
 that said "We apologize for the inconvience, but Windows did not start successfully. A recent hardware or software change might have caused this." Five startup options were listed (3 Safe Mode options, a Last Known Good Configuration Option, and a Start Windows
 Normally option). I have tried all five, and with each of them, it proceeds to the Windows XP startup screen for a few seconds, and then on to the BSOD. When I shut down and try to start up, the cycle only repeats itself.</span></p>
<p><span>When I'm fast enough, I can hit F12 before the black screen appears, and get to the Boot Menu. I ran the onboard diagnostics (included the very thorough diagostic
 tool from Dell) and everything checks out perfectly (Memory, Hard Drive, etc.). On another occasion, I popped in my Windows XP system disc that came with the laptop and booted form that. When I got to the setup menu, I selected the Recovery Console option
 by pressing R. I was able to get to the command prompt, where I didn't know what to do, so I ran CHKDSK. That found an error and fixed it, but still no change in the startup problem. I there a way I can boot Windows using the system disc so that I can backup
 my files (without reinstalling Windows and losing everything)?</span></p>
<p><span>So I need some help! To say that I am frustrated is a HUGE understatement. Everything was working great until this NIS update hit. In fact, this is the first
 time I've ever had any problem like this! What has Norton done to my laptop?</span></p>
<p><span>I currently have nothing attached to my laptop whatsoever (except for the power adapter). I haven't installed any new hardware (ever), nor have I installed any
 new software recently. I've looked through the boards a bit, and it seems that others have had BSOD problems with NIS, but I didn't see anything recently that looked like my issue. I also noticed that Norton has been rolling out a new update to NIS over the
 course of the month. Could this be the update that has crippled my computer? Again, it doesn't look like others have had this problem, but it seems like a no-brainer that NIS is the culprit here given how this happened.</span></p>
<p><span>I now have a completely unusable laptop that I need to get working again. What should I do next? Is there a way I can remove the NIS update? Do I have to do
 something with the registry? My immediate concern is also to get all of my files off of my laptop and onto a USB drive or the like. Please be specific/detailed, because as I wrote, I have not come across the BSOD before, and have little experience with this
 type of problem, removing updates, or working with the registry.</span></p>
<p><span>Any assistance is much appreciated! Thanks in advance for your help.</span></p>

            Malkeleah, thank you for your reply. I've been to Symantec website and forums, but it appears that I'm alone on this. I will contact Symantec via phone, but I am not sure that they will be able to do anything, if they even admit that the problem is theirs.
 Perhaps I'm too skeptical.
<div><br />
<div>Is there ANYTHING else that I can do to fix this issue myself? Since I can get to the command prompt, is there a way to edit the registry and remove this update? (Disclaimer: I've never worked with the registry before and don't even know if what I just
 typed makes any sense. I just know that the registry is related to changes in your system.) I saw another thread topic where the solution was the removal of a Microsoft update, using the registry I believe.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, can I disable Norton Internet Security service from the command prompt? Perhaps this will help?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sorry if the reason you asked me to contact Symantec is because they'll help me do these things or something like them. I appreciate your help.</div>

            Try Last Known Good Configuration from the same diagnostic menu as Safe Mode (F8). If you can get in, uninstall Norton and install something better. Apparently one of their low-level drivers isn't playing nicely with your system. I recommend NOD32 (commercial),
 or Avast, Avira or MS Security Essentials if you want a free program. Use the built-in Windows Firewall instead of something provided with a "suite".

            No. Antivirus programs use low-level drivers. Contact Symantec and see if this is a known issue and what to do about it.<br />

<p>Hi Rossonero1,</p>
<p>I had NIS 2009, and decided to do a free upgrade to NIS 2010 before my subscription expires in a month. The NIS 2010 downloaded to PC, then it removed the NIS 2009 and tried to install the NIS 2010. But, on restart, I got the same blue screen as you did,
 over and over again. I finally uninstalled the NIS 2010 and things are ok now, except I have no anti-virus installed. I have emailed norton asking them for a free download on NIS 2009 which was working before the attempt to upgrade. I have a dell dimension
 PC. I feel it is a issue with the NIS 2010 software, not the PC.</p>
<p>Just FYI.</p>

<p>Ok, so you might want to do a manual system restore:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.icompute.info/System_restore_from_xp_cd.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.icompute.info/System_restore_from_xp_cd.htm</a></p>
<p>I'd suggest using not the most recent snapshot folder but at least two dates before it. Please read the article carefully though.</p>
<p>Then if you get back into Windows I suggest you download and run the 
Norton Removal Tool and then phone them and complain.</p>

            The reason I am writing is because the same thing has happened to me only I am unable to find a place to type chkdsk/f.&nbsp; All this took place after I downloaded the norton antivirus through comcast. I have no idea how to access my files. Shouldn't someone
 be held responsible? It is the exact same&nbsp; screen word for word. I see that this happened over a year ago did you ever get the problem fixed? Please can anybody out there help me I need my lap top. I am not computer literate so I would need a detailed word

            In my opinion, there is no advice in this thread that will solve your issue, but it is most likely solvable.<br />
<br />
You see... there is no happy ending here.&nbsp; There is too much if, too much try, too much maybe.<br />
<br />
If you find a thread that is old and does not have a happy ending where the original poster (the OP) replies back that some suggestion actually worked, I would assume that none of the ideas worked.&nbsp; If anything worked, they usually come back and report they
 are happy to report a successful resolution to their issue.<br />
<br />
What does "one of their low-level drivers isn't playing nicely with your system" mean and how do you figure it out and fix it?&nbsp; I could say that for every problem ("sounds like a driver issue"), but it does not help.<br />
<br />
You could face south, stand on your left foot, reach over the top of your head with your right hand, grasp you left ear between your thumb and forefinger, hold your breath for 10 seconds and have the same result - nothing good to solve your issue.<br />
<br />
I would start a new thread just for your "new" issue.<br />
<br />
Start a new thread (as a <span style="font-weight: bold">new</span> question) and when you do, be sure to include this information:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
What do you see that you don't think you should be seeing?<br />
<br />
What do you not see that you think you should be seeing?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />

            Hi Fred, 
<br />
<br />Desktop-PT87RL7 is just the computer name of your RCA Cambio, that is assigned automatically by the manufacturers, the general form is Desktop - and a random string of characters, it has nothing to do with forex market pt87
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time, you will not need a Product Key, activation will be automatic and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p><span><span>Hi&nbsp; Alnagar_eg2004,<br />
<br />
</span></span><span><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Windows 7 Answers Forums.<br />
<br />
I have few steps which might help you.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 1</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try to install the software in compatibility mode and check if it works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To do this, follow the steps given below.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>How to install a software&nbsp; in the Compatibility mode:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;1. Right click on the downloaded&nbsp;the file and then select properties.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click the Compatibility tab.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Put a check mark against “Run this program in compatibility mode for”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Then select “Windows XP (Service pack 2) from the drop down menu.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Click on Ok and then try to install the software.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>If it doesn’t help, perform&nbsp; clean boot and then install the software. Clean boot will start Windows Vista by using a minimal
 set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The following link has steps showing how to perform clean boot: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1)&nbsp;Perform clean boot (Check the link for Performing clean boot)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2)&nbsp;Enable half of the services</span></span></p>

<h3> mom243  say:</h3>
<h2>            New computer can&#39;t get past &#34;Create an Account&#34; screen</h2>
                    <p>Brand new convertible style touch screen/laptop. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Powered it on and the Windows set up began, &nbsp;went through maybe 4 screens of options and then the sign in option with email address came up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I log into Microsoft account and get an error saying "oops, something went wrong. We can't add your Microsoft account to this device right now, but it's okay. We'll help you set up, and you can sign in later in Settings." &nbsp; so I click "Next". which
 brings up the "Create an account for this PC" &nbsp;Entered the info, tried it with and without setting up a password (I don't want one, but tried it anyway), it does nothing (can't advance to next screen) &nbsp;it simply give me this again. &nbsp;"something went wrong".
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>That's it, I'm stuck.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I found quite a few forums with this issue, none seemed to apply or work for me. &nbsp;This seemed to be a summary of everything:&nbsp;<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install/something-went-wrong-error/d258d115-be0b-4bf7-a519-aef1c55a8524?rtAction=1455217662101<br />
</p>
<p>and most of the options don't apply since it's a new computer and not an upgrade, I have no disk (it has no disk drive), can't access the control panel, can't figure out how to get into safe mode, No battery to take out, tried it plugged in and unplugged,
 disconnected from internet, connected, etc...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any Suggestions? &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

            I'd guess this computer has never been maintained. Naturally you should delete files in the Temp directory. You can use
<a href="http://www.ccleaner.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">CCleaner</a> to do the cleanup, but only use the cleanup tools. Do not use the registry tools.<br />

<h2>            0x80070424</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am have been having multiple problems with my PC lately and I was wondering if someone could help me. I keep getting a notification about needing to update my PC but when I go to update my PC I get this</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/836c4c8a-fcae-4dba-a7f6-f4aacaa42a4c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/836c4c8a-fcae-4dba-a7f6-f4aacaa42a4c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;So I cannot update my PC at all. I have tried all the recommendations from the main page to sort the update error known as&nbsp; "0x80070424" but none of them seem to work. My mate gave me and Xbox controller today to use to play games on my computer but when
 I went to download the software to use the controller it was unable to download due to this same error</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0cf6dcf-4a52-4022-b492-d0908c016f2c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0cf6dcf-4a52-4022-b492-d0908c016f2c?upload=true" /></a></p>
&nbsp;Could someone help me please and tell me how to fix this problem?

            Hi Jarrod, version 1809 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete and should resolve any other issues you are having . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<h2>            How to activate windows 10 after upgrade from 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just upgrade my windows 8.1 preinstalled on my laptop. Windows were with valid key and activated but now new windows 10 ask for activation. When I tried to activate manualy i got an&nbsp;Error code: 0xC004F012 - the call has failed because the value for
 the input key was not found? Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you upgrade or did you freshly installed Windows 10? If you upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 8 then there should be no reason for you to be asked about a key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you freshly installed Windows 10 then you do need a Windows 10 key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know what you did.</p>
