<p>Hello Tyler8806,</p>
<p>Just uninstall from the old computer and install on the new computer, and do an automatic online activation.</p>
<p>Two points of information:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Office 2010 Professional Academic's licensing terms allow you to install and activate the product on two of your computers simultaneously:&nbsp; your main computer and your portable computer.&nbsp; So it's almost a certainty that&nbsp;there is no requirement to uninstall
 from the old computer, unless of course you just want to, or unless you&nbsp;are planning to scrap/retire/sell/donate/etc the old computer.&nbsp; In that case uninstall from the old computer.</p>
<p>It's very unlikely, but you may encounter a message along the lines of "you have activated this copy of Office too many times" when you try to do an automatic online activation of the second installation.&nbsp; If that happens, just rerun the Activation Wizard
 and choose the option for a Telpehonic Activation.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; If the new computer comes with the Office 2010 Single Image preinstalled (most new computers do), you can simply enter your Office 2010 product key into the Setup Wizard to complete installation and activation.</p>

    <title>How to lock layers when using MS Front Page editor-- - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cgmdrx77  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to lock layers when using MS Front Page editor--</h2>
                    <p>I have become so addicted to MS Front Page for creating websites for myself, I can't function well without it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The one factor that has bugged me for 10 years using MS Fr. Pg. is that every time I have ever tried to use layers in my headers, the layers later show that they each have usually slid off position laterally. It has forced me to do all my headers without using
 layers. And that has prevented me from creating the designs I want to use and make look better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that the more advanced other design editors seem to have a means of locking the layers in place to avoid all this. I have even tried the "control + 2" old method I discovered. Because of the expense, I can't buy Dreamweaver or others and know that
 a lot of you have used Front Page and know if there even is a locking method available in that program for the layers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would truly appreciate your help. I use Win. 8.1, Win. 7, and Win. XP at different times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Curt</p>

            <p>Kathy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that quite a few have the same problem as I do with layers. Thank you for your help and links also.</p>
<p>The big problem is in my headers. I notice that if I want a photo in the background that I have to add a layer box on the header edges, insert the photo of image in that---but then when I add text in a new layer on top of that it slides sideways when it
 gets online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to have solved the problem---instead of adding the text in a new layer, I use a table box and insert my text inside that, even the fancy text with shadows. I've tried to get the boxes to slide as I move the original big table and they now stay in
 place---When I move the big table like for a webpage I'm creating to left and then to the right side of the big table everything stays in place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice that using the fancy text creator software that You have to cut and paste it inside the table where you want it placed and to be stationary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I've said all that right and in sequence but my mind isn't as sharp as it used to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for updating us. To have a better view on the specified service, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If its labelled as DisplayLinkManager.exe</li><li>If IE issues persist after disabling the specified service.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If what you're referring at is the DisplayLinkManager.exe service/process in Windows 7, this executable file is a software component of DisplayLink Core Software that is developed by DisplayLink. It is not essential to the Windows 7 operating system although
 it is required to access DisplayLink software settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file can be removed/uninstalled via the Control Panel's Programs and Features section. To know more about this process, click on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/2601726" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using any product/software or program coming from DisplayLink and uninstalling/reinstalling isn't an option for you, we'd recommend uninstalling the last Windows Update via Control Panel since system restore didn't suffice. To do this, you can
 perform the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on Start, and then search Control Panel.</li><li>Click on Programs, and then select Programs and Features.</li><li>Click on Installed Updates, and then locate/click the last update that is installed on your device. Preferably on the day or a week before you've experienced your concern.</li><li>Click on Uninstall.</li><li>Once done, check if you'll still experience your concern.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to an update on your concern.</p>

<p>Hi Jason,<br />
<br />
We have received the requested information in PM.<br />
<br />
According to the detailed NDR, your onmicrosoft domain may be blocked. I have reported it to the relevant team. They will email you and help you to delist the onmicrosoft domain from the back end. It will take several working days. Thanks for your patience.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

</blockquote>
<br />
Not exactly certain what you are asking.&nbsp; But in the example, I would propose to be able to enter the inquiry value (in this case, '5114535'), and the function would yield '05/11/2011' (A1272), because the inquiry value falls between '5114468' (D1272) and 5114708
 (E1272).

            Hi dannyboy1<br />
<br />
A small number of new models come with no preset security code - you have to enter one the first time you use any feature that requires it.<br />
<br />
The security code helps to protect your phone against unauthorised use. You can create and change a code, and set the phone to request it. To create a security code, select Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Security &gt; Access codes, and follow the instructions on the display.<br />

            Thanks Scoobyman have done that as suggested but the phone can still be switched off and on without requesting a code from me. Do I need a PIN as I can't find mine and what's the difference between a PIN and a security code?<br />
Cheers

            yes the security code protects the handset or memory depending on what you set it to do. Activating the handset will not allow anyone to put their sim in the fone, although nowadays it costs £5 from a market trader to simply unlock it to all networks which
 at this time is a grey area in the law.<br />
<br />
The pin protects your sim use. If you set this noone will be able to use your sim The handset will turn on but will not allow access to your info on the sim or let them use your credit or contract tarrif minutes/texts.

            Depending on your network provider (SIM provider), but most likely your default PIN-code is 1234. You can change it in the security settings on the phone.

            Hi Samantha,<br />
<br />
<p>1. Which antivirus application are you using?</p>
2. From which website are you downloading iTunes?<br />
<br />
<p>
<b>Here are some troubleshooting steps&nbsp;that you can try to resolve this problem.</b></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Open Internet Explorer in no add-ons mode check if you can download.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>To start Internet Explorer without add-ons:</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
</span><strong><span>Start</span></strong><span> button, and select
</span><strong><span>All Programs</span></strong><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
</span><strong><span>Accessories</span></strong><span>, and select
</span><strong><span>System Tools.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
</span><strong><span>Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</span></strong><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If the browser appears to be working properly in Internet Explorer (No Add-ons) mode, you might want to use Add-on Manager to disable all add-ons and turn on only
 when you need them. This will allow you to figure out which add-on is causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>If the above method does not work, go to next method.</span></p>
<br />
<p>
<b><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 2: Reset Internet Explorer settings and check the functionality.</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>NOTE:</span></b><span> The Reset Internet Explorer

<h2>            How to set the default locale of a specific document</h2>
                    
<p>I am very confused by the way Office manage languages, keyboards, and default locales. It links them to the current language, keyboard, and default locale I am using in my system, which really make no sense. Whatever is my system, in fact, I may need to
 write a document in a specific language by using specific standards to format dates, time, currency and so forth.</p>
<p>I am using an English platform on an Italian computer with Italian keyboard. By using that keyboard I can write a document in English, Italian, or French. When I write a document in a specific language, I also uses the formats for dates, currency, and so
 forth consistent with that language. The language and locale MUST be linked to the document, not the system. However Office works in a way really bad for international writers.</p>
<p>For example, if I write a document in English and I wish to set a decimal tab, such a tab should be able to recognize the dot as a decimal separator, since in a document that I have to send to USA I must use dots as decimal separators. However my system
 uses comma as a decimal separator and it should NOT change, since all the other applications must use commas for decimal separators. There is no way to set a locale for the document anyway. I have to temporary change the decimal separator in Windows, which
 is a mess also because I could write at the same time several documents in different languages.</p>
<p>It looks like Office designers do not really understand the needs of people that are able to write in different languages. It should be possible to localize every paragraph in a document, because I could also use different languages and formats in the SAME
 document. However, even if a paragraph is marked as "English US", locales are not honored. From this point of view Office is really primitive.</p>

<div>Regardless of where the setting is applied, date formats are </div>

I am not telling you to link language and locale: they are two different things. What I say is that every document should be associated to a language and to a locale, with the possibility to associate a language and a locale to pieces of text too. Just like
 the lang attribute of XML, for instance, that can be applied even to a single word. For example, let us suppose that I am writing an English document to be sent to a friend in USA. In such a document I have to include a list of items with a price in euro.
 Of course, I wish to align all prices by using a decimal tab. Since I am using an Italian locale in my system, the decimal tab correctly aligns all prices only if I use a comma as a decimal separator. However that will confuse my friend, because comma is used
 as a thousand separator in USA. So, if I format prices as my friend is expecting, that is, by using a dot to separate decimals, prices are no more aligned. I have no way to tell Word that such prices have to be formatted according to USA locale.<br />

Well, in Word there are really tons of features and honestly I use only a limited part of them. I am a writer and what I expect from a word processor are robust basic feature. The problem is that Word is also an American product and international support is
 not usually considered basic by American companies. I understand that, it is not a criticism. However Word is from many years a very popular international product too, so I expect that MS will consider international feature a must, not just an add-on. It is
 not only a matter of language or format. A lot of spellers and thesaurus of languages different from English are quite poor and contains various mistakes; setting the language of a piece of text is not a one click operation; the language bar has to be built
 by user; there is no way to select all texts written in a certain language (associated by user, of course, nobody pretends AI); often Word changes the language of a word based on keyboard settings. For years I fought against the link between language and keyboard.
 Changing a keyboard makes no sense because the symbols on physical keys cannot be changed accordingly. I do not need to change a keyboard to write in another language.<br />

Well, in my last novel (written in Italian language), I have dialogs in English, French, German, Czech, Arabic, Urdu, Ancient Greek and Latin. In addition, I often quote what people said in their own original language in my essays. If I write in English or
 French I use different currency or number format according to who is the expected reader. And I ma not the only one. Today Europe is not really a federation like USA, but very similar (no more borders, customs, same currency, and so forth) BUT we have different
 languages. So we are used to speak two or three languages and know a little bit&nbsp; words and typical phrases of other ones. We live in a more international environment, so mixing is the rule, not the exception. :-)<br />

<div>Hi Dario,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let me say, in case I wasn't clear in the first place, that this is not an </div>
<div>area in which I think Microsoft excel. They are getting better, but very </div>
<div>slowly, and, as I said, you do have a point about decimal points and commas.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>However, although I don't know what the best result would be, I cannot </div>
<div>really see that attaching a locale to a block of text is the way to do it. </div>
<div>Would it not be much easier if Word simply ignored the locale and aligned </div>
<div>numbers of all sorts in all circumstances - or perhaps formatting could be </div>
<div>applied to numbers so that Word could use whatever delimiters it was told in</div>
<div>any individual case. As I said, I don't know - I'm just offering opinion - </div>
<div>and I do know there are many different scenarios.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Although you titled the thread asking how to set the locale of a document, </div>
<div>and began by saying you were confused, you seem to be aware of how Word </div>
<div>works and are complaining - probably reasonably - about what Word does. So </div>
<div>for clarity, the only available settings for language are "detect language </div>
<div>automatically" and "switch keyboard to match language", neither or which you</div>
<div>probably want, and there are no (Word) settings for locale.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>OK - I've just had a play with some of this and it is, as you have said, </div>
<div>confusing. Set to English (UK), decimal points align; set to Italian </div>
<div>(Italy), commas align, but set to French (France), the two seem to align </div>
<div>together. If my quick tests are anything to go by, if you set your formats </div>
<div>as French you can get what you want! Not that I would suggest for a moment </div>
<div>that this is, in any way, a sensible solution.</div>

<div>&gt; Hi Dario,</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; Let me say, in case I wasn't clear in the first place, that this is not an</div>
<div>&gt; area in which I think Microsoft excel. They are getting better, but very</div>
<div>&gt; slowly, and, as I said, you do have a point about decimal points and </div>
<div>&gt; commas.</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; However, although I don't know what the best result would be, I cannot</div>
<div>&gt; really see that attaching a locale to a block of text is the way to do it.</div>
<div>&gt; Would it not be much easier if Word simply ignored the locale and aligned</div>
<div>&gt; numbers of all sorts in all circumstances - or perhaps formatting could be</div>
<div>&gt; applied to numbers so that Word could use whatever delimiters it was told </div>
<div>&gt; in</div>
<div>&gt; any individual case. As I said, I don't know - I'm just offering opinion -</div>
<div>&gt; and I do know there are many different scenarios.</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; Although you titled the thread asking how to set the locale of a document,</div>
<div>&gt; and began by saying you were confused, you seem to be aware of how Word</div>
<div>&gt; works and are complaining - probably reasonably - about what Word does. So</div>
<div>&gt; for clarity, the only available settings for language are "detect language</div>
<div>&gt; automatically" and "switch keyboard to match language", neither or which </div>
<div>&gt; you</div>
<div>&gt; probably want, and there are no (Word) settings for locale.</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; OK - I've just had a play with some of this and it is, as you have said,</div>
<div>&gt; confusing. Set to English (UK), decimal points align; set to Italian</div>
<div>&gt; (Italy), commas align, but set to French (France), the two seem to align</div>
<div>&gt; together. If my quick tests are anything to go by, if you set your formats</div>
<div>&gt; as French you can get what you want! Not that I would suggest for a moment</div>
<div>&gt; that this is, in any way, a sensible solution.</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; "Dario de Judicibus" wrote in message</div>
<div>&gt; news:adb9074e-c89a-4270-90df-bc49eeeeab5e...</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; Tony, www.WordArticles.com said:</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; Think about the consequences for a moment - if you were the reader of a</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; document that contained text in both UK English and US English (a common</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; occurence that causes many problems as it is) and had to check the</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; language</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; in order to be able to interpret any dates correctly, would you feel your</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; world had improved?</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; I am not telling you to link language and locale: they are two different</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; things. What I say is that every document should be associated to a</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; language and to a locale, with the possibility to associate a language </div>
<div>&gt;&gt; and</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; a locale to pieces of text too. Just like the lang attribute of XML, for</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; instance, that can be applied even to a single word. For example, let us</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; suppose that I am writing an English document to be sent to a friend in</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; USA. In such a document I have to include a list of items with a price in</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; euro. Of course, I wish to align all prices by using a decimal tab. Since</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; I am using an Italian locale in my system, the decimal tab correctly</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; aligns all prices only if I use a comma as a decimal separator. However</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; that will confuse my friend, because comma is used as a thousand </div>
<div>&gt;&gt; separator</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; in USA. So, if I format prices as my friend is expecting, that is, by</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; using a dot to separate decimals, prices are no more aligned. I have no</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; way to tell Word that such prices have to be formatted according to USA</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; locale.</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; In my (again, very humble) opinion, Word already takes too much notice of</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; locale, and your point about decimal points and commas is well made. I do</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; agree that Word is not at its best when dealing with documents containing</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; mixed languages - or even single language documents that use locale</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; sensitive formats for a locale other than that of the user.</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; Well, in Word there are really tons of features and honestly I use only a</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; limited part of them. I am a writer and what I expect from a word</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; processor are robust basic feature. The problem is that Word is also an</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; American product and international support is not usually considered </div>
<div>&gt;&gt; basic</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; by American companies. I understand that, it is not a criticism. However</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; Word is from many years a very popular international product too, so I</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; expect that MS will consider international feature a must, not just an</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; add-on. It is not only a matter of language or format. A lot of spellers</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; and thesaurus of languages different from English are quite poor and</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; contains various mistakes; setting the language of a piece of text is not</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; a one click operation; the language bar has to be built by user; there is</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; no way to select all texts written in a certain language (associated by</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; user, of course, nobody pretends AI); often Word changes the language of </div>
<div>&gt;&gt; a</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; word based on keyboard settings. For years I fought against the link</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; between language and keyboard. Changing a keyboard makes no sense because</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; the symbols on physical keys cannot be changed accordingly. I do not need</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; to change a keyboard to write in another language.</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; Do you really write single documents that use multiple locale settings? I</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; find that a pretty unusual requirement.</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; Well, in my last novel (written in Italian language), I have dialogs in</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; English, French, German, Czech, Arabic, Urdu, Ancient Greek and Latin. In</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; addition, I often quote what people said in their own original language </div>
<div>&gt;&gt; in</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; my essays. If I write in English or French I use different currency or</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; number format according to who is the expected reader. And I ma not the</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; only one. Today Europe is not really a federation like USA, but very</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; similar (no more borders, customs, same currency, and so forth) BUT we</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; have different languages. So we are used to speak two or three languages</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; and know a little bit words and typical phrases of other ones. We live in</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; a more international environment, so mixing is the rule, not the</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; exception. :-)</div>

<h2>            Wiki app templates</h2>
                    
<p>hi,<br />
<br />
we've just begun implementing a new wiki site for our business and i've got some questions about it.<br />
<br />
1. we would like to edit the template when creating a new site so that we can add a custom header and such.<br />
i've open the site in sharepoint designer 2013 but i do not know what file to edit, may you tell me which files that is the template for a wiki-app?<br />
<br />
2. when you add a new site:<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=2b8bf0aa-72be-4ca8-9597-fc0d0041ce68" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d2b8bf0aa-72be-4ca8-9597-fc0d0041ce68" /></a><br />
it creates a new site in the rootfolder instead of the wiki-folder,<br />
but if we add a new site with the "add a site" function the sites is created in the wiki-folder.<br />
<br />
how do we change in what folder the new site is placed when just pressing "new".&nbsp;<br />
using the settings -&gt; add a new site is not a solution for end users.<br />
<br />
if i made myself unclear please ask me to provide more information.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Hi Simon,</p>
<p>For question 1:<br />
You can find the design files by click the gear icon &gt; Design Manager &gt; Edit Master Page/Display Templates/Page Layouts. To confirm which master page file you are using, please go to site settings &gt; master page. Then go back to SharePoint designer and search
 for the file name to locate the place of it.</p>
<p>For further questions about customization, we’d suggest you post a thread in our
<a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=sharepointcustomization&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MSDN forum</a> which is a specific channel for handling such issues.</p>
<p>For question 2:<br />
The screenshot seems to show the button for adding a new page, and from the thread, it looks like you want to add a new site. Can you double confirm which one are you looking for? Add a page or add a site?</p>
<p><br />
Regards,<br />

<p>Hi Simon,</p>
<p>If creating a new page as you described above, instead of creating a new site, the new page should be found at the page library under the wiki site:</p>
<p><a href="https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/EnterpriseWiki/Pages/Forms/AllItems.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">~/Pages/Forms/AllItems.aspx</a> [Replace ~ with your wiki site address]</p>
<p>You can check whether you can find the newly created page in the page library.</p>

<h3> chiang-shenghuang  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trying to use my School&#39;s Office365 account with my personal Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>I have had a Microsoft account for many year, which I use for logging into Windows 10 while I'm not at work. &nbsp;I also use OneDrive for that account (I have a grandfathered 25G...that's how long I've had this account!). &nbsp;Recently I acquired an Office365 account
 through my work (a university). &nbsp;So now I have a personal Microsoft account with my personal email and a separate Office365 account based on my work email.</p>
<p>I just received an email telling me that my OneDrive storage will be reduced to 5G. &nbsp;But since my Office365 account has 1 TB, I want to move all my files to the OneDrive in Office365. &nbsp;I'm really not sure how to do that. &nbsp;Specifically, I'm thinking if the
 following options might work:</p>
<p>1. Is there a way that I can "link" the Office365 account to my personal Microsoft account, although the two have different email login? &nbsp;And if I do that, will the two OneDrive accounts merge?</p>
<p>2. If the above doesn't work, I'd like to use the Office365 OneDrive to sync all my files. &nbsp;My question is, can I log into my personal Microsoft account every time I start Windows but automatically sign into my work OneDrive account for file syncing?</p>
<p>3. If neither works, in order to use my work Office365 OneDrive, do I have to sign into my work account when starting windows every time? &nbsp;That would be really strange, because now when I try to log into Office365, it always directs me back to my university
 login page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate if anyone can help me. &nbsp;Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>hi derrick,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>here the answers as below:</p>
<p>1.please note that the office 365 work or school account is created by an organization<span>’</span>s administrator to enable a member of the organization to access all microsoft cloud services such as microsoft azure, windows
 intune or office 365. an office 365 work or school account can take the form of a user<span>’</span>s organizational email address, such as
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>microsoft account, created by user for personal use, is the new name for what used to be called “windows live id”. the microsoft account is the combination of an email address and a password that a user uses to sign in to all consumer-oriented
 microsoft products and cloud services such as outlook (hotmail), messenger, onedrive, msn, windows phone or xbox live.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the two accounts belong to two different services, and the onedrive for business library and the personal onedrive can't be merged.&nbsp; that's an expected behavior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>moreover, you can use <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/get-started-with-the-onedrive-for-business-next-generation-sync-client-in-windows-615391c4-2bd3-4aae-a42a-858262e42a49?ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 for business library, you can copy the files or folders from the synced personal onedrive folder(e.g.
<i>onedrive - personal</i>) to the synced onedrive for business library folder(e.g.
<i>onedrive – organization name</i>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.yes, you still can use your personal account sign into your pc and sync your onedrive for business library with your office 365 work or school account. to do that:</p>
<p>check if your onedrive version on your windows 10 is 17.3.6381.0405. if not, install the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=248256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">new onedrive for business sync client</span></a> directly and sign into the new sync client with your office 365 work or school account once to sync all the files and folders
 from your onedrive for business library to your windows 10. after that, you can open the synced folder to view files next time.&nbsp;if you want to view the files in the broswer, you still need to log into the office 365 portal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.from your description, your school environment is using active directory federation services. in this scenario, you will be redirected to your university login page when you log into office 365. for the details, please consult
 the it department in your school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks,<br />

<h2>            E90 - browser crashes before even starting up</h2>
                    In the last week I haven't been able to start my Nokia E90's browser as it seems to crash before even starting.<br />
For this reason I can't open the option menu and clear the cache (which I suspect is the problem).<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to cleare the cache accessing an hidden folder on the phone memory from File Manager? What's the name of the hidden folder?

<h2>            Lumia 540 Hard Reset Issue</h2>
                    I have a Lumia 540 and it received some update from Microsoft a few days ago. I am fully aware of the Windows Insider Program but have not used it on the phone. After the update the phone had an interface similar to Widows 10 but with a lot of bugs. I
 thought Microsoft rolled out an official Windows 10 mobile update but that doesn't seem like the case. So I tried to hard reset my phone after update and got an even worse system without most of the necessary apps like STORE, SETTINGS, PEOPLE, PHONE. I searched
 and tried the hard reset using Power+ volume down button followed by an exclamation mark on screen, etc. At the end of the gears rolling I get a sad smiley :-( and the phone shuts down. I know it sounds ridiculous that I got a windows 10 update without the
 insider but it happened.

            Hi. ParrishNelson 
<br />My name is Kyle and I am an Independent Advisor.
<br />I would like to help you.
<br />
<br />
<br />I suggest you try to do maintenance to your web browser with which you open the Excel application online. It is possible that you are generating conflicts and do not let it work properly.
<br />
<br />in the following link it refers to compatible web browsers to open Office Online in case it is helpful:

<p>Okay, thanks for the infoz. I am using Google Chrome. I also use Google Sheets alongside Excel Online, so I couldn't guarantee there's nothing going on under the cover, but Google Sheets doesn't exhibit this strange behavior. I had a row of numbers and was
 moving down them, not noticing that they were being deleted. I hit Ctrl+Z but that didn't work, not sure why. Going to the Home tab and clicking the Undo button there a few times restored the sheets missing figures. I played around with the arrows keys on
 the sheet for a while, thinking as many do that it was a fluke that would disappear in a moment; first time this had occurred. WTH?! Every cell I moved across was erased. I rebooted my machine. Still no change. Sometime later in the day, it stopped, but I
 took no particular steps to orrect anything. Yesterday, it returned. And again today. I was surprised to not see a long list of links to folks with the same problem as mine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stranger things have happened, and I'm sure this will be resolved someday. Hopefully soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no such guide created in that name. You can search for related contents that talks about Word and its integration with Outlook. This may help you in getting a better view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
        </p>

            <p>Ignore Praveen's earlier reply - it is incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a blog post that was posted at the following address:</p>
