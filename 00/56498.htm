<h2>            Buy large amounts of gift cards.</h2>
                    <p>Hi Xbox.<br />I'm an Italian guy who is about to get into the game by opening up a company.<br />I would like to specialize in selling gift cards. Most importantly, there are the Xboxlive Gift Cards.<br />I would like more information on prices. The funds I do not miss so my purchases would always be for tens of thousands<br />of euro but I would like to understand a little better that margins are there.<br />Specifically, I'm interested in small cuts in both EUR and $.<br />Something like this:</p>

<p>Xbox Gift Card 5 Eur<br />Xbox Gift Card 10 Eur<br />Xbox Gift Card 15 Eur<br />Xbox Gift Card 20 Eur<br />Xbox Gift Card 25 Eur<br />Xbox Gift Card 50 Eur</p>

<p>Xbox Gift Card 5 $<br />Xbox Gift Card 10 $<br />Xbox Gift Card 15 $<br />Xbox Gift Card 20 $<br />Xbox Gift Card 25 $<br />Xbox Gift Card 50 $</p>

<p>Waiting for your kind reply I wish you a good day.</p>

<h2>            Buying an Xbox One in Canada and taking it to Australia</h2>
                    
<p>I am interested in buying an Xbox One, however, I am moving to Australia for school in the new year what issues can i expect to encounter? Will i still be able to purchase games in Canada and Australia? I have read online that the Xbox One games are not
 region locked but the DVD/Blu-ray discs are due to international requirements. Also any information regarding my Xbox 360 would be appreciated as well.</p>

<p>From my understanding, the console isn't region locked except for Bluray/DVD movies -

<p>Do you know what would happen if i just decided to bring my Xbox 360 over? I am assuming that games and DVDs purchased in Australia would not work but would my Canadian games still work and would i still be able to connect to Xbox live and play online with
 my friends?</p>

<h2>            How do I remove the &#34;upgrade to Windows 10&#34; promtp&#47;update&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<div>
<p>I have been through Windows 10 "upgrade" hell and I'm not sure it's over.<span>
</span></p>
<p>Like an idiot, I signed up for the free "upgrade" for my Dell Inspiron 3646. Last Sunday the prompt came and I installed it. Everything was fine until I turned my pc back on Monday morning and there was a blue screen that said:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Recovery. Your pc/device&nbsp; needs to be repaired. The boot configuration data file doesn't contain valid information for an operating system. File:\BCD...&nbsp; Error code:0cx0000098.... you'll need to use recovery tools.... If you don't have any instillation
 media (like disc or usb device), contact your pc administrator or pc/device manufacturer....<br />
Press Esc for UEFI Firmware settings".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had saved a system image to an external hard drive before updating,&nbsp; but saw no way to get it off the exhd onto the computer. After an hour on the phone with Dell and running a hardware diagnostic test, the hardware checked out fine. So Dell said it was
 software problem, but I'm not covered for software support so they wanted $129 to help me and I don't have that to spend.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>So I thought, "Windows 10 did this. Microsoft is going to fix it". After waiting two hours for a call back, the first tech support specialist had me turn my machine off and on 3 times. Then 4 times. Then 5 times. Surprisingly(?) nothing changed. So I had
 to wait until the next day to be contacted by a level 2 tech. He told me to borrow a computer so I could have it by mine when he called back the NEXT day.
<br />
When he had go to some special link and download a fresh copy of Windows 8.1 (my pc's original OS) and try to install it. This involved several phone calls and lots of waiting. Then, when it was almost finished installing, BAM! The blue recovery screen came
 back. The tech said, "it has to be a hardware issue". I asked if we could try again, but he said, "no, it won't work. You'll have to take in to be repaired".<br />
So, we hang up and I decide to try again anyway. Only this time instead of clicking "Install" I clicked an option at the bottom that said "Repair", AND IT WORKED. BOOM! Windows 8.1 was back on my pc and everything *seemed* fine. Me and my son were surfing the
 web, I was reinstalling programs that I had lost, everything *seemed* to be okay.
</p>
<p>I didn't turn it off that night. The next night (last night) I went to turn it off and noticed it said "update and restart", so I clicked it.<br />
It restarted and said "installing update 1 of 114". It got to about 34 or 35 of 114 and guess what happened.
</p>
<p>Blue recovery screen. NOOOOOOOOOO! I tried to reinstall/repair it again and no luck. I just turned it off and went to bed.<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
This morning I tried again. Only I looked at more options, that curiously would only appear with the flash drive containing the new Windows 8.1 on it, inserted in the pc. Whatever. So I start rummaging through the options and low and behold one is to restore
 using a system image from a usb device. EUREKA!!!!<br />
I chose it, followed the directions and THWACK! I have all my stuff on my working computer again! Happy ending, right?</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
I'm sitting there basking in the glow of figuring all this out on my own with zero technical skills (though ticked that neither Dell or MS told me how to do what I did even though both were aware of my saved system image) when I noticed something glowing in
 the taskbar. What's this?&nbsp; Windows update?<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
I click and almost poop my pants when I saw "your Windows 10 upgrade is downloading..."<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
What?! NOOOOOOOO!!!! Go away! I do not want it!!!!<br />
So I click cancel and it stops. I close it and within seconds it comes back on. I stop it again,&nbsp; but leave it open and search "stop Windows 10 upgrade".<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
I find an article and followed the directions to remove update <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3035583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB3035583</a> which I was led to believe is where the promt comes from. Then Windows wants to keep searching for updates. I just closed it. I wnet to check to make sure it wasn't still checking for updates in the background and up pops the prompt to install
 the Windows 10 "upgrade" again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not going to upgrade this pc to Windows 10. EVER. How do I get rid of the prompt/update and stop it from trying to download and upgrade on it's own? PLEASE help.</p>

            I already did that. It's not an update. It's the windows 10 upgrade that signed up for and went through everything I described above. Now, every time I turn my computer on, it starts downloading the upgrade and getting ready to install it and I DO NOT
 want it anymore, and I want it to stop trying to upgrade this pc. How do I cancel the upgrade once it is at this stage of automatically trying to upgrade? I want this to stop now. I want it off my pc completely.

            <p>I also am unable to install ANY Windows 8.1 updates because even if I check those updates and uncheck the Windows 10 "Upgrade", when I click "install" the first thing it tries to do is the Windows 10 upgrade!!!
</p>
<p>I have called and the wait times are over 2 hours. I have tried to chat with the helpdesk and it has me waiting for hours. I tried to schedule a call back and there were NO TIMES available. This is very frustrating!</p>

            I feel your pain!&nbsp; I am so aggravated.&nbsp; I let it install once, then removed it, and then it upgraded all by itself.&nbsp; I hate Microsoft now and am considering Apple.&nbsp; XP WAS THE BEST THEY HAD,&nbsp; and now they have really made a mess for everybody and a bad
 reputation for Microsoft.&nbsp; Good luck - I am trying to uninstsall it now.&nbsp; I HATE WINDOWS 10!

            <p>I tried so many ways to get rid of windows 10 I messed up the whole computer. I have 8.1 and they don't have the restore function that you can put a date way back in. I also wasn't getting the 8.1 updates After I thought I got rid of 10 and the only thing
 that was doing any updates was the comp. was trying to reinstall 10. I could only restore back to Aug. 15th and I did the Win. 10 the first day it came out. SOMEHOW, it's gone, maybe. I made my updates so ask me before installing anything and so far, it's
 just sitting there and I finally got rid of the wretched box that kept wanting to reinstall. I can NOT get the works off my programs but 8.1 seems to be working ok now. What a pain in the butt and don't think I'll ever upgrade again. So glad I only did it
 on this pc!!!!!</p>

            Yep, I can't even install any of the 20+ Windows 8.1 updates I have waiting because even if I uncheck the Wondows 10 upgrade or try to hide it, as soon as I click to install updates the first thing it does is try to download and install Windows freakin
 10! Let me know if you can figure out how to get it off completely as I have yet to get ahlod of a tech on the phone or chat!&nbsp;

            <p>I'm not sure what I did. I know in all the reading it said delete KB3035583 and gwx.exe. I couldn't even find either one of them!!!&nbsp; Then someone said it was like a Trojan so I downloaded some program that scans and then you have to buy, that's when everything
 froze up and went berserk. I couldn't even get that off for 2 days out of my programs!!!&nbsp; Then the next day, 8.1 started working although 10 is still lurking and waiting for me to download by mistake. Since I changed my updates to ask my permission first I
 was able to do just the 8.1 updates and not have 10 start up again. I just can't find it to get rid of it and I suppose it's using up a lot of space on this pc.</p>

            <p>Bob and all the rest of us:</p>
<p>I have had a similar issue. My Asus machine upgraded from 8.1 to 10. Then I couldn't get some browsers or any of my security programs to access the net. A level 2 tech told me (after looking at the 10 files) that some didn't install and some were corrupt;
 this is why I couldn't get programs to access the net and when in safe-mode w/ networking I couldn't get out but a command prompt could ping and tracert by ip and name. He said revert to 8.1; that came back files not found. Tue the 11th an update pushed through
 that destabilized the system to the point that a cold boot takes 8.5+ hrs. Once done, the start button doesn't work and clicking an icon may open after a minute or two. Or it could black screen the system and reboot the desktop. I tried Hiren's and Yumi rescue
 tools. The system refuses&nbsp; to boot if Windows10 is not available as a boot option. Even Asus is stumped. Microsoft is in denial about the whole thing. They have even gone so far as to close out all my tickets. Thu the 13th they forced an update out for NVidia
 gpus that so screwed up the drivers that some people had to manually uninstall, reinstall the gpus then go to NVidia's website and download and manually install the drivers. Others weren't so lucky, the update fried their cards completely. A buddy that test
 games lost $4000 worth of cards because of Windows 10. Microsoft is going to be buying a new 8.1 machine for me.
</p>
<p>Bob and the rest, if you don't have a copy of 7, 8, or 8.1 get one. Then reformat the drive in question and do a CLEAN install of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck to one and all</p>

<p>
</p><p>1- open up the settings app</p>

<p>3- find the microsoft store and click on advanced options</p>
<p>4- now select the reset option and close the settings</p>

    <title>Battlefield 3 Multiplayer pass problem. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> megamario95  say:</h3>
<h2>            Battlefield 3 Multiplayer pass problem.</h2>
                    
<p>My Xbox 360 arcade had stopped being able to read most of my games after having it for 3 years. whether the disc is in the tray, or stops reading them in the middle of start up.</p>
<p>After this I purchased another pre owned arcade and was told to do a licence transfer from my old one in order to share DLC and such between other profiles. This Xbox soon failed and i was forced to return it after moving all my files back to my old Xbox.
 On returning the arcade i purchased an Xbox 360 slim. I started up Battlefield 3 after having to move all of the 10G of content over as well as my profile. Once the updates went through i tried to play multi-player and the game refused to let me play and requested
 me to purchase another online pass.</p>
<p>I don't want to spend more money because of this problem and i was wondering if it was possible to get my online pass from my previous Xbox.</p>
<p>I have been told that the pass is not a physical portion of memory in a memory unit and can`t be moved.</p>

<p>Hey Mario,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can re-download the Online Pass for BF3 from your Account's Download History. &nbsp;To get to your Download History, on your console go to Settings&gt;Account&gt;Download History. &nbsp;You may have to scroll down a bit to get the the Online Pass. &nbsp;It will actually
 be listed as "Online Pass". &nbsp;Once you select it, it will show that it is the Battlefied 3 Online Pass, and you can Download Again.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Give those steps a shot, and let us know if they help. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

<p>A few things to consider. One: Do you have an AMD processor?</p>
<p>If so, check with your computer manufacturer for driver updates before trying to install the Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Do you have an ARM Processor? Select the right download from the Microsoft Update catalog and install that on your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, three: Try selecting the download update file to your desktop, opening and installing it from THERE option as this often solves these problems. It worked on mine so I'm not just babbling, here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I didn't have to use it for the January Update you want but did for a later one.</p>

<p>Your subscription only cover landline calls to Turkey. The number you called in Turkey is a mobile number, therefore it is your Skype Credit that has been charged. There is no problem with your Skype To Go. You just called a phone number that is not covered
 by your Unlimited World subscription.</p>

    <title>Restore OEM Recovery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fredericklessing  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restore OEM Recovery</h2>
                    <p>OK,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So got this Asus X202e with Windows 8. Decided I want to install Windows 10 Tech Preview, but do not want to lose my original OEM recovery. What I did was just to format the OS partition and leave all the other partitions (Recovery, System etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, I have network issues with Windows 10 and my Shift keys is not working, both of which had no problems in Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So wanting to restore to OEM, I started the Asus and pressed F9, Advanced, Reset - Got the message saying that the recovery partition is missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installed EaseUS Partition manager, checked the recovery and other default partition is still there just not active. Googled all day! Found many posts on using EaseUS and normal Disk Management to shrink and create and merge all sorts of partitions etc and
 reagentc.exe but all to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please tell me or help me find a way to recover my Asus. No I do not have recovery discs and cannot order them. Also no Windows installation media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mentioning that, would it work if I just reinstalled with a friends Windows 8? Meaning would it read the license code off the BIOS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be appreciated! Thank You!<br />
</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Fred</p>

            <p>You need to create a Windows 8.1 Bootable USB for a UEFI BIOS as instructed here:</p>

</p>
<p>The main difficulty you will have is determining your Edition. The correct Edition will accept your key and take you to the license agreement screen. The wrong Edition will ask for your product key. You may have to do a bit of trial and error to get the
 correct Edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your old recovery partition is useless so you might aswell delete all old partitions on the drive.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Visual C&#43;&#43; runtime error on startup</h2>

<p>I have uninstalled everything related to the ATI catalyst software and drivers and I have tried to start with all startup options disabled.&nbsp; The errors persist despite these steps taken.</p>

<p>Hello CatManDEW63,</p>
<p>I suggest you try to run the System File checker and see if it finds any corrupt system files.</p>
<p><span>Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click 'Run as Administrator'<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: </span><strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong><span><br />
<br />
This will check for any integrity violations and fix any corrupted operating system files.<br />
<br />
Restart your system<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Now run chkdsk:<br />
1. Disable any security software before attempting to upgrade or do a clean install.<br />
2. Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications)<br />
3. Disconnect any external devices before installing.<br />
4. Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click 'Run as Administrator'<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</span></p>
<p>Please reply back and let us know if this helps.'</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t install a game due to apnstub.exe</h2>
                    Hi, I recently upgraded my computer from XP to Windows 7 Ultimate. I purchased a game yesterday and have not been able to install it due to the following message that keeps popping up, I would like to solve this problem ASAP. Thank you. This is the message
 that pops up:&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"C:\Users\Jason\AppData\Local\Temp\ApnStub.exe is not a valid Win32 application."
<div>

</div>
<div>Thank you for your time.</div>

            <p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your issue on Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Which game are you trying to install?</p>
<p>2. Do you have the game on a CD/DVD?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ApnStub.exe file belongs to product AskStub Application and were developed by company Ask. com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check if the game is compatible with the Windows 7 operating system.<br />
Refer:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win7/CompatCenter/Home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win7/CompatCenter/Home</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are a few methods which you can follow to resolve the issue:<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Try to install the game in clean boot mode.</p>
<p>Refer:</p>
<p>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>Note: Refer "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot"</p>
<p>under more information to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
I would suggest you to copy all the contents from the disc to the hard drive and then start the setup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>Can't open .EXE files in Windows 7 or Windows Vista</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2688326" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2688326</a><br />
To do so: Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection,
 back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/back-up-the-registry</a><br />
How to back up and restore the registry in Windows<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also refer:</p>
<p>Error message when you install a Microsoft game or mapping program</p>

<p>Important: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this resolves the issue. </p>

            Hi Mahesh, Thank you for your time.. I did check to see if the game is compatible with Windows 7 and it indeed is. I also tried those 3 method's that you have provided and none of them have worked. Also, if you can tell me how to get rid of clean boot
 mode when i start up my computer that would be great. As for i would like it to boot normally now since it did not resolve my issue. I would also like my issue resolved. Thank you for helping me out and I hope we can find a solution to this.
<div><br />
<div>Also, the name of the game is Spongebob Squarepants 3-D.. Also known as Spongebob Squarepants: The Movie.. and I do not have a disc to install the game.. I purchased it online from Shockwave.<br />

            Hi Jason,<br />
Thank you for replying.
<div>Sorry to know that previous methods suggested did not help.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In order to&nbsp;put the computer back to normal mode&nbsp;refer "<em>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</em>" under more information to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>This issue can also be caused by any of the below possibilities.</p>
<div>1. File is corrupt, bad, or missing.</div>
<div>2. File is a virus, worm, or other malware file. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Resolution:</div>
<div>
<p><strong><em>File is corrupt, bad, or missing</em></strong></p>
<p>If the file or program you're attempting to run is corrupt or missing, Windows will be unable to execute the file properly and sometimes generate this error message.</p>
<p>If you downloaded this file and verified it is complete and compatible with your version of Windows delete the file and try downloading and running it again. It's possible during the download that the file became corrupted.</p>
<p>Finally, if the second download does not work, try downloading the file from a different webpage. It is possible that the person or company maintaining the website mistakenly uploaded a corrupt version of the file you're attempting download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>File is a virus, worm, or other malware file</em></strong></p>
<p>This error can be generated by a file that is a&nbsp;virus, worm,&nbsp;Trojan, or other&nbsp;&nbsp;malware file. Often, this will be caused because the virus scanner installed in the computer will not allow the file to be installed or run. Try scanning the file to verify it
 is not a virus or infected.</p>
<p>Refer:</p>
<p>Microsoft Safety Scanner</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><b>Note:</b> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Thanks</font></p>

            Hi Mahesh, Thank you for replying and doing your best to help me out. I have set my computer back to normal boot mode. Thank you for those steps.
<div><br />
<div>As for, installing the game.. That issue has still not been resolved I scanned the file with my anti-virus programs and did not get any detections. I also ran a full Microsoft Safety Scanner, It detected 2 items as malware (The Spongebob game was not one
 of them) But I still removed the 2 items that it detected and I tried to install my game again. However, I still got the same error message with the apnstub.exe and my issue is not resolved.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I apologize for taking up your time with this, But I would just really like to install my game. Thank you for all of your help. Are there any more methods I could try?</div>
<div><br />

<p>1. not enough BC games for the original is but one reason it is not done, but many are available on the Game Pass and EA Access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. It is EXTREMELY doubtful either game or version of Marvel Ultimate Alliance will be offered as a GWG for a couple of reasons. First being it is an Activision published game and to my recollection there has yet to be ANY Activision game added to this service.
 The other reason is that both versions of both games are no longer listed, pulled from the marketplace due to the license expiring. Activision would have to pay to renew the license again just to even distribute it on Live again, and I seriously doubt they
 will do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. We cannot at the moment, add it to the suggestions on uservoice. I personally hope this does not happen, the most voted games would likely be ones I already own as people tend to vote for the more popular titles. I'd rather see more obscure ones I do
 not own but interested in trying out...but as I said that is just my opinion on that subject. I'd hate to see months of COD being constantly voted (though likely not to happen, see my point 2).

<h2>            &#91;W8&#47;8.1 Mail app&#93; links are plain-text in &#34;simple&#34; e-mails.</h2>
                    <p>in e-mails without any pre-configured layout web addresses are treated as plain text, while they are recognized properly through web-mail or through the gmail app on my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is particularly annoying because i regularly receive notifications from a forum(between 10 and 25 a day) that contain links that are shown as plain text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is <strong>not</strong> the "links don't work" problem that can be fixed by deleting registry entries.</p>

<div>Did you buy a Retail copy or an OEM copy? If it's a Retail copy, no</div>
<div>problem. You can replace any hardware you want to, and even move it to</div>
<div>a completely different computer, as often a you need to or want to.</div>
<div>The only restriction is that it may not be on two computers at once.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But if it's an OEM copy, its biggest disadvantage is that its license</div>
<div>ties it permanently to the first computer it's installed on. It can</div>
<div>never legally be moved to another computer, sold, or given away</div>
<div>(except with the original computer). If the computer dies or is</div>
<div>stolen, your license dies with it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The question however is what changes to your hardware makes it a new</div>
<div>computer. Microsoft has never completely clarified this, and in fact</div>
<div>has contradicted itself on it. There are those people (here in this</div>
<div>forum, as well as elsewhere) who will tell you that changing the</div>
<div>motherboard makes it a different computer, and there are those who</div>
<div>will tell you that that's not true. It's a can of worms.</div>
