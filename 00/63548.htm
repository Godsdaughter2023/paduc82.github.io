<p>I was wondering if there is, or plans to be, API to access the Family Settings? - I'm looking to combine IoT with this, to make a physical countdown clock / indicator of screen time left.</p>
<p>

<h3> vincentconcepcion  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#40;Windows 8.1 Pro x86&#41; Bluetooth Driver is not Installing, stuck hanging at &#39;detect bluetooth device&#39;, please help</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm trying to install a Targus USB BT Adapter and it ends up hanging at the&nbsp;<em>'Detect Bluetooth Device'</em>. And despite giving some time for the driver to detect and install, nothing changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>When I plug in the adapter, windows reads it as&nbsp;<em>'USB Input Device'</em> and updating driver from there doesn't work. &nbsp;</li><li>Tried running Troubleshoot but won't detect any hardware problems.</li><li>There are no BT drivers in&nbsp;<em>Device Manager'</em>.</li><li><em>'Bluetooth Support Service Properties'</em> is running.</li><li>I tried with the provided driver from Targus, and also tried the driver download from Broadcom.</li></ul>
<p>The frustrating part is that prior to doing a clean upgrade to Windows 8 from Windows 7, I successfully installed the BT Adapter and it was in working order. &nbsp;I did a search in this site for answers but the reoccurring, 3 provided links I've come across
 don't seem to be applicable where I would uninstall and re-install the BT driver; in this case, I cannot even install the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm stumped, so any assistance is appreciated, thanks!</p>

            Thanks Anil. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I tried doing the install in compatibility mode and it did not work. &nbsp;I looked into the product and apparently for many folks with this product, the driver issue seems to be a common problem.

<h2>            Bluetooth connection problem in Windows 8.1 for Bose Soundlink Mini Speaker</h2>
                    <p>I can't connect my Bose Soundlink Mini speaker to my Lenovo A730 All-in-One Desktop PC that is running Windows 8.1.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I can successfully pair the device but am unable to get a stable connection. i.e., once it is paired, the device icon label will change to "connected" momentarily and revert to "unconnected" in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So far, the only way I've been able to get sound out of my Bose speaker is to connect the auxiliary output to the headphone jack on the PC.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've talked to both Bose and Lenovo customer support and they both suspect the problem is with the Bluetooth device driver.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I even tried installing a Bluetooth device driver&nbsp; (released on October 16th) from the Lenovo web site, but it only appeared to address some unknown issue with "hands free audio" and did not help my problem.</p>

            I had this problem after purchasing my Acer Aspire 5600U in November. My Bluetooth worked out of the box on Windows 8, able to connect to my Bose Soundlink Mini, all was good. Updated to 8.1 shortly thereafter, and the problems began as I've seen described
 here, try to pair, says it's ready, but never gets past "ready" to pair and just disconnects. I was able to solve my problem by going to Acer's website and support page and looking for updates specific to my PC, and there was an update to the Bluetooth driver.
 I installed the update, restarted PC, and all has been fine since, Bose player connected on first try, and has connected ever since, as well as all other devices.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Not sure if this will be helpful to everyone, but wanted to share what worked for me.&nbsp;</div>

            Well finally it looks like it is fixed for me anyway......I think if you persist with trial and error you will get there in the end. This is what I did.&nbsp; I went to the Dell support page and downloaded the so called fix as mentioned above. It put all the
 files in a zip folder saved to the computer then attempted to install it all. So far so good&nbsp;and then it froze the screen for an hour with me wondering what to do so I did yet another troubleshoot where it said some of the files had not downloaded properly.
 I then went into control panel and tried to delete the thing but it said I had to wait as I already had another version running.....I hit the off key the only way to get rid of the frozen screen then restarted. I went back to control panel and wiped it again
 but it took out all the wireless settings. I then re-entered my wireless key and told it to troubleshoot and fix all wireless settings. It did this without a hitch and I tried the Bose mini which immediately hooked on and stayed

<h2>            HP Laserjet 4100 on Windows 7 X64</h2>
                    I have a Laserjet 4100 I was using on Windows 7 X32 without incident. I recently installed X64 version and now I can't print at all. Windows 7 installed the driver automatically, but I also tried installing the universal print driver for 7 X64 for that
 specific printer (traditional install) and I set the port for LPT1 (there is only 1 parallel port) but also tried the default&nbsp; DOT4_001 port. When the driver first installed I successfully printed a test page, but after that it would never work. I triple checked
 the cable. Windows sees the printer, but I get a print error in the queue and it never prints. I tried running&nbsp; Mats_Run.printing from MS and it found no problems.

            Solved. For some reason, though I have only a single parallel port, it is seen as LPT3, perhaps because it is a PCI expansion card. So I had to set the port for LPT3. I had tried that post install and it didn't work, but once I selected LPT3 during install
 it worked.

                    I am using Windows 7 x64 and whenever I run certain installed programs, such as Celestia, Google Earth, and DOSbox, I get the message "The application was unable to start correctly (0xc000007b). Click OK to close the application." I think this may be due
 to my system being x64 and these programs being x86. I've attached a HijackThis log

<p>As mentioned in several links in a Google search, this error is most likely a result of a 32-bit (x86) executable trying to load a 64-bit (x64) DLL.&nbsp; You might have to adjust your PATH or copy DLLs to avoid this.&nbsp; For example, my PATH is set up to find the
 x64 version of&nbsp;d3dcompiler_46.dll (for DX11.1).&nbsp; I happen to have x86 applications that need the x86 version of this compiler (in fact, I have MSVS projects with configurations for Win32 [x86]&nbsp;and x64).&nbsp; The error dialog shows up when I launch the x86 application.&nbsp;
 In fact, the error shows up if I try to run Intel Amplifier (vtune) on an x86 configuration.</p>

<h2>            XBOX Live&#58; Laggers</h2>
                    
<p>Hi XBOX/Microsoft,</p>
<p>I've been a huge fan of Microsoft since DOS/Windows 3.11.... yeh I'm OLD.</p>
<p>What is going on with LAGGERS on XBOX Live? I recently moved to San Diego and the majority of people I end up having to play with are from Mexico. I have nothing against Mexicans but they have really poor internet connections and as a result LAG really badly.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not even a subscriber to XBOX Live but have a few 2 day passes I got with games that I've been using here and there. I planned on buying a subscription once these free passes ran out but now I don't even plan on paying for this service.</p>
<p>* I recently moved to San Diego, CA and notice lots of foreigners in my games and they are always lagging. I am originally from BOSTON, MA and never had this issue there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So here are my questions....</p>
<p><strong>1) Are you going to do anything about laggers? Perhaps a threshold for ping? put people who have similar pings in games with eachother?</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a. Do you have any plans to segregate XBOX Live gaming to individual countries? I think its a bad idea to mix developing countries with 1st world countries since developing countries have poor infrastructure and thus poor internet connections.
 Mixing the two just ruins gaming for everyone.... well maybe not for laggers!</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) Is there anything I can do to resolve the issue or is XBOX Live just going to be like this no matter what?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I notice this primarily in Battlefield 3 since thats what I enjoy playing the most.</p>

<p>Oh I must be new to this whole computer thing! I need a good connection to make XBOX Live work well???</p>
<p>LOL.</p>
<p>Did anyone read my post? My issue is primarily with people from 3rd world countries and their crappy internet.</p>
<p>I'm giving up on Microsoft all together. They used to be great but since Bill left the company its just floundered. Everything about MS sucks. From their new licensing schemes for servers, hyper-v in relation to vmware, etc. The new XBOX one is just a kick
 in the balls to everyone. Windows 8 is a ripoff of Apple. </p>
<p>Moving to Ubuntu and buying a PS4.</p>
<p>&amp; for the record Diesel is the only one who left a decent response. </p>

<h2>            When will microsoft start fixing the bugs&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I have been using skype for almost a decade now. Ever since Microsoft came out with skype for android and windows 10, it has become absolutely unreliable. The voice on my android device chops up and the call rarely connects on my windows 10 platform. Despite
 all that, it is almost impossible to find reliable help anywhere about the issues. Skype android has no settings to work on to identify hardware problems. My device works fine with other apps such as WhatsApp video calling. Will Microsoft please stop talking
 its customers for granted and fix the issues please.&nbsp;They seem to be lacking programming skills. Always behind google in coming out with products, and when they do catchup, its a joke (Look at Cortana launch event). I use Microsoft only because I have no other
 choice. Losing faith in their programming skills now.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype call quality&nbsp;depends on&nbsp;the internet connection (<em>you and the person you're calling)
</em>are using. If your calls are dropping or not connecting at all, we suggest to close other applications that might be interfering with your call such as file sharing applications, streaming audio or video, or even just having a web browser open are all
 things that can eat up bandwidth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling the Skype app on both devices? Please consider checking our FAQ regarding

                    <p>I have a computer that had a ton of viruses but removed %99.99 of them. Im still having problems with it and want to restore it to the factory settings. Ive read online that I need some disk that came with the computer when I got it but dont know where it
 is. Where can I get another disk?</p>
<p>Im not looking for how to restore to a previous point, but how to restore to the factory settings as if I just bought it.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Reinstall Windows Preinstalled On Computer</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>OEM computer manufacturers are required to provide at least one way for you to reinstall Windows if you buy a computer with Windows preinstalled - your computer should have included either a restore partition
 on your hard drive, or Windows install/restore disks. ﻿Most computer manufacturers also have a feature to make your own install disks.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If the restore partition is still there and was not removed, it will reinstall Windows. There is usually a prompt when you first start the computer telling you what key to press to start the restore﻿ -
 check your manual if you're not sure how to. Or if you have install disks - insert them, restart and boot from them to start the reinstall process.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If you restore it to factory condition, it will be like it was when you first bought it - all preinstalled programs will be installed. Anything you installed after buying it
 must be reinstalled. This will remove any personal files on the computer, back them up first.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>Contact the OEM computer manufacturer and ask them to send you an install disk for your computer - they may charge a small fee.

<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
My second request to get some sort of resolution to my problem since yesterday. &nbsp;I am unable to receive or send email since yesterday from Windows Live Mail. &nbsp;I cannot delete the messages I have received up to January 20th, and I cannot delete messages from
 the folders I do have. &nbsp;However, I am able to link to websites from the messages I have received. &nbsp;There are several error message pop ups I do receive: &nbsp;When trying to view emails in my inbox: "An unknown error has occurred, or "windows Live mail was unable
 to send the receipt" &nbsp;When trying to delete Message: "The message could not be deleted".<br />
<br />
Outgoing emails: "The message could not be sent" and "A problem has occurred. Please Try again"<br />
<br />
There is no way to save outgoing&nbsp;messages&nbsp;as a draft, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have tested through my primary web mail, email account emails that have come in since Jan 20, but that account does not have folders or previous emails I have saved to folders, my contacts, etc. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
PLEASE, What should I do? &nbsp;And, is there a real LIVE person I can contact about this? &nbsp; I've requested that I be "alerted" when someone responds to this post, but that means I have to go to my webmail account to view instead of my Windows Live Mail...&nbsp;<br />

            Since my original message two days ago:<br />
Detail step that I took TODAY: &nbsp;I tried to log onto Windows Live Email, and am unable to.<br />
I'm not able to use a different computer...Just this one computer available.<br />
The issue is affecting all senders, I'm not able to access the email<br />
There is no error message now, I'm unable to access the Windows Live Email, or any of my previously received emails including ones that pertain to financial documents, my health, etc. Or, my folders with correspondence from Friends, and family.<br />
I'm unable to send screenshots now, I cannot access the Windows Live Email.<br />
<br />
The only way I was able to retrieve your response was to sign up for HOTMail on Windows Live Messenger via my basic email address. &nbsp;This response is being sent via Hotmail by way of my earthlink email account.<br />
<br />
Basically, the ISSUE now is that I'm unable to access the Windows Live Email where all my folders with correspondence I had received prior to upgrading from Windows Vista (Windows Mail) to Windows 7 and transferring my Windows Mail to Windows Live Email.<br />

            I'm unable to get screenshots of my issue, THE ISSUE IS I CANNOT Access my Windows Live MAIL. &nbsp;I cannot get any further than my Start Menu and the tab for WINDOWS LIVE MAIL. &nbsp;I click the tab WINDOWS LIVE MAIL and it does NOTHING. &nbsp;As I wrote before, The
 problem was once I got into my WINDOWS LIVE MAIL, I could not delete incoming messages, or send any replies to messages BUT NOT I AM UNABLE TO ACCESS MY WINDOWS LIVE MAIL, If I try and go to WINDOWS LIVE...there is only HOTMAIL and when I try to SEARCH for
 WINDOWS LIVE MAIL, I will click on a finding and it DOES NOTHING. &nbsp;What else am I suppose to do, and HOW LONG will all this back and forth email take before I get some help?<br />
<br />
Let me REFRESH the issue I'm trying to resolve with my WINDOWS 7, WINDOWS LIVE MAIL. &nbsp;I CANNOT ACCESS the WINDOWS LIVE MAIL AT ALL. &nbsp;It won't let me access my emails...thousands of emails that I have in folders that were transferred from WINDOWS MAIL (when
 I had WINDOWS VISTA until early December 2011). &nbsp;There are important back up emails and folders that help me do business and pay my bills, and monitor health related issues. &nbsp;I'm not sure if ANY of that information/email folders still exist. &nbsp;WHATEVER was
 in WINDOWS LIVE MAIL until January 20th is not retrieveable through my earthlink email account or hotmail via Windows LIVE. &nbsp;Does this help, do YOU have any questions before you send me on another problem solving exercise that doesn't pertain to my "issue"?<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

I've checked your account and found out that it is working fine on our database. </span>
Can you confirm if you're accessing your account via Hotmail website or an email client installed in&nbsp;your computer? However, i<span>t's possible that the filter settings of your account are
 affecting the delivery of incoming/outgoing messages to your mailbox. You may check out the Solution Article below for instructions on how to check and modify your email settings.<br />

            Thank you for your response this morning. &nbsp;I have been using the Hotmail via the WINDOWS LIVE MESSENGER ever since I started developing problems with WINDOWS LIVE MAIL. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I do not understand what you mean about "an email client" installed in my computer.<br />
<br />
Coincidentally, I managed to access the WINDOWS LIVE MAIL about 20 minutes ago, it was download/updating? the storage, and had only emails through yesterday (1/23)...but I was able to click on the email and got the messages I had gotten before (I could read
 them, and even link to websites), and then I could not delete the messages, and then suddenly I got this message: "A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. &nbsp;Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available" and there
 was a "close program" button, and I closed the message.<br />
<br />
I tried to access the WINDOWS LIVE MAIL immediately after I closed the program, and it now just pops up the same message (above). &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I will try contacting my "domain's system" and let them know I am having problems with WINDOWS LIVE MAIL and see if there was some glitch that occurred...although, I don't think I would be able to receive or send directly from my webmail, or have access to
 hotmail if that were the case (?) <br />
<br />
I'll read the solution article you included, but I don't think that is my particular case.
<br />
<br />
Since HOTMAIL is working (now) I guess if I could only transfer ALL my folders/files from WINDOWS LIVE MAIL to HOTMAIL I'd be a happy camper again.<br />
Do you have any suggestions on how I can do that, considering I can't access WINDOWS LIVE MAIL, or send/receive from there at this point (again). &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'm also not sure, from the message that was relayed, if or <i><u>WHEN</u></i> Windows will find a solution without my prodding.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;<br />

            Hi <span>pattyflyer2012</span>,<br />
<br />
That type of error&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. &nbsp;Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available"&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;is usually caused by interference from a non- compatible antivirus program. Which antivirus are
 you running? As a minimum, email scanning in the antivirus must be turned off, although that may not be sufficient to eliminate all bad effects. If the problem persists, please uninstall your anti-virus.
<br />
<br />
With regards to your second concern about transferring your folders and files from Windows Live Mail to Windows Live Hotmail, you don't need to do that. YOu just have to configure or sync your Windows Live Hotmail to Windows Live Mail. Please refer to this&nbsp;<a href="http://windowslivehelp.com/solution.aspx?solutionid=2fed6e95-2d35-4030-a12c-9a399d5889c2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>link</strong></a>
 to know how to do it.<br />

Thanks!<br />

            Good news!&nbsp; after going back to my "domain" email server (as Ken suggested), I&nbsp;changed the spam settings, but did not eliminate the screening for spam...just on a very low setting of what is obviously spam.&nbsp; I considered that there may be some sort of
 conflict with the earthlink antivirus and that of windows, and of McAfee... (meaning, my primary antivirus program is McAfee...and earthlink seems to have its own antivirus?)&nbsp; Anyway, I was able to access WINDOWS LIVE MAIL, and delete a ton of emails that
 came in since 12/11/11!!&nbsp;&nbsp;But there's more below... <br />
<br />
I don't know how I did it, but I also located my email folders, at least some&nbsp;of&nbsp;those that weren't imported when I transferred from Windows Mail to Windows LIVE mail...geez.....<br />
<br />
This evening I cleaned up my folders, got rid of a whole bunch of emails, which I thought my be bogging down the "storage" aspect of WIndows LIVE Mail, but there are now two problems I've trying to investigate...<br />
<br />
When I tried to delete emails, I was only able to delete about 5 or 6 at a time from the Inbox, then do a permanent delete from the deleted folder, whereas the storage&nbsp;folders, I could delete indefinitely before having to permanently delete them from&nbsp;the storage
 delete folder.&nbsp; ???<br />
<br />
Is there a setting I can use to delete more&nbsp;inbox emails&nbsp;to the inbox delete folder?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Secondly, I cannot access the junk mail folder (I seem to have 3 emails trapped in there) and each time I click on the folder it restarts the WINDOWS LIVE MAIL ...if I just try to delete the contents of the junk email&nbsp;folder, it also&nbsp;restarts the windows LIVE
 MAIL.&nbsp; I think I'm finally getting a hang for this new email system, BUT, I'm terribly afraid that what happened to me last Friday is going to happen again?!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions are greatly appreciated on the items above, and in the meantime, tomorrow, I will try to contact earthlink and see how to make the webmail compatible (if it means turning off the anti-spam/anti-virus ) with Windows LIVE MAIL.<br />
<br />
<br />
...I'm getting too old for all these "surprises" and trying to understand what I'm suppose to do&nbsp; without&nbsp; immediate blow by blow instructions and input&nbsp; - I&nbsp;think it used to be called either chatline or telephone conversations???&nbsp; ...sorry, I'm tired.&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Need help recovering my Skype account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ruthw94  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need help recovering my Skype account</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday my Skype account was compromised and a spam link was sent to all contacts in my address book. Today, I was unable to access the account altogether. I have already tried going through the online verification process to change my password and regain
 access, but to no avail. I answered all the questions on the form to the best of my knowledge, so I was very perplexed when my request was deemed as not having "sufficient information to verify my identity".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should be noted that the email address associated with the Microsoft Live account from which I am currently posting is not the same as the one I used to sign up for Skype (which is no longer in use). Any help in this matter would be greatly appreciated,
 as I have already tried everything I can think of. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><span>Hello gbello,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
The components of Services for Unix have been incorporated into the operating system. With the release of Windows 2003 R2 and later operating systems you don't need to download any package, all you need is to go to Control Panel à Add / Remove Windows components
 and select the components you need.&nbsp; As you have guessed, nothing remains forever so is the name "Services for Unix".&nbsp; From Windows 2003 R2 SFU components are called differently.&nbsp; We have "MS Services for NFS", "Identity Management of Unix" and "Subsystem
 for Unix-based Application".<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t boot A required device isn&#39;t connected or can&#39;t be installed</h2>
                    <p>I would greatly appreciate any assistance with this. I understand that this is a surprisingly common topic. I have already spent a day reading the other posts with no results. I have a copy of windows 10 on a USB and have followed the suggested steps for
 a repair with no change. It is a Windows 10 pro system upgraded from Windows 8.1 pro. The system has been running fine but wasn't used for abut 2 weeks over Christmas.&nbsp;After the break it&nbsp;started fine first time but was then left asleep for about another week.
 Shortly after this I restarted it and&nbsp;it came up with the statement in the title and error OXC000000e. The system has a primary drive which is an SSD. It looks to me as though the problem is that the SSD is no longer visible to the system. The equipment is
 all brand new so I don't think it is hardware.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the manufacturers screen when you turn on the machine, there should be an option to F2, Del, ESC, or something, to enter BIOS...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look through the various sections for SATA and\or BOOT for the SSD, and whether it is listed as a boot device...</p>

    <title>Set microsoft language once and for all - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skummert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Set microsoft language once and for all</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I've been having this problem quite a lot, with most microsoft related services</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in the weather app for example, the whole app is in english except for the maps tab (powered by bing maps) in which all information is in dutch. In other apps as well some information is in dutch especially when signing in for the first time and having
 to accept terms and conditions</p>
<p>
</p><p>And in the web, only in microsoft web pages when the open automatically (like when clicking a link for support or help from an app), everything is in dutch too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally the process when connecting my microsoft account to windows 10 for the first time was also completely in dutch without options to change it)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I live in belgium and everything related to computers and web is always in dutch by default but in most cases I can change it, but in case of microsoft stuff, it will stay in dutch no matter what, even though the app language is set to english, the system
 is in english, and last time I checked on the web, my microsoft account is in english too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it might be some language setting that I'm forgetting somewhere and it has to have something to do with my location (otherwise it wouldn't be specifically always dutch) but don't really know where to look.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi skummert, </p>
<p>I&nbsp;do have&nbsp;the same trouble with Bing Maps.&nbsp;My language automatically changes to Japanese characters, as I do live in Japan.
</p>
<p>Same as in your case, my PC settings and my Windows Live profile are all set to Germany. But still Bing Maps displays the japanese characters.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">There is a workaround for this language problem.</span>
</p>
<p>You need to load your local country Bing&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&gt;&nbsp; http://bing.be&nbsp; , instead of bing.com</p>
<p>That will set your language to the desired language. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also there is an URL Parameter http://www.bing.com/<strong>?cc=be </strong>for Belgium</p>
<p>This works well for me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Domo,</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In response to your query, do let us know what are the options you get when you right click on the file and select "open with".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of the programs are able to open that file, you will need to look for third party applications that supports that particular extension. Also, for photo editor, you can go to the store and look for any available photo editor programs.
</p>

<p>Hi Lauren,</p>
<p>Some audio and video file formats are not supported in Windows Movie Maker and cannot be imported. However, if you have a video or audio file that is not supported, you may be able to use a non-Microsoft video editing program to convert the file into a format
 that Windows Movie Maker supports, and then import the resulting audio or video file into Windows Movie Maker. Some files also require you to install a codec before you can use the files in Windows Movie Maker.</p>
<p>You can import files with the following file name extensions into Windows Movie Maker to use in your project:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Video files: .asf, .avi, dvr-ms, .m1v, .mp2, .mp2v, .mpe, .mpeg, .mpg, .mpv2, .wm, and .wmv<br />
•&nbsp;Audio files: .aif, .aifc, .aiff, .asf, .au, .mp2, .mp3, .mpa, .snd, .wav, and .wma<br />
•&nbsp;Picture files: .bmp, .dib, .emf, .gif, .jfif, .jpe, .jpeg, .jpg, .png, .tif, .tiff, and .wmf</p>
<p>If you want to import a file into Windows Movie Maker that has a different extension from the ones listed above, in the file type list, choose All Files. Windows Movie Maker can import most file types, but not all file types will work when you try to use
 them to make a movie.</p>
