<h2>            Revert Back to Previous Version of Windows 10 After Problematic Install of Version 1803&#63;</h2>
                    My computer took a Windows 10 update over the weekend.&nbsp; The sihost.exe system warning message appears after booting up.&nbsp; Files stored on my desktop before the update appear on tje desktop now, but most other functionality is no longer available.&nbsp; I would
 like to revert back to the state prior to the upgrade, but have not found a method by which to acomplish this.

            First sorry for the troubles.
<br />Many many users are experiencing Windows update issues since the Spring update.
<br />
<br />Go to start - settings - update and security - recovery.
<br />Select to go back to previous build.

<br />
<br />Once you go back then below is a link on how to stop the update for awhile.
<br />Use that after you rollback.

            I would recommend that you should not only rollback from 1803 to 1709 but also defer it from happening as there seem to be issues. Try to install this after a month or two when more cum packs are released stabilizing 1803 further. (Roll back can be done only if you were upgraded during last 10 days i.e. you are within 10 days roll back window)
<br />
<br />A. Roll Back - Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; Under Go back to previous version of Windows 10, Get Started &gt; Follow onscreen directions
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work - Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options - Revert to previous version of Windows

            Tried the "Go back to the previous version" selection In the Advanced Recovery Evironment - the system message tells me "we ran into a problem and wont be able to take you back to the previous version of windows".&nbsp; Given that response, is a reinstall of
 the 1803 update possible (I no longer have wifi function after the update)

            Hi Doug, 
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous version of Windows       
        </p>

            At this point, I think it would be prudent to go back to 1709. My biggest roadblock is that I am currently stuck with 1803 that has very few functioning features.&nbsp; I attempted to go back to the previous version using advanced options, but the system ran
 into problems and could not do that.&nbsp; I also tried to find a restore point, but none were available.

            First you will need to force your machine to get into the recovery screen.
<br />To do this boot up and wait for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle, when you see that press and hold power button to shut down.
<br />Boot up again and do the same thing by waiting for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle then shut down, power up for the 3rd time and you should get repair screen.
<br />Let it run.
<br />You will then get a screen with the Automatic Repair, select the Advanced Options.
<br />
<br />Select to go back to previous build.
<br />see if you can do that.

            <p><span>Hi Guilford, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The Microsoft Compatibility Center which checks the compatibility of a program or a device in Windows 10 has been removed. So, you would have to contact the program/device support team to check it's compatibility with Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also like to let you know that most programs created for earlier versions of Windows will work in this version of Windows, but some older programs might run poorly or not at all. However, you can fix this issue by installing it in Compatibility mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To install the program in Compatibility mode, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Right click</strong></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> on the setup file of the program and select
<strong>Properties</strong></span></li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong>Compatibility Tab</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Place a check mark next to <strong>
Run this program in Compatibility mode </strong>and select the operating system accordingly from the drop down list</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Let the program to install and then check the functionality.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps you. Let us know if you need further assistance. We'll be glad to assist you.</span></p>

    <title>Win 7-64x fails to recognize external USB hard drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> refusenik  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 7-64x fails to recognize external USB hard drive</h2>
                    
<p>64-bit Win 7 has never recognized USB drives and memory devices properly. At first this was a driver issue (despite MicroSoft assertions to the contrary, Win 7-64x didn't have an adequate&nbsp;one) that was solved by installing the driver from a powered USB hub
 (proves the prior parenthetical).&nbsp;Win 7 no longer reliably&nbsp;recognizes these devices. On the rare occasions the&nbsp;Win 7&nbsp;recognizes a USB device is there, it demands that the device be formatted before it can be accessed.</p>
<p>This is nonsense; these devices are already formatted and can be accessed with other OS's,&nbsp;both MS and Mac on other computers. The Mac OS on a 6-year old powerbook gives virtually instant access to the whole drive immediately on connection; other PC's take
 slightly longer.</p>
<p>Win 7 does beep when these devices are connected or disconnected, and they are associated with&nbsp;(and correctly identified under)&nbsp;the icon for "safely remove USB device" in the system tray.</p>
<p>The particular hard drive I'm having the most&nbsp;problems with is a year-old Seagate FreeAgent Go drive, 320 Gb. MicroSoft only recently listed this as a "compatible" device.</p>
<p>Turning off the power management features did not help.</p>
<p>Any assistance in getting Win 7 to recognize USB drives and memory devices would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestions, Tom. They're not fruitful, though. Seagate has no separate, downloadable&nbsp;usb drivers -- their site says their drives&nbsp;use the native Win 7 usb drivers. The software you linked to is for Seagate Manager, their&nbsp;software&nbsp;for handling
 backup and such. (I have the current versiion installed.)&nbsp;So going back to a prior restore point to install non-existent driver&nbsp;software really isn't a sensible option, nor is individually&nbsp;tracking through a couple of hundred Windows updates to see which one
 it was which disabled access to my usb devices.</p>
<p>What I've done is updated the chipset software. That at least got me to the point where I get a code 43 error for the hub and memory devices. The stock MicroSoft suggestion of uninstalling all of the usb drivers and rebooting to reinstall them didn't work
 after that. One major flaw in MicroSoft's suggestion is that my mouse and keyboard die when I uninstall the hub to which they're connected!</p>
<p>So I'm still looking for a solution. Thanks again, Tom, and thanks in advance for any help anyone can give me.</p>

<p>Ken, your posting is particularly unhelpful, as I was plainly referring to my computer and not Win 7 in general. However, all you have to do is search the MicroSoft website to&nbsp;find&nbsp;(literally) thousands of unresolved&nbsp;USB issues with Windows in general, and
 many deal with Win 7 in particular. Please note that I said "unresolved," and please note that many users are finding this problem after&nbsp;a month or two of Windows updates. The fact that a well-known&nbsp;recommended fix was to temporarily install the driver from
 a powered&nbsp;USB hub, and the fact that this fix worked for a short time, conclusively demonstrate that Win 7 had and continues to have&nbsp;USB driver issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I neither know nor care what a "Microsoft MVP" is,&nbsp; nor do I know whether your description of your experience is accurate. What I do know is that on my computer (and that of many, many&nbsp;other MicroSoft customers) Windows has never recognized USB drives and
 memory devices properly -- or *ceases to recognize them when&nbsp;a supposedly routine update of Windows&nbsp;is installed* --&nbsp;and none of the suggested fixes has worked more than temporarily, and always poorly at that.</p>
<p>At present, my computer's response to installation of USB memory devices is erratic -- sometimes Win 7 tells me the device needs to be formatted, sometimes it tells me the device has no files on it, and sometimes Windows Explorer freezes while it's trying
 to do *something* about a universal device. These different responses occur without any changes to the system.</p>
<p>Again, I'm still looking for a solution. Thanks in advance to anyone with a constructive comment.</p>

<p>Frequently, I do not state the reasoning/purpose behind what I suggest as my aim is to provide a route to a solution because it is often the case that the poster does not,&nbsp;perhaps can&nbsp;not, provide a complete description. It is most helpful to have system
 details, a description of what leads to the problem (a reproducable procedure that was fillowed) and the result including the exact error message(s). You did give some of that.</p>
<p>The first step in any trouble-shooting, problem solving exercise is to be sure the system is in a well-defined, stable state. My suggestion that you "restore the system to the state before installing the driver for the powered USB hub" was to serve that
 objective. Incidentally, the wording was not the best. "Restore the system to the state it was before before you installed the driver for the powered USB hub", would have been better.</p>
<p>My next suggesation is that you take one of the problematic devices and check it on another computer. Run a disk utility sich as chkdsk with switches set to repair errors. This step aims simply to eliminate a possible source of problems. Again, in troubleshooting,
 the best approach is a controlled, planned, systematic elimination of possible problem-sources. Application of "magic bullett" solutions might seem attractive but seldom proves durable in the long term. However, it is your system and you need no one's permission
 to do as you please.</p>
<p>Please note that I have not suggested that this will solve your problem(s). It is simply another step in a process.</p>

<p>You say you were "plainly referring to my computer." You may have<br />
meant it that way, but it wasn't at all "plainly" to me. You said in<br />
the message I replied to, "64-bit Win 7 has never recognized USB<br />

to Windows 7 in general, and the point of my reply was that it is<br />

<p>Tom, let me start by saying I do appreciate your assistance in resolving the problem with my computer. I did not intend to denigrate your MS MVP designation; to the contrary, the first thing I did was thank you for your initial posting, and after all, I
 wouldn't be on this site looking for help if I didn't think there were people here with far more expertise about Windows than me. My comment to another poster (not to you)&nbsp;was meant&nbsp;to indicate that I hoped someone who had such a designation would know better
 than to waste their time and mine on giving a corporate, rah-rah&nbsp;denial to an inquiry about a problem that many, many other users have faced --&nbsp;in a&nbsp;forum&nbsp;directed to&nbsp;problem resolution, not random&nbsp;comments about Windows.</p>
<p>In any event, I also appreciate the need to approach the problem systematically,&nbsp;something I've learned&nbsp;about many of life's problems over the&nbsp;40 or so years since I first learned how to program a computer. I'm not a newbie -- I bought Win 95 and 98 at retail,
 and over the years&nbsp;have&nbsp;replaced every part&nbsp;on a computer that you can think of, so I've dealt with driver issues before&nbsp;--&nbsp;but&nbsp;this&nbsp;problem is so frustrating because it seems to me it shouldn't arise at all, let alone be difficult to solve. But I'm far from
 an expert on Windows; that's why I'm looking for help.</p>
<p>If you're willing to continue with me, I'm willing to take the OS back behind the first time I installed the hub drivers and start from there.&nbsp;I mentioned in a prior posting that my system's present&nbsp;response to usb memory devices is erratic.&nbsp;Such devices
 function absolutely fine on both a six year old&nbsp;PC (Win XP) and&nbsp;a six year old Powerbook&nbsp;(Mac OS 10x). The BIOS and chipset software of the problem computer&nbsp;have been updated, and usb&nbsp;is set to automatic in the BIOS.</p>
<p>As for other system info: Intel mobo&nbsp;DG41RQ, BIOS RQG4110H (etc.),&nbsp;2.9 GHz Core Duo E7500, 4 Gb memory, Win 7 Home Premium x64. HDD, LightScribe DVD burner, usb mouse, usb printer&nbsp;and usb&nbsp;keyboard all&nbsp;functioning properly.</p>
<p>Tom, thanking you again for your reply and&nbsp;any assistance you can give.</p>

<p>As a follow up: MicroSoft appears to have acknowledged that this widespread problem is an&nbsp;issue with the Win 7 drivers:</p>

<p>This might not apply with your setup; however, in some cases USB devices do not finction properly or do not work at all unless connected directly to the computer's USB port. With these devices, "port replicators", ports on "docking stations" or any other
 form of cascaded connection does not work.</p>
<p>Do get back as you try to work through this.</p>

<p>A final follow up: Astonishingly, after trying to install&nbsp;each and every one of my available thumb drives (including those for my wife's Macs), Win 7 x64 recognized one of them&nbsp;and installed its driver. Suddenly, Win 7 recognized everything. I don't know
 whether this is permanent but I can tell you without a doubt:</p>
<p>THE 64-BIT VERSION OF WINDOWS 7 HAS FREAKIN' DRIVER ISSUES.</p>
<p>Mu-Sluff admitted it with the NVIDA hot fix several months ago and the thousands of postings regarding usb driver issues on this site&nbsp;prove that many drver problems still exist.</p>
<p>And Ken, a personal note to you --&nbsp;if there's a problem on thousands of systems, Win 7 is broken, and I don't care how many times you say&nbsp;it works like it's supposed to. Your effing beloved Windows ain't perfect.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 VPN sets network to public&#33;&#33; How to change</h2>
                    <p>On Windows 10 when I set up a connection to work as a PPTP the network that it makes is set as public and then no file share. Not much point in having a VPN to the office server if I can not file share!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>works fine in windows 7, 8, 8.1 but not 10 also works on Mac and iPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i need a fix ASAP I have tried changing the setting in regedit no luck, I have changed the network setting but the group policy's stop me from having file share on public network this worked on my home windows 10 machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>need a fix as I have to run a access database from the server when in my home office and this has to be on my work laptop as uses log in details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

<p><span>Hi Web_tracker,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Disk Defragmenter might take from several minutes to a few hours to finish, depending on the size and degree of fragmentation of your hard disk. You
 can still use your computer during the defragmentation process.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Disk Defragmentation takes a long time for one of the following reasons:-</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>The number of file extents (that is the number of files + extra extents, see<br />
defrag /v) will affect how much time your defrag takes.<br />
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Also the number of free space extents and the size of each will affect<br />
defrag time.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><br />
Lastly, Defrag runs at low priority, so if you are doing something else on<br />
the computer defrag will yield to whatever else is happening<br />
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For more information visit the following link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://blogs.technet.com/filecab/pages/disk-defragmenter-faq.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://blogs.technet.com/filecab/pages/disk-defragmenter-faq.aspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To resolve the issue you can follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check your hard disk for errors<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>You can help solve some computer problems and improve the performance of your computer by making sure that your hard disk has no errors.</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Computer by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Computer.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click the hard disk drive that you want to check, and then click Properties.</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Tools tab, and then, under Error-checking, click Check Now. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation,
 type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>To automatically repair problems with files and folders that the scan detects, select Automatically fix file system errors. Otherwise,
 the disk check will simply report problems but not fix them.</span></p>
<p><span>To perform a thorough disk check, select Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors. This scan attempts to find and repair physical
 errors on the hard disk itself, and it can take much longer to complete.</span></p>
<p><span>To check for both file errors and physical errors, select both Automatically fix file system errors and Scan for and attempt recovery
 of bad sectors.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Depending upon the size of your hard disk, this may take several minutes. For best results, don't use your computer for any other tasks
 while it's checking for errors.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            scanner issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have successfully installed the drivers for a Contex SD4430 scanner but when I try to start a scan using acrobat standard or windows fax and scan I get the message that the scanner could not be initialised.&nbsp; There is also no presets for the scanner.&nbsp; The
 monitoring software states no issues with the scanner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

                    <p>Windows 10 Mail does not send, mail leaves drafts but does not go to sent.&nbsp; Does not arrive at address.&nbsp; When I compose mail a 1 shows up in the drafts as I type.&nbsp; Once I click send, the mail goes away, the 1 goes away.&nbsp; Nothing in sent and the mail does
 not arrive at the prescribed address. Very frustrating. &nbsp; Have already tried the prescribed fixes.</p>

<h2>            outlook main window always stay on top</h2>
                    <p>After upgraded to Windows 10, i found that the outlook 2013 main window always stay on top when i click to start a new email, reply to email or forward email. I click on the task bar but the windows of new, reply or forward emails were all blocked by the
 main window. I need to minimize the main window so that i can work with the secondary window.</p>
<p>When i revert to Windows 8.1, the problem does not exist. So it should be the problems of Windows 10, or related to the compatibility issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same problem happens in my desktop and surface. And it also occurs in Word. How to prevent the main window always stay on top ?<br />

            <p>I have solved this problem by an advise of someone. The problem is found in the Chinese input method. When i change to English input, the problem was solved.</p>
<p>However, when i go back to Chinese input method, the main windows will always stay on top so that everytime when i need to input the Chinese, I have to minimize the main window.</p>
<p>Quite annoying.</p>

            I have a similar issue: I have a PC with both Linux and Windows (not sure of the version at this writing). I had been receiving the update prompts to Windows 10, and the free download was going to expire, so I decided to download the new version. It would
 not download completely, so after a day or two, I think I had not completely shut off, but all of a sudden my computer went to a black screen like it does when you start it up, I would usually have a prompt to select Linux or Windows after which it would revert
 automatically to Windows, if I didn't make a selection, but now I have this grub rescue prompt. I like to use both Linux and Windows. I'm doing some research and don't mind trying to fix this issue as long as I get some solid, good info to follow. I'm searching
 the Internet and finding good info, and now just find this source, so decided to put my issue here for some feedback. Thank you<br />

            No, Microsoft does not, you will need to purchase a new Windows 7 product key if you lost yours. If you can't afford Windows 7 (which is rare to find), you might as well stick with Windows 10.

<h2>            There might be problem with the driver for the Wi-Fi adapter - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to fix a Dell Inspiron 7000. After an update, the wifi stopped working. I can't even get a USB wireless adapter to connect to the internet on the laptop. The laptop is
<strong>not</strong> running the latest update 1703. It is running the build right before that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>I tried the netsh command prompt guide and that didn't fix it.&nbsp;</li><li>I was able to update the driver by downloading it onto a USB from another computer</li></ul>
<p>Not sure what else to do besides to factory reset, which is something I really want to avoid.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Skald,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you do anything else, use the computer that does have an internet connection to&nbsp;go to the Dell drivers &amp; downloads section for your Service tag and download all the new items including any BIOS update.&nbsp; Copy the files to the afflicted computer and
 install them.&nbsp; It is possible that this alone will fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, to both update &amp; repair your computer, make an installation disk [USB/DVD] using
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install</a> Then start Windows normally, connect the USB, open File explorer and look at the USB, run its setup.exe file.&nbsp; By doing this within Windows, this initiates a "repair install" which
 will overwrite the Windows files on your computer without disrupting your&nbsp;installed applications or your own files.</p>
<p>
</p><p><del><em>By the way, did you know that Dell cannot supply replacement batteries for our computers?&nbsp; And there is no third-party supplier either.&nbsp;
</em></del><em>Ignore me, you wrote 7000 series but I read 7779 specifically [Dell does supply replacement batteries for some of the 7000 series but not the 7779].</em></p>

</p><p>1&nbsp; You might find that it fixes your problem straightaway so that you would have the option of not bothering to update to ver 1703 or at least not
</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;Any BIOS / firmware updates would, by definition, survive the Repair install and they would be full ready for the Creator's update.&nbsp; Generally-speaking, hardware drivers also survive Repair installs although I can imagine that there are exceptions.&nbsp; It
 is perfectly possible that the Creator's update <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
demands</span> updated BIOS / firmware &amp; hardware drivers for our computers.&nbsp; Certainly,&nbsp;there were new&nbsp;Dell BIOS&nbsp;/ firmware &amp; hardware driver updates&nbsp;when the Creator's update was released &amp; since we both have 7000 series Inspirons I imagine that most of the
 guts of our computers are the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, mine is a Dell Inspiron 17-7779 with a Intel(R) Dual Band Wireless-AC 3165 [WiFi &amp; Bluetooth].&nbsp; This info can be shown in, amongst other places, a command window by entering

            Hi DaveM121, thanks for the suggestion. I got a message that said that the file was already in the system. So I contacted Microsoft and their rep found out that VCRUNTIME140.dll was part of Accelerometer, a program of HP. So for now it has not been resolved
 yet, but at least&nbsp;I know it is not disturbing the Windows program. I can live with it for now.

<h2>            Broken Xbox One, So long</h2>
                    
<p>Greetings, I'm posting here because I cannot get anyone else at xbox one support to listen to me. &nbsp;I already have a service ticket open ref #<strong> [ Removed]</strong> &nbsp;so that describes the hardware problem. &nbsp;But the real problem is that today I've finally
 decided to part ways Xbox. &nbsp;On the phone I mentioned my dissatisfaction with the $500 piece of equipment and I was simple told "Then sell it on ebay." &nbsp;That remark made me cancel my 10+ year subscription with xbox live. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I was very surprised when I said I want my 10+ year account cancelled because I was met with no resistance, no "I'm terribly sorry" or "how can we keep you as a customer?" &nbsp;I was simply told okay, placed on hold and the account was cancelled. &nbsp;I guess this
 is a valid response since that's exactly what I asked for and it seems I had a very self-infalted view of my importance of being a long term "valued" customer. &nbsp; Perhaps it is a very trite thing but I felt two inches tall after that conversation, it was a
 wounding experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've spent thousands and thousands of dollars on Xbox games, and have always been a major supporter. I've had so many wonderful memories with Xbox, so many sleepless nights and just as many failed school tests/missed papers. &nbsp;No matter what Xbox was there
 for me, no matter how bad my day was I always had Xbox to look forward to. So canceling my subscription has simply made me sad. &nbsp;I'm not mentioning this out of spite or to receive some sort of handout I just wanted to pass across my experience so that (hopefully)
 someone of importance can read this and take the proper steps so this never ever happens again. &nbsp;To be clear I'm a customer lost that can never be regained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problems with my xbox one are countless but here a a few. &nbsp;First the Kinect, a shoddy piece of equipment I really didn't even want (which I've had to replace twice). &nbsp;I was excited to show off "the future" to friends and family but always ended up having
 egg on my face. &nbsp;An extra $100 I rather would of spent on games. &nbsp;Second the console itself was constantly needing to be reset, software was constantly crashing, not responding and other issues (which you are already aware of). &nbsp;I never went a full day without
 a hard system reset. &nbsp;Xbox live seemed to crash on a regular basis as well, obviously a must to play and even chat with my friends making the system pretty useless. &nbsp;On top of that the party system is my worst nightmare. &nbsp;It never functioned properly for me
 or my friends, even with the newest updates. &nbsp; In a nutshell every time I turned on my xbox I was looking forward to a fun relaxing experience like I've had so much of in the past but always ended up shutting off the console because it was just too much of
 a hassle. &nbsp;Most of my friends have sold their consoles, at a loss mind you, just to not deal with it anymore. &nbsp;And this is where I am now. &nbsp;I will be selling my xbox one, losing my digital game library &nbsp;also selling the system at a loss simple because it's
 not worth the hassle anymore. &nbsp;I hope this is a giant red flag to anyone of importance within the xbox hierarchy. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>To wrap up I just want to say thank you, &nbsp;you've lost a customer today but I'll always remember my time with Xbox as a positive one. &nbsp;Thank you for all the memories, all the epic moments, stories that gave me goosebumps that also made me cry. &nbsp;Thank you
 for all that. &nbsp;I'm sad to be leaving but it's proven to me that it's time to move on. &nbsp;Please take these lessons and apply them to future endeavors so the new generation of gamers can experience what I have. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks Again.</p>

<p>Sincerely,&nbsp;</p>
<p>the one and only CEOWAYNEENTPRSE</p>

<p>See but that kind of attitude towards the tech is what causes these problems. do I expect bugs? of course I do. Do I expect the $500 piece of hardware to break on a consistent basis to the point where it's unusable? No, that's unacceptable. &nbsp;By allowing
 something to be subpar will only continually allow more &nbsp;products to break. Writing it off doesn't solve the overall problem or more importantly the policy on the problem.
</p>
<p>But the main problem of my point wasn't so much the bugs (I mentioned those for reference if anyone was listening) but for when I raised my frustrations, in a calm, reasoned &nbsp;way over the phone &nbsp;it is unacceptable to just tell the consumer well sell it then.
 &nbsp;Especially one who has been with the program for 10+ years, had many many red rings of death and even accepted the "well it's buggy" &nbsp;school of thought back in the day. &nbsp; &nbsp;You'd think with how hard Sonys giving to them they would &nbsp;at least want to inquire
 with me further. &nbsp;Every consumer seems to count these days. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I could easily be all alone in what I expect as standard for a $500 machine (from what I see with my friends and online I highly doubt that's the case). I see what you are saying but hope to God you eventually raise your expectations. As for me "going forward"
 is exactly what I've done. </p>
<p>I apologize for my long windedness and my "rage" at the subject, it is a passionate subject/pastime of mine and I believe Xbox has forgotten about people like me.
</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply and reading. </p>

<p>Yes you should call back, speak to a supervisor and make a complaint about the person who told you to sell it on ebay.</p>
<p>That is not good service and I can perfectly understand why you are annoyed. If I was spoken to like that I would probably feel the same way as you.</p>
<p>But you said you have invested lots of time and money in your xbox so would be a shame to throw it all away.</p>
<p>All customer support lines for any company can have bad staff who drive customers away but unless you complain about them nothing will ever get done about them.</p>

    <title>Acct on PC says no devices attached to download games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> irismustang  say:</h3>
<h2>            Acct on PC says no devices attached to download games</h2>
                    <div>Usually this is no problem. I grab my games with gold and any deals with gold I want to buy when I'm at my PC. Today I went to get the Game with Gold for Jan 1-15 and I signed in. Had to do the verification and all that, but I was in. "Bought" the game.</div>
<div>It gives the pop up that usually tells me it's going to try to push to my system. This time it tells me "It looks like you don’t have any applicable device(s) linked to your Microsoft account. To install, sign in on a device with your Microsoft account."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I wonder if I signed in with the wrong Microsoft account, using one I have for just email, but no, it has my Gold attached, so I'm in my Xbox account.</div>
<div>I check my account. I see my device. "Everything looks good" according to Microsoft.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am signed in on my xbox. I do have my xbox one attached to my login.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I go back to the game. Try to do it again.&nbsp; Same thing. I'm staring at my Xbox Dashboard on my TV. Everything's fine there. I'm online. I'm in a game. No problem. Then I see the game is downloading.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So it DID find my device and it DID push to the device, but the alert that there's no applicable device is strange, and I'm not sure if some privacy setting got flipped or if it's just a glitch. Anyone else see anything like this ever?&nbsp;</div>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you said, hopefully it was only a glitch and thankfully it got solved easily, if it happens again I would recommend contacting support considering some portals/Hubs/screens tell you everything's fine while others don't and you did check that your account
 was logged on all your devices and that it was the right one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you can keep enjoying your games!<br />

<p>The problem got fixed and irismustang did follow many of the steps, so I find the article a bit redundant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many seem to be having this problem and it's getting solved by it's own for some reason so it's hard to say what's really going on</p>

            I've never seen it do it before. Makes me feel better others see it too. Weirdest part was it already pushing itself to the Xbox even though it was telling me there was no device. Thanks for reassuring me it's not just me.&nbsp;

<p>I always seem to have the hardest time getting into the right section to actually contact support itself, but I will definitely try in the future. It seems like every time I have an issue, it takes me twice as long as before to get into the right support,
 but since I rarely ever have to contact, I think I just don't know the shortcuts others know when they contact more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That actually doesn't address my particular issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not using Windows 10 and I'm not trying to do compatibility either. So it's not a game I could "play anywhere".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was simply being logged in looking at the Games With Gold, telling it to "buy" and then the page that says it will try to push to device suddenly decided I didn't have a device attached to my account, though my account saying it was in my devices list.
 Same as if I were just purchasing a game for my Xbox, but accessing microsoft/xbox's site through a browser rather than the Xbox store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then it downloaded the game to my Xbox anyway, even giving me that pop-up error. So my question was more why would the microsoft site decide I didn't have any devices attached when the 'my account' part showed it clearly and what I could do to rectify
 it. But it looks like others do have that happen to them, so it does look like it's a random glitch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That sounds like a temporary database glitch and it's nothing to worry about since what you wanted to do still happened. As long as your account shows your console is linked and the games download remotely, then you have nothing to worry about. It may be
 bothersome or confusing but I don't believe that happens every time.</p>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on your machine? Include all you ever had including<br />
those you uninstalled. (These can leave remnants which can cause strange issues.)<br />
<br />
Do a search for all .cpl files most will be in "C:\Windows\System32" however you can have others. Click on<br />
each one at a time and see if one does not start - if so Right Click on it and rename it using cpZ as the extension so it is east to find. Retry Control Panel - if no joy keep trying all your .cpl files. (Note the others found under other Folders under C:\Windows
 should not be tried as they are not active.)<br />
<br />
<br />
A few of these are appwiz.cpl, firewall.cpl, desk.cpl, powercfg.cpl, inetcpl.cpl, timedate.cpl and others.<br />
<br />
Try these in case general corruption has a role :<br />
<br />
Start - type this in Search Box -&gt;&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top and RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; -&nbsp; RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Enter this at the prompt - sfc /scannow<br />

lately? Also check for driver updates in Windows Updates.<br />

    <title>Surface Pro 2017&#58; Surface App could not connect to pen device, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fabio pareschi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 2017&#58; Surface App could not connect to pen device, display serial number, and Device and Printers not showing a realistic icon</h2>
                    <p>I got these problems (I presume, related the each other)&nbsp;after a clean windows 10 reinstall on my surface pro 2017 (necessary after a failed windows software reset)</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Surface App could not connect to pen device with classic red error: "<em>The Surface app could not connect to the pen device. There may be a problem with device metadata etc etc"</em></li><li>Surface App could not display serial number and firmware version anymore.</li><li>Device and Printers was not showing a realistic icon for surface and surface pen (mice and printers are OK)</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Everything else (pen, etc) is working correctly. Googling, it is possible to find that this problem is actually quite common when updating old surfaces to windows 10. A solution for surface 3 was posted in https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surf3-surfupdate/surface-3-surface-app-could-not-connect-to-pen/dc452b1f-4498-4edf-b80f-0c71b14a8665
 Of course, no use for SurfacePro 2017</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had anybody got this issue (and was able to solve it) with the new surface?</p>

    <title>the hidden administrator account is hidden by default, should it be - Microsoft Community</title>

<p>original title: <span>Hidden Administrator</span></p>
<p>Hi, the hidden administrator account is hidden by default, should it be left activated, and password-protected? or should it be left blank without a password like default. Is it advisable to use this account everyday like the previous version windows which
 you run as an administrator, or should another account be created?</p>
<p>Both methods are the same, and have the same impact, and the same security protection, but which one is better?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recommend the Hidden Admin Account be disabled and only used if needed as last resort<br />
since it is.&nbsp;That is the reason it is hidden.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Make another ADMIN account with your same Password to test and fix. Always keep a spare<br />
ADMIN account that is not used on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
Disable the Hidden Account unless needed.<br />
<br />
Microsoft recommends using a User Account and saving the ADMIN you make only when<br />
needed for security reasons. However using a User Account on a regular basis is to<br />
restricting for most of us. Hence have two ADMIN accounts one to use and one to test<br />
and fix. Either way leaving the Hidden Account for emergencies.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<p><br />
Whether the Built-in Administrator shoud be enabled or disabled is really your choice.<br />
If you decide to keep it enabled&nbsp;:<br />
1. Give it a secured password ( make a written copy and don't lose it ).<br />
2. It <strong>MUST not</strong> be used on daily basis. <br />
3. It should ONLY be your emergency backup admin account.<br />
4. You should create an admin&nbsp;account with you as admin. <br />
5. The choice is yours. Others might say you should open a normal user account and use it for daily basis. If you agree, do so.<br />
