<h2>            Is there an MS Project Report that compares Baseline against Current plan&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a project that I would like to generate a report that reflects the baseline dates against the current plan dates for my project tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a pre-existing report in MS Project 2010 that does this (or gets close to this)?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or if it doesn't
 exist, how can I create a report that gives this?&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know how to customize a report, or even how to take an existing report and modify it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone's help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>LadyWhitmofGP,</p>
<p>To my knowledge there is no report that shows baseline versus current plan, but it is easy to show that with the Tracking Gantt view. That shows the baseline versus plan in the Gantt display but you'll need to add the baseline date fields, and perhaps the
 Start and Finish Variance fields if you want to show a comparison in the tabular (left side of Gantt View) data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would create your own custom view based on the above and then it will be readily available whenever you need to create a report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Excel 2011 - restore standard fonts only.</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader2">(How to? Is it possible without re-installing Office?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>During installation process for Office 2011 (Mac) I recall a choice to have Microsoft Office apps use only a standard set of Office fonts, or the users available full font set available on their Mac.&nbsp; The later includes any fonts the user has downloaded
 and installed themselves. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to reset Office apps (like Word or Excel) back to the Microsoft standard font set only, without having to redo a full install of the Office suite.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not find an option to do this, nor can I find a folder of fonts, or font list in the Office files, where in I can remove non standard fonts, to just leave MS Office using only its standard fonts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to be able to do this so I can test if the crashes and memory issues I am getting with Excel may be due to some of my user downloaded fonts causing Excel to crash.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that this is a different issue to using option in preferences to change the default font used in Excel or Word when you open a new document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>-- After a few weeks, I have posted a comprehensive response below of what I have learned, including an alternative short cut solution to remove user fonts without a full re-install of Office. This is not quite the same as restoring Office standard fonts
 only, but it should be sufficient to test for fonts that you the user may have installed that are crashing Office.&nbsp; --</p>

            <p>The only way I know of to restore all office fonts is: </p>
<ol>
<li>open Office installer and go to custom install.</li><li>Check Fonts Only.</li><li>Run installer.</li></ol>
<p>The Item your talking about you might have gotten confused about relates to Office Lion on on up.</p>
<p>In Font Book there is a Command to Restore system fonts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be careful using that. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You use that in dire cases Only. What it does It is totally Deletes (throws in Trash), every font that exist on your system Hard Drive. Whether installed by other applications &nbsp;(including Office) . Put system Back like it would be as if you bought computer
 new and just had system on. So unless you pull those fonts out of the trash and reinstall them a lot of you applications will be hurting when you open them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead the way it should have been written, is remove all&nbsp;system fonts that still exist and and simply restore with new copies. &nbsp;Shame engineers are not smart enough to ask experienced users how to do things, would cause a Lot less heartache and gnashing
 of teeth.</p>

            <p>PMFJI, but I believe that what you're recalling is the question as to whether the fonts installed with Office 2011 should be available to All Users or to the installing user account only. That determines in which font folder the fonts are placed... There
 are at least 3 '<em>active</em>' font folders:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Macintosh HD:System:Library:Fonts</strong> [which is best left untouched]</li><li><strong>Macintosh HD:Library:Fonts</strong> [shared by all user accounts]</li><li><strong>Macintosh HD:Users:</strong><em><strong>UserName</strong></em><strong>:Library:Fonts</strong> [available to the specific user account]</li></ol>
<p>In neither case do the Microsoft fonts get "mixed in" among others in the same
<strong>~:Library:Fonts</strong> folder. Likewise, neither the OS X fonts nor fonts installed by other programs are added into the Microsoft folder unless the installing individual explicitly chooses to do so. By default, fonts installed by Office 2011 are
 placed in a <strong>Microsoft</strong> folder within #2 above unless the installing individual elects to do otherwise. If so, the
<strong>Microsoft</strong> font folder is placed within #3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a question of this nature arises it's usually motivated by the questioner attempting to resolve some sort of problem or achieve a specific objective. I don't mean to insinuate that you '<em>don't know what you're doing</em>' :-) or to be condescending,
 but unless you are rather certain that the steps you intend to take will address the issue, it might be beneficial to explain what the underlying issue is. Perhaps others have related experienced &amp; can provide some insights. Otherwise you may expend a fair
 amount of time &amp; effort without resolving the issue.</p>

            <p>Bob is correct in his suggesting where Fonts would go in his explanation above.</p>
<p>And&nbsp;I agree with his assessment that Only the system updates and install should mess with the the Fonts in the System/Fonts Folder.&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Bob, you were correct, my question here does relate to a different problem.&nbsp;
</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">The original problem was memory instability, hang and quit issues with Excel, including a possibly related copy and paste beach ball hang.&nbsp; I have discussed this problem in another thread titled "Office 2011, Excel; copy and paste

</p><p class="contentStandard">As it turns out, I have found a way to do this pretty much without a reinstall.&nbsp; The solution is not perfect, as Mac OS standard fonts are also loaded into Office. However, this method does remove all downloaded user fonts, which
 are the ones most likely to be causing a problem. </p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">In finding this solution, I have also determined by elimination that problematic fonts are not the source of the problems I have been having with Excel.&nbsp; More the pity.&nbsp; I will make a post back in that other thread when I am done

<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2011-macword/office-2011-for-mac-crashes-in-normal-mode/2873b79f-eafc-4381-a9f3-286c9c2b684f" title="Thread link.">

 fonts: those that don't follow all the rules can crash Word."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>
</p><p><em>To install or not install Office standard fonts only?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This background should help you understand the issues around fonts, and help you decide what the best choice is for you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is another reason apart from the risk of Office crashes for not using fonts other than the Office standard set.&nbsp; Its the visual accuracy of how other people see your documents when you share them.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use some downloaded fonts of your own in an Excel spread sheet or Word document, and send that spreadsheet or document to another person, if their Mac or Window machine does not have a copy of that special downloaded font, how can their computer display
 correctly your file in Excel or Word? &nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact is it can not.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>What typically happens is the application at the recipients end will replace the special font you have used in your sent document with a standard font like Arial, just so that the file can be opened and displayed on the other persons computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recipient will still have the words you have typed, but with the font changed, the appearance of the document may be significantly different.&nbsp; For common types of files it probably does not make much difference, but imagine a carefully sculptured Wedding
 Invitation design in MS Word, with elaborate special flowing font.&nbsp; It wont look the same with the text rendered in Times or Arial font.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem is not just with MS Office.&nbsp; If you are using uncommon fonts, and sending files to others from any application, then this issue can happen.&nbsp; This includes emails by the way.&nbsp; The problem arises irrespective of the OS you or the recipient is
 using. </p>
<p>
</p><p>A different solution some applications use with non standard fonts is to load a copy of the fonts used in the document you have created, and send a copy of your special font with the document. Their same program at the recipients end will then render the
 document as you intended, as it also has a copy of the special fonts you used.&nbsp;&nbsp; The downside to this solution is that it makes for much bigger files to transfer.&nbsp; Font files can be multi-megabytes in size.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>From what I can see, MS Office solves the problem slightly differently, if you opt for their solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It simply supplies a standard set of fonts. When you initially instal Office 2011, you can set Office to only use those standard fonts in all Office applications.&nbsp; This works as a solution, as your documents will only contain the same standard fonts as held
 by all other Office users, Mac and Windows. If they have Office, they have the same fonts installed on their computer.&nbsp; Problem solved!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this means you can not make documents in Office using non standard (but still compatible with Office) fonts that you may have downloaded onto your computer.&nbsp; You may not like this.&nbsp; You may want a lot more variety and choice in the fonts you can
 use than the standard Office font set.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are only printing your work with special fonts yourself, then, provided the fonts do not crash Office, there is no problem with using these fonts.&nbsp; This leaves you with lots of creative freedom in what you can design and create.&nbsp; As you are not sending
 your work with unusual fonts to others to edit or appreciate just as you create it, its not an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consequently, with installation, they give you a choice of what you want to do. Have Office use only a limited set of standard MS Office fonts, or access all your fonts in your Font Library.&nbsp; (At least, that is my memory of the installation process a year
 or more ago. )</p>
<p>
</p><p>I chose for Office to access all my fonts.&nbsp; A choice I regret just for the moment given I need to have MS Office&nbsp; access only standard fonts to test if the crash problems I am having are being caused by non standard fonts.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Before this I did not regret
 my choice.&nbsp; I don't send documents with fancy fonts to others, but I can do some home printing with them if I want. Cool!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>M<em>aking your decision. A few more tips and work arounds with fonts to consider.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you work with unusual creative fonts, and you send those docs generally to the same people, collaborators, to view and/or edit your work, you can ask your collaborators to download and install the same set of special fonts you use in your documents onto
 their computers. They can then see your docs with the correct font rendered, just as you want them to.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use creative unusual fonts, and you just want others to be able to view what your work looks like, but not edit and change and evolve your work on their computer to send back, then the simple solutions is to send images of what your final work looks
 like rather than the file itself.&nbsp; For example, take screen pics of your work. No exchange of fonts needed.&nbsp; Good if you just want to check they are happy with the look of what you are doing.&nbsp; You will still need the fonts you have used to be available to
 where ever you print this work. If you are printing it yourself, no problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>How can you tell what you chose when you installed Office?&nbsp;</em> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Open a Word or Excel document and look at the drop down font list in the Menu Bar at the top. If you have a long list of fonts available to you, then you are using more than just the Office standard fonts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the MS Office standard fonts in the OS X Font Book. This is all of them. Hence why if you selected Office fonts only the font list in the drop down menu should be quite a short list.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>SOLUTION:</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Opening Office 2011 applications without User Installed Fonts being loaded.</strong></p>
<p><em>(And without a full removal and re-install of Office.)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">1. Quit All Office applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">2.&nbsp; Open the Font Book application. (Installed with the OS in your applications folder.)</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">3. Under Menu &gt;File, choose &gt;Restore Standard Fonts...</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">This will first explain what it will do before doing it, so relax.&nbsp; It removes, but does not delete, your user added fonts. It puts them in a different folder, where in later you can put them back into your Font Book.
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">4. In the Finder Menu, Select &gt;Go and while the drop down menu is visible press the option key so that &gt;Library appears in the drop down list.&nbsp; Select Library.&nbsp; A window showing your user account's Library Files should open on your
 Desktop.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">5.&nbsp;&nbsp; In that window open the following folders, one inside the other:&nbsp; &gt;Application Support, then &gt;Microsoft, then &gt;Office, then &gt;Preferences, then &gt;Office 2011. In this last folder, select the file "Office Font Cache" and drag it
 to the desktop or trash.&nbsp; Leave this window open so you can see what happens. </p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">6. Open Office Word or Excel.&nbsp; When Office finds this file missing, it rebuilds it.&nbsp; Since you have removed all the user fonts from the Font Book, it can only build the list from what is available in the Font Book.&nbsp; So the new rebuilt
 font list telling Excel and Word what fonts are available has been reconstructed using only OS X and Office standard fonts.&nbsp; Done!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Because this new list will include all the Mac Standard OS fonts (as well as the MS Office standard fonts) it will still be a long font list once you check the available fonts in the drop down menu in Word or Excel.&nbsp; Go on&nbsp; .. go have a look!&nbsp;&nbsp; What should
 be missing is all the User installed fonts.&nbsp; These are the ones that are likely to be causing problems and crashes. (If any of them are, that is!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there you have a solution.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are doing all this to problem solve a crash or other issue in Office, and the crash or other problem does not go away, then the problem was likely not in your user added fonts.&nbsp; I suggest load your fonts back in and enjoy them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand if you do this, and your problems in Office 2011 apps go away, you have a bad font or perhaps several bad fonts in your user fonts causing the problem. You need to identify which ones are the problem ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>Also solution to identifying problem fonts if you have some:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a few ways to go about this, each with different levels of robustness and time involved.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The standard and most robust way is unfortunately slow.&nbsp; You need to quit your Office apps, then load your removed fonts back into Font Book in batches of 5 or 10. Opening your Office app after you add each batch, and seeing if the crash or problem returns.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If after adding a batch brings the problem back, then remove that batch, then load the fonts in that batch one at a time, until by a process of elimination, you identify the culprit font or fonts. If you have a lot of user fonts, this could take a long time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>An alternative way involves remembering the description of types of fonts that can crash Office quoted earlier in this post.</p>

</p><p>In Font Book menu, choose &gt;Preview and select &gt;Show Font Info. Instead of seeing an example of the fonts, you see technical summary information of each font.&nbsp; Now you can go through your font list and check for font types that, in the above description,
 are likely a problem for Office. Remove those and see if the crash or issue is resolved.&nbsp; This may be a quicker route than adding all back in batches and testing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A third option.&nbsp; If you look back in the OS window where you removed the "Office Font Cache" you should see that it has been replaced (updated) and the modified date of the file now the current date and time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can go back and look at the modified date of the file you removed, either on your desktop or in the trash, to see the difference.&nbsp; It probably has the modified date of when you installed Office, or the last time you installed new fonts on your computer,
 and hence the cache file was updated.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have had crashes due to bad fonts you have added, this modification date is probably also the date you added the problem fonts.&nbsp; Could help you narrow down your search for the culprits.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>These are the options I have found.&nbsp; The alternatives beyond this are, leave user fonts removed from your available fonts to all applications. Essentially, abandon those lovely fonts you spent hours downloading.&nbsp; Or finally, just putting up with the problem
 that brings you here (if it is not to serious). </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>Some further thoughts:</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Some may argue the steps 4 and 5 in my solution (to find and remove the "Office Font Cache" file) is not necessary.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this step is important to ensure there is no legacy issues from troublesome fonts.&nbsp; Even if they are no longer available to load, this ensures Office apps don't even look for them and cause a problem in the process of not finding them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first looked at the "Office Font Cache" file, the modification date was back to when I installed Office. I have probably not added any new fonts in that time.&nbsp; I suspect this file gets checked every time an Office app opens, but is only updated if
 there is a change in available fonts. In which case, having removed it once, it probably does not need to be removed each time you add a batch of fonts to seek a problem font.&nbsp; I am not certain of this. Perhaps someone else can check this and add a post.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this solution takes you to places on your Mac you have not been to before, I strongly recommend not interfering with any other files in the Library files unless you know quite specifically what you are doing.&nbsp; Having Office not work is one thing, having
 your entire computer not work within the next 10 minutes from a little "harmless fiddle" in here is quite another.&nbsp; Don't be tempted.&nbsp; Look yes, change no.&nbsp; Finish what you are doing, close it all up, and leave it all alone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><em>Long Post - Why?:</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This should be a comprehensive post on Office 2011 and fonts for any number of issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This post is long.&nbsp; I think it needs to cover all it covers. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Reading through lots of posts in my search for answers to my problem, I suspect problem fonts maybe the source of many other users crash problems with Office (incl past releases like Office 2008).&nbsp; In many instances this possible cause was not made known
 to the original poster.&nbsp; I also have not found a time satisfactory solution to determining if fonts are the issue without doing a full re-install of Office to reverse ones original choice with standard fonts only, or spend a lot of time loading and unloading
 fonts in an elimination process.&nbsp; This leads some to just abandon using Office.&nbsp; I have at least found some more time efficient solution to determine if user installed fonts are the problem.&nbsp; Takes probably less than half an hour.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a user with issues does not have an understanding of the font issue more broadly, they could spend a few hours of wasted time re-installing Office over their current installation and not actually solving the problem, just waste their time.&nbsp;&nbsp; For re-installing
 Office to work, it would seem that one needs to ensure all Office 2011 files, including those in User Library etc, are removed.&nbsp;Suggestions like reinstall just the fonts does not, unfortunately, address the problem.&nbsp; (It just re-installs the Office standard
 fonts in the Font book. It does not offer reset on the choice of what fonts are accessed by Office apps. ) There is some hours of reading up just to know all the places to look and remove
 Re-installing fully also means having to manually reset all your preferences after you re-install Office and your testing process is completed.&nbsp; What ever way I look at it, these 'solutions'&nbsp; likely involve a day or more of time and work. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having struggled with all this over weeks, spending 20 hours possibly, and finding some less time costly options, I felt a comprehensive post was required in the interest of Mac users generally.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe a full explanation, with background explanation for experienced and newbies alike, is in the end the most efficient time solution for all concerned.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope the effort cuts down the chase for the issue that brings you here, and hence saves
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Collective efficiency.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

<h2>            Several issues with Outlook 2016 from O365 and Shared Mailboxes</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently migrated several PSTs into Shared Mailboxes then gave access to specified users for each shared mailbox. Ever since, their Outlook clients have been slow and popped up a couple of errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook memory low, close and try again, not in those exact words....I figured this was because Outlook was set to Cached Exchange mode so I disabled that. However Outlook has been slow to respond in regards to navigating between folders in 1 mailbox or
 other mailboxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I started to get a pop up stating there was an issue signing into my account. A few others have seen this message today as well. No changes have been made in the environment, I would know because I am the only IT guy here for 40 users.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be93a6cf-aaa5-4c92-8e99-175d52604c94?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be93a6cf-aaa5-4c92-8e99-175d52604c94?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>It doesn't tell which application it is referring to because its just a white background with no title or header. I think this may be related to Outlook and/or Skype for Business but I do not see any events logged into Event Viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know Skype for Business has logging enabled, I just do not see anything in there that sticks out to be the cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would greatly be appreciated!</p>

<div><br />
<div>Look at the link about Outlook performance issues when you have many shared folders or mailboxes open&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/3136059/outlook-performance-issues-when-you-have-many-shared-folders-or-mailbo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/3136059/outlook-performance-issues-when-you-have-many-shared-folders-or-mailbo</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>What is your Outlook 2016 version?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Where &amp; when do you see this error message? Is it within Outlook error or else?</div>
<div><br />
<div>There may be Connected Services issue. Go to File&gt;Office Account&gt;check under Connected Services OneDrive &amp; Sites.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Launch Outlook in safe mode to check your issue. Close Outlook. Choose Start, type Outlook.exe /safe, and press Enter.</div>

            JMDodd,<br />
<br />
The short answer is that Microsoft is fully aware of this bug and has no plans to fix it :(
<br />
<br />
Here's the long answer ...<br />
<br />
I discovered the exact same problem last December 2012 and started this thread ...<br />
<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-wlsettings/how-to-delete-one-mis-spelled-email-address-from/15a82987-b635-4677-b130-13632a0fdbc8">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-wlsettings/how-to-delete-one-mis-spelled-email-address-from/15a82987-b635-4677-b130-13632a0fdbc8</a><br />
<br />
It is a long thread. Initially, the Forum Moderators (who are not Microsoft employees but work for the outsourced company that Microsoft hired to run these forums) did not take the time to read and understand my initial post.
<br />
<br />
I finally convinced a few Forum Moderators to try to reproduce the problem. Then, they kept telling me the problem was "under investigation". I was never sure why a problem that the Forum Mods were able to reproduce needed so much "investigation".<br />
<br />
After much persistence, I finally got a reply on May 26, 2013&nbsp; (five months after I started my thread), that said this:<br />
<br />
<i>Our Microsoft Engineers have confirmed that this feature is currently not available in the Outlook.com User Interface (UI)</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Microsoft Engineers are now aware of this issue.&nbsp; Although there is no definite turnaround time...</i><br />
<br />
You can read the entire response at the bottom of Page 5 in the thread referenced above.<br />
<br />
I find it hard to believe that Microsoft has been aware of this bug since at least December 2012 and yet they cannot and will not provide outlook.com users with the ability to add, delete, and change entries in the auto-complete list.<br />
<br />

<p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microosft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&nbsp; me help you with your issue. Since you are having the same issue, you can both&nbsp;follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turn off the auto-complete suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sign in</strong> to your Outlook.com account.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Gear icon</strong> on the right side corner of the page and select
<strong>More mail settings</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Customizing Outlook</strong>, click <strong>Advance privacy settings</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Auto-complete suggestions</strong>, select<strong> Only suggest people in my contact list</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>Hope these steps would help you with your concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you have other concerns, please let us know.</p>

<br />
Please refer to the link I provided in my post above.<br />
<br />
Read the ENTIRE THREAD.<br />
<br />
You will see that I SPECIFICALLY stated that I <b>did not want to select</b> the <i>
"Only suggest people in my contact list"</i> option.<br />
<br />
I want the auto-correct feature to suggest choices from all VALID email addresses that I have ever used.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, once one enters an email address with an error in it, there is NO WAY for one to edit, change, or correct the mistake in an email address. It remains in the auto-correct list FOREVER!!!!!<br />
<br />
That is the point. Your customers want a way to add, delete, or change entries in the auto-correct list. Unfortunately, Microsoft refuses to provide such basic features. If you read the thread I referenced, you will see (on the last page) where a representative
 from Microsoft states that Microsoft is aware of the issue and has no plans for fixing it.<br />
<br />
If you (personally) would like to be of help to your customers, then escalate this issue to Microsoft and tell them that it is common courtesy to provide their customers with the ability to edit the auto-correct list. Perhaps no one at Microsoft ever makes
 a mistake when entering an email address, but I can assure you that in the real world, mistakes are made when entering email addresses and we need a way to fix those mistakes.
<br />
<br />
Hmmmm ..... I wonder if gmail provides the ability to edit their lists? <br />

            <p>I have to say that I'm shocked to find that such an obvious and basic feature as deleting an entry from your autocomplete list is not available.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I would like to make a serious case to Microsoft as to why this should be added:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1) If you accidentally mistype an email address, the mistype will show every time you start typing the correct email address, leading to you potentially using the wrong address in the future</p>
<p>2) If an acquaintance changes their email address they wish you to use to contact them, you can remove the old email address from the autocomplete list to prevent accidentally using it again out of habit</p>
<p>3) This is a basic function that has been available in the Outlook client since at least Office XP (2002)</p>
<p>4) Several of your competitors offer this function, or something similar</p>
<p>5) As an IT service provider, I am asked by a lot of users which online email offers the most functionality.&nbsp; This will come up in conversation when I make recommendations and will be a "black mark" against outlook.com when I make recommendations.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I agree with Langware above.&nbsp; This is a basic function of email clients, whether they are online web-based clients, or offline email clients.&nbsp; He also pointed out in several places that the function of only suggesting people on his contact list was
<strong>not</strong> the function he was looking for, but he was, in both of his threads, pointed to that as a solution (even though he stated specifically that this was not the function he was looking for).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Outlook.com is still a very good online email client, and has a lot of nice functionality.&nbsp; The lack of this feature is very annoying when it becomes an issue, though, and Microsoft should look at adding this feature.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

            Thanks Hitman,<br />
<br />
The Forum Moderators who respond here cannot fix this problem. They are not Microsoft employees ... they work for the company that Microsoft contracted to run these forums. They cannot change Outlook.com's code. And the Microsoft employees, who have the authority
 to change Outlook.com's code, do not read or participate in these forums.<br />
<br />
We need to provide feedback directly to Microsoft. In the upper right or your Outlook.com window, you will see a "gear" icon. Click it. In the drop down menu, click Feedback. Follow instructions, and copy/paste your above reply into the proper input field.<br />
<br />
Perhaps if enough people complain, Microsoft will fix this BUG.<br />

            The biggest problem of course is that Microsoft and other companies employ call centres in India and other Asian, but those staff do not comprehend English language context, and many struggle with basic English. So they give the quickest response to the
 few lines that they have been able to understand - and we're left frustrated by the call centre's unwillingness to employ competent staff.<br />
<br />
Really doesn't do Microsoft and all the other companies justice by using these third rate Asian companies - because you can be assured that these issues are not being passed up the line to Microsoft as the call centres think that it would make them look bad
 by not resolving the issues, even though they can't actually resolve it<br />

            <p>If Microsoft defined the terms and conditions of their outsource contract such that all problems that the paid moderators here (and other unpaid users who volunteer their help) could not quickly solve were escalated to a second or third tier of Microsoft
 employees (who were trained in true troubleshooting), and if repeatable bugs were forwarded to the corresponding developers (with enough staff allocated so that repeatable bugs were fixed in a timely manner), then these forums would not be full of unresolved
 problems, repeatable bugs, and customer's questions with no replies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But Microsoft continues to disrespect their customers by refusing to invest more of their $20 billion dollars in quarterly revenue into significantly improving customer support while we customers are left with unresolved problems and repeatable bugs (like
 the bug described by this thread's original post .... which is almost a year old and still not fixed).<br />

</p><p>As you have noticed, the User Interface for outlook.com has changed since Alden D posted a reply on June 11, 2013. The suggestion made by Alden is as follows (with corrections made for the current interface):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turn off the auto-complete suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sign in</strong> to your Outlook.com account.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Gear icon</strong> on the right side corner of the page and select
<strong>Options</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Customizing Outlook</strong>, click <strong>Advance privacy settings</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Auto-complete suggestions</strong>, select<strong> Only suggest people in my contact list</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>However, please note that the above suggestion results in auto complete ONLY making suggestions from your contact list. If you have ever sent email to an address that is NOT in your contact list, that address will still be in your "auto suggestion" list,
 but (if you have followed the above instructions) that email address (that is not in your contact list) will no longer be auto suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want the auto complete feature to include address that are in your contact list and also addresses (that you previously used) that are
<strong>not </strong>in your contact list, then do not make the setting that is mentioned above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course the problem being discussed in this thread, is that you have no way of editing the addresses in your "auto suggestion" list (i.e., those addresses that you previously have sent email to and are not in your contact list). For years, we have been
 asking Microsoft to give us the ability to edit, add, delete entries that are in the "auto suggestion" list.</p>

<p>I'm at a loss as to why people are still posting ways to limit what is offered in auto complete, when the question is quite clear. This site has numerous threads and posts of how to hide incorrect emails.<br />
<br />
<strong>We want to be able to delete incorrect email addresses, not hide them.</strong><br />
<br />
I don't think we can put it in plainer English than that. Perhaps we need to type it in the languages that are most common in the areas that Microsoft have their call centres - to stop the continuous translation errors</p>

<h2>            Screen flickering at various times after the 10130 build</h2>
                    At this time, this screen flickering has happened during the use of explorer.&nbsp; At one time, this happened for several minutes until I had to shut it down.&nbsp; Task manager was inoperable to stop it.&nbsp; This is happening on a factory Dell with an I5 processor
 and 8g of RAM.&nbsp; It was a clean install of a previous build.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is anyone else encountering this after&nbsp;this latest build (10130).

<p>When I have a look with my PC USB, the phone memory&nbsp;free is 215 MB (of 275 MB)</p>

            you are running out of RAM. this is not free space in c: drive, this is the free random acess memory available to the OS and apps. use task managet (press and hold menu key for a few seconds to launch the task manager) to close background apps, your phone
 supports full multitasking, but every time you leave an app running in background, you use up a bit of RAM.

            <p>Thank you for the prompt reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue started when I upgraded my single licensed copy of Office 2010 to a subscription based version of Office 2016 - on Jan. , 2017. My systems is up to date and I have tried to correct the problem in a few ways. I've spoken to the people at Parallels,
 looked at the config of my vm, made sure all Word files are associated with Word and made sure Excel is the default for all Excel files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the issues. Some Excel files show the MS Excel Logo on the files's icon, others do not. Some Word files show the logo on the icon, while others do not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screenshot below shows what I am referring to. Some icons are blank with the proper extension, while others show the icon with the associated app and ext.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ced6db22-93b0-4cf7-82af-c2d3ef943d2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ced6db22-93b0-4cf7-82af-c2d3ef943d2e" /></a></p>

            Thank you for the update. Just to clarify, have you tried to repair your Word and Excel applications? This is for us to check if those applications are updated and to check if your files will show up the right logo based on their file type.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, kindly please perform the steps below to check if this action will work for you to open these files&nbsp; successfully.<br />
<br />
1. Right-click one of the file, then choose <strong>Open with</strong>.<br />
2. On the pop-up window, please select Excel or Word based on the file type you are trying to open.<br />
<br />
We look forward to your update.

</p><p>I was finally able to get this application to load and run. It issued several reports, nothing that I could really make sense of. It did show I was running a VM using Parallels on a machine running OSX.</p>

</p><p>No change in the icons either. Again, all files open with the proper application, it's just the icon/logo that is missing ~ perhaps cosmetic???</p>

</p><p>Sounds like W8 in Desktop mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or that you have OSK already running--then the TIP will not show at all, automatically or by request.&nbsp;&nbsp; FWIW I have only used W10 in a VM so I can't really say whether W10 has fixed this designed deficiency.&nbsp; I suspect not.</p>

<p>Hello Ramona,<br />
<br />
It seems that you are encountering challenges accessing your password-protected notebook sections in OneNote. We recommend going through the following methods below to troubleshoot this concern.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Safe Mode<br />
<br />
</strong>Starting a Microsoft Office for Windows application in Office Safe Mode can allow you to safely use it when it has encountered certain problems. Refer to this support article on how to:<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Open-Office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-Windows-PC-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Open
 Office apps in safe mode on a Windows PC</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Repair Office</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If an Office application such as Word or Excel isn’t working correctly, sometimes restarting it will fix the problem. If that doesn’t work, you can try repairing it. Refer to this support article on how to:<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Repair
 an Office application</a>.</p>

            I was able to deal with my particular problem by opening the older version of One&nbsp;Note and in that version I was able to open the password protected notebook. &nbsp;I copied the information and created a new section in the latest version of One Note. &nbsp;So yes
 I took care of my particular problem, but I don't think the issue is truly resolved, just resolved with a work-around.&nbsp;

<p>Hello GoodnewsAjilo,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, you need 5 licenses at least in your Office 365 Business Premium tenant. To license them, please see the below picture:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31882a3a-7873-44e1-9572-4f8b7c744b4e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31882a3a-7873-44e1-9572-4f8b7c744b4e?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your reference: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/subscriptions-and-billing/assign-licenses-to-users?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Assign licenses to users in Office 365 for business</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you need to purchase more license, please see
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/subscriptions-and-billing/buy-licenses?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> to get the detailed information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, if you only have 1 license and don't want to buy more, you may try the
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/email/create-a-shared-mailbox?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Shared Mailbox</a> which doesn't need license but can help you achieve the function of co-working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the above information helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rudy</p>

</p><p>If you are trying to create&nbsp;a Skype&nbsp;account using a <strong>phone number </strong>
or an <strong>email address</strong>, it will send a verification code&nbsp;to the security information you have used in the account creation process. This is to ensure that you have access to the security information in case you need to recover the account in the
 future.</p>

<h3> matth2000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 &#47; Exchange 2010 Hybrid Setup - multiple connected domains</h2>
                    <p>We have an Exchange 2010 / Office 365 hybrid setup. We have had this in place now for about 4 years. We have all mailboxes migrated to Office 365. The admin of these mailboxes is still done via the local Exchange servers Exchange Management Console and synched
 via AD Connect. Since creating this hybrid setup, the company has purchased other businesses which we have added to the hybrid setup. These businesses have kept their own domains but have used our hybrid setup for email using the Office 365 / Hybrid system.
 So they have their own domain completely separate to ours but share our email system.
</p>
<p>The IT guys in these other domains have to remotely login to our Exchange server when they have to create an account or make some changes that cant be done via the Office 365 portal. Also, remote users not connected to the domain cannot change their passwords
 as they are not connected to our domain. We have an ADFS website setup so that they can change their passwords but this isn’t forced like it is when connected to a domain with group policy. It causes problems for both users and admins to maintain passwords,
 manage emails and so on.</p>
<p>Essentially what I am asking is, is there an easier way to do all this, what other options do I have? We need to make things easier for our overseas IT administrators and also password changes / forced password changes more effective.</p>
<p>Thanks all in advance.</p>

<p>Hello MattH2000,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to post here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your description,<span>&nbsp;
</span>may I know how do you add those businesses into your organization's Hybrid scenario? In my opinion, those businesses' admin should have an account which is hosted on your on-premises
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/exchange-hybrid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Exchange server</span></a> and not as a remote user to connect to server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And all those businesses' users should can change and manage their password easily as they are also hosted on the same AD and Exchange server as you.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to your update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rudy</p>

<p>Hi Rudy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes those IT admins do have an account on our network with domain admin privileges so that they can create and manage AD / Exchange accounts which then sych to Office 365.</p>
<p>Yes those users are hosted on the same AD as ours, but that is only their Exchange account. Those not on our AD are on their own completely separate AD networks.</p>
<p>So essentially they log onto their computers connecting to their separate domain then they open their Outlook which connects to Office 365 and opens their Exchange account which is essentially administered from our network.</p>
<p>So these users that are not on our domain are connected to a separate domain and therefore can not easily change their passwords.</p>
<p>Hopefully that makes sense.</p>

<p><span>As their Exchange account and AD account</span><span>
</span><span>are managed separately</span><span>. If you want to change the password of Exchange account, while the AD account's password also be changed. The suggested way is
</span><span>that move all users from their exist AD environment to yours to uniform their account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it doesn't meet your scenario, can you share a example with us about your concern? Your time is appreciated.</p>

<p>I don't think moving all the other businesses to our domain would be an option.&nbsp;They&nbsp;are already on their own separate domains and removing those and connecting to ours would be a mammoth task and very&nbsp;disruptive.</p>
<p>All I am really after are the following below, is there any way of doing this other than joining them to our domain?</p>
<p>
</p><p>IT administrators - We want the IT admins that setup and manage the email accounts to be able to do this without having to remote into our Exchange server. Is there an easier way to do this? Something allowing them to do this on their premises without having
 to log into our servers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forced Password change - We need to be able to make the Office 365 Exchange users to be forced to change their passwords every three months. Currently this only happens via GPO forcing users connected to our network to do this. All the users that are connecting
 outside the network never have to change their passwords which is not very security efficient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your help and advice with this Rudy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello MattH2000,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For any Office 365 online host user, their admin can setup the password expiration policy to let them change the password if needed, please see
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-the-password-expiration-policy-for-your-organization-0f54736f-eb22-414c-8273-498a0918678f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> to get the detailed information. For the local Exchange server users, the admin can enable the OWA password expire prompt in Client Access server, please see
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/exchange-server-2010/bb684904(v=exchg.141)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in my opinion, the IT admins need to remote into your Exchange server as them are outside of your domain. Meanwhile, we recommend you go to our
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?category=exchangeserver%2Cexchange2010%2Cexchangeserverlegacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi Rudy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted in TechNet about this. A helpful user suggested upgrading our Exchange 2010 to Exchange 2016 and we could then use the Exchange EAC which is a web based version of the management console used for administering Exchange. This would allow our overseas
 users to do the user account setups via Internet Explorer over the web.</p>
<p>My understanding is that if you have a hybrid setup then you can get a free on premise Exchange 2016 license key. Is this still correct even though we are using Exchange 2010 (fully licensed version)?</p>
        </p>

<p>I was just hoping someone could advise what my options are in regards to removing the Exchange Hybrid part of the setup?</p>
<p>What we would like to be able to do is fully create, manage and administer Exchange accounts online in the cloud Office 365 portal only. This way the overseas IT departments would never have to login to our office here to administer Exchange accounts. We
 would still need to keep the local AD though and have it possibly synching to Office 365. Is something like this possible?</p>

<p>Hello MattH2000,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to post back. If you means the Hybrid Edition Server key, the answer is no. it is suitable for Exchange 2003 and 2007 on-premises server. For detailed information, please see
<a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/exchange/microsoft-exchange-licensing-faq-email-for-business" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a good way is that you
<a href="https://products.office.com/en-sg/business/compare-more-office-365-for-business-plans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
purchase</a> an Office 365 for Business tenant for those businesses directly. And then you can
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/set-up-directory-synchronization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
sync</a> the local AD with Office 365 if needed via AAD connect. </p>

<em>without</em> quoting this post: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1b. Did the computer come with Win8 preinstalled or...?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1c. Is Windows 64-bit or 32-bit installed? See <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit</font></a> [good for Win8, too]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your currenty-installed <em>third-party</em> anti-virus application or security suite (if any) and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. What third-party anti-spyware applications (i.e., <em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em>) are installed, if any? What third-party firewall, if any?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer<em>s since you bought it?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer
<em><u>when</u> you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Is KB2916626; KB2898785, KB2893294, KB2892074 and/or KB2893984 listed in <strong>
Installed Updates </strong><em>(not <strong>Update History</strong></em>)<em>?</em> [1]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; PC Doctor;
 TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; Comodo System Cleaner; Advanced System Optimizer; CCleaner

            <p>1. You did a clean install of Win8 64-bit in 2012,&nbsp;is that correct?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. When (approx. date) was Win8.1 installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Was Win8.1 Release Preview (beta)&nbsp;ever installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Is Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall enabled?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Is Automatic Updates set to the default Automatic setting?</p>

<h2>            Touch, touchpad, usb mouse, keyboard gone crazy on Medion &#40;Lenovo&#41; Akoya touch notebook</h2>
                    <p>I have updated from Windows 8.1 to a 99xx build and did not experience such problems. It was introduced with build 10041 and continues with build 10049.</p>
<p>During update installation of 10049, I noticed balls moving/dancing along a virtual vertical line in the middle of the screen. This appears first, in a installation step beyond the initial setup step. I managed to restart a couple of times, but the issue
 is persistent.</p>
<p>E.g.</p>
<p>Not touching the notebook, the lock screen shivers and finally pulls up by itself, showing the sign in screen.</p>
<p>Touching the touchpad shows a pointer shivering along that virtual vertical line in the middle and another pointer that I can move over the screen, but disappears as soon as I withdraw from the touchpad.</p>
<p>Very difficult to get focus to the password box and then focus is lost again almost immediately.</p>
<p>Suspect it to be a drivers issue.</p>

            <p>Hi Joscelin,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 Technical preview.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can understand how frustrating it can be when things don’t work as expected. I'd be glad to help you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you boot the Computer in safe mode and check if the issue persist.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Safe mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly or that might prevent Windows from starting correctly. Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please refer below link on how to boot computer in safe mode.</span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> &nbsp;To exit from safe mode, restart your computer and let the Windows start normally.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the computer works fine in safe mode, </span><strong><span>Perform a clean boot</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>

</span></p>

</p><p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting".</span></p>

            <p>Hi Sara,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry that it took me so long. Now having found the time and reading your first step on how to set up for boot options, I thought this to be a showstopper, as with the situation described, I could not even manage to sign in to Windows. Nevertheless, I booted
 and to my surprise this time the issue did not reproduce. Probably some setup going on as it took a very long time with a black screen before the desktop showed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The notebook was fully configured on Windows 8.1 before I updated to Windows 10 TP, i.e. Synaptics Pointing Device Driver and Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center were amongst the installed programs. I have uninstalled those in order to prevent further trouble.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarted a couple of times to get past the Update errors and now getting Windows up to date... slowly.</p>

<p>Wait, not so good, the problem returned.</p>

<p>To get rid of it, I tried the following. Booted with build 10041 iso from usb drive. Issue already shows at first setup screen. I have cancelled the setup. Next, I have booted from the original Windows 8.1 recovery dvd. No input device issues at first setup
 screen. I have cancelled this setup as well. I will wait for the next build on iso, hoping that this turns out to be only a temporary issue.</p>

            <p>The good news for Microsoft is that it is not in Windows, which is the bad news for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course I thought at first that it was a Win 10 IP issue, but meanwhile I have tried a setup with the Windows 8.1 disc that came with the notebook, having removed all internal disc partitions. Issue starts showing already after one of the restarts during
 setup. As I have an identical machine which I had to clean up as well, I learned that there is no issue with Windows, but that most likely there is a hardware defect in the touch panel. Just received an email from the distributor to do some checks to confirm
 that, but thought I better update here already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, keep up the good work. Looking forward eagerly to the next build for my desktop pc and my Lumia.</p>

                    <p>// Request also sent via Window 10 Feedback Tool.&nbsp; Also, some of these are copied suggestions from ZDNET.&nbsp; //</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Command prompt requests (since Windows 10 is moving into new territory, now is the time to address of some of these concerns).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>•Tabbed Interface: provide the ability to have multiple tabs in a single command prompt window
</p>
<p>•Highlighted Elevated Privileges: When invoking the command prompt--or any application or dialog for that matter--make a colored border or something to stand out so the user is aware that a particular CMD, PS, or dialog box is elevated
</p>
<p>•SSH: Provide native ability to SSH and SCP into other systems (Windows and *nix)
</p>
<p>•Bash-Style Autocomplete. </p>
<p>•ANSI Colors: A system of escape sequences to the command prompt to make changes in color and some related characteristics.&nbsp; For example, make directories show in one color while files are relected in another.
</p>
<p>•Retain History Between Sessions: This is big.&nbsp; Why not incorporate a history feature similar to *nix that is persisent between sessions?
</p>
<p>•Dump CMD, Move To PowerShell:&nbsp; However, only do so if PS can natively read and process legacy Windows's command and environment variables.

<p>There numbers go up to 1008.&nbsp; I don't mind if the asterix are kept as long as the words between and including

<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to do this?&nbsp; I had a look at a few pages on wildcards but could only find a way to delete different letters

<h2>            Logo Pixelated when Word&#47;Excel saved as PDF</h2>
                    <p>I'm on a Mac.</p>
<p>When I insert a picture file into the header of the Word doc. I'm using a high-res. jpeg. The logo looks great and crisp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I save as a PDF and select the highest resolution under the 'tools' image compression. When you open the PDF in Acrobat and zoom in, the logo edges are a little pixelated. This is a completely vectorized logo, no type to be messing things up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened multiple times with different ways of saving the PDF settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When on a PC, the resulting PDF is terrible. Very pixelated.</p>

            Just for a test. Save as a png file the original then create the PDF from that. Or if you have Acrobat, or PDFpen save everything without the image. Then insert the image into the PDF program.&nbsp;And save as PDF.&nbsp;

    <title>N95 Firmware update - Not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vered---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N95 Firmware update - Not</h2>
                    I recently purchased a new N95 RM-160. Firmware 10.2.006.<br />
Phone is connected correctly to PC.<br />
I downloaded lasted Nokia Software Updater (NSU) V1.4.23en.<br />
NSU does not find any need to update the s/w to version 20.0.015, which I understand is the latest. And this is very sad :-(. Can anyone in Nokia explain? Or help?

            If the nokia software updater doesn't allow you to update then your phone is most likely network branded or network locked. Most networks don't bother approving new updates leaving thier customers stuck with old firmware.<br />
<br />
If your phone isn't network locked see this faq for more info: <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4577229#faq35" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://europe.nokia.com/A4577229#faq35</a><br />
<br />
A nokia care point/service centre may be able to update it for you.

            Thanks for the reply. I was able to by-pass the restrictions imposed by Telstra. The Nokia Software Update now takes me from 10.2.006 =&gt; 11.2.009, and no further. I have tried a few different product codes and cannot get the NSU to go to version 20.0.015.
 Any help on that? BTW: back-up and restore issue (into newer version) which crashes the firmware is a real nightmare. Do you have a contact person in Nokia I can vent to? As a s/w developer myself, I would NEVER release s/w that fails so dramatically.

            Hi, I would be interested in how you by passed the Telstra restrictions. I have a N95 and no matter what I do, change product code etc, I can't get NSU to update my phone. The latest version is now 12. something..

            <p>Hi NileshMayekar,</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for posting on forum.</p>
<p>I understand that you have an issue with update your Nokia Lumia 625 to 8.1 version.</p>
<p>Please let us know more information about your issue.</p>
<p>What error code or message did you get?</p>
<p>Did you try to restart your phone and start again with update?</p>
<p>I would recommend also to check if you have enough space on your phone and try to use other Wi –Fi&nbsp; connection.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Edit:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have any suggestions regarding phone, update 8.1 or system itself, please post them here on this official suggestion site:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say <em>Skype Logs, </em>are you referring to your chat or messages history?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, conversation history from the last 30 days is saved on the cloud which means these messages within the 30 day period will be visible to other devices when you sign in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For other messages older than that, they are saved to your local drive depending on how you had it set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also export/import/back up Skype messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer to this link for more information on how to&nbsp;configure&nbsp;your chat history on your local drive:
