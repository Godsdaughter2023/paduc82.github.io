    <title>Green Dots on Surface 3 Screen &#40;Glitter effect&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fireblaze97  say:</h3>
<h2>            Green Dots on Surface 3 Screen &#40;Glitter effect&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So I have done some research on this issue with the surface 3's and I cannot come up with a definitive answer. It appears to be a common problem with surface 3 owners that are not fixed by simply trading their device in under warranty (which is not an option
 for me) So what people are saying is its a driver or graphical issue within the screen. How do I correct and fix this issue? It only presents itself on a black or dark background. My computer is up to date on the Intel(R) HD Graphics and as of just a few min
 ago up to date on Windows Updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many months ago I posted this thread:&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surf3-surfdrivers/1-purple-vertical-line-on-surface-3-screen/a722d90c-4d05-4c97-9a4a-933c9adf4600</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where I was told to hold off on a repair for a vertical line that kept appearing. This line still exists today, but its very faded and never shows up unless my face is pressed against the screen and be brightness all the way up with a black background on.
 And even then its not there 100% of the time. I either didn't notice or just now got this new glitter effect issue but its puzzling me to what the issue really is. I either have a very defined graphical issue or the screen is faulty. Its in a heavy duty case
 and has a nice screen protector on it and is well kept, this isnt&nbsp;from dropping it, which I never have... so help, please? Im super confused right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updating the driver for HD Graphics (Already up to date)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updating Windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>Power cycling via restart</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turn off Night Light</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cycle brightness&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updating&nbsp;Generic PnP Monitor (Already up to date)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updating Surface Display Calibration (Already up to date)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shutting down and restarting</p>

<p>Hi FireBlaze97, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We suggest that you try running the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit. The toolkit runs through a series of tests to diagnose the hardware of your Surface device.
<span>The diagnosis and repair time averages 15 minutes or less, but can take an hour or longer. Click
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> on how you can run the toolkit. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If running the toolkit did not help, try to boot the device in UEFI and check if the line will appear. If the line appears then this is hardware related.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the line does not appear, then this is software driven. You may want to

            Ok So I ran the tool and it found no issues. I then booted into UEFI. The faint pink line did not show up, however, the dots, the glitter effect was very present throughout the screen. I have not performed a reset yet, do you think these glitter dots are
 part of hardware?&nbsp;

    <title>Melee, melee, and more melee. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dre g writer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Melee, melee, and more melee.</h2>
                    
<p>Man, I'd never thought that I would be running melee builds in this game knowing how powerful weapons get the closer you are to the enemies.<br />
<br />
But lately, I been running melee builds for multiple classes now and I must say, they are my most powerful builds. They out-class and out-damage my weapon and power builds by far.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My three favorite melee characters is the N7 Shadow infiltrator, Krogan battle master vanguard, and Krogan warlord sentinel.<br />
<br />
I never knew just how effective these melee builds are until I started stacking all those melee perks, melee weapon mods, and melee equiptment together to do one-hit kills on high difficulties.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;What I like about my melee classes is although they all are doing melee, they each have a different style of melee play, but each are very powerful to get the job done.<br />
<br />
The infiltrator's shadow strike, while cloaked is a deadly combo as I can appear at the back's of enemies without them even knowing it and kill them, and from this one video I saw on youtube, I now know how to manipulate the cool down timer for a very short
 1 sec cool down, so I can constantly cloak and shadow strike once per second.<br />
Out of the 3, she disposes the most amount of enemies the quickest as the cool down starts the moment I start the shadow strike leaving me with one second left of cooldown after the strike has completed, allowing me to zip from enemy to enemy in one second
 per enemy. And then I pile on a bunch of melee buffs to where I can hit a Brute on gold and leave em with one bar of armor left.
<br />
She's pretty much a glass canon though, so I must stay in cloaked mode or else I get my **** handed to me as she doesn't have no more than 650 health.<br />
<br />
The Warlord Sentinel has a completely different way of doing melee as he isn't stealthy like the N7 shadow. He just straight sprints up to the enemy and drops the ban-hammer on them, literally.
<br />
His rage ability procing after every kill, is the key here, as he gains over double melee damage and damage reduction on top of the damage reduction from tech armor and his regening health make him a mobile, and hard to kill tank, allowing him to take the punishment
 as he closes in to the target, unlike the N7 shadow, were she must stealth to get in close or else she'll die. The biotic hammer along with multiple melee buffs make him do the most melee damage out of all my melee builds.
<br />
All but the toughest enemies on gold will out right die on one hit. He's also the most difficult to use as he has to run up to an enemy to kill them while taking damage to close in and avoid damage and can't hide behind cover, where as the other two, has teleporting
 abilities and can use cover.<br />
<br />
The vanguard krogan is probably my favorite class as he has the most survivability, although his melee damage pales in comparison to the N7 shadow and Krogan warlord. He isn't stealthy, and he doesn't sprint up to the enemy either, he's like a mixure of the
 warlord and N7, how he just appears right in front of targets with his biotic charge like the N7 and be a tank like the Warlord.
<br />
His biotic charge is quite amazing if you choose the perk that doesn't cause a cool down sometimes. I usually always select the 100% shield gain on biotic charge, but this one time, I choose the no cooldown perk and I learned the no cool down is more effective
 as I was able to charge as many as 5 times in a row.<br />
I usually just charge something and then Melee them, to activate rage. By his shield constantly going up and having barrier up, he's a even better tank than the warlord as I can quickly get out of a sticky situation with the charge and restore my shields a
 bit and then charge again. I also use the biotic charge when I see an enemy about to do a powerful attack to avoid it.<br />
<br />
I VERY rarely use the weapons. I mostly get the lightest weapons with the weapon mods that help power and melee damage.<br />
<br />
if you guys haven't tried a melee build, I suggest you guys try it. It's more effective than I thought.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Anyone else use melee builds??? I would like to hear some other melee build ideas I should try.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Melee is ok for bronze or silver. I dont use it. Would much rather use the points for defense. Your melee playing would be a one way ticket out of my room. This style is point who*ing. Melee players have no sense of team work. Its all I have to kill this,
 oh I have to kill that. In a game meant for teamwork there is no room for a melee only guy. I get it. You can deal more damage and kill more with your melee but what your doing is quite novice. This way is fun for like one or two days. People dont like playing
 with melee players. I only host and almost every Warlord that I have let in has cleared my rom after the match because that player made the game no fun. When a Warlord is running around like an idiot stealing everyone kills. I dont let them in my rooms anymore.
 A Warlord will kill my room, and then sit there like im going to keep him around. Im guessing you dont do this on gold or platinum. I only play gold and I cant tell you how many times ive seen Krogans go melee crazy only to get downed in the middle of about
 10 enemys. Im not trying to be mean but I can say that I do not support melee only or melee only teammates.

<p>The most fun that I had with Melee was the first 10 days or so that I had the EDI (AIU Infiltrator) Character, which was unfortunately quickly nerfed by BioWare because of its devastating results. If you're looking for a new Melee "experience", Dre G Writer,
 I recommend that you hit Deaths Head 200 up for his link (buried deep within these forum archives) of the Volus sporting a 'Batarian Gauntlet', that was excellent...:-)</p>

<p>Hello "Arkham99" &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>My Volus Adept uses his 4 Orb Charges to keep my Power Recharge Speed at +200% when using heavy weapons; the Shotgun modded with the Omni-Blade attachment (+50% melee damage) along side of spamming Shield Boost is absolutely hilarious when combined with
 the Batarian Guantlets bonus gear &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>The most fun that I had with Melee was the first 10 days or so that I had the EDI (AIU Infiltrator) Character, which was unfortunately quickly nerfed by BioWare because of its devastating results. If you're looking for a new Melee "experience", Dre G Writer,
 I recommend that you hit Deaths Head 200 up for his link (buried deep within these forum archives) of the Volus sporting a 'Batarian Gauntlet', that was excellent...:-)</p>

I have three voluses but I've never used them before. I will have to see what they are capable of. From what I hear on the forums and watching videos, I heard he can turn invisible without a cooldown. So I can see how he is capable of turning invisible and
 meleeing targets................*big grin on my face*........this will be interesting!!</p>

<p>I feel dumb now but Lei i had no idea that Volus orbs would give you 200% recharge on shields. It makes sense. The Juggy has the same thing with four siege pulses. Now I wonder if the collector has this as well. .
</p>
<p>Arkham: Tell me about Edi before nerfed please. I didnt know about this.</p>
<p>Dre: The volus can turn invisible with the push of the L3 button but it only lasts for maybe 3 or 4 seconds. Its certainly not a tactical cloak but useful all the same. Especially for a volus medic.</p>

<p>Hello "BAD 2020" &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, I think that you get a +10% or a +15% Power Recharge Speed for each Orb that you have. &nbsp;I barely use my Volus Adept, but I'm pretty sure that its a +15% per Orb.</p>

<p>I tried using the Volus, and I got owned, pretty damn bad. I need to learn how to use this character and his powers correctly. Although I only did one match though.</p>
<p>I mostly use melee because my weapons are pretty weak. Level one or two gold weapons and stuff. Good defense is a good offense.</p>

<p>Volus isnt a killer. He is a support class. I have seen a few vanguard Volus doing pretty decent but this is extremely rare. The medic version is a great teammate. Running around getting people up. The volus is a huge help on escorts. &nbsp;He could also be a
 juggys best friend. </p>

<p>Melee isn't a Volus's strong point, but it is absolutely hilarious when they're equiped with the Batarian Gauntlets indeed &nbsp;LOL &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Furthermore, this little guy can be surprisingly tough to take down (granted that your spamming out " Shield Boost " like there is no tomorrow) and in my opinion; he must always have a +200% Power Recharge Time to be used effectively &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>Hello Irfan,</p>
<p>Thanks again for your response. Since I wrote you last Ihave discovered through my system status (control panel) that my Windows 7 activation status and product ID are unavailable. I therefore followed instuctions from microsoft help and support in order
 to activate.&nbsp; Again I was given error code D0000034 as before with the update problem.However I was given the option to phone , but was given no phone #.&nbsp;I purchased the Windows 7 DVD and installed&nbsp;on PC which was custom built for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the microsoft website
 for help and support&nbsp;I was asked for the product&nbsp;ID which they&nbsp;said is a 20-digit #.&nbsp; The only&nbsp;no. I have is the product key which is a 25-alpha-numeric.&nbsp; I tried to enter that&nbsp; and did not go through.&nbsp; Therefore I'm told that I can pay for help since I dont't
 have the product ID.&nbsp; Perhaps this is not your area of expertise,Irfan,but&nbsp;I was hoping...I did re-install windows about last april when I had problems , and probably didn't re-activate ?? What do you think?&nbsp; If you can get me back on track I&nbsp;would be so grateful
 and thanks again for being such a big help!!</p>
<p>wandrinstar</p>
<p>&nbsp;Please ignore above request . I have since re-activated Windows and problem was resolved with phone technical support and thanks again for your assistance, Irfan. Also thanks to all the folks answering phones at microsoft. The experience I had was truly
 a pleasure. I was not expecting such a courteous and professional attitude.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work,</p>
<p>wandrinstar</p>

</p><p><strong>Doing the Repair Update</strong></p>
<p>The repair upgrade is a straightforward process. Simply boot to your Windows 7 desktop. Insert your Windows 7 installation DVD, then click
<strong>Install Now</strong>.</p>

<p>When the setup menu appears, click <strong>Upgrade</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Step-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f08%2fStep-2_thumb.jpg" height="410" width="545" /></a></p>
<p>Setup will begin copying files. This will also replace any broken operating system files that might be preventing Windows from functioning properly.</p>

<p>There you have it: your personal files and installed applications are preserved. I found this especially handy for fixing corrupt operating system features. For example, I had disabled some features in Turn Windows Features on or off. When I
 tried to re-enable them, they would not work. Repair upgrade was able to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, this means you will need to reapply any updates, since it basically replaces certain applications. It is an inconvenience, but achieves a functioning system if all else fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Media Center still does not launch, its probably best you do a custom install.</p>

                    <p>I noticed My gamer score decreased by over 23k the other day and every single Xbox one game shows 0 gamer score when I click On the game itself it shows all unlocked etc. I was Assured by&nbsp;multiple people at Xbox Live support that it was a issue with Xbox insider program and this wasn’t a isolated incedent and that my gamer score would correct itself within a few days, now it has&nbsp;been almost 2 weeks and nothing has happened and when I reach out to Xbox Live support they say there is nothing they can do. I’m very displeased with the help received from xbox and it’s&nbsp;support team. I Have been a member for over 10years and &nbsp;this is frustrating to be told nothing can be done when you&nbsp;can go to My account and correct the problem manually, which is what should have been done in the first place. I will be leaving the insider program to assure this doesn’t continue to happen, and more problems don’t happen that will “fix themselves”&nbsp;Fix your **** and fi

<h2>            Bad drivers for ATIV 500T running Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>When Windows 8.1 was released, I've upgraded my ATIV and eveything has gone well.</p>
<p>Some time ago, i've got a system crash and i needed to restore to windows 8 and format everything. After that i've tried all that i can, but the 500T stucked in the reboot after upgrading with a blue&nbsp;led flickering with a regular "click". After a lot of
 time waste, I've upgraded to 8.1 after have removed like every driver that was in the system. Now I've Windows 8.1 but the audio drivers are not working. I mean, I've removed Realtek and Intel sound card drivers, and if I try to reinstall this two i can ear
 sounds (but the flickering and clicking come back) and after a reboot the only thing that I can do it's restore Windows from a backup.
</p>
<p>Every driver was upgraded with SW update or with Windows Update, tried all the combinations that I could try (only one, both, none...).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone know how to restore the old Realtek sound driver now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

 I am actually not able to keep the device off as it comes back on every time after about ten minutes. Have only McAfee. Thanks

<h2>            How to disable thumbnails for tif files only&#63;</h2>
                    


Since the Tiff bug (system freezes for minutes when going near large (above 700 MB -1 GB) tiff files with layers and compression) has been around for years and MS doenst seem to give a **** to fix this on a Win7 64 bit system wich im sure a lot of photographers use, i would like to know if there is a possible workaround. 


Sure i could just disable the whole thumbnailing thing, but i dont want that, for the files it actually works with its very practical. 


So can i somehow exclude just the tif files from the thumbnail creation process?

            Hmm I see -- looks like I should not have assumed on that one. &nbsp;I'll keep digging, I know there is a key that defines which types generate previews.
<div><br />
<div>Update: &nbsp;After more research, it appears that the thumbnail generation on Windows Vista/7 is built such that it is not possible to selectively disable thumbnail generation on a file type basis. &nbsp;I apologize for my mistake.</div>

            <p>I Just created a file from a google image, i dont think i&nbsp;can make a small one, the file is now 1,2 GB in size. I increaced the size to 5500 x 4125 pixels, made 3 layer copys of the image, did some masking and effects, and set the colors to 16bit).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then&nbsp;i opened the RessourceMonitor in the Drives section. And opend the files location in the explorer. There i could see the explorer was at the file for 2 minutes (displayed the thumbnail after half the time, but still kept reading the file intensly, slowing
 down other processes on that drive).</p>
<p>Ram usage went from 15% up to 100% of 8GB Ram, Pagefile usage also from 20% up to 85%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A third party program created the thumbnail in 5 seconds and then was done with the file. And no notable spike in RAM usage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So that file is not a system killer (might be on a system with less RAM) but it still almost freezes my machine for 2 minutes for other stuff on the same drive as the tif. And it was just one file, with more in one location&nbsp;it might be more of a problem</p>

    <title>storAHCI.sys - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jocan70  say:</h3>
<h2>            storAHCI.sys</h2>
                    I was having major problems with my laptop showing in task manager that the disk was constantly at 100% and was incredibly slow. I looked up on Support.Microsoft.com for a solution and instructions appeared to be that it was caused by storAHCI.sys and
 I should go to registry editor and change the MSI Supported key from a value of '1' to '0'. Then reboot. I followed this, but when rebooting I received the Driver_IRQL_not_less_or_equal (storahci.sys) error and my machine would not load Windows but kept trying
 to restart. Clearly it's due to my changing the key value. What can I now do to fix this? Thanks for any help I can get.

<h2>            No Network Connection in WinXP</h2>
                    Have a HP Pavillion dv6000 laptop that was working fine one day and then the next - absolutely no network connections - either wireless or ethernet (local); even though both network adapters are installed and have most up to date drivers.&nbsp; In Network Connections&nbsp;
 there is nothing - all blank.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I choose "New Connection", it'll go to Network Connection Type and none of the boxes work.&nbsp; Will not go past this dialogue box by clicking next.&nbsp; Network Connection Wizard doesn't work at all.&nbsp; Some of the services that look
 necessary to run the wireless / ethernet - don't seem to be installed and running.&nbsp; Can't find much by Googling that helps.<br />

Anybody got any suggestions on how to get my network back without&nbsp; re-installing XP.

            Hi Tlswift, <br />
<br />
Thanks for the information. Have you tested your re-installation yet. On a side note please keep in mind that your key would be good for that type of media that was installed on your system. Meaning if you had retail XP you would need a retail key, if you had
 OEM media you would need a OEM key. Alternatively you can attempt to order replacement disks from Microsoft.&nbsp; Please see the link below as to how to order replacement media for yourself.

<p>&nbsp;Are you talking about favorites in Microsoft Edge?&nbsp;&nbsp; If so, then read the following:</p>
<p>
</p><div>Yeah, this problem is well documented on this forum... favorites just tend to magically disappear (typically associated with a windows update).&nbsp; For some, it happens more than once... and for countless thousands of others, it never happens at all.</div>
<div><br />
We haven't heard from Microsoft what the root cause is... or how to prevent it from happening again.&nbsp; Instead, they merely suggest that you ignore the problem and reload your favorites from Internet Explorer.</div>
<div><br />
However, "Reload your favorites, and hope it doesn't happen again"... isn't very comforting.</div>
<div><br />
So, first let's get your favorites back... and then we can show you an easier way to protect them for the "next time" this happens</div>
<div><br />
Part 1:&nbsp; Restoring your favorites</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
If you haven't been backing your files yourself, then don't panic... there most likely is still a way to get your favorites back</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
Windows has a built-in feature called System Restore that takes a "snapshot" of your system before it does an install, update, etc.&nbsp; This is a good thing, since a lot of people have trouble with missing favorites after a Microsoft update.</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
So, that means that this snapshot will most likely have the missing favorites.&nbsp; And now the questions are: "Do I have a viable snapshot", and "How do I get my favorites from the snapshot"</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
<em>There is supposed to be a feature in File Explorer that allows you to right click on a file (or directory) and go to properties, and select "Previous Versions".&nbsp; Unfortunately, that doesn't work for most versions of Windows 10.</em></div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
Step 1 – Do I have a viable snapshot?</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
The first step is to see if you have a recent snapshot. So, type "create a restore point" at the Cortana prompt to bring up the settings... then click on the "System Restore" button to get to the next prompt.</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4c5bb1f8-4cb6-41fa-bec0-92f9dfd854c1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4c5bb1f8-4cb6-41fa-bec0-92f9dfd854c1" /></a></div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
This will show the list of available restore points.&nbsp; Hopefully, you’ll have a recent one to use.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5e481f08-499d-4ad2-995f-e1e47a62be55" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5e481f08-499d-4ad2-995f-e1e47a62be55" /></a></div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
Step 2 – How do I get my favorites from the snapshot</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
<del>So, there are two approaches... the first is a "broad approach" that just restores everything on your PC from that snapshot.&nbsp; However, that might not be the best approach, since the snapshot may be several days old... and you'd lose everything that you
 did from that point in time.&nbsp; You'd also have to reinstall whatever update that originally caused this problem.</del></div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
<del>So, look at the date of the restore point, and decide if you want to restore everything from the snapshot or not.&nbsp; If so, just click on the Next button to start the restore.&nbsp; Warning, this takes a lot of time to complete the process (at least 20 minutes
 or so).</del></div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
The other approach is to extract only parts of the data from the restore point.&nbsp; This would probably be the most appropriate since you won't lose anything else you've done since the last snapshot.&nbsp; Plus, it will take a heck of lot less time to do.</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
Windows doesn't have a "selective restore" option, but there are some free 3rd-party applications that can do this.&nbsp; Personally, I use one called ShadowCopyView.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will allow you to view the snapshot as a hard drive... and then copy the specific files/folders
 that you want to restore.&nbsp;&nbsp; See the website <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shadow_copy_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shadow_copy_view.html</a> for more information.</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f684698-6432-4ea6-acba-5b9454fed7d9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f684698-6432-4ea6-acba-5b9454fed7d9" /></a></div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
In this case, you'd be wanting to copy the contents of the \Users\YOUR_NAME_HERE\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe folder from the backup to the same location on your C:\ drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: The AppData folder is hidden, so you might have
 to tweak the File Explorer settings to be able to see that folder.&nbsp; Also, this particular utility doesn’t overwrite existing files, so you should delete that folder first.</div>
<div><br />
Part 2:&nbsp; How to backup and restore your favorites</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
There are several techniques that you can use to backup your favorites (after you've restored or reimported them and fixed them the way you want them).&nbsp; There is a simple technique that only works if you're using the Edge "synchronization feature", and a more
 turn-key method where you install a 3rd-party application that can also protect a lot of the other Edge settings</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
1) If you are using the synchronizaton feature, you can copy the contents of the %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe\RoamingState for safe keeping.&nbsp; And then just copy it back after a crash/reset.</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
2) You can use the free 3rd-party <a href="http://www.emmet-gray.com/Articles/EdgeManage.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
EdgeManage</a> application to import/export your favorites to an HTML-based "bookmarks" file or perform a full database backup/restore.&nbsp; This technique works without regard to the synchronization setting.&nbsp; Plus, you can use this bookmarks.html file as an import
 into other browsers</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
<em>Note: The folks on the Windows Insider program have been testing a version of Edge that has native support for import/export using a bookmarks.htmls file.&nbsp; So, that pretty much means that this new feature will be in the so-called Creators Update to Windows
 10 that is expected in April.</em></div>
<div><br />
I would highly suggest that you use the Edge "Send feedback" tool to let Microsoft know that you've had this problem.&nbsp; The more people who report it, the less likely they will be able to ignore it.</div>

<h2>            Duration of Upgrade Windows10</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>Is it true that if I were to upgrade from Windows 7 to windows 10 by the free offer that I have received will that be reversible if I don't like it and secondly there is a rumour that the upgrade is only for one year after which we will have to pay to continue
 using it ...Is that true???</p>
<p>thanks</p>

            <p>No, if you upgrade during that year - you do NOT have to pay after a year. It's just the promotion for free upgrade. After that, if you haven't upgraded yet, it will cost you. But, it's not subscription based or anything like that. You get in on the free
 upgrade sometime within that year - it's yours for the life of the product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd make a good backup of your old system in case a downgrade isn't available or fails.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I have tried installing</p>
<ul>
<li>by reserving Windows 10. (Update history shows failed attempts to install.)<br />
</li><li>by downloading the media creation tool and clicking MedaCreationToolx64.exe directly.

</p><p>All this with the same ultimate result: gets stuck at (about) 25% installation or when (about) 84% of the files have been copied. At that point, presumably when Windows is attempting a restart, the computer shuts down. After I do a manual restart, it reverts

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You will experience these symptoms if you have just enough free disk space to pass the compatibility check for installing Windows 10, but not enough disk space for the additional updates that are installed during setup.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you receive these errors on a device that has little free disk space, try freeing up additional space and try again.&nbsp; Depending on the device, you may need 10-13 GB of free space to install Windows 10.&nbsp; We’re currently working on modifying
 the compatibility check so that it doesn’t underestimate the amount of space required.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, disconnect all the external devices (printers, scanner, USB (universal serial bus) drives, etc...) Except mouse and the keyboard and then try to upgrade.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Giridhar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for your helpful reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I attempted the update above I had 18 GB free space on my C drive. I cleaned up some things and brought this up to 25.6 GB and tried the update again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This also failed, but with a different message:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 30px">0xC1900101 - 0x2000C</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 30px">The installation failed in SAFE_OS phase with an error during the APPLY_IMAGE operation</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="text-align: left">I was able to find some information on the 0x2000C error, so followed some of the advice that I found there, and in the articles you sent me. I did the following</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><ul>
<li>update of the BIOS in my Lennovo Z480</li><li>cleanup of all files including system files using cleanmgr.exe</li><li>cleaned my drivers from the command prompt using the following command: rundll32.exe pnpclean.dll,RunDLL_PnpClean /DRIVERS /MAXCLEAN</li><li>did some other cleanup that got me up to 29 GB of free space</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>(For cleaning the drivers I followed the instructions at Troubleshoot common Setup and Stop Errors during Windows 10 Installation at</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-troubleshoot-common-setup-and-stop-errors/324d5a5f-d658-456c-bb82-b1201f735683">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-troubleshoot-common-setup-and-stop-errors/324d5a5f-d658-456c-bb82-b1201f735683</a>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried the update again. I got to 42% completion this time, while the update was installing features and drivers. It failed on restart with the following message:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 30px">0xC1900101 - 0x3000D</p>

<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="text-align: left">I've done a preliminary search on the 0x3000D error but most of the articles seem to be about Widows 8.1 or pre-July 29 release of Windows 10.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I also received this error. &nbsp;Per your response, I check, and I have 532 GB free on my hard disk. &nbsp;The only things physically connected to my computer are my monitor, my keyboard and mouse (both of which are wireless, as is my printer connection), and a Wi-Fi
 adapter. &nbsp;I likewise turned off my Microsoft Defender virus protection and firewall. &nbsp;The Updater app failed to run at all today (we are now on day two of this odyssey), so I attempted to follow Microsoft instructions to install the upgrade using an .iso file
 (found here&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-upgrade-to-windows-10-using-iso-files/2159c2a7-a925-4fa3-9a03-08a5e1ecf891). &nbsp;I got to about 18% installed, and it stopped and restored my previous version of Windows
 7. &nbsp;Since disk space is clearly not an issue in my install, do you have alternative suggestions?</p>

            I have 387 GB of free space and 4 GB of RAM on my Dell Inspiron 560 running Windows 7 Home Premium with Service Pack 1 Build 7601. &nbsp;When using the Media Creation Tool x64 to install Windows 10, I get the following error part way through the installation
 process:&nbsp;
<p>Error code 0xC1900101 - 0x20003</p>
<p>The installation failed in the SAFE OS phase with an error during the INSTALL_UPDATES operation.</p>
<p>And the PC has been restored back to Windows 7.</p>

            I encountered error code 0xC1900101 - 0x20003 as well; I believe this problem is caused by device drivers that are not certified.&nbsp; I updated all device drivers with the most current drivers available from the Microsoft Update Catalog.&nbsp; I uninstalled third
 party applications and started the Windows 10 download &amp; install again.&nbsp; The second install completed successfully.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi, I had the same issue and I reasoned it might be because of some unknown problem with the auto updates on my Win7 OS(corrupt file or whatever).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix it I ran Disk Cleanup -&gt; Clean up system files. Rebooted, then ran the auto update repair utility on the MS site. Then I rebooted again re-installed Win10 and it setup perfectly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My unit is a Sony Vaio laptop and it is running better now than when I bought it. Win 10 is a winner so far.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<u><b>The basic definition of a 0x116 bugcheck is:</b></u><br />
<br />
<blockquote><br />
<i>There may be a bug in the video driver or video hardware.</i></blockquote>
So, let me now explain what VIDEO_TDR_ERROR means. First off, TDR is an acronym for
<i><b>'Timeout Detection and Recovery'</b></i>. Timeout Detection and Recovery was introduced in Vista and carried over to Windows 7. Rather than putting exactly what Timeout Detection and Recovery does exactly, I'll just directly quote the MSDN article!<br />
<br />
<blockquote><b>Timeout detection:</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>The GPU scheduler, which is part of the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem (<i>Dxgkrnl.sys</i>), detects that the GPU is taking more than the permitted amount of time to execute a particular task. The GPU scheduler then tries to
 preempt this particular task. The preempt operation has a "wait" timeout, which is the actual TDR timeout. This step is thus the timeout detection phase of the process. The default timeout period in Windows Vista and later operating systems is 2 seconds. If
 the GPU cannot complete or preempt the current task within the TDR timeout period, the operating system diagnoses that the GPU is frozen.
</i><br />
</blockquote>
<blockquote><i>To prevent timeout detection from occurring, hardware vendors should ensure that graphics operations (that is, DMA buffer completion) take no more than 2 seconds in end-user scenarios such as productivity and game play.
</i></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Preparation for recovery:</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>The operating system's GPU scheduler calls the display miniport driver's
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff559815%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>DxgkDdiResetFromTimeout</b></a> function to inform the driver that the operating system detected a timeout. The driver must then reinitialize itself and reset the GPU. In addition, the driver must stop accessing memory and should not access hardware. The
 operating system and the driver collect hardware and other state information that could be useful for post-mortem diagnosis.&nbsp;
</i></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Desktop recovery:</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>The operating system resets the appropriate state of the graphics stack. The video memory manager, which is also part of
<i>Dxgkrnl.sys</i>, purges all allocations from video memory. The display miniport driver resets the GPU hardware state. The graphics stack takes the final actions and restores the desktop to the responsive state. As previously mentioned, some legacy DirectX
 applications might render just black at the end of this recovery, which requires the end user to restart these applications. Well-written DirectX 9Ex and DirectX 10 and later applications that handle Device Remove technology continue to work correctly. An
 application must release and then recreate its Direct3D device and all of the device's objects. For more information about how DirectX applications recover, see the Windows SDK.
</i></blockquote>
<blockquote>&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff570087%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Article here.
</a></blockquote>
<br />
With this being said, if Timeout Detection and Recovery fails to recover the display driver, it will then shoot the 0x116 bugcheck. There are many different things that can cause a 0x116, which I will explain below:<br />
<br />
<i>(Ensure you have the latest video card drivers. If you are already on the latest video card drivers, uninstall and install a version or a few versions behind the latest to ensure it's not a latest driver only issue. If you have already experimented with
 the latest video card driver and many previous versions, please give the beta driver for your card a try.)</i><br />
<br />
<u><b>The following hardware issues can cause a TDR event:</b></u><br />
<br />
<b>1.</b> Unstable overclock (CPU, GPU, etc). Revert all and any overclocks to stock settings.
<br />
<br />
<b>2.</b> Bad sector in memory resulting in corrupt data being communicated between the GPU and the system (video memory otherwise known as VRAM or physical memory otherwise known as RAM).<br />
<br />
<b>GPU testing:</b> Furmark, run for ~15 minutes and watch temperatures to ensure there's no overheating and watch for artifacts.<br />
<br />
<b>RAM testing:</b> Memtest - Refer to the below:<br />
<br />
<span><u><b>Memtest:</b></u></span><br />
<br />
Memtest86+:<br />
<br />
<b>Download Memtest86+ here:</b><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memtest.org/</a><br />
<br />
<b>Which should I download?</b><br />
<br />
You can either download the pre-compiled ISO that you would burn to a CD and then boot from the CD, or you can download the auto-installer for the USB key. What this will do is format your USB drive, make it a bootable device, and then install the necessary
 files. Both do the same job, it's just up to you which you choose, or which you have available (whether it's CD or USB).<br />
<br />
<b>How Memtest works:</b><br />
<br />
Memtest86 writes a series of test patterns to most memory addresses, reads back the data written, and compares it for errors.<br />
<br />
The default pass does 9 different tests, varying in access patterns and test data. A tenth test, bit fade, is selectable from the menu. It writes all memory with zeroes, then sleeps for 90 minutes before checking to see if bits have changed (perhaps because
 of refresh problems). This is repeated with all ones for a total time of 3 hours per pass.<br />
<br />
Many chipsets can report RAM speeds and timings via SPD (Serial Presence Detect) or EPP (Enhanced Performance Profiles), and some even support changing the expected memory speed. If the expected memory speed is overclocked, Memtest86 can test that memory performance
 is error-free with these faster settings.<br />
<br />
Some hardware is able to report the "PAT status" (PAT: enabled or PAT: disabled). This is a reference to Intel Performance acceleration technology; there may be BIOS settings which affect this aspect of memory timing.<br />
<br />
This information, if available to the program, can be displayed via a menu option.<br />
<br />
Any other questions, they can most likely be answered by reading this great guide here:<br />

<br />
You can run it via Windows or DOS. Do note that the only difference is simply the environment you're running it in. In Windows, if you are having what you believe to be device driver related issues that may cause conflicts or false positive, it may be a wise
 decision to choose the most minimal testing environment (DOS).<br />
<br />
Run all tests EXCEPT: Fix All, Long Generic, and anything Advanced.<br />
<br />
<b>To reset your page file, follow the instructions below:</b><br />
<br />
<b>a )</b> Go to Start...Run...and type in "sysdm.cpl" (without the quotes) and press Enter.<br />
<br />
- Then click on the Advanced tab,<br />
- Then on the Performance Settings Button,<br />
- Then on the next Advanced tab,<br />
- Then on the Virtual Memory Change button.<br />
<br />
<b>b )</b> In this window, note down the current settings for your pagefile (so you can restore them later on).<br />
<br />
-Then click on the "No paging file" radio button, and<br />
<br />
- then on the "Set" button. Be sure, if you have multiple hard drives, that you ensure that the paging file is set to 0 on all of them.<br />
<br />
-Click OK to exit the dialogs.<br />
<br />
<b>c )</b> Reboot (this will remove the pagefile from your system)<br />
<br />
<b>d ) </b>Then go back in following the directions in step a ) and re-enter the settings that you wrote down in step<br />
<br />
<b>b ).</b> Follow the steps all the way through (and including) the reboot.<br />
<br />
<b>e )</b> Once you've rebooted this second time, go back in and check to make sure that the settings are as they're supposed to be.<br />
<br />
<b>Run System File Checker:</b><br />
<br />
SFC.EXE /SCANNOW<br />
<br />
Go to Start and type in "cmd.exe" (without the quotes)<br />
<br />
At the top of the search box, right click on the cmd.exe and select "Run as adminstrator"<br />
<br />
In the black window that opens, type "SFC.EXE /SCANNOW" (without the quotes) and press Enter.<br />
<br />
Let the program run and post back what it says when it's done.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
- Overheating of the CPU or GPU and or other components can cause 0x116 bugchecks. Monitor your temperatures and ensure the system is cooled adequately.<br />
<br />
- GPU failure. Whether it's heat, power issue (PSU issue), failing VRAM, etc.<br />
<br />
<u><b>The following software issues can cause a TDR event:</b></u><br />
<br />
- Incompatible drivers of any sort <br />
<br />
- Messy / corrupt registry<br />
<br />
- Corrupt Direct X - <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/179113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/179113</a><br />
<br />
- Corrupt system files (run System File Checker as advised above)<br />
<br />
- Buggy and or corrupt 3rd party drivers. If you suspect a 3rd party driver being the issue, enable Driver Verifier:<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>What is Driver Verifier?</b><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
3. Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7)<br />
- Concurrentcy Stress Test (Windows 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
4. Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
5. Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
6. Check EVERY box that is [B]NOT[/B] provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
7. Click on Finish.<br />
&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart.<br />
<br />
<b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause /
 force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <b>not</b> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
If you did not set up a restore point, do not worry, you can still disable Driver Verifier to get back into normal Windows:<br />
<br />
- Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
<b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b><br />
<br />
It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
<b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Sincere apologies, this thread slipped through my subscriptions.<br />
<br />
The attached DMP file is of the 0x116 bug check.<br />
<br />
<u><b>The basic definition of a 0x116 bugcheck is:</b></u><br />
<br />
<blockquote><br />
<i>There may be a bug in the video driver or video hardware.</i></blockquote>
So, let me now explain what VIDEO_TDR_ERROR means. First off, TDR is an acronym for
<i><b>'Timeout Detection and Recovery'</b></i>. Timeout Detection and Recovery was introduced in Vista and carried over to Windows 7. Rather than putting exactly what Timeout Detection and Recovery does exactly, I'll just directly quote the MSDN article!<br />
<br />
<blockquote><b>Timeout detection:</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>The GPU scheduler, which is part of the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem (<i>Dxgkrnl.sys</i>), detects that the GPU is taking more than the permitted amount of time to execute a particular task. The GPU scheduler then tries to
 preempt this particular task. The preempt operation has a "wait" timeout, which is the actual TDR timeout. This step is thus the timeout detection phase of the process. The default timeout period in Windows Vista and later operating systems is 2 seconds. If
 the GPU cannot complete or preempt the current task within the TDR timeout period, the operating system diagnoses that the GPU is frozen.
</i><br />
</blockquote>
<blockquote><i>To prevent timeout detection from occurring, hardware vendors should ensure that graphics operations (that is, DMA buffer completion) take no more than 2 seconds in end-user scenarios such as productivity and game play.
</i></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Preparation for recovery:</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>The operating system's GPU scheduler calls the display miniport driver's
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff559815%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>DxgkDdiResetFromTimeout</b></a> function to inform the driver that the operating system detected a timeout. The driver must then reinitialize itself and reset the GPU. In addition, the driver must stop accessing memory and should not access hardware. The
 operating system and the driver collect hardware and other state information that could be useful for post-mortem diagnosis.&nbsp;
</i></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Desktop recovery:</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>The operating system resets the appropriate state of the graphics stack. The video memory manager, which is also part of
<i>Dxgkrnl.sys</i>, purges all allocations from video memory. The display miniport driver resets the GPU hardware state. The graphics stack takes the final actions and restores the desktop to the responsive state. As previously mentioned, some legacy DirectX
 applications might render just black at the end of this recovery, which requires the end user to restart these applications. Well-written DirectX 9Ex and DirectX 10 and later applications that handle Device Remove technology continue to work correctly. An
 application must release and then recreate its Direct3D device and all of the device's objects. For more information about how DirectX applications recover, see the Windows SDK.
</i></blockquote>
<blockquote>&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff570087%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Article here.
</a></blockquote>
<br />
With this being said, if Timeout Detection and Recovery fails to recover the display driver, it will then shoot the 0x116 bugcheck. There are many different things that can cause a 0x116, which I will explain below:<br />
<br />
<b><i>(Ensure you have the latest video card drivers. If you are already on the latest video card drivers, uninstall and install a version or a few versions behind the latest to ensure it's not a latest driver only issue. If you have already experimented with
 the latest video card driver and many previous versions, please give the beta driver for your card a try.)</i></b><br />
<br />
<u><b>The following hardware issues can cause a TDR event:</b></u><br />
<br />
<b>1.</b> Unstable overclock (CPU, GPU, etc). Revert all and any overclocks to stock settings.
<br />
<br />
<b>2.</b> Bad sector in memory resulting in corrupt data being communicated between the GPU and the system (video memory otherwise known as VRAM or physical memory otherwise known as RAM).<br />
<br />
<b>GPU testing:</b> Furmark, run for ~15 minutes and watch temperatures to ensure there's no overheating and watch for artifacts.<br />
<br />
<b>RAM testing:</b> Memtest - Refer to the below:<br />
<br />
<span><u><b>Memtest:</b></u></span><br />
<br />
Memtest86+:<br />
<br />
<b>Download Memtest86+ here:</b><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memtest.org/</a><br />
<br />
<b>Which should I download?</b><br />
<br />
You can either download the pre-compiled ISO that you would burn to a CD and then boot from the CD, or you can download the auto-installer for the USB key. What this will do is format your USB drive, make it a bootable device, and then install the necessary
 files. Both do the same job, it's just up to you which you choose, or which you have available (whether it's CD or USB).<br />
<br />
<b>How Memtest works:</b><br />
<br />
Memtest86 writes a series of test patterns to most memory addresses, reads back the data written, and compares it for errors.<br />
<br />
The default pass does 9 different tests, varying in access patterns and test data. A tenth test, bit fade, is selectable from the menu. It writes all memory with zeroes, then sleeps for 90 minutes before checking to see if bits have changed (perhaps because
 of refresh problems). This is repeated with all ones for a total time of 3 hours per pass.<br />
<br />
Many chipsets can report RAM speeds and timings via SPD (Serial Presence Detect) or EPP (Enhanced Performance Profiles), and some even support changing the expected memory speed. If the expected memory speed is overclocked, Memtest86 can test that memory performance
 is error-free with these faster settings.<br />
<br />
Some hardware is able to report the "PAT status" (PAT: enabled or PAT: disabled). This is a reference to Intel Performance acceleration technology; there may be BIOS settings which affect this aspect of memory timing.<br />
<br />
This information, if available to the program, can be displayed via a menu option.<br />
<br />
Any other questions, they can most likely be answered by reading this great guide here:<br />

<br />
You can run it via Windows or DOS. Do note that the only difference is simply the environment you're running it in. In Windows, if you are having what you believe to be device driver related issues that may cause conflicts or false positive, it may be a wise
 decision to choose the most minimal testing environment (DOS).<br />
<br />
Run all tests EXCEPT: Fix All, Long Generic, and anything Advanced.<br />
<br />
<b>To reset your page file, follow the instructions below:</b><br />
<br />
<b>a )</b> Go to Start...Run...and type in "sysdm.cpl" (without the quotes) and press Enter.<br />
<br />
- Then click on the Advanced tab,<br />
- Then on the Performance Settings Button,<br />
- Then on the next Advanced tab,<br />
- Then on the Virtual Memory Change button.<br />
<br />
<b>b )</b> In this window, note down the current settings for your pagefile (so you can restore them later on).<br />
<br />
-Then click on the "No paging file" radio button, and<br />
<br />
- then on the "Set" button. Be sure, if you have multiple hard drives, that you ensure that the paging file is set to 0 on all of them.<br />
<br />
-Click OK to exit the dialogs.<br />
<br />
<b>c )</b> Reboot (this will remove the pagefile from your system)<br />
<br />
<b>d ) </b>Then go back in following the directions in step a ) and re-enter the settings that you wrote down in step<br />
<br />
<b>b ).</b> Follow the steps all the way through (and including) the reboot.<br />
<br />
<b>e )</b> Once you've rebooted this second time, go back in and check to make sure that the settings are as they're supposed to be.<br />
<br />
<b>Run System File Checker:</b><br />
<br />
SFC.EXE /SCANNOW<br />
<br />
Go to Start and type in "cmd.exe" (without the quotes)<br />
<br />
At the top of the search box, right click on the cmd.exe and select "Run as adminstrator"<br />
<br />
In the black window that opens, type "SFC.EXE /SCANNOW" (without the quotes) and press Enter.<br />
<br />
Let the program run and post back what it says when it's done.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
- Overheating of the CPU or GPU and or other components can cause 0x116 bugchecks. Monitor your temperatures and ensure the system is cooled adequately.<br />
<br />
- GPU failure. Whether it's heat, power issue (PSU issue), failing VRAM, etc.<br />
<br />
<u><b>The following software issues can cause a TDR event:</b></u><br />
<br />
- Incompatible drivers of any sort <br />
<br />
- Messy / corrupt registry<br />
<br />
- Corrupt Direct X - <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/179113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/179113</a><br />
<br />
- Corrupt system files (run System File Checker as advised above)<br />
<br />
- Buggy and or corrupt 3rd party drivers. If you suspect a 3rd party driver being the issue, enable Driver Verifier:<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>What is Driver Verifier?</b><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
3. Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7)<br />
- Concurrentcy Stress Test (Windows 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
4. Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
5. Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
6. Check EVERY box that is [B]NOT[/B] provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
7. Click on Finish.<br />
&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart.<br />
<br />
<b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause /
 force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <b>not</b> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
If you did not set up a restore point, do not worry, you can still disable Driver Verifier to get back into normal Windows:<br />
<br />
- Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
<b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b><br />
<br />
It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
<b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />
<br />

My PC is a custom PC. I have a&nbsp;ASUS Maximus IV Extreme -Z - LGA 1155 - Z68 motherboard and an&nbsp;Intel Core i7-2600K CPU. Anyway i don't know how to fix these disc trays? any idea how? one day they just stopped working. They work fine when i click on them from
 the outside and they would eject discs and stuff, but on the PC itself they aren't working or being recognized anymore :/...

<p>Dear Barb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for you job!</p>
<p>I have been working on my surface mod 1514 with windows 10&nbsp;<span>for almost one week,
</span>my keyboard suddenly stop working. I tried many different options to resolve the problem indicated in the web. Some people with the same problem bought a new keyboard without positive results. That means, it is software problem. Last night I reset the
 surface and today it is worst, it doesn't work the pen and it is very difficult to use the keyboard in the screen with my big fingers. I hope windows or Microsoft resolve the problem.</p>
<p>I was happy with my surface but this problem make me think and decide that this is not the right computer for me.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alejandro Lucic</p>
