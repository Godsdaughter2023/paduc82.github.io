    <title>Sharing link to Document ID - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dalek_kelad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sharing link to Document ID</h2>
                    <p>We have enabled the Document ID feature on our site collection and want end users to share the document ID link for Documents similar to this: .../sitepath/layouts/15/DocIDRedir.aspx?ID=DOCIDXXXX</p>
<p>
</p><p>This used to be possible but with the recent update <em>Changes to Document ID URLs:</em> "<span>In SharePoint Online, Document ID URLs will only appear inside the Document ID column, meaning they
 will be visible on property forms in both the modern and classic experience. They will no longer be available inside the sharing dialog, or inside the callout"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the primary reasons some sites have ventured down the Document ID path is so that they can obtain a link to the document that will not change regardless of whether it is moved within the folder path or to another library within the site collection.&nbsp;
 Given all of the features for sharing a document (copy link options, sharing options), there is no library menu item that allows users to quickly obtain and share the link of the Document ID that I could find.<br />
</p>
<p>I know there are now new configuration options per the recent new feature of <em>
Customized Sharing Defaults per SharePoint Site Collection</em> but still can't find a menu callout that will allow end users to easily share the link to the Document ID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something or is the only way for a user to obtain a document ID link to share, is to navigate to the properties menu, then right-click and copy shortcut from the menu pane?</p>

<p>Hi Dalek,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your sharing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to explain that as you mentioned, the document&nbsp;ID will no longer be available inside the sharing dialog, or inside the callout. We can only get the document ID in the file&nbsp;properties menu pane.&nbsp;I appreciate your understanding.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>While Justin's correct, there's another trick that might help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start with one main presentation; it might be nothing more than a single slide listing each of the topics in your overall message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each of the topics (text box, shape, whatever) has a Hyperlink Action setting pointing to the presentation that covers that topic.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When clicked during a slide show, the topic presentation will open then quit when it gets to the end; or you can include an End Show action setting wherever you think you might want to end it yourself.&nbsp; Once the show ends, the presentation closes and leaves
 you back at the main presentation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There will never be more than two presentations open and since one of them is a single slide, there's no strain on resources.</p>

</p><p>I have created a nomination&nbsp;form&nbsp;that includes several different award categories.&nbsp; I have inserted a drop down list and I would like to be able to automatically display the award critera and information on how to apply&nbsp;for just the award that&nbsp;the user selects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't use mail merge I don't think because the form will be sent out to people who won't have access to a source document.</p>

            What type of dropdown is it?&nbsp; If a legacy formfields dropdown as used in a document that is protected for forms, you can use a Select Case construction in a macro run on exit from the dropdown that evaluates the Result of the dropdown formfield and then
 sets the corresponding text to the Result to a TextInput FormField (or if the corresponding text is too long (&gt;256 characters) have the macro code set the value of a variable in the document and have a docvariable field that will display that value as a result
 of the code updating the fields in the document.

    <title>Runtime error 6 overflow - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Runtime error 6 overflow</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've created a macro which searches the whole table and filters the results. It works fine on tables with less that 30, 000 lines however anything over 30 000 I receive the run-time 6 overflow error. I've "Dim colCounter As Long" however this still hasn't
 fixed the problem. Could you please let edit the below code, and advise me as to what it should be?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>the issue debug is on the following line:</p>
<p>main.Range("A" &amp; (CInt(colRowsToShow.Item(colCounter)))).EntireRow.Hidden = False</p>

<p>Just bought a HTC hd2 but can not sync with outlook on a XP system.&nbsp; Help desk thinks I may have corrupted the files somehow and suggest that I replace the new phone with another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other issues, my phone screen goes black while I am on the phone and I can not get to the "end call" key;&nbsp; when I get the email going on my phone it screws it up on my computer. I am a blackberry convert and think I will love this phone IF I could get it
 working right. Any thoughts or ideas?</p>

            The first thing I'd recommend is that your perform a factory reset on the phone.&nbsp; You can do this by tapping Start &gt; Settings &gt; All Settings &gt; System &gt; Clear Storage.&nbsp; This will delete all your user files, settings, and any applications you may have installed
 to the device and return it to its out-of-the-box factory settings.&nbsp; if any files were inadvertently corrupted by you or anyone else, a factory reset will restore these files and return the device to proper working order.

    <title>ctrl &#43; arrow does not work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ldhkah  say:</h3>
<h2>            ctrl &#43; arrow does not work</h2>
                    I use MS Word 2007 at work. I have Windows 7. I use keyboard shortcuts a lot to get through a document more quickly without having to change to the mouse. I especially use Ctrl + Arrow Keys to move through a document word by word instead of letter by letter.
 This shortcut has stopped working. I can use Ctrl + End or Ctrl + Home, but using the Ctrl + arrow will not work. It has to do with the control button, it seems because other shortcuts are not working the same either. Instead of Ctrl + Shift + arrow to select
 and highlight words, Shift + Arrow selects and highlights text instead. I don't know how or why this happened. It just started when&nbsp;I showed up to work yesterday morning. How do I fix it or undo what has been done to change it? Thank you.

            <p>There's is little you can do. &nbsp;You need to contact whomever created the database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the database split? &nbsp;Is the front-end password protected? &nbsp;If not, you can retrieve the back-end password very easily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you could contact Wayne at http://www.everythingaccess.com and see if he can help, but i don't know if this is a service he provides. &nbsp;If it is, you'll need to first be able to prove ownership of the database.</p>

<div>1. Read the entire history of the problem before responding.</div>

<h3> philip_95  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update from windows 8&#47;8.1</h2>
                    When Microsoft release windows 10 they will not do like update 8 to 8.1 as this will&nbsp;causes incontinence as if want to fresh installation you will need to install windows 8 then update to windows 8.1 before you can install in windows 10 and if you have
 download limit this could you may not be able to get windows 10 without going over limit. What I would think Microsoft should do is have an interface where you give windows 7/8/8.1 product key/product id and give an equivalent windows product witch can be
 used with a windows 10 installation DVD/ISO.

    <title>Malware Protection keeps trying to install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelsperry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Malware Protection keeps trying to install</h2>
                    <p>I use W8.1 modified with Classic Menu. I use a commercial AV system and their anti-malware product so I do not use Windows Defender nor Security Essentials as they would conflict with my current AV software. In fact I have completely uninstalled Defender
 using a handy utility. There are no elements remaining and no entries in the registry either. I run PSI2 to check whether all my programs are up-to-date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet Microsoft Malware Protection keeps try to install! Why? It is not needed at all and as it is part of Defender that is not on my computer why is it trying to force itself upon me? How do I permanently stop it trying to install? It is highly annoying that
 Microsoft are ignoring my wishes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice please on how to stop it (I will not re-install it as that will 'break' my AV system)</p>

            <p>You are fighting the wrong battle, which is why you'll never win.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender since Windows 8 is included as part of the original operating system installation, so it's expected to be there by Windows Update and will be updated with other operating system components any time that might occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, Defender is also specifically designed to be disabled by any properly designed and configured reputable 3rd-party security application via well documented parameters, remaining installed but silently waiting in the background on the system in case
 the primary security application should fail to operate for any reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, if the primary security system fails to initialize, Windows Defender should be re-enabled as both a warning and a fallback to basic protection until the issues with the
 primary security application can be determined and resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problems most have with this situation is attempting to fight it, since that's exactly what malware might attempt and so destined to fail or at least cause flaky, inconsistent results that can't be guaranteed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the best course of action is to instead work with the Windows Defender protection as designed and after first insuring that it is properly installed and working, then install a Windows 8.1 certified security application that will thus also be designed
 to disable Defender properly.&nbsp; If there are any problems with this occurring at that point, the issue can be researched and resolved as a supported configuration, which attempting to disable Windows Defender manually or especially trying to remove it completely
 has never been.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, you're fighting entirely the wrong battle.&nbsp; Get a clue.</p>
<p>

            <p>I am not fighting the wrong battle at all. I do not use Defender as I have other, better AV system running. The issue is that Malware Protection is being 'updated' several times a day and has been since the January updates. So why is it trying to update
 something that doesn't exist on my computer? It never did before that update and is annoyingly unwanted.</p>

            <p>If the installations of both Defender and the 3rd-party security application are working properly, the updating of Defender itself should simply maintain these operating system components just like any other, with it remaining disabled as long as the 3rd-party
 application is fully Windows 10 compliant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this isn't true, then there's either something wrong with the 3rd-party application or installation&nbsp;or the operating system installation itself.&nbsp; Removing the components of Defender in an unsupported manner&nbsp;could cause&nbsp;one such installation&nbsp;issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only people I see having such problems&nbsp;are those who attempt to circumvent this design and end up fighting the wrong battle as a result.</p>

            <p>Firstly, I am NOT using Windows 10 but as I stated I am using Windows 8.1. Defender was disabled when I installed my chosen anti-virus software about two years ago. The operating system was installed by the computer manufacturer so should be perfectly configured.
 I have allowed all the security updates ever since buying the computer, but have always been selective about other 'updates' or additions. Note also that I have been a computer user since the late 1980's and have worked in the software industry as a Technical
 Author until retirement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The change in behaviour of Defender's Malware Protection only started when the January updates were installed so there is no correlation between my AV and this unwanted behaviour. As the reports from PSI showed up several times a day since the January 'Update
 Tuesday' and not before then that indicates an issue with one of those updates, such as that for Defender itself. So I can say for certain that Microsoft have made a change that is unacceptable. I put up with it for three weeks and finally got so annoyed that
 I found out how to completely remove Defender and all its components that are not actually part of nor required by the OS. But still Microsoft insist on trying to update an element that is not present on my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So going back to the original question, how do I stop Microsoft try to update something that isn't there?</p>

</p><p>So going back to the original question, how do I stop Microsoft try to update something that isn't there?</p>

<p>With due respect I would like to ask that were you(<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/3dd4dccc-c345-e011-9577-d485645a8348" title="MichaelSPerry">MichaelSPerry</a>) Technical Writer in the past?
 Then you must know about Group Policy Editor and Registry Editor. Kindly use those tools to control Microsoft Unwanted behavior. Microsoft constantly reducing control of users over their machine . Microsoft is very aggressive these days to pushing their products
 to consumer even if they dont want it all. Microsoft offered Cortana in Win 8/8.1/10 with glamorous poster that it help you, but infact microsoft is trying to harness info and doing R&amp;D using consumer machine capabilities.
<br />
<br />
So in nutshell, kindly use gpedit and regedit to control Windows dragon. And the last word, Microsoft guys never tell you the real solution even they have knowledge about it, because they cant go against Microsoft aggressive Telemetry policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You have made the classic mistake of assuming that I wrote about Windows, I didn't. I worked for an international EDA (Electronic Design Automation) software company based in the UK and Japan. Most of our work was on UNIX systems that was later ported to
 Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no references to Defender nor any of its components in the registry and I cannot see any option in Group Policy Editor to stop this unwanted behaviour. But I will look again, just in case I missed something obscure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree that Microsoft is becoming aggressive in trying to force users to use the unwanted junk like Cortana, W10, etc. I have managed to turn off all the telemetry trick that I can find, but so many aspects are deliberately hidden from the user that I regularly
 search out any tricks, even using the computer press articles to search more deeply. It's getting to the stage that I am seriously considering building a Linux machine to get away from Microsoft's absurd behaviour.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Yes, I made a slip relating to Windows 10 vs. 8.1 above, however that doesn't really matter since Defender operates in fundamentally the same way in both operating systems, it's simply more capable in the later version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless, I won't change my answer since the issue is that removing Defender from these operating systems has never been supported by Microsoft, so the Windows Update system is simply doing what it's supposed to do, while the missing Defender is what's
 causing the current problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The core issue is whatever happened when the earlier update failed which on occasion happens, usually due to remnants of an earlier security software installation that wasn't properly removed, though there can obviously be other causes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your assumption that the computer manufacturer "perfectly configured" the original installation is one I would never make, since I know that's typically not true and in fact, many of the issues we see here are due to the imaging methods often used to allow
 for speedy production processes.&nbsp; I worked in the computer manufacturing industry as a network administrator, so I'd always used Microsoft supported installation methods to reinstall the computers I received&nbsp;from our own production&nbsp;from scratch before using
 them within&nbsp;our&nbsp;business operations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll never resolve this by attempting to modify Windows to operate the way you want, since the Windows Update system is designed to examine the system for missing updates and install them.&nbsp; Since that's based on&nbsp;a catalog of files expected to exist in
 that particular system configuration, it will continue to try installing the files it assumes that system should include.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd personally try to return the system to standard configuration and then resolve whatever initial issue cased the problem in the first place.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I don't know how you'd return to that state without a complete system Refresh.&nbsp; Since that wasn't
 typically possible after a Windows 8.1 upgrade due to the original imaging methods most manufacturers used, which I've experienced myself, the only option might be a complete operating system reinstallation.&nbsp; I fortunately managed to get a physical Windows
 8&nbsp;DVD from Dell Support before they went private to perform my own reinstallation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I can say at this point is good luck, since Windows 8/8.1 wasn't as easily repaired as with Windows 10 when the issues weren't minor.&nbsp; My own Win8.1&nbsp;system has been very well behaved since I reinstalled without any of the 3rd-party junk contained on
 the second CD they provided, since none of that was ever included within Windows itself.</p>

            <p>Defender never was part of the OS until Windows 10 appeared. It was and is an option in Windows 8.1 and earlier. Since it is optional, Windows Update should not be attempting to add any part of it to any system that does not have Defender installed and active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Defender is very poor compared to other anti-virus systems, as shown by numerous independent tests, there is no need for any of it on a computer that runs a professional anti-virus system. Indeed, the whole AV industry advises against having two AV
 systems present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I return to the original question that has been avoided by some so far and that is 'How do I stop it trying to add Malware Protection to my system that does not have Defender installed?'</p>

<p>Windows Defender helps protect your computer against pop-ups, slow performance, and security threats caused by spyware and other unwanted software by detecting and removing known spyware from your computer.

<p><strong>Windows Defender<br />
</strong>In Windows 8.1, Windows Defender has been upgraded from antispyware to a full-featured antimalware solution capable of detecting and stopping a wider range of potentially malicious software, including viruses. Windows 8.1 users no longer need Microsoft
 Security Essentials, because Windows Defender is now just as powerful.&nbsp;&lt;SNIP&gt; Therefore, it’s good to know that
<p>
</p><p>Since Windows 7,&nbsp;Windows Defender has been included in the operating system itself and though it could be disabled, was not supported to be uninstalled.&nbsp; Any removal hacks were created by unknowledgeable "techies" with no true understanding of the damage
 they were doing to the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One primary change between Windows 7 and 8.x versions of Defender was the addition of the&nbsp;antivirus components previously contained in Microsoft Security Essentials, though there were other less well known technical improvements as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each succeeding version of Windows since 7 has contained an improved version of Windows Defender, which though always able to be disabled by an antivirus or antimalware product certified for that particular operating system, has become increasingly difficult
 to disable manually by any other supported method.&nbsp; On some earlier versions this meant&nbsp;the antimalware service could no longer be manually&nbsp;disabled, while on Windows 10 this now includes the fact that&nbsp;the GUI application&nbsp;will re-enable itself after a period
 of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go ahead and believe whatever you wish, but I've been involved with these products since the original beta versions of Microsoft Antimalware (never fully released), Windows Defender (beta only&nbsp;on&nbsp;Windows 2000), and OneCare beat before it was renamed.&nbsp; As
 a&nbsp;Consumer Security MVP from 2007-11, I'd sat in a room at Microsoft&nbsp;with the development Product Manager and individual component development managers for the Windows&nbsp;Live OneCare product before that evolved to become the initial Microsoft Security Essentials
 and was later embedded within Windows 8.1 Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You've damaged your Window installation, it's that simple.&nbsp; Do whatever you wish, but you're wasting your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rob</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt; EDIT &gt; I won't get into&nbsp;my own opinion about the testing groups, since I've covered that in detail in the past.&nbsp; Instead I'll direct you to an article by one of your peers whom you seem to trust more, even though they've spent far less time with those&nbsp;inside
 development at&nbsp;Microsoft and don't have the years of experience I've had working directly with both these Microsoft security products and many of those that had existed long before the 3rd-party products some use today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past I'd had little time for the uninformed technical press, but then I realized this was because like Rubenking states in his article, he'd simply missed the details about how Microsoft's security products complement and validate each other, which
 I'd implicitly understood as a past BIOS and systems level programmer, network administrator and security professional.</p>

            <p>Defender was only ever an optional install until W10! I have installed various operating systems over the last 30 years and I know what I am talking about. As it was optional, in all Windows versions before W10, the OS worked without any of Defender's features.
 All I wanted to do was return the OS to the state applicable without Defender.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now resolved the totally uninstalling of Defender and remove all trace of it. That has stopped the update trying to put unwanted junk on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am disappointed that respondents failed to appreciate the issue and did not attempt to answer the actual question I originally asked.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>In the process of uploading scans of my girlfriends mom's recipes. Last night i had a ton of issues syncing to my actual onenote notebook that i finally got resolved, but now my Android app, with all my scans, won't sync and is causing issues between the
 two. I'm getting the above error when i try to update on my app. the desktop app has no errors, and the one i have in onedrive also has no errors.&nbsp; I could not find ANY results for the above error code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there a bunch of pages that will not load on any instance of the notebook. when i click on them in android app it says 'Hang on while we get your notes...' but doesn't seem to pull them. The page stays, but nothing loads.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>when i use the windows app, it says "This page isn't available yet. It was added from another device that didn't finish syncing. You'll be able to use it when that device syncs. Page created 8/24/2018 2:42pm" the time is WAY wrong on that, as i didn't start
 the project until after 7pm. The pages that won't load all have impossibly early times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>when i open the one living in onedrive it says "Page deleted. This page has been deleted on another computer that hasn't synced yet. it will be removed once the sync is done." and then it disappears from the notebook. The thing is, i didn't delete anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help?</p>

<p>Hi Darleen --</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a similar issue. There are a couple of rogue sections that keep reappearing in my Recycle Bin. I keep trying to Empty, but somehow they re-emerge and muck up the sync to other devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried going to OneNote Online to delete the sections there. I could right-click on the individual notes to Delete Permanently, but right-clicking on the section would not give me any dialogue options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Odd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still no resolution for me.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 won&#39;t open on my Lenovo laptop..</h2>
                    I have read several posts regarding this topic and other people having the same issue but cannot find any with a solution. Outlook opens in webmail, on my desktop and on my Samsung phone. &nbsp;On my laptop it won't open. I click the icon and it stays in a
 limbo "starting" state. &nbsp;I've applied all updates, checked my user account, turned on and off, troubleshooting, and nothing. &nbsp;Can anyone offer a solution if there is one out there? I hate to think this is a software glitch??? &nbsp;

            <p>Thank you Rey Cam but your response applies to how MY name appears to people who receive an email from me. &nbsp;What I asked is how to make the "DIsplay As" name under the "internet" section on each contact to not revert back to the full email address. &nbsp;Example...I
 input an email address as <em>**email address**</em>. &nbsp;I then enter "Johnny - State Farm" in the "Display As" box, then save. &nbsp;The next time I click on "To" box in a new email, and search for Johnny - State Farm" it is not there. &nbsp;I reopen that contact and
 the "Display As" name has reverted back to <em>**email address**</em>. &nbsp;I recently updated about 15 contacts with new "Display As" names and saved each. &nbsp;I then opened Address Book and searched for each and they had all reverted back to the full email address.

            The referenced thread was not very helpful. &nbsp;Some of the comments <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
imply </span>this is a known issue with Outlook 2010 but has been conveniently ignored by Microsoft because it's a 7 year old product and they want everyone to switch to Office365 where the problem do not exist. &nbsp;If anyone knows otherwise or can offer an alternate
 solution it would be greatly appreciated.

    <title>How to lock conditional formatting so other users don&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bonus12  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to lock conditional formatting so other users don&#39;t accidentally change it&#63; Stop automatic updates to conditional formatting&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am using conditional formatting that covers nearly the entire range of data. However, I will soon be turning this sheet over to others for editing and I want to make sure the range of the conditional formatting DOES NOT change during copying, pasting,
 or otherwise rearranging of cells within the range.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it is now, the range of conditional formatting keeps updating and ruining the performance of the sheet. How can I lock automatic changes to the conditional formatting? I just want the conditional formatting range to stay the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Thank you for your help!</p>
<p>Hmmm ok. I read some of the link, however...</p>
<p>I thought I might be able to name a range using name manager. For example I would use name manager to give a name to the range $A$5:$Z$500, and then refer to that named range in the conditional formatting settings so that it only applies to the named range
 and cannot change. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Would this work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't completely know how to do this so if you think it's at all possible I would appreciate your forthcoming advice.</p>
<p>Thanks very much to all.</p>

<h2>            Delete email older that X Days</h2>
                    <p>I would like to be able to set a rule to delete every email older than X days in my inbox. I want the "Archive" folder untouched unless I manually delete them.</p>
<p>I read other posts that talked about using sweep on a per sender basis, this would not work for me. For some reason, unless I am doing it wrong, the rules settings will not allow: After X days DO: delete.</p>
<p>Any tips?</p>
<p>I am using the Outlook.com web based.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the primary email pushed to my mobile device</p>

            I had this problem. Solution seems to be - set up your delete after so many days rule. Then click + Condition underneath your rule and select 'folder is' and 'Inbox' (as appropriate). Or other condition. No weird message pops up and the rule is in place.&nbsp;
