<h2>            Saving issue in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>When trying to save a file, I can only save to the desktop.&nbsp; Which is rather annoying.&nbsp; It says I must be an administrator, which I am the only administrator account, and in-fact, I am the only account.&nbsp; Can anybody help?&nbsp; I've turned read-only off and in
 C:\ properties, I have allowed every tick (apart from "special permissions" which is grayed out.)</p>

            I tried that and it didn't work. I have only one user account setup ion this pc and it is the admin. I'm also unable to transfer files from my phone. I get an access denied message which I can only assume is part of the same problem.

<p>Even when I use WIN + D or click on Desktop from the side, it does not open the desktop.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Need permission from S-1-5-21 etc. to delete a specific folder on an external hard drive.</h2>
                    When I connected my external hard drive today, there were 2 unknown folders I haven't seen before. The names of the folders are (from top to bottom):<br />
<br />
60d1ed2d32416e8aeb<br />
4278f068ed08cfeb6851e4<br />
<br />
The first folder contains the following files:<br />
<br />
mrt.exe<br />
mrtstub.exe<br />
<br />
The second folder contains many more files which look like Internet Explorer files. Here are some of them:<br />
<br />
admparse.dll<br />
advpack.dll<br />
html.iec<br />
ie4uinit.exe<br />
ieakui.dll<br />
ieframe.dll<br />
jsdbgui.dll<br />
jsdebuggeridle.dll.mui<br />
<br />
Now as the title says I can't delete both folders because I need permission from the following...user? :<br />
<br />
S-1-5-21-1934431923-378725584-4205987783-1007<br />
<br />
I'm really confused because I do not know how these folders were installed on the eHDD. Please help me out!
<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />

            Right-click the problem folder, click Properties, click Security, click Advanced, click the Owner tab, set yourself as the owner. You need to be logged on under an account with administrator privileges to do this.

<p>But in their wisdom?? they put it in the store app rather than putting it in the regular updates.</p>
<p>And since the store app is broken, the updated store cannot be installed.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade asks to uninstall Daemon tools with error code  0xc1900209</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows 10 - Daemon tools problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi all.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">In short: </span></p>
<p>The Win10 upgrade asks me to uninstall Daemon Tools, but I cannot find it anywhere on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Details:</span></p>
<p>I am trying to upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>My computer goes through the whole procedure, but at the end I get a blue screen with "What needs your attention" saying I need to uninstall Daemon Tools. At the the bottom right there are two buttons ("back" and "refresh") which do nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I close this screen and click the icon for "Windows 10 upgrade assistant", I get a new window saying "Something went wrong", along with
<strong>error code 0xc1900209</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot solve the problem. </p>
<ul>
<li>Daemon Tools does not appear in Control Panel &gt; Programs &gt; Uninstall or Change a program.</li><li>I have checked the folders C:/Program Files and&nbsp;C:/Program Files (x86) and there is nothing there that seems related to Daemon Tools.</li><li>I have checked several forums and none of the tips work for me.</li><li>The only thing I found via a Forum discussion was a REGEDIT &gt; HKEY_CURRENT_USER &gt; Software. There was a Daemon Tools folder there which I deleted completely. But after rebooting and doing a new Win10 installation run, I still get the same problem.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I am completely stuck and I'm not sure if Microsoft will give me the free upgrade if I don't solve this before the 29/7 deadline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specs:</p>
<p>Currently running Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 on an ACER with Intel Core i5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi ZigZag,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, I had just managed to solve it - this is what I did</p>
<p>
</p><p>-I found a sub-folder named "tools" in the c:/programs</p>
<p>-that folder contained several files related to Daemon Tools lite, including "uninstall.exe"</p>
<p>-but the uninstall.exe didn't work: produced an error window with code "1", no further information.</p>
<p>-I downloaded Daemon Tools lite again and installed it in the same folder, overwriting the old files.</p>
<p>-now uninstall.exe did work!&nbsp;</p>
<p>-there were still some files left over which I deleted manually</p>
<p>-Windows 10 installed normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this works for other people too.</p>
<p>

    <title>Separate audio on split screen with Turtle Beach headphones - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shanetfletcher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Separate audio on split screen with Turtle Beach headphones</h2>
                    
<p>I decided to make the plunge and buy some Turtle Beach PX21 headset's (x 2 for me &amp; my partner) as they was on offer. But anywho, the setup is simple, I have basically used the red / white port of the TV to hook up both headphones.</p>
<p>However, I am now wanting to make the headsets work on split screen, meaning I want myself to hear just me (guns blazing etc) and my partner to here her audio. Apparently this can be done very simple but I am unable to find ANY kind of setup which allows
 me to do this (apart from spending £200+ on another make of headphones with a amp).</p>
<p>The headphones (purchased on Argos) told me to buy a <span>Xbox 360 HD Audio Adaptor with Optical, however I actually do not know why I needed this as it works fine through the TV.</span></p>
<p>Does this device allow me to do what I need for split screen? or will I need something else such as a audio splitter or something?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hey ShaneTFletcher,</p>
<p>Let's try to clear up a few things. First off the xbox is not designed to split the games audio of things happening in-game out to different audio ports. It will however accept a transient to be broadcasted via your microphone to others headsets. In other
 words as the xbox does not have a separate way to mix the signals of different elements and send them out to specific channels. &nbsp;While playing games split screen, no matter how you set it up, you will always hear the same audio of &nbsp;in-game play. You can buy
 a audio splitter which should have a 3.5mm plug to send into your Turtle Beaches amplifier to a pair of RCA plugs which you can then decide if you want to grab audio from the tv or xbox. BUt to be clear the game/console will not separate the sounds from in
 a game to multiple devices. Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Really wish this was possible. &nbsp;It seems that with multiple usb's there is a way to put out more than one signal but it doesn't sound like the sound hardware is able to process sound separately for each. &nbsp; I really hope this is addressed I. Future consoles

<p>I agree. There is a large niche emerging that is being mi$$ed by not encouraging the extra family member to join in the fun without having to leave the room for another Xbox system which kills the mood and the point of "quality time". &nbsp;Not sure if it will
 take off, but some games like CoD:BO2 has the feature 'Dual Play' that incorporates enabled TV's and glasses that allow each local player to "see" the whole screen instead of just half. &nbsp; Sounds great except the mixing of the sound from each players point
 of perspective ruins it for both of us. &nbsp;I suppose the game and the headphone processor is all that really is needed to support the separation of the discrete audio information from the game to each unique player when you think about it. This would be a big
 boon to the local multi-players right now whom would love this feature. </p>

<h2>            Gnasher Shotgun Overpowered &#63;&#33;&#63;1</h2>
                    
<p>Is it me or can you down people in multiplayer online from 50 feet away with the gnasher shotgun ?!?!</p>
<p>My complaint is that i have a lancer ( With Active Reload I Might Add ) and i shoot someone at a distance that i would have to roll at least twice to get to and they are downing me with a shotgun from that distance !!! Now i know the shotgun isnt supposed
 to be that powerful because in campaign it takes usually more than one shot to kill the enemy even on the easiest setting, is it just randomly powerful or modding. Gears 3 is supposed to have dedicated servers so it cant be lag.</p>

<p>The gnasher is fine it's the sawed off that I have questions about. Maybe it's just me but it feel like it has a farther distance then the beta... I’d say about a foot or two?</p>

 believe the map was Passover but there was a good amount of distance between us. Anyway I guess I need to be more careful...</p>

<h2>            Webcam and Microphone No Longer Work after Installing Windows 10</h2>
                    After updating to Windows 10 I noticed my integrated webcam and microphone no longer work. The Device Manager does not list Imaging Devices anymore either. However, under 'Universal Serial Bus controllers' there is an "Unknown USB Device" that is shown
 as not working properly, I believe that is the webcam. I've tried uninstalling it and scanning for hardware changes but it still does not work. Any advice will be greatly appreciated. &nbsp;

            <p>This is in response to the Microsoft support engineer, Jenith James, there is nothing wrong with the device or program that is installed, except for Microsoft tweeking it to produce the bad results.&nbsp;I am experiencing.</p>
<p>My Logitech camera (V-U 0003) &nbsp;250 quick cam, worked fine until&nbsp;Microsoft put a windows 10 update on my computer about 2 months ago, now the camera works only when using the camera program installed by/with Windows 10, but not with the Logitech program,
 it works on the Logitech install page, but the screen stays black on the program page when opened and this makes the fine-tuning of the advanced control for the camera useless.&nbsp; I tried uninstalling the windows camera app, but that didn't help, the image screen
 of the Logitech program stays black.&nbsp;(Microsoft, messed up the Logitech, Launcher_Main.exe) The program keeps flashing&nbsp; "Launcher_Main.exe failed" , but just for the Logitech program, not for the stinking Microsoft camera app.<br />
IMO it is Microsoft rendering my program useless to force me to use the Microsoft program, that stores the photos on the hard drive &amp; not in documents/pictures, where Logitech program puts them.&nbsp; In other words Microsoft hi-jacked my camera to use with their
 program, that they can then open remotely, to spy in my house, as well as steal my photos/videos.&nbsp; If this is not the case then restore the picture to my Logitech camera program that is working perfectly. Take out your block on the Logitech program, that controls
 the screen image, prior to snapping the picture.&nbsp; I disconnect the camera when not in use anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not use the Microsoft camera app, I have uninstalled it, I do not like spies in my computer.&nbsp; There is no other logical reason for the camera to not
 work with the Logitech program, but does work with the Windows 10 camera app.&nbsp; That is a&nbsp;pretty low-life thing to do.</p>

    <title>July 2017 Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brown8  say:</h3>
<h2>            July 2017 Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>I cannot find any contact info for Windows...only virtual support and forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the most recent update, which updated automatically after I reviewed security settings (it did NOT ask to update), I have limited funcionality. My cursor will freeze in trying to move across the screen, causing often a full 5 minute delay to get from
 one side to the other. My single finger scroll is completely gone and replaced by a two finger scroll that functions when it wants to - ramdomly. My tabs randomly switch from one to the next. Useability of sharepoint and outlook is diminished due to freezing,
 data not being saved when I save it, and new items not loading. I have missed several emails because they loaded a day or two later than when they were sent. I find myself reverting to my little iPad simply because it seems to function all the time and does
 what I need it to do when I need it to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially after the update I had to reboot the computer multiple times just to get it to load anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have avast antivirus. I now do not have the choice of shutting down anything antivirus related with windows/microsoft.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I believe these updates were probably designed to increase productivity, the only increase of anything I have seen is in my time on the clock - it now takes me easily twice as long to do anything that I used to do, simply because I cannot get the cursor
 from one location to another and the tabs randomly switch or disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does microsoft have a fix coming to fix the fixes or am I better just going back to Apple?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to better help you, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Confirm which build is currently installed on your device. To check, follow the steps below:</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Press <em><strong>Windows key + R</strong></em>, then type in <em><strong>winver</strong></em>.</li><li>Click <em><strong>OK</strong></em>.</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>What is the make and model of your device?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, let's troubleshoot the issue by performing the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Run the Windows built-in troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>This troubleshooter automatically diagnose and repair common problems with devices and hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Click on <strong><em>Start</em></strong>, search for
<em><strong>Control Panel</strong></em> and click on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. On the Control Panel window, search for <em><strong><span>Troubleshooting</span></strong></em> and click on
<em><strong><span>Troubleshooting</span></strong></em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. On the left pane, click <strong><span><em>View all</em></span></strong><em>.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. In the list of options, click on <strong><span><em>Hardware and devices</em></span></strong><em>.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">5. Click on <em><strong><span>Next</span></strong></em> and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If the issue persists, proceed to method 2.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:&nbsp;Update your touchpad drivers</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Press <strong><em>Windows key + R</em></strong>, then type in <em><strong>devmgmt.msc.</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span>2. On the Device Manager window, expand the <strong><em>Mice and other pointing devices.</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span>3. Right-click on your touchpad driver and select Update driver.</span></p>
<p><span>4. </span><span><span>Select </span></span><span><span><strong><em>Search automatically for updated driver software</em></strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. </span></span><span><span>If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try looking for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, we recommend performing the steps on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4002019/windows-10-improve-pc-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have a similar problem, in that I can't get windows 10 out of diagnostics. It won't load, it won't do re restore point (and all my other restore points have gone). I can't even boot from &nbsp;USB recovery.</p>
<p>All this from the second Microsoft update in the last few days.</p>
<p>Can anyone help us?</p>
<p>'And to the person who said about going into Control or whatever', we can't do that if we can't get our PC to boot.</p>
<p>Can we install a new version of Windows on an external hard drive and then boot from that? Would we then be able to access all our programs and files etc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very frustrated....</p>
        </p>

<p>I never cease to be amazed how organisations like Microsoft always try to put the blame for their own incompetence on the user. Like many others, prior to this July 2017 update, my PC was ticking along nicely. Since the "update" and with no other action
 on my part, suddenly my PC has a host of glitches e.g. I am unable to access the Power button when I click on the Windows image at bottom LHS of screen to turn the PC off, I can't properly access the photos in my Pictures file, photo attachments to emails
 take forever to open, various screens have a "shakyness" at the top in the menu bar, and so on. Reading the responses to other's questions, it appears that Microsoft, rather than attempting to help resolve the problems they have caused, endeavours to make
 out it is the users who have suddenly created problems,&nbsp;&nbsp;strangely, at exactly the same time &nbsp;as they installed their update. Seriously Microsoft, get &nbsp;out of your backrooms and join the real world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone down the "troubleshooting" path and been told all is well. I checked drivers and have been told they are up to date. Please tell me how I can get my PC operating as it was BEFORE the July 2017 update. As best I can tell to my non computer expert
 eye, I have lost all my previous System Restore dates. Microsoft should change its corporate identity to "all care, no responsibility"</p>

            Were I to have been able to get my cursor to work, I would have provided you the answers requested. However, with a frozen machine I could not do anything. Thankfully, my husband was able to reboot to the previous version of Windows...which worked until
 earlier this week when an update randomly took place and again caused issues. We have since found a way to block the updates, and my machine is again functioning smoothly. Very happy now.

I have had all the above on a network of 10 machines for a customer and its managed to destroy the network and Homegroup as well, I have spent three days sorting it out. We have had to resort to using internet explorer because edge has become very slow and
 occasional, Chrome won't open because of security issues

Thank you for your response (Useless) I didn't ask you to upgrade or fiddle with the machines neither did my clients in the first place, you need to test your upgrades rather than release them on the unsuspecting public. We had machines working perfectly, before
 the upgrade. What do you think we do, apart from running a busy wholesale outlet? Oh we will just reinstall all the operating systems, which were working perfectly last week! If that is all you can offer don't bother in future.

<p>Just because you don't agree with a response doesn't make it useless.</p>
<p>I don't work with Microsoft, just a fellow user, so I have no involvement in the testing of Windows upgrades.</p>
<p>If you don't have the understanding of the operating system that your business is relying on then I'd highly suggest hiring an outside IT firm to help you with the issues you are having.</p>

<h2>            Star Club - New Klondike Pack - Easy I - Puzzle 1 is UNSOLVABLE&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>The top left puzzle where you have to take three 4s onto the top shelf. It is totally unsolvable. And it is rated easy. :-(</p>
<p>I am 99.99% sure of this because I have solved each and every puzzle in all other packs. 1190 stars before attempting this pack. Spent 2 hours on this and tried every move sequence. Not possible at all. I can probably write a program to perform a brute force
 search to prove it, but I don't think it's necessary.</p>
<p>I will mark this down as another blunder by the development team. So much time wasted on one broken puzzle. Not impressed. :-(</p>

<p>ProductDock0955, you must be looking at the wrong pack. The NEW "Klondike" pack (released a few days ago) only have 8 sub-packs, all of which Klondike puzzles (a total of 80). You were probably looking at the Klondike sub-pack of the FABLE pack.</p>

<p>ProduktDock0955, did you solve the WHOLE 10 puzzles in the "EASY I" sub-pack of the "Klondike Collection Name" pack? I don't think so. You probably just solved one puzzle out of that pack, or solved the "EASY II" sub-pack instead. The puzzle I'm talking
 about is the "Card Challenge" where you need to "Play 3 Fours to the Foundation". I don't think it is possible to be solved at all. You can prove me wrong by either posting a complete walkthrough, or capture a screenshot and show it here. But I highly doubt
 you can do it.</p>

<p>I'm sorry I stand corrected. Just solved that challenge now. It has to be done in a extremely convoluted way to unlock the Ace of hearts. DEFINITELY NOT easy.</p>

<p>It took me several tries, 30-45 minutes (lost track of time), but I beat it. &nbsp;I have to wake up at 4am eastern time to drive to work in freezing rain, so I don't have time for a full play-by-play.</p>
<p>At the beginning/middle of the challenge, don't put the 6 of spades on the 7 of diamonds. &nbsp;Instead dig down to the 6 of clubs, fourth from bottom of 5th stack. &nbsp;This frees up the ace of hearts as the third ace for playing three fours.</p>
<p>After the 6 of clubs is down, play the 5 of diamonds to it to free up the 3 of spades.</p>
<p>I had skipped all the easy and medium challenges in this collection to concentrate on the hard and expert challenges to get stars as fast as possible. &nbsp;My favorites are Freecell and Pyramid, and I skip all but the easiest Tripeaks challenges, so I have a
 lot fewer stars than you have. &nbsp;Thanks for posting about this, I like a challenge. &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>Although not impossible, this was harder than some of the expert boards. &nbsp;They may have inadvertently marked it as "Easy" as it's draw-one, where most of the hard and all of the expert challenges in this collection are draw-three.</p>
<p>I'll be in heaven if Microsoft/Arkadium follow this up with all-Freecell and all-Pyramid Star Club collections. :) &nbsp;Hint hint :)</p>
<p>EDIT: &nbsp;You beat it while I was typing all of that :)</p>

<p>I believe it will work with both. It does not replace you tv reciever. &nbsp;You will need to run the HDMI from the direct TV reciever to the XBOX . The XBOX is just a passthrough, &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Cortana and Knowledge Management in Business Office 365 and Devices</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone using Cortana (and perhaps Delve) in a knowledge management capacity? There are two aspects I'm interested in: Context management and extending that ability to devices (e.g. iOS).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Examples:</p>
<p>I can tag content on one or several taxonomies: User role, business segment, customer segment, etc.<br />
- As a user, information is presented to me based on those taxonomies. (both push and pull...Delve and global search)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can Cortana read relational databases and pull information? Such as, let's say I asked Cortana if my customer ordered any widgets in the last 30 days, or what my notes were from our last interaction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help pointing me to documentation or communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p />

    <title>Surface Studio not working, error iaStorA.sys - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reidh555  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Studio not working, error iaStorA.sys</h2>
                    Surface Studio is brought from the US, After a couple of days of work, it issued a blue screen with the error iaStorA.sys. The main HDD is OK, there is a suspicion of M.2 SSD running as a cache in the hybrid drive. Downloading, trying to restore or reinstall
 the system ends in a blue screen with the error iaStorA.sys. Is it possible to break the hybryd drive or replace the SSD with any other, same volume? And does this action void the guarantee? Sending the warranty to the US is not very convenient.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error you are getting may be caused by several factors such as:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Corrupted Windows system registry</p>
<p>2. Possible damaged hard disk or hardware</p>
<p>3. Possible driver issue with other hardware other than your hard disk</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to be able to isolate this, may we know if you are getting a particular STOP Error code or Error message?&nbsp; The error code would more likely let us know where the issue is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that you have tried reinstalling the system.&nbsp; Was the error due to the re-installation of the system or did you get that error prior?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to your last question, replacing the SSD may possibly void the warranty.&nbsp; To find out exactly, you may check this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4036294/surface-surface-warranty-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> where the warranty information is disclosed.</p>

            When the system starts, a screen appears with an error of 0x000000f. If you try to boot from a recovery disc or installation disc, it does not reach the language selection screen and immediately displays an error iaStorA.sys (stop code: PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA).
 If boot from LiveDVD(USB), the main HDD (2Tb) is visible. Smart parameters are normal, there are no errors.

<p>Thank you for providing us with the Stop Error Code.&nbsp; Based on the error code itself, this simply means that there may be a problematic system file which Windows 10 does not recognize and in order for your Surface to be protected, Windows automatically generates
 that stop error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can we fix this?&nbsp; </p>
<p>The issue may both be hardware and software related.&nbsp; We would like to know if you installed any update prior to this from happening?&nbsp; Often, updating your drivers or one of your drivers might have triggered this as it may not be compatible with Windows
 10.&nbsp; This can easily be resolved by rolling back the driver.&nbsp; To do this, just follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Press<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows + R</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>on the desktop screen.</li><li>Type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>devmgmt.msc</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and hit enter.</li><li>Expand the category you want and right click on the driver and select properties.</li><li>Navigate to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>driver</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>tab and click on<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>RollBack driver</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, this can only be done if you can boot into Windows.&nbsp; However, since you're getting the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) error while booting into Windows, we would advise that you use a recovery drive to reinstall Windows.&nbsp; To to this, simply follow
 the steps provided in this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023512/surface-creating-and-using-a-usb-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Explorer.exe not properly starting up on boot up Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> houdini111  say:</h3>
<h2>            Explorer.exe not properly starting up on boot up Windows 7</h2>
                    So this started last night, and we have no idea why, but explorer.exe is not loading everything up. Sometimes it loads all the images, sometimes it doesn't. But it is never functional. The only thing I was able to do was anything found in the Ctrl+Alt+Delete
 menu. After much troubleshooting, I decided to stop the explorer.exe process, and then it worked. I restarted the computer and tried again, it didn't work. After even more trial and error I decided to start up explorer.exe with a manual "Start Task" command,
 and everything worked fine. I tried many more times, and it continues to work flawlessly after the manual restart of explorer.exe. However, restarting the computer wholly does not fix the problem.&nbsp;<br />
I have no idea what is going on, but my guess is that, for some reason, explorer.exe is not getting all the RAM it needs, even though it is set to "High" priority.&nbsp;

<h2>            Window Movie Maker in Windows 8.1 does not work.</h2>
                    <p>OT: Window Movie Maker in Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 8.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows Movie Maker doesn't work at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have converted my movies to .WMV files several times by different programs.&nbsp; I have downloaded Windows Essentials 2012 several times but nothing helps.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't get any kind of messages
 at all.&nbsp; It just doesn't do anything.&nbsp; When I click on import media and select a file and click import, nothing happens.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried it on previous files that I used in Movie Maker when I had Windows HOme Vista Premium and it won't load those either and
 there is nothing wrong with them.&nbsp; I made a lot of movies using the old Vista Home Premium Movie Maker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Microsoft needs to shut down and reorganize.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems like every time they come out with something new, it's worse not better.&nbsp; This new Windows 8.1 is the sorriest Windows program I've had yet.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's slow as Christmas and nothing works with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I would got with a mac but I just don't need a computer bad enough to pay there prices.&nbsp;&nbsp; If this is the best Microsoft can do, I may just go back to the way I did things before these money pits came on the market.</p>

            <p>Your issue then isn't DVD burning but actually editing/saving the movie.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For editing there are other options like Nero Video 2015, Pinnacle Studio, Premiere Elements, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might want to consider downloading a trial version of some of these first before spending money. As you have noticed, editing video can be fraught with issues so it would be better to get it right using a trial version first... then if you like what
 you see, pay for the full version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nero Video 2015, for example, has a trial version and it will open an existing .wlmp from Movie Maker. So you could even try continuing your project in Nero Video 2015 without having to start again from scratch. If that works, you could continue with Freemake
 Video Converter for making the DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Even Apple has dropped DVD support and hasn't included iDVD for several years. Microsoft isn't being arbitrary in dropping legacy support for DVDs.</p>

<h2>            how do i install a game thats on a disc i just bought on windows 10 without files being blocked</h2>
                    im trying to install a brand new game that's on a disc called need for speed hot pursuit 3 on my windows 10 computer but when I try to install/run it it wont allow it because its blocking 1 of the files for the game something to do with the English setup
 or something like that I tried turning off everything like the windows defender and the virus protection from spectrum and my computer is set on allow apps from everywhere I tried chatting and doing remote chat with an agent and the agent did little to nothing
 to fix this issue so what do I do to get this game to install so I can play it without this happening to me

<p>Would this be <em>Need For Speed 3: Hot Pursuit,</em> which was released in '98 ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also an NFS: Hot Pursuit (2010) and NFS: Hot Pursuit 2, but no Hot Pursuit 3.</p>
<p>NFS: Hot Pursuit (2010) runs on Win10&nbsp; without any problems, but I installed it before upgrading from Win7 to Win10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>[EDIT: Thought I had NFS: 1&amp;2, but confused them with NFS: Underground 1&amp;2 ]</p>
<p>'98 is a bit early, and the game may require some special fixes, but I'm not sure if NFS 3: Hot Pursuit can be made to run on Win10.</p>
<p>I don't know if this game uses a 16bit installer, but if it does it will not install on 64bit Windows. It should install on 32bit Windows though</p>
<p>(and many games with 16bit installers will run on 64bit Windows if copied from a 32bit machine to a 64bit machine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some games from this era (with 32bit installers) do have a problem installing from the disc so you could try copying the entire</p>
<p>contents of the disc to a new folder (on you desktop is OK because you delete this folder later) and run the install from that folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The information I have indicates that NFS3: Hot Pursuit should not be affected, but a few of the
<p>NFS games (Underground 1&amp;2, Hot Pursuit 2, High Stakes, Porsche Unleashed, and maybe others ?)&nbsp; use
<em>SafeDisk</em> copy protection, </p>
<p>and these games require a noCD to run on Win10. I have details on MS's DRM Blocking in my post at
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-gaming/login-as-administrator-warning/56cf28ad-c7e5-432f-89ab-d22e08a06544">
---this thread ---</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Most games that use SafeDisk will install but fail to run when the game does the disc check when you launch it, but some</p>
<p>do the disc check while installing which will prevent the game from installing as well. In this case it's also often possible to install</p>
<p>the game if you copy the disc to a new folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
- Next step would be to trawl the various NFS forums for more details regarding your particular version of NFS.</p>

            Hello xjben, welcome.<br />
<br />
You solution lies within the ATI's Catalyst Control Center. Its a utility program bundled in with the driver software. Check your system tray (where the clock is) for the CCC icon. It should be redish in color.<br />
<br />
If you open up the CCC, there will be an option to set screen rotation based on degree (like 90, 180, etc).<br />
<br />
I cannot remember off the top of my head where it is, however, it should be rather apparent when you look for it.<br />
Let us know if you need help either installing CCC, locating CCC, or trying to find the screen rotate option and I can pull up some information for you,<br />
<br />
Thanks!

<p>Hi Luis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The freeze or hang error that you encountered when accessing the Recording tab on your device can be related to an incompatible driver. To isolate your concern, we suggest that you restore your PC to an earlier state to remove any recently installed apps
