<p>I have the same problem and can't install that update. Tried turning off my antivirus and nothing, tried in safe mode and neither. The troubleshooter says that there is a pending update, but can't solve it. The messages of try again and error code are very
 annoying.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Château,<br />
<br />
<br />
There could be a number of factors as to why you are experiencing Windows Update issue. This could be caused by broken components of Windows Update or due to a software conflict.<br />
<br />
You can perform a clean boot. A <strong>clean boot</strong> will help eliminates software conflicts that occur when you install a program, update, or when you run a program. For instructions, refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: After clean boot troubleshooting steps, refer to the section "<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>" in the provided link to return your computer to normal startup mode.<br />
<br />
You can also use the guided walk-though from this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for more troubleshooting steps. This guided walk-through provides
 steps to fix problems with Windows Updates, such as taking a long time to scan, or error codes while installing updates.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes and we'll assist you further if needed.<br />

<p>Well, I tried everything you suggest, but nothing works, the error is still there. I only didn't try to "Perform a clean install of Windows 10" because I will lost everything and I think there should be the ultimate alternative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to do separately updates instalations after my the last successful automatized instalation. The last one was&nbsp;KB4033631, so I tried to start from the acumulative last update available, but didn't work. It says:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bcaeda0c-bcfe-4954-9eb7-5dff82d219e4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bcaeda0c-bcfe-4954-9eb7-5dff82d219e4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And everyone I tried, inclusive the next one after my&nbsp;KB4033631 was KB4034674 but had the same message error "The update is not applicable to your computer" (acumulative and diferential). So if any of them are applicable to my computer, why is it trying
 to install them? What could be wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p><span>Hi Michael3245,<br />
<br />
- Is the error message associated with a blue screen error/crash? <br />
- Are you able to boot to the desktop? </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’d recommended you to<span>upload the minidump files so that the experts here can analyze the cause of the blue screen error. Refer the following

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span><font><font color="#000000">To provide the appropriate resolution, I would need more information from your end.</font></font></span></strong></p>
<p>1. What happens when you try to perform Startup Repair?</p>

            Thanks! I have tried it all without success. I did manage to download win7 sp1 64bit .iso and make a bootable dvd. I am currently running Memory dia tool again. I still get a very quick blue screen with the error, but I cannot determine how to stop it
 to look at the actual error.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I tried a upgrade with the win 7 dvd, but it requires I get the system up to ask for a upgrade load. I will try this afternoon a safe boot, then see if I can upgrade from that.
<br />
<br />
The problem I have is, the win7 key is not with me. I have a three pc license. Two pc's are working but I have not determine, if or how, I can get the key off of one of them. If I can find the key I can go ahead and do a new image load of win 7 sp1 64bit. &nbsp;
<br />
Thanks!<br />

 purchase backup a Cooling Fan with LED Lights from EBay. I was able to solve that problem but however what else can I do about the Laptop Fan should I replace it or just let my new Laptop Cooling fan takeover for a while when my Laptop is on?</p>

<p>So if someone could help me, that would be great.</p>
<p>There was a blackout where i live, and after it, my xbox would no go past the green start up screen. So i tried everything to solve it, and to finish all i tried to Factory Reset the console. But in the middle of process the console froze and i Hard Reset
 it. Now i rarely can get to the "Preparing Console" screen, usually the consoles just freezes for half a hour, and sudenlly shows me Error E102. And when i can get past it, it gets stuck in 66%. I tried everything. I would love to try an USB Factory Reset,
 but i cannot find the files here in Xbox.com, always shows me that the "page was moved" or something like that.</p>

<p>I would be really gratefull if someone could help me with this. Thank you in advance.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Keeps Trying and Failing to Install An Update That Is Already Installed</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 Pro version 1709 and for the past three months Windows has been trying to install an update (KB4074588) that my computer says is already installed. The update keeps failing (10 times now). Other updates have successfully installed
 in the meantime, it's just the one that keeps trying to install and failing. Is it possible that it did not install correctly the first time? Should I try to remove the one that says it is successfully installed and see if it completes anew? Any advice would
 be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Randy</p>

            I am a fellow community member who likes to help my peers when able. <br />Microsoft has put together a great troubleshooter to help identify and fix issues with Windows Updates.

            Hey Randy.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />What I'd do at this point is install latest Version 1803 by installing Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

<br />If you still continue to experience problems...
<br />
<br />I recommend you block it until the next cumulative update is released. Many are reporting the same problem too and it looks like this update is buggy.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:

<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.
<br />
<br />If you still want to troubleshoot the problem:
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv

            Hi,
<br />Updating to Windows 10 1803, the latest feature update should resolve your issue.
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.
<br /><a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />All steps, including upgrading using ISO file and Media creation tool, are covered here:

            Hi CBGB, 1709 is no longer the latest version of Windows 10, 1803 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Disable any 3rd party Antivirus you may be running
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<p>Hi Everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to thank you all for your very quick responses and your ideas to fix the problem. I thought upgrading to the new 1803 version might solve the problem and I was waiting for the upgrade to be pushed to me, but the problem is so annoying I think I will
 take the suggestion to use the Media Creation Tool to get it right away. I will let you know how it goes (maybe from another computer if it doesn't work right lol). Thanks again, the community support here is awesome.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your help. I installed Windows 1803 using the Microsoft Windows Update Tool and I have faith Windows Update will start working again. It has installed Defender definition updates with no problems, but they were working under the 1709&nbsp;Update
 that was corrupted for other installs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll update this thread one final time when the bigger update(s) install next month.</p>
<p>

                    I have Windows 7. Within Notepad, the print option shows "selection" and "pages" grayed out. Therefore, you can't print a specific page. Why list them at all if they are unavailable in notepad?

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notepad is a barebones text editing tool. It has few features other than those required to create and edit text files. The print dialog box is a standard dialog box, so the print selection option shows up. If you need the ability to print a selection of
 text, you might consider using WordPad or some other text editing software other than Notepad.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a Nice Day!</p>

<p>Please dont tell me to right click and copy and the go to the ocation and right click and paste.
</p>
<p>or even highlight and ctrl+c and ctrl+v to copy and paste. </p>

<p>selecting a file and pressing the left mouse button at the same time pressing the ESC button reverts back the functionality, of the drag and drop.

<p>Any one&nbsp;know why the functionality (drag and drop) gets disabled in the first place?

<h3> peanut x uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBOX 360 S unable to connect to wireless network.</h2>
                    
<p>I have an xbox 360 S 250gb which is unable to connect to the wireless network.I also have an xbox 360 S MW3 edition which can connect to the wireless just fine. Both are sat right next to each other.</p>
<p>One will connect. the other won't. It can see the wireless, but when I put in my password, which I've tried multiple times, it just won't connect. the other one connects fine.</p>
<p>The router is a billion bipac 7800N, It's wpa2 AES, with no mac filtering, dhcp is on but the non-working xbox doesn't pick up an ip address. Manually assigning an address doesn't work either. taking off all network security and making it an open wireless
 network also doesn't allow it to connect.</p>
<p>If I plug in a cable, it will connect. But this 2nd xbox is for a part of the house where I can't use a wire, and so I need the wireless to be working. I've tried resetting the modem, I've played about with the settings on the router but I feel I am going
 through the motions for no reason as the xbox right next to it can connect just fine. I've reset the network connection to factory settings on the xbox, I've reset the whole xbox to factory settings. Nothing has worked.</p>
<p>If&nbsp; I need to send it off to Microsoft to be repaired that's fair enough, I need it working, is it a repair job or is there something else I can do?</p>
<p>regards</p>
<p>Peanut</p>

<p>I'd say it's a faulty wireless adapter inside your Xbox, since even removing wireless security doesn't allow it to connect. &nbsp;ShadowmanUK may be able to prove me wrong (he's the resident networking expert)</p>

<p>Thank you for the help, it seems updating the router's firmware has sorted it out. Although I still don't understand how 1 of the xboxes connected perfectly and the other didn't if the firmware was a problem, but I'm not going to argue with it, As long as
 they're both working then I'm happy! </p>
<p>Right, in case it helps anyone else...</p>
<p>W: &nbsp; 0000 - 0000</p>
<p>X: &nbsp; 8000 - 0011</p>

<p>ID: &nbsp;0000 - 0006</p>
<p>L: &nbsp; 8015 - 0002</p>
<p>Q: &nbsp; 8007 - 0435</p>
<p>T: &nbsp; Wireless</p>
<p>A: &nbsp; 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0</p>
<p>G: &nbsp; 0.0.0.0</p>
<p>D: &nbsp; 0.0.0.0, 0.0.0.0</p>
<p>N: &nbsp; SSID</p>
<p>S: &nbsp; WPA2</p>
<p>C: &nbsp; 0</p>
<p>These were the details when it wouldn't connect. I then updated the firmware to the latest version, and built the wireless network slowly step by step and tested it at each one to find if/when it failed:
</p>
<p>Default ssid, no security</p>
<p>Tried it just G,</p>
<p>Changed the ssid to same as before, </p>
<p>tried it B G N, added wpa2, </p>
<p>Connected fine at all stages and settings are now same as before, just tested other xbox to make sure and that connected fine as well.
</p>
<p>Thank you very much again for your help. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I certainly can. It had the same firmware on it you get when you buy it. &nbsp;106D. Which is stable and all reviews say it works great, even with the xbox and allows 2 xboxes to connect with open nat so they can play the same game at the same time. (not tried
 it yet)</p>
<p>I've upgraded it to the latest one, 106G which appears to have fixed the issue and though it's still early I've noticed no other problems with the firmware.
</p>
<p>And I did connect with the wire WxxR, but updating it didn't fix it. I did &nbsp;think to try that. I just didn't want to mess about with the router because it was working with one xbox fine so didn't think the router could be the issue... obviously I should
 be more thorough in future. </p>
<p>Thank you a 3rd time Shad0wman :)</p>

<h2>            Switching between pen and touch in Win 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I previously posted that I was having trouble with older metro apps locking out touch capability (</p>
<span>
<span>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-winapps/metro-apps-wont-respond-to-touch-in-windows-10/5c6ec410-11f1-409e-97f0-470da7b26aaf">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-winapps/metro-apps-wont-respond-to-touch-in-windows-10/5c6ec410-11f1-409e-97f0-470da7b26aaf).&nbsp;
 Nobody really followed up or answered in a serious way, so I thought I'd try again.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The more I look at this issue the more I think it is more of a Win 10 issue.&nbsp; What I noticed is that when I use those apps, the problem isn't that touch doesn't work, because sometimes it does.&nbsp; What seems to be happening instead is that when I use the pen,
 the computer locks touch out for that app.&nbsp; It works find in the task bar, as does the gesture to bring up the settings on the right hand side.&nbsp; What doesn't work is touch-based scrolling, etc once I've used the pen.&nbsp; On the other hand, if I load the app and
 never use the pen, then the app responds to touch.&nbsp; I hunted around and couldn't find a setting that covered this, so maybe somebody else has an idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, my hardware is a Lenovo x220 tablet PC, I'm running windows 10, and its up to date.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I regret the inconvenience caused to you. Let me help you.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<div>
<p>I would suggests you run app troubleshooter and check it helps.<br />
Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with hardware and devices. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check if the issue is with your touch pad.<br />
Refer these steps:<br />
1.&nbsp;Press Windows key +X, select Control panel.<br />
2.&nbsp;Change the view by option on the top right to Large icons.<br />
3.&nbsp;Click on troubleshooting and click on the view all option on the left panel.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run the&nbsp; Windows Store apps troubleshooter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest you to download and install latest touch screen driver from the computer manufacturer website&nbsp;

<h2>            Move folder from desktop</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a few folders on my desktop that contain all different kinds of files - doc, pdf, and audio.&nbsp; I would like to move these from desktop and place them as new folders under "This PC" in explorer, rather than placing them inside one of the existing folders.&nbsp;
 Is there a way to do this?&nbsp; I've searched everywhere and can't find a way to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do folders on desktop slow things down if they're not opened - not the shortcuts, but actual folders with lots of files in them?</p>

            <p>No reason why you should not move them...personal preference - I only use shortcuts (and the recycle bin)&nbsp;on the desktop because it reduces the risk of accidental deletions - and I like an uncluttered desktop too so I keep regularly accessed programs on
 the task bar or start menu.</p>
<p>You may need to be careful with the audio files - if you play these with WMP from the media library, WMP may no longer be able to find them...also the different folder types in the regular storage locations are optimized for the relevant contents (Docs Music
 Pictures etc.) so it might actually be better to move them there, but create a new sub-folder (e.g. 'Ex-Desktop Files') - you could even create a direct desktop shortcut to it so you still have quick access.</p>
<p>If this sounds practical, let me know if you want more help - equally if you want to hang in there for other suggestions - no worries. - Regards - Ric.</p>

<br />
battery number is printed oldbattery itself. remove the battery and chek .. somewhat similar to this number.. PA3817U-1BRS but double check in the battery itself and you MUST verify it... look for genuine product/ or

<h2>            Computer doesn&#39;t recognize CD&#47;DVD drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,<br />
<br />
I'm having an issue where my computer isn't recognizing my disc drive. Initially I looked in the device manager and the disc drive wasn't even listed. However, there was a floppy disc listed, which from what I can physically see my tower doesn't have. That
 was the first odd thing I noticed.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After some simple trouble shooting, I opened my computer up to unplug the drive. I boot it back up and now the computer is recognizing it (Hitachi GH15N. I thought great, popped in a music CD and nothing. From a bit of research, apparently there aren't drivers
 available for this unit, and Windows is supposed to find them?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The first thing I noticed is the drive is odd. The green light is always blinking, regardless of use. When I use the eject button, it'll eject, pause and then close on it's own. You can get a disc in/out, but need to be quick.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I right clicked and looked for updated drivers within the device manager. After some time of looking, it came back with nothing available and the drive disappeared from the device manager again. Shutting down, unplugging the drive, plugging back and turning
 back on will usually make it appear again. But when I try to do anything with it, it goes away. This drive does not display and X's or yellow caution signs in the device manager. It's either there and looks fine, or not listed at all.<br />
<br />
I haven't used this computer much, it was recently restored by someone else before I bought it. I've had it since last September and it's worked great. This was the first time I tried to use the disc drive (wanted to make a recovery disc) and noticed it to
 be a problem.<br />
<br />
Any ideas? I'd tried a few things so far. I've been working from this thread:&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/windows-7-suddenly-doesnt-recognize-dvdw-cdrom/75fc3eb1-ac1a-465c-8cf0-bd4ccc9e071c</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled the drive, rebooted and it installed it and to be honest, it almost seemed like it was going to work. So I put a music CD in again, didn't run on it's own so I went to my computer. From there I double clicked the drive with the disc in it and
 windows explorer went to Not Responding. After a minute or 2 of that, the green status bar started to fill the address line, and then ultimately finished and nothing happened. The drive is still showing now in the device manager, but I can't seem to get it
 to do anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I open Windows Media Player and choose the disc drive, it's saying there's no disc. I've also tried a DVD and data disc, but to no avail. Actually I just put a DVD in and the drive disappeared again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate</p>

            <p>Hi Ratandeep,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. My computer is a custom build, someone put it together as their media hub, which was what I bought it for. I'm now using it as my desktop as well since my Mac Mini died on me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specs:</p>
<p>Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit</p>
<p>AMD Phenom II X4 920 Processor 2.80GHz</p>
<p>4GB RAM</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was just from the computer properties. If you'd like more specific info, just let me know and I can find it for you. When I bought it, I did research on the components it had and they all got excellent reviews, which was why I bought it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I booted it up this morning, the drive wasn't showing again so I couldn't do Method 1. So I shut down, unplugged and rebooted, now it's showing the disc drive as E. I'm not putting a disc in, or clicking on the drive because then the computer will think
 for a few minutes, followed by the drive disappearing under my computer. Note, when the drive is displaying, clicking properties gives the status "This device is working properly." For arguments sake, I changed the drive letter from E, to D.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing this, I right clicked on the drive under My Computer. Windows explorer then went to "Not Responding" as it has been, After it stopped, I entered &nbsp;music CD but it's still saying no disc in the drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using Method 2 but when I go to the site, the page doesn't fully load and jumps all over the place. I can't actually click on, or do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p />
        </p>

            <p>The following <em><strong>assumes this is a desktop computer</strong></em>.&nbsp; It is a laptop, you will likely need a technician to do this and it will cost a lot more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most likely, the DVD drive has failed.&nbsp; They are not expensive and are easy to install.&nbsp; New ones go for about $20.&nbsp;&nbsp; Buy one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unplug, hold power ON switch in for 5 to 7 seconds, remove the cover</p>
<ol>
<li>The drive is easy to locate.&nbsp; It has 2 plugs in the back of it.&nbsp; </li><li>There are likely 2 screws holding the drive in place remove them. Then remove the plugs.</li><li>The old bad drive may slide out the front or you may have to remove the front cover to get it out.</li><li>Slide the new one in.</li><li>Secure it with the same 2 screws.</li><li>Put the plugs in</li><li>Close it up and try it out. </li><li>Extremely likely Windows 7 will find the drivers for it.</li></ol>

            <p>I have an old HP tower that has a CD/DVD burner in it that I haven't used in years. Would it be as easy as moving that drive into my new tower, hooking it up and turning it on? It should automatically install all of the drivers that are needed, correct?</p>

            <p>Probably not.&nbsp; The old computers used a data interface called PATA.&nbsp; The newer ones SATA.&nbsp; The power cable attachment is completely different too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can buy a device that would convert, but the cost doesn't make sense when you can find a new SATA DVD drive for so little cost.

            <p>Thanks everyone. I'll take my other tower apart and see what type of connectors it uses. If they're not the same, I may just leave it as I don't use the CD drive. Only reason I discovered it wasn't working was trying to create backup discs, but I was able
 to do that with a USB anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, I'll update this when I get a chance to dig into my other tower.</p>

<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>When I start Windows Media Player 12.0.7601.17514, it adds files to the library that have been modified since the last time it was open. How can I stop this?</p>
<p>Options &gt; Player &gt; "Add local media files to library when played" is cleared.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><span>Media information about music files in your library, including files that were created when ripped from CDs, is displayed in the Player. The existing media information
 cannot be removed, but you can prevent new media information from being retrieved and displayed. However, doing so will cause any files created during ripping to be displayed in your library as "Unknown."</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click the
<b>Start</b> button, click <b>All Programs</b>, and then click <b>
Windows Media Player</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the Player is currently open and you’re in Now Playing mode, click the Switch to Library button in the upper-right corner of the Player.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click the arrow below the
<b>Organize</b>, click <b>Options</b>, and then click <b>
Library</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. In the
<b>Automatic media information updates for files area</b>, clear the <b>
Retrieve additional information from the Internet </b>check box, and then click <b>
OK</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This also clears the Update music files by retrieving media info from the Internet check box, located on the Privacy tab.</span></p>

            Server operating systems are not officially supported. Are you stating that is the only way it is functional or that it installs like that by default? What occurs when you attempt to remove it? If you cannot remove it, that sounds like a system policy
 or admin set configuration, not related to Skype itself. Obtain the proper rights to disable compatibility mode. If you continue to run into issues with compatibility mode disabled, please provide the OS you are using and the exact version of Skype&nbsp; you have
 installed?

            Skype has never installed in compatibility mode by default on any OS I use. It can be forced into that mode by system policy. This leads me to believe something in your configuration is causing this. Please provide information on your setup (OS build,
 exact version of Skype, etc.). That is the only way I could attempt to replicate your issue. My guess is you are running a server release of Windows (2008 R2, 2012, etc.) with a limited video driver or other imposed limitation. You should not be running in
 compatibility mode to being with. No compatibility mode, possibly no forced configuration. Limitations could be imposed if you are using an RDP session vs. a real session. You could try updating your video drivers.

<p>It never happened&nbsp;to me either, but it did happen to my friend.</p>
<p>Cannot see any reason for this, I challenge whoever made this "feature" to try and work on his pc at this resolution for one hour.</p>
<p>Classic skype worked just fine, but today it decided it must be updated.</p>
<p>It's a windows 7, the exact details I do not know</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player STILL will not bun a C.D. Music List&#33;</h2>
                    &nbsp; Still, to this day&nbsp; Windows Media Player WILL NOT burn a music list.&nbsp; I have written about this same exact problem for years now.&nbsp;Sometimes, once in a great&nbsp;while it will work. But even then that is very rare. &nbsp;I mean how long should it really take to
 burn an 80 minute C.D.? Well I have been trying for&nbsp;over 45 minutes now and have about 5 ruined C.DS.'s to show for it. This is the is the exact error message I keep getting after it says the burn is complete... "Windows Media Player encountered an error while
 burning. Verify that the burner is connected properly and that the disc is clean and not damaged."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not connected? It sure recognizes when a C.D. has been inserted. Working properly? A C.D. Will play every time it is inserted. Roxio will burn an exact&nbsp;1 to 1 copy of a C.D. with no problem. iTunes certainly does not have a problem with creating a&nbsp;play&nbsp;list
 and burning it onto a C.D. But I am not trying to burn music that was purchased from iTunes. I am trying to burn a playlist from my own personal C.D.'s that were burned into the &nbsp;Windows Media Player Library. Why does it even ask to burn a C.D. if it doesn't
 work?&nbsp; So now&nbsp;what, am I going to have to burn all of the C.D.'s that I have purchased and ripped to the Windows Media Player Library into iTunes&nbsp;also? That means I will have duplicates&nbsp;of ALL the C.D.'s I have purchased and take up tons of memory on the computer.
 I thought it would be nice to have iTunes music separate from purchased C.D.'s but with the way windows 7 operates it seems like that would be impossible. It seems like Windows Medial Player will not work on a Windows P.C. Will I really have to rely on third
 party&nbsp;software to do the task? If so I might as well delete the entire Windows Media Player program from this computer altogether &nbsp;if&nbsp; is that worthless. It is just absolutely amazing how I have to come here and ask for help to try and figure out why hardly
 any of the built in Windows programs work.

            &nbsp;Once again yes it does. Roxio will burn an exact 1 to 1 copies of a C.D. But you cannot make a playlist of different music. iTunes will&nbsp;burn C.D.'s with no problem, well, except for the fact that the music purchased in iTunes ins in the mp4 Format. That
 format will not play in all C.D. players. So now to use iTunes to handle all of the tasks I will need to have all of the music in both mp4 and WAV format. That is a huge waste of space on the computer. That is the whole entire reason for&nbsp;ripping all of my
 C.D.'s into the Windows Music Library. I ripped them all in the WAV Lossless format for the best quality. Still I get the error message..... "Windows Media Player encountered an error while burning. Verify that the burner is connected properly and that the
 disc is clean and not damaged".<br />
&nbsp;I do have some of the&nbsp;music I was trying to burn onto a C.D. there in iTunes but it is all in the mp4 format to listen&nbsp;through the iPod. If I burn the music onto a C.D in the mp4&nbsp;format it will not play in all C.D. players like the WAV version will. So now
 that I have all of my C.D.'s&nbsp;ripped into Windows Media Player in the WAV Lossless Format and most of them ripped into iTunes in the mp4&nbsp;Format I will now have to convert the music in iTunes into the WAV Format there too. How great, now I can have THREE copies
 of all the music on this computer. Do you know how much space that will take? Not to mention the music I did rip into iTunes is in the Apple&nbsp;Lossless Format to achieve the best quality there.
<br />
&nbsp;I really cannot believe that to&nbsp;do such an incredibly simple&nbsp;task as burning an 80 minute playlist&nbsp;has now taken over 1 hour&nbsp;&amp; 20 minutes and it still is not done. Instead Windows must take a lot of time to trouble shoot to accomplish this.
<br />
&nbsp;Is there a way to delete the Windows Media Program from the computer since it will not do what it was intended to do? I mean what good is it anyway? The whole reason for ripping all of my music is to create playlists and burn them to C.D's. It seems like that
 won't happen.

            &nbsp;I have always had it on the slowest speed possible. I tried to speed it up this time. I tried everything I could think of and nothing would work. This always happens with Windows services. It's like it wasn't recognizing the C.D./DVD Player when trying
 to burn a disk. But it would Rip a disk just fine. When I would insert a blank disk it would recognize it and ask what I wanted to do with it. When using iTunes to burn&nbsp;music on a disk it worked great. Using Roxio to burn an&nbsp;identical duplicate 1 to 1 copy
 it worked great too. But I was not trying to burn an exact duplicate C.D.&nbsp;using Roxio or burn a C.D. using iTunes in an m4a format. I was trying to use Windows to burn a C.D. in WAV format&nbsp;using songs from various artists.<br />
&nbsp;So, once again...... I had to reset this computer back to "Factory Default Settings" and do about 20 million updates... again!&nbsp; It will impossible to find out what update was the culprit if that was even the issue.<br />
&nbsp;Anyway everything is gone, now comes the task of restoring all of &nbsp;the computer files&nbsp;from the Back-up hard drive once again.<br />
I'm&nbsp; starting to believe Windows is best used to just be the "Host" for&nbsp;3rd party&nbsp;programs that will do the job.<br />

            <p>&nbsp;Wow Windows just keeps getting worse and worse. I never ever find any solutions here on these forums.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had to reset this computer back to it's "Factory Default Settings" and now the ROXIO Program that was working now isn't working. Why in the world when a&nbsp;program is "(Not Responding)" &nbsp;Windows keeps saying it is checking for a solution. I have never been
 notified of a solution. Do they&nbsp;or have they EVER responded with a solution? I have hardly any programs on this computer right now and it is so strange that how Windows 7 64-bit will only run programs once in a while. It wasn't even easy getting back to this
 forum. Why is there a&nbsp;place on the Bing Toolbar to sign into an Outlook Account?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I enter in all of my data to sign in it tells me it is wrong. But then when I type in Outlook into the search menu it pops up and then I am able to sign in there. It seems
 almost impossible to do anything on a Windows computer. What in the world does anybody else accomplish here besides surf the web and see tons of complaints on how things "Don't Work"?&nbsp; Seriously, what??</p>

            &nbsp;Well now I have just uninstalled the recently installed program, ROXIO Creator Pro. I thought maybe something went wrong during the installation. So I went to the Control Panel and uninstalled it. Then I turned the computer off, unplugged it , held the
 start button down for about 30 seconds the plugged it back in and restarted&nbsp;it. I put the ROXIO&nbsp;CD disc back in to reinstall it. I stared at the little auto run window that pops up saying&nbsp;it is searching for content. After about 5 minutes of waiting it tells
 me the Auto Run program is "Not Responding" I tried to close it out and low and behold it says Windows is checking for a solution! It finally closed. Then I pressed the Start Button&gt;Computer and pressed the BD-ROM Drive to try and start the process again.
 The only thing that happened is the little blue circle started spinning around and around and around. I tried to close the Window out and it WILL NOT close. Yet the circle is still spinning as I am typing.&nbsp;

            &nbsp; With Windows Media Player I burn everything in WAV Lossless. Those CD's will play in any CD player that I have used in the past and it sounds great. The disc I am using is Memorex and TDK audio CD's.
<br />
I have done every update possible. I have been trouble shooting this same problem for about 3 years now. It is different every time. Yesterday I was able to burn a CD using Windows Media Player. But&nbsp;today, just now, I have been trying for 25 minuets just to
 build a playlist to burn on a CD. As soon as I try to pick a song to "Drag and Drop it" the whole program freezes and I get the (Not Responding) sigh right at the top of the screen. &nbsp;If&nbsp;I leave it alone for a few minutes nothing will happen. If I click on
 anything else the screen turns white, then I have to click on the red X about 15 times or close it from the task bar. And once again I always get that stupid little window popping up saying "Windows is Checking for a Solution". Obviously there is no solution
 because I have NEVER been notified.&nbsp; I&nbsp;seen that white screen and seeing the Not Responding sign about 12 times today. And after writing this letter it has now been 35 minutes and absolutely nothing has been accomplished.<br />
&nbsp;Looks like I'll have to be using iTunes for everything if this keeps up. It seems like APPLE is doing their job at keeping things running smoothly.&nbsp;I just don't want two copies of everything I have in iTunes. I would have to have two copies because everything
 gets imported into iTunes in APPLE LOSSLESS format. But to listen to those on any CD player I would have to covert them into WAV format.
<br />
&nbsp;Why would I really have to convert everything into WAV format in iTunes, that's what Windows Media Player is for!&nbsp;The Only problem is IT DOES NOT WORK!!&nbsp;Oh wait, that's the first problem, the second problem is there is not way to fix it!<br />
&nbsp;I would love to take a video of what is going on and post it with a little Cam-Corder. But where can I post the video. I'm thinking of making one anyway and post it to Youtube.<br />
Is there a way to post a video here?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>When I turn my computer on, after the desktop appears, the Windows Live Messenger shows up in full display form, along&nbsp;with a display entitled Today.&nbsp; I would prefer that this does not happen automatically.&nbsp; I only want Messenger to be displayed when I click
 on it to open. Minimizing these displays is simple, of course, and only takes a second or two, but I find it annoying that the display shows up on its own.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>

<h2>            Indexing a Shared Folder in windows 7</h2>
                    I have a shared folder with several pdf files. When I use windows to search for a word that I know exists in one of the files, I only get word documents, PDF's are not shone. I think this has to do with Indexing but I dont know how to Index a shared folder.
