<p>Hi Frdavid,</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Which web browser are you using to download files?<br />
•&nbsp;Have you made any recent changes on the computer?<br />
•&nbsp;Does it happen with all the downloads?</p>
<p>This usually happens if the download is not properly downloaded or file is corrupted, this may also happen if you are trying to install a program that not suitable for the version windows.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1</span></strong><br />
First I would suggest that you scan the computer for any malware or virus infection.<br />

<p><br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2</span></strong><br />
Try re downloading and installing the program and check if it works.</p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>for the APC_MISMATCH error, try this hotfix:</p>
"STOP: 0x00000001" error occurs in Windows Server 2008 R2 or in Windows 7
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2203330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2203330</a></p>
<p>Click on the link "View and request hotfix downloads", select the platform (x86 or x64) and type in your email twice and type in the captcha ad click request hotfix.<br />
<br />
After 1 minute you have an email with the link to download an exe. Use the password which is included inside the email to extract the update.<br />
<br />
Install the update and reboot, now the issue is fixed.</p>
<p>The other 3 crashes are NTFS_FILE_SYSTEM errors which are caused by the driver<strong>amp.sys</strong> :</p>

<p>Thanks again, I'm requesting a new driver from Authentium Inc, the windows compatability center does not list, so I'll let you know. There appears to be a lot of comments about this file online&nbsp; whether it can be trusted or not. When i&nbsp; get a reply and (hopefully
 a fix), ill post it here for others and put on my skydrive with a link.</p>

                    <p>I have a Canon MG7751. In control panel/printers it appeared as a printer and scanner and could be used as both. To use the scanner all I had to do was click on the scan utility link. I have now upgraded to Windows 10 and installed the drivers and software
 for the printer but now there is no scan facility. Printer is working fine.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
<br />These should help:
<br />
<br />Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver.

<p>Thanks for trying to help but I've uninstalled and then reinstalled from the Canon website three times.&nbsp; Among the eleven programmes this installs there is one call Canon IJ Scan Utility but as I said the printer is in devices and printers as a printer only,
 not a scanner as it was when I was using Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            You will need to check with Canon Support and Forums where others probably have had the same issue.
<br />
<br />A few checks.
<br />
<br />Can you run that Canon U Scan Utility?
<br />
<br />Is it shown in
<br />
<br />Start - Settings - Devices - Printers &amp; Scanners?

<h2>            &#40;D&#58;&#41; can&#39;t detect some of my old DVDs</h2>
                    <p>Over 10yrs ago I made DVDs from my camcorder using my DVD Movie Maker. I no longer have that computer. I can play the DVDs in my DVD player with no problems but I can't play it on my computer. It also does the same thing with DVDs I burned using a Funai
 DVD/Recorder machine. Does anyone know why? No media player I have downloaded will play them. There is nothing wrong with the (D:) DVD on my new recorder and I have no problems playing on my computer. I think it has something to do with the way I created the
 DVDs. Any ideas?</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> First try the steps here:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/fix-dvd-cd-drive-not-working-missing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/fix-dvd-cd-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />Did the DVD drive work in that PC before?  If so this might have been caused by Windows Update.  Did you receive Windows Updates recently?  Check at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.  You can try uninstalling any affecting Updates there.
<br />
<br />You can also try to System Restore to a point before this happened:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />See if the problem returns with the Update reinstalling and if so uninstall it and block it using the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />To attempt to repair this, go to Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Under DVD Device, click on Driver tab, see if Roll Back is available.  If not choose  Uninstall, restart PC to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Next right click Start button to open Disk Management, scroll down to find the DVD drive.  Does it have a driver letter?  If not right click to issue a drive letter so it shows up in File Explorer, save and exit.
<br />
<br />Run Hardware troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />FYI there is no DVD player in Windows 10, they want you to buy one from the store.  There are better free options here:  <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2953724/windows/how-to-play-dvds-in-windows-10-for-free.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/article/2953724/windows/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Thanks for the response. The DVDs have never played on this computer. This computer doesn't even detect them. They play fine in the DVD player. The drive is fine. It has something to do with the DVDs. I made them almost 10yrs ago. I have a new dvd/recorder
 and laptop now. I was trying to save my home movies by getting them off VHS tapes and putting them on DVDs. I can still view them on the DVD player connected to the tv but my plan was to download them to the compute and make family members their own&nbsp; personal
 DVD. On my new dvd player/recorder, I can make dvds and play them back on this computer with no problems. I wouldn't care , but it's my old home videos. None of the media player can detect them in the drive. I hate technology :(

            Thanks for replying. I have tried VLC. GOM and many others. The DVDs have never be detected on this computer. The drive is fine, it something in the way the DVDs were created or something. They are videos I made on my VHS camcorder. I was trying to get
 them off VHS tapes. I used&nbsp; a Funai player/recorder to burn them to a DVD. I also made DVDs with Windows DVD Maker. This was over 10 yrs ago. They play fine in my new DVD player connected to the tv.&nbsp; I wan't to be able to download them to the computer and
 make individual dvd for my family member. With the equipment I have now I can record on the DVD player connected to the tv and play and see the file on my computer.

            Hi  bly48,
<br />
<br />Can you browse the DVD in File Explorer?
<br />
<br />If so, what is the folder names (Structure) on that DVD that you cannot play on your PC?

            When I put the DVDs that I describe above in the drive. It does read anything. When I try to open the drive it tell me to insert a disc. I have no issues with other DVDs or CDs.

            What DVD Player are you using?  As I mentioned earlier, Windows 10 does not come with a DVD player.  Try one of these:  <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2953724/windows/how-to-play-dvds-in-windows-10-for-free.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/article/2953724/windows/...</a>  I recommend VLC.

            Will it play on any other PC? It may be the way it was burned, plus DVDs have a shelf life and cannot be relied upon endlessly.

            I remember playing it on the computer I had back then. Dofi you know of any kind of software that could find it and open it. There has got to be something out there. I just don't know what kind of question to ask.

<p><span>1. Press (Windows key + X) and click on “Device Manager”.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Expand “Display Adaptor”.</span></p>

Use an external USB Hard Drive, as size also plays a part in backups or System Images you backup.

</p>
<span>
<p>　</p>
<p>1) Verify that KB3035583 and KB2952664 or for Windows 8.1 KB3035583 and KB2976978 are installed.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Open Windows Update as follows:</p>
<p>Windows 7: Click on ‘Start’ / Control Panel / Windows Updates and in the bottom left corner click on the ‘Installed Updates’ link.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Windows 8.1: Right click on ‘Start’ / Control Panel / Windows Updates and in the bottom left corner click on the ‘Installed Updates’ link.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>In the upper right corner there is a ‘Search Installed Update’ box. Enter the appropriate pair of KB numbers (one at a time) for your version of Windows. Example: KB3035583</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Note: If these updates were installed within the last week continue on to step #2, otherwise un-install both updates and re-install them and then continue to step #2.</p>

<p>2) Open Windows ‘Task Scheduler’ (Start / Computer / Manage) and navigate to:</p>
<p>Computer Management / System Tools / Task Scheduler / Task Scheduler Library / Microsoft / Windows / Application Experience
</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>3) Right click on ‘Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser’ and select the ‘Run’ option. You may need to wait anywhere between 10 to 30 minutes or more for the task to complete and return to the ‘Ready’ Status. Press the F5 key to refresh the ‘Status’ about every
 10 minutes.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>4) Open Windows Explorer (File Explorer in Windows 8.1) and navigate to the C:\Windows\System32\GWX folder. Right click on the GWX.exe file and select the ‘Run as administrator’ option. Click ‘Yes’ when prompted.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>5) Let the computer idle, keep your laptop connected to AC power and about 1 hour (take a good movie break), more if you have a slower computer (about 2 hours to play it safe) and if the GWX icon is still not displayed, shut you device totally down (<strong>do
 not hibernate or go into Sleep mode</strong>) for the night.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>6) The next day power on the computer and wait about 30 to 60 minutes, the GWX icon should now be visible.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>7) Click on the GWX icon in the taskbar and view the 6 slide presentation. You’re now ready to immediately make your reservation or wait a while as it’s a free upgrade for a year starting on July 29th, 2015</p>

            <p><span>Hi Rick,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues with Windows.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try the following methods and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to try to boot the computer in safe mode and check, Please refer to the below Microsoft article and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or
 an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may
 temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the
 computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to refer to the article given below and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-7-startup-repair-loop/672077be-7e5b-4f77-8677-67b8187bed37"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-7-startup-repair-loop/672077be-7e5b-4f77-8677-67b8187bed37</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

                    <p>*-Original Title - Need windows media player help</p>
<p>I am very frustrated with Microsoft at this point. &nbsp;I have had continuing problems with Windows Media Player and have tried the turn windows features on or off multiple times, have done the CMD scan twice, the first time it said there were some corrupted
 files which were fixed and it still wouldn't run after all this. &nbsp;It shows up in the programs but if you click on it it appears to be opening it but nothing happens, &nbsp;Well i decided to upgrade to Windows 7 Professional and IT STILL WON'T PLAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 &nbsp;<span> </span>I did another CMD scan and it said it couldn't find any problems. &nbsp;What do I have to do to be able to run Windows Media player? &nbsp;Mac is looking really good now. &nbsp;Thanks. &nbsp;</p>

                    <p>After upgrading to Win10, I would get a periodic notification pop-up in the lower right corner of my screen saying that I have a problem in that my computer needs to share with my other devices. I never said I have other devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to figure out where to turn off that option:</p>
<p>

<p>Share across devices= I toggled it to NO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That worked until recently, and that pop-up now comes back periodically (once a day?) even though that toggle is still set to NO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, I think it is very presumptuous of Microsoft to tell me that I have other devices. They do not know this.</p>
<p>Secondly, I think it is very presumptuous of Microsoft to think that, if I do have other devices, that I want to make them visible to my computer. That is not their decision to make or assume for me.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I think it is wrong for Microsoft to label this as "a problem" and one that I need to correct... for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I did click tonight on that notification popup, as it said I could, and I was directed to a Get Help Virtual Assistant (PREVIEW) where it listed several top topics for me to choose from. None applied, and I typed my problem succinctly in the box
 provided. The response was that I wanted something other than what this Virtual Assistant wanted me to want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Incidentally, they mislabeled to call it a Virtual Assistant. More accurately, it is merely a list of top topics plus links to other places, that's all. Calling it a Virtual Assistant implies it is some evolutionary step towards artificial intelligence
 and can assist me much more than it did. Nope, it merely performed a limited form of word matching, and I'm intellectually insulted. A common search box would do as much.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had enough of this pop-up. It is not my job to second-guess the thinking of their programmers when they are insufficiently articulate in the text they provide in their pop-ups, withholding from me what the conflict really is, while expressing it in
 terms of their multiple assumptions about what I want and how I can further Big Brother. I'm not their puppet with cell phone, tablet, Xbox, and whatever other toys, wanting to lower my shields to receive all of their planned interconnectedness for me, so
 that I can be a portal and recipient of their partners' endless advertising, endless listening to the endless cultural garbage of music and social networks, to buy buy buy, and open my life to hacking by strangers. There are people in this world who want none
 of that, don't they know, and Microsoft needs to respect that in the way they present themselves at these times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(That felt good to say all that.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how I can disable this annoying pop-up other than, ha, going out and purchasing some devices with which to allow it to share my personal business?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed my question has been moved to the category of Microsoft Edge. FWIW, I do not use Microsoft Edge. I use Internet Explorer 11. I don't understand the relevance of this category.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, to answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>• HP h8-1280t 64-bit, i7-3820 with 12GB RAM, no touch display, no microphone, no camera. This is a desktop computer, not a mobile device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>• Today is 12/17/2017. My device is "up to date":</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feature&nbsp;Updates (1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feature update to Windows 10, version 1709</p>
<p>Successfully installed on ‎12/‎14/‎2017</p>

<p>
</p><p>2017-12 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1709 for x64-based Systems (KB4054517)</p>
<p>Successfully installed on ‎12/‎15/‎2017</p>
<p>
</p><p>• Edition = Windows 10 Home</p>
<p>Version = 1709</p>
<p>Build = 162.99.125</p>
<p>
</p><p>****</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pop-up precedes&nbsp;these recent updates shown above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to provide a screen shot at this time because the pop-up is self-removing thus does not stick around. I don't know when it will again occur but if I'm at my computer to catch it, I will screen-shoot it. Often, after the pop-up disappears (er,
 slides out of view), its text&nbsp;will appear on my Notifications sidebar until&nbsp;I delete it from there, so the next time it does that, I will recap its text for you. There are times, however, when the pop-up does not show up on this Notifications sidebar. Also,
 I think last night's pop-up had more text in it than usual, inviting me to click on it for more information and that's when I was referred to the Virtual Assistant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Here is the screen shot of&nbsp;a&nbsp;different pop-up that showed up tonight. It does not have identical text as the one I most often receive (which has text that speaks in terms&nbsp;of devices not being shared):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c1b2776-b83e-44bd-8d62-3c46e64241da" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c1b2776-b83e-44bd-8d62-3c46e64241da" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on it and it opened up my Settings / Shared Experiences where my Share Across Devices is still toggled to OFF. There is really nothing else there to toggle. It&nbsp;simultaneously opened up a pop-up for me to log into a Microsoft account to apparently
 make this unexplained fix that it assumes I know about, pre-populating this pop-up with an email address&nbsp;(account) that I never use and therefore of course had I not changed its password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, it's some&nbsp;mysterious Microsoft account problem that does not impede me in any way. I am toggled to OFF. There ain't nothing to share. I have no reason to&nbsp;toggle that setting to ON. This notification should explain the problem instead of directing
 me to take unexplained corrective action, leaving me in a fog as I go, then likely recording every step as if I authorized with full educated knowledge whatever it is it wants me to do. Ain't going there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the other, more regularly-appearing pop-up plants itself in my Notifications sidebar, I'll screen-shoot it as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the pop-up issue for <strong>Shared experiences</strong> is due to a corrupted user profile if it still continues even after being disabled in
<em>Settings</em>. That being said, are you experiencing the same issue with other user profiles? This includes local user profiles and Microsoft accounts.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I am not being ridiculously obtuse, but when you say "local user profiles", to that I say I am the sole user of this desktop computer and I have no other profiles built for user access. When you say other "Microsoft accounts", I think in terms of
 email addresses and I will say that get the Notification even when none of my email addresses are accessed. Am I answering your questions in a useful way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I last posted, I again received the Notification that&nbsp;I imaged in my last post. This time, interestingly, I noticed the bottom part of that right-side Notification sidebar, where many tiles are displayed, and I saw that two of them are&nbsp;teal in color.
 If they were that&nbsp;color before, I cannot say, as I may have had them collapsed:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e84f050-854f-4a95-b01d-32cc4c4da566" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e84f050-854f-4a95-b01d-32cc4c4da566" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not click on either of the teal tiles, lest I compound the issue, but I know that I should not have bluetooth&nbsp;ON because both my mouse and laptop are cabled, not wireless, nor should I have Wifi&nbsp;ON&nbsp;because my desktop is connected to my router via ethernet
 cable. This is peculiar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To investigate, and still&nbsp;wanting to avoid clicking directly&nbsp;on those teal tiles, I&nbsp;instead&nbsp;went to PC Settings from my Start button and found my Bluetooth set to ON. I now have changed it to OFF. As a result, in the sidebar the bluetooth tile has changed
 from teal to black and states "Bluetooth" in the tile where it had stated "Not connected".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I found the Wireless Network Connection set to ON. I now have changed it to OFF and the Wi-fi tile changed from teal to black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps these are the "Shared experiences" obliquely referenced in the Notification?<em>
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>How about if I wait a few days and see if the Notification ceases, then report back in this thread?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hmm... while we wait, let me speculate. Because I had&nbsp;just found my desktop wifi setting was&nbsp;ON even as I also have the ethernet cable connected up to my desktop, I do have a clue here as to what may have&nbsp;been happening. Until last November 30 (three weeks
 ago), my desktop was fed by ethernet cable from my otherwise wireless router and&nbsp;this router was fed by my telephone line as it was DSL service. My desktop wifi setting was always&nbsp;OFF, of course. On November 30, my ISP tech&nbsp;came out and upgraded my internet
 speed and gave me a new (wireless) router fed by glass (no longer fed&nbsp;by my phone line) and due to its new physical location I had no CAT5 cable long enough to connect the new router to my desktop while the tech was present. I looked at my desktop screen and
 saw that it said it "saw" the new router via wifi (!) so I marveled at that and called it good. Later that day I bought and installed a CAT6&nbsp;ethernet cable to replace the wifi connection and apparently I did not turn off the wifi connection at that time. I
 thought I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If fixing those two settings stops the Notification, that would be the end, then. Except, I do recall the text of the original nagging Notification was differently worded, saying something about "devices". Well, maybe I've fixed the problem associated with
<em>both </em>Notifications, let's hope, although I&nbsp;still say&nbsp;that the first Notification appeared well before November 30.
<strong>If</strong> the problem is now fully resolved, I still won't be able to explain how my desktop decided to turn its wifi&nbsp;ON to see the new router, plus turn&nbsp;its bluetooth capability ON, too, for whatever reason. Or&nbsp;maybe the bluetooth somehow got turned
 on prior to November 30 to have caused the earlier Notification. Heck, maybe my wifi<em> also&nbsp;</em>inadvertently got turned on prior to November 30 and perhaps the change&nbsp;of router is what changed the text of the Notification.&nbsp;Oh, well, some mysteries will
 just have to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll report back in a few days or when a next pop-up occurs, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>As soon as I logged in this afternoon, the Notification (imaged in the previous post) again appeared and placed itself in the Notifications sidebar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I decided to again click on this Notification, it again took me to the <strong>
Settings / Shared Experiences </strong>screen where <strong>Share across devices </strong>
still is set to OFF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, it also presented me with a second pop-up, needing me to confirm my password in order to proceed with the unexplained fix. Once again, it pre-populated this second pop-up with an email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me pause this story and explain something about the email address it chose to pre-populate both times it presented itself. Back on July 2016, I wanted to register for the Win10 Insider Preview Builds. I&nbsp;had only&nbsp;wanted to get the build 14352 to get rid
 of a MAX_PATH problem.&nbsp;For this registration, I had to provide/create a new email address to use for this. I did so, but then abandoned the registration when I read the following&nbsp;information in the TOS:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>You might experience crashes, security vulnerabilities, data loss, or damage to your device.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I certainly did not want any of that, so I didn't complete the registration process. (I probably closed the registration window inelegantly if an elegant way was not evident.) I have never used that email address for anything, ever, and am not sure if I
 deemed that email address as valid, as in my mind I associated it only with this failed registration. Because that email address ended in "outlook.com", seems to me that&nbsp;that domain&nbsp;had to have been generated by Microsoft as part of the registration, as I
 would not have chosen that domain on my own. (I would have created one as "hotmail.com".)
<p>
</p><p>Back to my story. As I said, the second pop-up pre-populates with&nbsp;that email address from July 2016 that was part of an abandoned registration and one that I considered impotent. Still, I went ahead this time and entered the password that my old notes indicate
 I had&nbsp;created for it, it accepted the password, this second pop-up then disappeared, and I was left with the same screen&nbsp;for&nbsp;<strong>Settings / Shared Experiences</strong> where
<strong>Share across devices </strong>still is set to OFF, and&nbsp;is the same screen that&nbsp;I&nbsp;always previously access via the Start button without signing into any email address nor confirming any password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, boy, have I fed the original problem by doing this? A question for you, please:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Where has that outlook.com address been stored&nbsp;since last July 2016&nbsp;that it&nbsp;is now&nbsp;resurrected in this story</em>?&nbsp; I presume it&nbsp;got stored online by microsoft.com which makes it scary that I had to provide that password in order to proceed with changing
 options on my own computer! Certainly my own computer does not care to verify who I am in this way?!&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A second question, please:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Since I had to click on the Notification to be asked to confirm the password for that outlook.com account in order to reach my Settings, but I am not asked for any password when I am accessing the same settings via the Start button, does that mean that
 the Notifications in the sidebar are not merely my own computer talking privately to me (as I had assumed) but actually is an external microsoft.com computer communicating with me?
</em>This is an important distinction for me to come to understand. By confirming the password for this&nbsp;outlook.com account, have I reported back to the mothership without my knowledge? LOL.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, there's the matter of finding out how that outlook.com address has insinuated itself into my desktop computer such that I need to provide its password (this is unnerving), and may have insinuated itself into this whole pop-up problem,&nbsp;and if ultimately
 removing that address from where ever it resides holds new consequences for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the above may even be the root of the problem, but a digression. I regret ever expressing interest in the Insider Preview Builds program. I see it&nbsp;has come back to haunt me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            An email account is just required on Windows Insider Program in order to tally the number users that might submit feedback about an issue or a feedback about a new feature.
<p>
</p><p><strong>Shared</strong> <strong>experiences</strong> will require an email account in order to sync your personal configuration across your devices. That is exactly why it is asking you to update your information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We mentioned in our previous post that it is possible that a corrupted user profile is causing the notification issue with
<strong>Shared experiences</strong>. That being said, for further isolation of the notification issue, we suggest creating a new user profile. For easy distinction, you can name the new user profile as
<em>test</em>. After creating a new user profile, sign in with your Microsoft account and monitor if the same notification will show up. Follow the steps from this

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't act upon your nice advice about creating a new user profile to test this issue because, since that last Notification on December 21, I've yet to receive another one, today being ten days later. Prior to that, IIRC the Notification was almost at
 a frequency of once a day. I've made no other changes&nbsp;since December 21 when I turned off the two blue tiles. If the Notification never again appears, I think there is no experimentation left to perform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strange that I&nbsp;did receive that final Notification<em>&nbsp;after </em>I had corrected the two blue tiles, setting Wireless to OFF and setting Bluetooth to OFF. It was after I had shutdown my computer for several hours did the final&nbsp;Notification occur. Not RESTART,
 but Shut Down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I make that distinction between RESTART and Shut Down because I've noticed for a short while&nbsp;how quickly my PC had been starting up (since at least December 17, for sure, which is the date KB4058043 was installed, but I am guessing if that update was responsible)
 and today&nbsp;I found Windows 10 Fast Startup had been enabled. I keep it disabled but I suspect&nbsp;certain Windows Updates turn it back on. I've read that Fast Startup is not recommended (by the Norton community, for instance)&nbsp;because it bypasses certain update
 functions of certain applications that require a full kernel restart to take effect. Only a RESTART will go full kernel, they said, while Fast Startup will not. Ha, perhaps&nbsp;Fast Startup prevented Windows from seeing the two changes I had made, when&nbsp;the PC&nbsp;started
 up and sent that Notification one last time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back and forth we go with Fast Startup. I turn it off. Something turns it back on. Over and over. So, there are goblins who will undo what I do. But that's another topic for another day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In closing, I&nbsp;will never understand why Windows decided I had other devices. I would have preferred it to say, for instance,
<em>"Your Bluetooth is enabled&nbsp;in your PC yet no Bluetooth devices have been detected. Do you want to sync any devices to your PC? Read
 to receive a Notification every day telling me<em>&nbsp;Microsoft needs to fix my account</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, I will continue to monitor for the unwanted Notification and I look to finally post here&nbsp;after more time has passed.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Using Microsoft account balance to make Windows 8 &#47; Windows Phone 8 purchases&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I currently have a Microsoft account balance of £18.02 I was wondering if anyone knew how to set my Microsoft account as a payment method on either platform... This is related to MS points being retired on the Xbox 360 as a form of currency..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having looked on commerce.microsoft.com it is a payment option, however it doesn't explain how to redeem the value I have stored in there. Beyond on my Xbox 360 where I have successfully been able to redeem. It does seem a little redundant only being able
 to use on the one format when there are all these platforms designed to be linked together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">BIOS, CMOS Battery Replacement Problem</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Started 2/6/2011</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I replaced the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS_Battery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
CMOS battery</a> on my DELL 8300 yesterday. I'm running XP-Pro, SP 3. Since that time I have not been able to access the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS_setup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">BIOS setup</a> screen, or any screen involving the F keys. I have read many articles and
 posts on a number of sites and have received several suggestions. I have tried unplugging my pc, holding down the start button on the unplugged machine, hitting the Delete key--all to no avail. The F keys work on applications, however, so it is not the keyboard.<br />
<br />
<br />
I also went to the DELL web site and upgraded from the A05 version to the A07 version for my<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">BIOS</a> . It said it would resolve problems with unplugged USB cables. Since I most certainly did not put
 the USB cables back were they were originally (I unplugged everything before the battery replacement) I tried that by downloading the A07 version and flashing the BIOS. That did not work.<br />
<br />
<br />
I tried removing the battery, waiting 10 minutes and then replacing it, to no avail. I have tried rebooting a number of times, varying the times when I hit the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F2_Key" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">F2 key</a> . I have plugged and unplugged, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough, with the machine totally powered down and the plug pulled, nothing happened of course. I removed the battery, waited 10 minutes, replaced the battery, closed the case, righted it and put in the power plug and the machine immediately started
 to reboot! I got a window that gave the BIOS version as 'BIOS Plus version 1.10 A 07'. along with some of the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invalid configuration information. Please run SETUP program </li><li>Diskette drive 0 seek failure </li><li>Performing automatic IDE configuration </li><li>Strike F1 to continue, F2 to run SETUP utility </li></ul>
<span>So I pressed F1, and did not get to continue. I pressed F2 and nothing happened there either. I pressed F8 and F12 and nothing happened. I tried the DELETE and ESC keys--no help there either. The only
<span>So I pressed F1, and did not get to continue. I pressed F2 and nothing happened there either. I pressed F8 and F12 and nothing happened. I tried the DELETE and ESC keys--no help there either. The only
 way out of that screen was for me to hit the power off button. I then restarted the machine and got the same results. As soon as the DELL logo showed up I hit F2--still nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The machine rebooted and the time was reset to 2004. Other than that, I can't detect any changes except the loss of hyper-threading. I have reset and resynchronized the time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, I tried rebooting with the DELL Diagnostic Disk. The reboot happened as it has been happening, that is, I couldn't access it with F12 (per the manual's instructions). So that was unsuccessful also.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I know that this is a lengthy post but I wanted to include all that I have tried. Thanks for everyone's help and any suggestions. but it appears that I may be at the end of the road, but it sure would be great to be able to reset my machine to hyper-threading.<br />

<p>Who knew there was a difference in USB ports and that apparently all USB ports aren’t created equally?<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;This is finally over and the problem is solved.<span>&nbsp; </span>I moved the USB plug into several ports and finally after the third repositioning and rebooting, it works.<span>&nbsp;</span>I now have access to the BIOS page with my USB keyboard in place.</p>

<p>What does the 4/1/12 mean, does it mean april, if so y is it so long for a bad bio. &nbsp;It said "*** off u ****" because i get so much racial abuse online and i get called a *** as you can figure out cos my Gamertag is Amar Rambo when I'm not but i don't report
 abuse because by the time i've finished a game, usually a 5 minute mw3 game, the persons left and i don't know their name. &nbsp;I did that because the only people who ever look at my profile are people that look at it for the wrong reasons, even my friends don't
 look at it and I've seen people do worse things than this and have couple days suspension. &nbsp;I'm confused about the date format though but if its still banned tomorrow then its definitely till April. &nbsp;Also do i get my months back for Xbox Live Gold Membership
 if this ban lasts that long?</p>

<p>4th day of the 1st month of the 2012th year to me. Your ban will be lifted around the same time it was enforced (if you were banned at 9pm you'll be unbanned at 9pm).&nbsp;<br />

In answer to your second question no you don't because you broke the rules you agreed to follow and were handed the punishment you agreed to upon signing up with the service. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Depends on your region. &nbsp;In North America, that would definitely be April 1st. &nbsp;I've never had a message from MS that was in a non-NA format. &nbsp;But yeah, I hope it's only 24 hours - 3 months seems pretty harsh. &nbsp;Although... &nbsp;were the **** actually asterisks
 or the word itself? &nbsp;Could be three months for blatant cursing.</p>

<p>In future it's always best to start your own thread instead of bumping old ones.This one is from 2012.</p>
<p>The date should be shown the same way as you use it in your region.</p>
<p>Most of the world uses day/month/year.The U.S. &amp; Canada(I think) uses month/day/year &amp; parts of Asia use year/month/day</p>
