<h2>            Microsoft Solitaire Collection offline problem. Spider hand won&#39;t replay</h2>
                    I am using Microsoft solitaire collection desktop app on windows 10 offline. I am playing spider. I can't figure out how to replay a hand that I have lost. It only has a new game button that deals a new hand. The XP version made it easy to replay a hand.
 How do I do that on Windows 10?

<h2>            Windows 7 Bluetooth Issue - LG LAS350B Soundbar will not pair with Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to change my laptop, and for some odd reason, the new one would not connect via bluetooth. This is the message I receive:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-------------------</p>
<p>Adding this device failed because of an authentication error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might be due to the use of an incorrect pairing code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try adding again using the correct pairing code for the device. You might need to refer to your device's documentation for details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check your device's documentation to see if you need to first install special software or security certificates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check for any firmware or software updates for your device.</p>
<p>--------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same issue with my Note3. &nbsp;I was no longer able to connect and so I removed the connection and several attempts to add the device again failed. &nbsp;Today, I decided to re-try and the soundbar successfuly added my Note3 again. &nbsp;However, for the laptop,
 it keeps giving the error message above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what else to do. Also, the soundbar connects to my other Samsung device with no issue. I do however recall one time while going through the troubleshooting, my computer states that my "Bluetooth Peripheral Device" failed and needed to be updated.
 However, I have run Windows update several times and everything seems to be updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help Microsoft!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: 12/25/2015 2:02 PM</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just got off the phone with LG Technical Support ~ they do not have drivers for the Soundbar, so even though Windows is saying to visit the site to get updated drivers, there is none. I already have my phone and other devices connected to the soundbar. &nbsp;I
 need help badly!</p>

            Hi Ray.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try setting the desired options for Notification buttons in Mail Settings (gear icon at bottom of Inbox) &gt; Message List &gt; Swipe actions.  It was after I set Delete as one of the Swipe options that it appeared for me on my Notification popup - which is convenient.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Windows 10 File Explorer Opens Multiple Windows when asking for just one additional</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10: An upgrade from 8.1-1 with all the updates to 10 as of 9/8/15.</p>
<p>i had two File Explorer windows open: The first on a folder made on the G: drive and one on "This PC":</p>
<p>I was copying all of one USB2 (H;) on the second window to add to another USB3 (G:)'s new folder.</p>
<p>After the copy had been running awhile, I went to the second window (the origin of the copy) to ask for a new window to look at something else.</p>
<p>Suddenly there were about 10 or 12 windows of File Explorer that opened in a cascade format.</p>
<p>After that it finally stopped after creating two areas of cascading windows.</p>
<p>I was then able to close all the extra windows and just keep the third one to continue working.</p>
<p>Hope this is enough info to pinpoint the bug.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Checked the new log and saw no information I could decipher as further steps to take; however, this log was 4 times longer than the one first one and seemed to run more through steps.&nbsp; The log's directory also has cab files from the first run as well as
 one dated from the upgrade process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked the WinSxS temp directory and saw no information in PendingDeletes or PendingRenames for the process that ran in Safe Mode. There were many PendingRenames from the process that ran first under the command mode.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 7 hangs when creating or renaming folder</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am running a Lenovo n200 with&nbsp; windows 7 pro X64. If I come out of sleep mode or hibernation then creating or renaming a new folder on the desktop or interacting with the desktop in other ways such as cutting and pasting causes the computer to hang for
 up to a minute. This issue has been quite widely reported online and there is an open question on this forum from last year here http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7performance/thread/37a8060c-a4f0-4a14-9bbf-cfa075bd2394/</p>
<p>I haven't been able to find any fixes for this yet - has anyone come up with a solution?</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Are you facing this issue only when you wake the computer from sleep?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Boot the computer into safe mode and then try creating or renaming new folder and check if the issue occurs, here are the steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Restart your computer if it is powered on.<br />
2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tap the F8 key after your computer initially powers on.<br />
3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once you see the Advanced Boot Options menu you can stop tapping.<br />
4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Use the up/down arrow keys to highlight your selection.<br />
5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Select Safe Mode and press Enter.<br />
6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You should see drivers loading, and then please wait.<br />
7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You should then be at the Welcome Screen.<br />
8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Logon to your computer using an account with Administrator privileges.<br />

<p><span><span>I would suggest also you to update the drivers for the graphic card, download the latest drivers from the manufacturer’s website, install and check if it helps:</span></span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also try running power troubleshooter and check if it helps, here is the link:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;<span>Also try disabling the security software temporarily and check if it helps, make sure you enable it once it is done.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please respond and let us know the status of the issue.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Azam</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. The problem is I can't recreate the issue - it seems to occur randomly when the laptop comes out of sleep or hibernation mode. The drivers are all up to date and as far as I can tell there's no problem with safe mode, but then I would
 probably need to run it in safe mode for a week or so to check :-P</p>
<p>The power troubleshooter shows up no problems either.</p>
<p>Haven't yet had the problem recur for me to try disabling security software. I've noticed from other users that some of them have been able to recreate the problem and others haven't. It seems to be a common issue with win 7/vista on lenovos . . .</p>
<p>Sorry I can't add any more info</p>

<h2>            XCOPY &#47;K does not presserve read-only attribute in XP</h2>
                    I am copying file using XCOPY /K /R from one directory to another and I want to keep the original attributes. Although it preserves time stamp etc but can not preserve read-only attributes. Although windows documentation says XCOPY does not preserve read-only
 by default but with /K option. It used to do before. I am not sure whether any patching bug or any third party software issue. Any help is appreciated.

    <title>Error code 0x80070011 whenever Windows 10 tries to update. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cupcakekingv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error code 0x80070011 whenever Windows 10 tries to update.</h2>
                    <p>Everytime that I have tried to have windows 10 install an update (currently stuck trying to install KB3156421) It will fail when I restart the computer to actually install it and revert back to the previous update and ask to install it again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking through Event Viewer I can see every time this fails (some 26 times) it gives me the same error code of&nbsp;0x80070011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now from what I've been able to gather, this is caused by changing the default 'ProgramFilesDir' registry from it's default to something else, in my case from C:\ to D:\ (as my SSD isn't big enough for my programs).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone got any ideas on a proper fix for this except for changing the default location in regedit everytime I want to install an update or can Windows seriously not install an update when the program files are in a differnt place?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<p>I have the same issue. To use my new SSD ( and not reinstall Windows ) I moved some directories from C: to the SSD and established a JUNCTION ( using the old MS-DOS mklink command ) between these directories.</p>
<p>Now I discovered this is not possible because the Hard Link has a "same volume limitation", or in other words, you cannot move "some" parts of Windows to other drive.</p>
<p>The question now is: What parts of Windows cannot be moved ? </p>
<p>( to try to revert back the damage and have a minimal use of the SSD at least ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h3> zach02p  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stolen 360</h2>
                    
<p>A friends of mine 360 was stolen by his roomate. My friend has proof of ownership. He bought it used. Need to find a way to get the serial #. He has a Gold membership. I was wondering if Microsoft would have a unique ID for it (serial/ mac address). If so
 can they tell aprox. where it is at.</p>

            <p>Hello Greenweed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated on the status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>perform startup repair </strong>and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow these instructions to get to the Windows recovery environment. You may need to connect a keyboard to complete the steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Do one of the following, depending on whether you have installation media (such as a DVD or USB flash drive):</p>
<p>
</p><p>• If you have installation media for Windows 8.1, start (or boot) your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to "Press any key to boot from DVD", do so. If you don’t
 see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the "Install Windows" page, click "Repair your computer" to start the Windows recovery environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>• If you don’t have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the Windows recovery environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. In the Windows recovery environment, on the "Choose an option" screen, click "Troubleshoot".</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Click "Advanced options" and then click "startup repair".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: <span><span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may create Windows 8.1 installation media using the following article:<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Create installation media for Windows 8.1</strong><br />

    <title>Windows 10 start menu problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arnfinnl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 start menu problem</h2>
                    <p>If you read this ,you may be aware of the method to get the start menu working again.</p>
<p>By right-click start button and select command prompt (administrator)</p>
<p>type powershell and hit enter ,then paste in this: Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</p>
<p>You may have to log off and on again to get the menu working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a cause for that problem on my computer.</p>
<p>I have a scan/repair program called : Auslogics boostspeed. And every time i repair registry errors with that one ,the start menu stops working. And i have to do the prosedure described abow.</p>
<p>I think that this may happen with other scan/repair software too....like cccleaner ,registry doctor etc...</p>
<p>I have now used the computer for several days now without using the registry fix thing in auslogics. And it works like a charm...</p>
<p>Hope you find this useful ,and good luck :)</p>
<p>Update. In Auslogics boostspeed&nbsp; It is the Fileassociations under "file" That makes the problem. Untick that one and it seems to be ok.</p>

    <title>BIOS Prompt will not show - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tylerlindstedt  say:</h3>
<h2>            BIOS Prompt will not show</h2>
                    Hello all, I recently found that my 8 gigs of RAM was being capped to 3 by my 32 bit Windows 7 and was attempting to fix that by re-installing Win. 7 with my disc but when I tried to restart so that I could boot from disc there was no prompt. I rarely
 turn off/restart my computer so I never really noticed but it doesn't give me the prompt on start up that says something like "Press ___ to enter BIOS" or something like that. When trying to look up this problem, all I found was that people just get a black
 screen, I don't think that's what happens to me. Can someone please help?

            <p>You need to enter the BIOS and change the boot order so that your DVD drive is the 1st device listed, followed by your disk drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To enter the BIOS when you 1st turn on your PC you should see the PC manufacture's BIOS splash screen displayed for a few seconds. At the bottom of the splash screen you should see an option to Enter / Change the BIOS settings (Example: tap the Del key several
 times while the splash is displayed). Make your boot order changes and then "Exit and Save" your BIOS settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now reboot the PC with the DVD and see if you get the Press any key message.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you see no message</strong> at all it could be the BIOS is set to skip the "Splash" screen in which case you will need to check with the PC manufacture on what key you need to tap several times (at least 5 to&nbsp;10 times once every second) when you
 power on the PC.</p>

            How to Change Boot Order in BIOS
<p>Depending on the brand or how your computer is configured, loading the BIOS might be different. In this article, I will show you on a standard configuration.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image17.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb17.png" height="379" width="501" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto" /></a></p>
<p>First, start your computer then press F2 function key as noted on the BIOS screen above, you will have to do this quickly as the BIOS loads very fast. Some BIOS configurations might require a different key combination such as F1, Tab, F12 or F11. Consult
 the owners manual that came with your computer for instructions or watch the display closely when it starts.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image18.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb18.png" height="361" width="499" /></a></p>
<p>Now we are inside the BIOS, of course yours might look completely different as the interface is not a standard across manufacturers, but the same philosophy is there. The BIOS will list information such as your primary boot device, along with other attached
 storage and secondary storage devices such as your DVD drive and connected peripherals such as your keyboard and mouse. The above screenshot displays the main page of this BIOS screen.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image19.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb19.png" height="355" width="488" /></a></p>
<p>Navigating your BIOS requires that you use the four way navigation arrow keys, there is no support for using a pointing device such as your mouse. It’s a very simple, as you can see, I am on the Advanced screen of this BIOS, I navigated to it by using the
 right arrow key.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image20.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb20.png" height="416" width="557" /></a></p>
<p>Here we see the Boot Configuration screen. Yours might vary depending on the Brand and BIOS version. On this screen we can change the first device that is loaded. If your intention is to boot from a device, you will have to change it to be the first one.
 The above screenshot shows that the first boot device is removable, this can either be a DVD or a thumb drive. If you would like to edit this, look for the instructions on screen.</p>
<p>As you can see in the instructions provided, to move a device up or down, you use the plus and minus keys. devices that have a plus sign beside them mean they have information that can be displayed for additional configuration purposes, pressing ‘Enter’
 key will reveal this information.</p>

<h2>            windows starts hidden applications with overlay window</h2>
                    <p>On startup doing nothing, several applications are started in the background (not showing on the task bar) with another widow that seems to be tied to it (possibly as an overlay). This started with just pictures and settings (as the applications) and has
 proceeded to include more (calculator and store), sort of an infection. I can only see these when I click with the mouse to show running apps.I can shut them down only via selecting them and then window close. They do not show up in the task window.</p>

<div>Hi Jashua,</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a developer so I have my system setup with xampp, postgres and phped. I also use norton.&nbsp; I noticed several strange startups by monitoring task manager and noticed windows shell experience starting up (assumed this was normal) but when starting adobe
 reader, I noticed several command windows started, so I started shut this down and setup my computer to have not auto start (for performance tuning my application. About 2 months ago I started seeing settings (with 2 windows hidden from desktop). Then pitures,
 awhile later store and most recently calculator. Yesterday I tried downloading Defender offline to check for viruses offline, but it doesn't validate on startup forcing me to choose normal boot.</div>
Cheers,</div>

    <title>After uninstalling Microsoft FSX, it won&#39;t install again. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leonard shilton  say:</h3>
<h2>            After uninstalling Microsoft FSX, it won&#39;t install again.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is on a one year old Dell, with Windows 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This all started when it looked like my C: drive was too small. It was getting full too quickly, while the 1.81 TB D: drive was virtually empty. FSX worked okay, but I wanted to install add-on's that I had on this Dell from my old, Windows 7 Dell. A
 more computer savvy (much more) &nbsp;friend said that C: is a ssd, and I should move FSX to the D:. Uninstall and re-install to D:. Seemed simple enough. &nbsp;I would then have more space for everything. After uninstalling, which did not go easily, &nbsp;I think I finally
 have it out. I can't put it back.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Putting in the disc does nothing. Have to go to E: and try to make it work there. It looks like the installer is working, but the only thing that comes up is an FSX Window with two circles to check. Not he regular FSX window to complete the installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One says, "Repair" Reinstall all program Features installed by the previous setup.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Other one says, "Remove" Remove all installed features.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the repair one, This comes up:Error:-1605 This action is only valid for products that are currently installed. Ok, it's not there. Try other one.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Remove, next. Do you want to completely remove the selected application and all of its features? Then, Would you like to remove your save game files?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Up comes Error Number: 0x80040702. Failed to load DLL: GameuxInstallHelper, Set up will now terminate.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then, The wizard was interupted before Microsof Flight Simulator X could be completely installed/uninstalled. &nbsp;Finish, exit.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So, I am completely stumped.</p>

            <p>Yes, you will need the 1.81 TB drive for FSX; &nbsp;a shame it wasn't an SSD: &nbsp;FSX will load your addons much better on that one. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re: &nbsp;your re-installation matter. &nbsp; First you need to remove all instances of FSX on your system and that includes Registry references. &nbsp; You would know where the folders of FSX reside, so check that they have all been deleted and then re-boot your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are getting the 1605 Error message, it means that FSX software needs its licensing reset. &nbsp; So go here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/928080</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Reset Tool package also applies for your Error code, not just 1722 and works also in Win10. &nbsp; Go carefully through the instructions given, but when you get to the part of going into Command Prompt, you will need to open Command Prompt (Admin).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've gotten this far and FSX Disk 1 starts to load, it is preferable to install FSX into the root of your selected drive (e.g. D:\FSX) and not into the default location of Program Files (xxx). &nbsp; FSX prefers to run without unnecessary clutter. &nbsp; If all
 installs correctly and you've activated FSX, then you can go ahead with adjusting your settings. &nbsp; However, it is highly recommended to install your add ons one at a time and then run FSX to check that there is no conflict. &nbsp;Many install all their add ons
 all at once and when FSX crashes they're perplexed as to the cause of it. &nbsp; And don't forget your HIGHMEMFIX=1 entry (add this to your Graphics section in your FSX.cfg: &nbsp;the ACES team forgot this entry).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps you get started.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Re: &nbsp;the Registry entries for FSX. &nbsp; The reason that we remove everything associated with FSX is that, during installation, if FSX detects any (old) reference to it, it will assume that an installation of it already exists. &nbsp; The result being that it won't
 reinstall or else, will give you a Repair option, which, when clicked on, produces no response. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have uninstalled FSX via the DVD or Control Panel (Remove Programs) and now unsure what to do with the Registry, you could download CCleaner(Free version), found here: &nbsp;https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Amongst its many functions, it does look for Registry entries that are useless because a program has been removed. &nbsp; However, before removing any entry, always satisfy yourself that it would be one that is safe to remove; &nbsp;I've never had a problem with the
 software though. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Thankyou Chriso747. I will check it out. However, I've been warned, by more than one person, and especially one who really knows his stuff, that registry cleaners are something that I probably should not mess with. Your thoughts?

            <p>They are correct up to a point. &nbsp; Ordinarily, I wouldn't recommend Registry cleaning unless there is a specific need to do so or you are fairly conversant with the registry entries that are about to be deleted. &nbsp; As I mentioned, I have been using CCleaner
 (and Advanced System Care) - both reputable programs, for a few years now and have been quite happy with them. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only snag that once cropped up was that it wasn't recognizing some file extensions for several of my B744 aircraft. That resulted with CCleaner removing those registry entries thus also removing the aircraft. &nbsp; What that meant was that I had to re-insert
 those aircraft into the FSX Simobjects folder and ensure that CCleaner overlooked those extensions when it did its search. &nbsp; The sequel to all that is it has now learnt to accept those extensions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, really it's a matter of choice. &nbsp; It may then be better in your case to avoid them and see what a physical search for old FSX registry entries brings up. &nbsp; You're already frustrated and perplexed with your present problem; &nbsp;you don't need another one
 if you can help it.</p>

            <p>Hi Criso747,</p>
<p>Sorry for the late reply. I actually was thinking about a search for old FSX registry entries, as you suggest. Problem is, in order to do that, I have to figure out HOW to do it!! How do I find the registry, and how can I recognize them, even if they are
 right in front of my face, you know? I don't want to get rid of things that I don't want to get rid of, right? I really appreciate your efforts to assist me. Really. I try to learn a little every day, but then I find more stuff that I am totally in the dark
 about. I spoke to a friend (same one mentioned before) about this. He has been in computers steadily for 40 years, and he says that if I can't figure this out, he can back it all up, even though I have Carbonite, too, and then wipe it clean, re install Windows,
 and go back to square one with FSX. That's looking more and more like a solution, every day. I know that this is only a "toy," but I'd like it to work. And I don't want to mess things up. I'm good at messing things up! I will let you know. As I said, your
 help is appreciated. You seem to be a very patient person. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Leonard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No problems about the delay in writing: &nbsp;you have much to consider. &nbsp; Re: &nbsp;Registry. &nbsp; If you type Regedit in your Search box on desktop, it will take you to it. &nbsp; However, I don't think you should delve too far into it if you're not comfortable in editing
 the Registry. &nbsp; However, leaving the Registry aside, just for a quick check &amp; for interest sake, you could go into your File Explorer page, click on your disk where FSX would have resided and do a search (in the box at the top right) for FSX. &nbsp; See what you
 come up with. &nbsp; Of course, any add ons you may have (e.g. aircraft, FSUIPC, etc. etc.) will show up since you have not deleted them(?), but there shouldn't be any entries pertaining to your FSX directory (e.g. C:\FSX, C:\Users\..., etc.). &nbsp; If there are, then
 FSX has not been removed completely at your last uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going the full FSX uninstall route will, of course, get you back to square one, but I would only pursue that as a last resort. &nbsp;I still think you should give the Licensing Reset Tool (described in my post in June 27) a go. &nbsp;This tool has helped many to get
 FSX going again in Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that FSX is more than a 'toy' to you, since you are determined to get it going again and get back into the 'air'. For me, it remains as a low-grade simulator, providing some enjoyment to my lifelong passion that could never be realized in real life
 (medical reasons). &nbsp; Many ex (real world) pilots use FSX to keep their skills and interest alive, so it still has a valid appeal to those with flying in their blood. &nbsp; I am retired now, but still do a long-haul flight almost every day (just completed one from
 Shanghai, China to Istanbul, Turkey). &nbsp; So I say this to encourage you to keep trying to fix this thing up and continue to develop your flying skills and expand your horizons. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, I am quite 'patient', particularly since dealing with Computer and FSX shortcomings compels one to exercise this trait to the max.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi, Me again!</p>
<p>Well, first, FSX is more like a hobby, to me. "Toy" was probably not a correct way to describe it. A fun pass-time. I am an aviation nut. Interested in flying machines all my life. Never got a pilots license; you can't always do everything you want to do
 in life, you know. Have flown planes before, though, and I also like Radio Control planes, too. Am much better at crashing than flying! Ha, ha. I have an R/C flight simulator, too. But IT WORKS! Also retired. Long story.</p>
<p>I am not going to give up on this, but it is frustrating. I looked at the Regedit suggestion, and thought, "yikes," don't even think of fooling around with this, Len!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, I don't see much of anything regarding FSX &nbsp;anywhere in my system. Add-ons, or anything, but I'll keep looking. Might stumble on something. For now, I am baffled. ??????????</p>
<p>I found something about a license key reset tool, but I don't know if that is what you are referring to. Didn't have any results with that, either, and I don't want to experiment too much, and mess things up more. How exactly do I find your post?</p>
<p>It seems that there are a lot of people who have had various problems with FSX, partially, I believe, 'cause it's an old program, and partially, because there are many non-geeks (like myself) out there. I think being a "geek" is a high compliment!!! But
 when it works, it is just fine. &nbsp;It seems that there are a lot of folks who are WAY more knowledgeable about all this than I am, like YOU, and I will never catch up. Oh, well! You know light years more than I do, and I appreciate your efforts. Any additional
 suggestions are much appreciated, believe me.</p>
<p>I remain, not giving up.</p>

<p>Hi Sarah Jane,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!<br />
<br />
Method 1: Download and install the latest updated drivers for realtek HD audio manager which is compatible with the Windows 7 Operating system from the manufacturer’s website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now go to the “Sound” option under control panel-&gt;Select the speakers and click on properties-&gt;then go to levels-&gt;and reduce all levels to 50 %.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2: Install the codecs also for the same.</p>
<p>Realtek HD (High Definition) Audio Codecs is one of the most popular integrated on-board sound card devices used by OEM on PC motherboard to provide functionality of input and output of audio signals to/from a computer under control of computer programs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> davidh72uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with picture files not loading in folder and taking hours to copy</h2>
                    <p>When my partner uses her fairly new Windows 10 computer, and goes to the 'pictures' folder, almost none of the photos come up with viewable thumbnails. &nbsp;One or two random ones will, but the vast majority have a 'blank sheet of paper' file pic. &nbsp;However,
 go to a photo app and ask it to look through the 'pictures' folder, and hey presto - instantly all the thumbnails are there. &nbsp;Try to go to 'show thumbnails' options to decide what sort to show, and the options are 'faded out' so can't be changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, when cutting and pasting about 50 regular photos (800k each approx) from the 'download' folder to the 'pictures' folder, it took many, many hours to complete the task. &nbsp;The computer had to be left on overnight to finish! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest what is going on?</p>
<p>Thanks!<br />

            Nope, no help I'm afraid. &nbsp;The 'File Explorer' button on the taskbar is incredibly slow and this seems to be the root cause of the problem; there are times when the file explorer fails to work whatsoever and a reboot is required. &nbsp;This is a new computer
 with minimal apps and programs on it and sfc /scannow shows no issues.

<h2>            HP Pavilion 23 stuck in start up modem</h2>
                    I installed window 10 update computer was working fine. I connected my printer (Kodak) to it after printing stuff and the computer was put on sleep mode the next time I went to use it the start up screen wont start up. Its like the computer is consistently
 trying to start up. I have shut it down and unplugged it still the same thing. It will not allow me to even restart it I have to shut it down. The only screen that appears is the black screen with the circle white sandbar like it is loading. The printer was
 disconnected from it and shut down it has been in the start up mode for a few hours and still wont start up. Does anyone know what I can do to fix this problem?&nbsp;

            I did this and it wouldn't run the repair disc for windows 10. I was able to pull up the repair screen by pressing CTRL F11 as I restarted the computer . I clicked repair and it said windows was unable to repair my computer. I then hit the prompt to run
 the DVD /USB option to run the repair disc but it wouldn't allow me to run the disc. It seems as if my screen is stuck on the black screen with the cursor spinning. I seen post all over that lots of people are having the same problem I even checked to make
 sure it was only showing the computer to have one monitor cause that was also a common problem for everyone after upgrading to windows 10. My computer wont even allow me to sign on it is just a black screen with the cursor spinning. If I hit CTRL ALT Delete
 it will bring me a blue screen with he Windows Logo but noting appears to sign in. Any other suggestions?&nbsp;
