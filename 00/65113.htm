<p>One of the tricks of a malicious software infection is to try to convince you that your system has a problem and you must pay something to somebody to fix it. &nbsp;You may be lured or redirected to a site informing you that your system needs attention that only
 they can provide - for a fee.</p>
<p>If you get taken to a site and are encouraged to buy Windows, are there any words on the site that you can tell us about? &nbsp;I think we have seen many of these kinds of sites already and know what to do about the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To eliminate questions and guessing, please provide additional information about your&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>What is your system make and model?</p>
<p>What is your XP version and Service Pack?</p>
<p>Click Start, Run and in the box enter:</p>
<p>msinfo32</p>
<p>Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste&nbsp;the information back here.</p>
<p>There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to&nbsp;be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</p>
<p>Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation: &nbsp;McAfee, Norton, Spybot,&nbsp;AVG, Avira!, MSE, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.</p>
<p>Perform some scans for malicious software, then fix any remaining issues:</p>
<p>Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware&nbsp;detection programs:</p>
<p>Malwarebytes (MBAM): &nbsp;<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a></p>
<p>SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS): &nbsp;<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a></p>
<p>They can be uninstalled later if desired.</p>
<p>When the scans runs clean, that is the time to start investigating problems.</p>

                    <p>I have a networked attached hard drive that I use for backup of the hard drives of several computers.&nbsp; Over the years I have accumulated several thousand .event files.&nbsp; These are files that seem to be related to some other file or folder (usually a picture

<p>Ken,</p>
<p>That didn't help much. It is the same mumbo jumbo that has been published before.&nbsp; It doesn't say why these files were generated only that they may be generated by some sort of Apple software. I have 33 of these files on my PC's hard drive and they aren't
 noticeably affecting its performance. I have approximately 65,000 of these files on the storage unit (many of them duplicates)&nbsp;across multiple directories.&nbsp;Each of the ***.event files has a&nbsp;name association&nbsp;with a *** .jpg file that I have saved. I want to
 delete them but I don't want to delete them if doing so destroys the ability to view/use the pictures which cover 50 years of family history.&nbsp;I am attaching a picture of what one of the directories looks like.&nbsp; Each picture has an event file associated with
 it.&nbsp; What happens if I delete those two event files.&nbsp; Will I be able to open/view/edit the picture once the .event file is gone?</p>

<h2>            SQL Server NON-DEFAULT Tracing stops all of a sudden</h2>
                    <p>Dear all, </p>
<p>we have enabled the SQL tracing on SQL servers but for some databases the tracing is disabled without any reason and then we have to enable it manually. This is happening on frequent basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>here is what we have done.</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Procedure CREATE PROC [dbo].[AuditTrcProc] with Tracing events</li><li>EXEC AuditTrcProc</li><li>EXEC sp_procoption 'AuditTrcProc', 'startup', 'TRUE'; </li></ol>
<p><br />
the tracing is generated to Shared location say 
\\NFS_Share_name\ServerName\sessiontrace.trc [ this is with sequence number and when it gets 1 MB is size another file is created]</p>
<p><br />
All works perfect, but&nbsp; this tracing is disabled on many servers randomly. </p>
<p>output of the query is null for non-default tracing&nbsp; [ no issues with default tracing]</p>
<p><br />
SELECT * FROM :: fn_trace_getinfo(default) </p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your feedback on this issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Aijaz</p>

    <title>Windows 10 reset failed. Now what&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 reset failed.  Now what&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently updated my last Win7 64x machine (my main rig) to Win10 64x.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The upgrade went fine, but I noticed some problems with upon first boot.&nbsp; It was sort of slow booting up, my sound wasn't working, and something just didn't feel right.&nbsp; The other 4 upgrades went very smooth (on other machines).&nbsp; They all booted very fast,
 so I was feeling confident in upgrading the "last man standing".&nbsp; Well, after updating all of my relevant drivers and still not having any sound, and the PC taking a&nbsp;some what of along time time to boot (compared to the other PC's).&nbsp; I elected to "reset" my
 install.&nbsp; Windows was activated, and I did verify the OS so I figured I was in good shape to go ahead an attempt this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything seemed to be going pretty well until the first reboot.&nbsp; Then I got the error code. "your computer restarted unexpectedly".&nbsp; So, after a little research I found there was a "fix" and&nbsp;that you could gain access to registry by pressing "shift+f10"&nbsp;
 I did so and changed a value in HK_Local_Machine&gt;system&gt;setup&gt;childcompletion&gt;status and changed the value from 1 to 3.&nbsp; The machine rebooted and seemed to be ok.&nbsp; Flashed to the Win10 install screen @64% progress&nbsp;and then just started to reboot at that same
 point.&nbsp; Obviously something went very wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my next questions are...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I have to reinstall Win7 and go through all the updating in order to get back to my upgrade status to Win10?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover...Can I reinstall Win7 and start over? Or am I toast?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What went wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried&nbsp;startup repair&nbsp;(yes I made a Win10 x64 disk with the Win10 media creator) it does nothing (and I have no cd key).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried going back to Win7 ( guess I forwent that when I elected to do a reset)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a system restore...says I must specify which windows installation to restore (it's not even an option)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried resetting my PC from installation media and it said my disk was "locked".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need some help here...sort of panicking </p>
<p>
</p><p>System specs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel i7 920 (OC'd to 3.8 GHz)</p>
<p>EVGA x58 SLi3</p>

            <p>Windows 10 is installed and updated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran into some space issues on my OS SSD.&nbsp; Disabling hibernation gave me the breathing room I needed to proceed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>No issues with the install.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only real issue that exists now is a driver issue with a Creative XF-I sound card.&nbsp; It is now (sadly) a legacy pci card, so I guess I have to wait for Creative to catch up, or figure something else out.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just got an hp Pavilion g6. I can access the internet with the Ethernet cable but not the wifi. I have a frontier router with wifi which I have used with my old Dell vostro 1000. Why when I disconnect the Ethernet cable I do not get wifi it says it is
 limited and no access? Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            If you are running Windows 10 1709, you should be able to change the Power Mode by clicking the battery icon in the Notification area (system tray). Drag the slide to extreme end for High Performance.

<h2>            SOLVED&#58; Disk 100&#37; busy, System Unusable</h2>
                    <p>Edit: Solved by running chkdsk.exe against the storage space drive (my D:). It took more than 48 hours for chkdsk to complete (so be patient if you are doing this!) but that seems to have resolved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Windows 10 Education Ed, version 1709</li><li>1 x SSD boot disk</li><li>Storage Space Device of 2 x 2TB disks mirrored</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>This is a recent change in behaviour, new in the last 1-3 months I would guess. My Storage Space Device frequently goes to 100% busy, rendering my system more or less inoperable. Any process / event that touches the Storage Space Device results in this behaviour.
 I don't see anything relevant in the Event Viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried many of the online suggestions such as disabling search and SuperFetch but that has not helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just now I was trying to update a route in Garmin Basecamp. When I initiated the route recalculation, the Storage Space Device went to 100% busy and stayed there for 10 - 15 minutes or so with the route recalculation showing now progress. Then disk activity
 suddenly went to zero and the route recalculation completed in what I would consider a "normal" amount of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week I was trying to copy music files between my NAS and my desktop, but had the same problems.</p>

<p>Edit: This may be related to any of the "file preview" or "file details" type view modes (large icons, tiles) in file manager. "List" and "small icons" views seems to be fine, but larger icon views, "details" view, "tiles" etc. seem to be a problem. In fact,
 file manager just crashed which testing various view options in the root of my D:.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More specifically it may be related to selecting any of the "more detail" type view modes in a given folder where that view mode had never previously been selected. Switching back to a previously selected detail view mode seems to be fine. In other words,
 disk busy goes to 100% for a long time while the system is working on populating the detailed view data the first time a given view is selected in a given folder. CPU is idling and memory usage to only ~20% while this is going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is only happening on my storage space device which is 2 x 2TB Western Digital Green mechanical drives. The problem does not manifest on my boot drive which is a Crucial m.2 flash device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks Andre. Looks like something in your list has resolved the issue for me. I disabled startup tasks, background apps, and non-MSFT services. Re-enabled the Garmin related stuff which I use frequently and the system is still working fine so I'll leave
 it like that for now.</p>
<p>

            It turns out that disabling all that stuff did not help. Any process that touches the storage space device is causing the device to go to 100% busy. My GOG games are installed on that device and they are now unplayable. Again, this was not a problem 2-3
 months ago.

<p>After about a month of banging my head against this problem, I ran chkdsk.exe against my storage space. chkdsk ran for more than 48 hours, appearing to be "stuck" at 10% for most of that time. When I checked on the machine late this afternoon, it was at
 the login screen. I ran some tests and the issue seems to be resolved, or at least the storage space does not get pegged at 100% busy like it was, though it still seems a bit slow overall. Still, my games seem to be working fine now so that's good enough for
 me.</p>

<p>Graeme P, thanks for taking the trouble to respond. Having been away for a few weeks, I had forgotten about it but your response prompted me to see if the problem still existed and, I am happy to say, that both Chrome and Firefox now seem to be working OK,
 so I guess somebody has applied some fixes in the interim.&nbsp; My guess is still a Microsoft problem, as it occurred in 2 browsers, but it doesn't really matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>Or find the item/game in the store and instead of the price it should show you the option to install it again?</p>

            We never got water in ours... water came out. The unit kept turning off...then wouldn't turn on. When we were looking at it... water dripped out. I don't know what kind of faulty machinery this is... I've never heard of such a thing happening. Ours is
 well set back inside a unit where no water can get to it.

            <p><strong>(Also try my more detailed solution posted later - see Feb 28th, 2016)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same problems: Four computers are connected in my office network. On each device, I shared one folder to make it&nbsp;accessible for all the other devices in the network. One folder on my "main" computer serves as&nbsp;a store for all the documents we&nbsp;create
 and use.&nbsp;It worked perfectly&nbsp;- until I upgraded to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 10 on all four devices, accessing the shared folders was no longer possible. This was a real problem for me&nbsp;because&nbsp;accessing the&nbsp;central document store from all the other devices was also no longer possible. You can imagine that I got slightly
 nervous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make the long story short, I found a solution and created a new, functional homegroup. My solution is very similar to the one Daniel083 suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that I can help you solving your problem with the following little "manual" showing how I proceeded. By the way, my mother language is German, and I use the German version of Windows 10, so, hopefully, I translate&nbsp;the menus and steps correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) On every single&nbsp;device in the network, open the "Services" section in the Control Panel,&nbsp;set the following service to "Automatic" and start them:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - HomeGroup Provider</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - HomeGroup Listener</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Peer Networking Grouping</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) In the Windows Explorer, open the "Options" menu, and change the settings to make sure that hidden and system files are visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Shut down ALL the other computers in your network except the one on which you want to create a new homegroup. This step is essential!</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Open the folder c:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Roaming\Peernetworking. Delete all the files in the folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) In Windows Explorer, tap or click on "HomeGroup" (in the navigation area of&nbsp;Windows Explorer, almost at the end). Tap or click the button "Create new homegroup" and wait until it is created. I recommend that you copy the shown key to save it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) The computer now automatically enters the new homegroup. The first part is completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) Start another PC in the network. Wait until it has fully started. In Windows Explorer, tap or click&nbsp;"HomeGroup", and then tap or click the button "Enter homegroup". You probably get the message that your key is being checked; don't worry! After a few
 (more) seconds, Windows asks you for the key of the new homegroup. Enter it, tap or click&nbsp;"OK" or "Continue", and wait for about 1 minute (depending on the speed of your PC). You should then get the message that your device is a member of the new homegroup.
 Success!</p>
<p>
</p><p>8) Do the same with your other devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9) Finally, check the settings of the shared folders on each device, and make sure that they are&nbsp;shared with the members of the homegroup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This solution worked perfectly for me, and I hope that it helps solving your problem with the homegroup, too! Let me know if it worked for you! Good luck!</p>

                    Hi!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have installed the Skydrive application (so I have a C:\Users\account\Skydrive-folder). I want my screenshots taken with win+print src go to a C:\Users\accound\Skydrive\Screenshots instead of into my \Pictures folder. This way I can take a screenshot
 of, say a map, or whatever and dash out the door and always be able to bring it up on my phone in a sec.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can I change where the win+print screen PNG-files go? Reg key?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Kind regards</div>
<div>Mikael</div>

    <title>Disk Usage at 100&#37; On windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> svajen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disk Usage at 100&#37; On windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Computer completely useless after updating to Windows 8.1 - 100% Disk Usage</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, Windows was bugging me for a long time to update to Windows 8.1 from 8.0. Every single time I selected no to the question because I know it takes a long time to update, and my computer was running just fine, and I don't use the app function which it
 seems to be based on anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One day, it said "your computer has now installed Windows 8.1, your computer will restart in...". Angry at it installing the stuff in the background right in the middle of an important assignment which I wasn't finished with, I restarted the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since opening the start screen after the restart, my computer has been slower than death. Looking in the Task Manager, I see a constant 95-100%. Sometimes it drops down to an acceptable level, but not for more than a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Games like Counter-Strike 1.6, which is over 14 years old, have serious lag and runs slower than it did on my computer I had ten years ago. Opening an internet page takes forever, and switching between programs takes about as long of a time it takes to make
 a cup of coffee and take a few sips.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking in the <strong>Task Manager</strong>, I can't say I see any special program taking up all the drive space. Sometimes it's Spotify, sometimes it's Google Chrome, whatever game I'm playing, my antivirus, "system", etc. Right now it looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aeb57dfb-e200-4d3f-8d36-273d6c883924" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a disaster. I've seen so many people with the same problem, and it astonishes me that it isn't taken care of yet. My computer was running perfect before the Windows 8.1 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Steps I've done so far to try and correct the problem:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increased the computer virtual memory</li><li>Deactivated BITS, Superfetch and Windows Search (plus a few other ones just to test, but everyone of them are now activated again)</li><li>Done the Windows Update troubleshooter, and updated to the latest versions</li><li>Changed Antivirus from Avast to NOD32</li><li>Updated various firmwares from the Samsung program (my computer is Samsung branded)</li><li>Updated my graphics card drivers</li></ul>
<p>I thought about doing a system restore (the one it says it won't impact your personal files), but clicking through the setup, it says "you will have to manually re-install these programs after the restore" and follows with almost
<strong>every program</strong> I have available on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my only option left right now is to install Windows 7, but I'd rather not because it takes forever to backup everything I have on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Does ANYONE have any idea on how to solve this problem? There must be a solution for this.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, and sorry if my tone is a bit angry. It just sucks spending over $900 bucks on a computer that is rendered useless without my consent when I have important work to do on it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

We've tried it in another outlet. We've tried connecting a recharge cable to the console, then to a controller, to manually turn it on (with the controller)&nbsp;nothing.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Is it the power supply for the Xbox?&nbsp;Is the xbox itself shot?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Beverly,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in&nbsp;Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Has the issue started to occur recently? Did you add some software or hardware that possibly produced the issue?</li><li>Is the issue specific to some high quality images?</li></ol>
<p>In order to diagnose the issue, I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to try the steps provided in the following article including the Apps troubleshooter and check if it helps.</p>
<p><em><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Troubleshoot problems with an app</a></strong></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I would suggest you try the restore library option and check if it helps. Please back up all the files in the library before trying this, just to make sure you don’t lose any files. Refer these steps:</span></span></span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a)&nbsp;Open&nbsp;File explorer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b)&nbsp;In the navigation pane, locate <strong>
Libraries</strong> and right click on it</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c)&nbsp;Click “restore default libraries” option.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">d)&nbsp;Check if the issue persists.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to that, I would suggest you to send us a screenshot of the images that have gone black for further research on the issue. Refer to the following article to post a screenshot:</p>
<p><em><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">How to include a screenshot in your post</a></strong></em></p>

</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know the results, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

            <p>I have tried restoring my library, but that didn't work. This only happened recently, where it is all the time, it has been sporadic, but this time they haven't come back. The guy at Curry's put an app on so I could view my video's as media player wouldn't
 work properly. Now I find I cannot view some of my pics either. Here is my attempt at a scree shot.</p>

    <title>Dolby Digital Plus - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian lofthouse  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dolby Digital Plus</h2>
                    <p>After downloading the recent Windows 10 October update I until today have been getting the same message every time I log in "Dolby Digital Plus has been removed from your PC not compatible with this version of Windows 10". I received the same message in
 the "Spring" update which Microsofts help desk removed for me. I looked into all programmes and the Dolby Digital plus was still there so I uninstalled it, this did not solve the message coming up in the action centre every time I booted up. Today I noticed
 my sound was not very good as before the update so I went into "Sound troubleshooting ", after doing some tests it told me to restart my PC, the sound is great now just like before and I have noticed the Dolby Digital plus is back on my laptop again&nbsp; and the
 annoying message in the action center has gone !!&nbsp; Can anyone tell me if Dolby Digital plus is or isn't compatible with the latest version of Windows 10 or maybe the driver itself wanted upgrading !&nbsp; I have a Lenovo laptop and it certainly sounds better with
 Dolby Digital plus !!</p>

<h3> jnygrenmn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changes to the view of a console file</h2>
                    In Disk Defragmenter, the 'File - Options' menu item opens a window with one "Disk Cleanup" tab. On that tab it says: "Changes to the view of a console file are saved in your profile." What is a "console file"? What "Changes to the view" does this refer
 to? Finally, what is 'my profile'? <br />
<br />
Does any of this have anything to do with defragmenting my hard drive?<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I suppose this option is available for all the tabs in Computer management. It seems if you change the layout for console - that will be saved to your profile. It has nothing to do with particular Disk Defrag or Disk cleanup..</p>
