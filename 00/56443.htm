    <title>Hard drives and spare sectors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hula_baloo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hard drives and spare sectors</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I have recently learned from GTS-NJ that the process of spare sector allocation is automated by the disk controller.&nbsp; I know from experience it hasn't always been that way, so I'm curious as to when this feature began.&nbsp; It's probably been a number of years
 and I'm just catching up with it, but would like to narrow it down if possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I would like to pursue to some degree the performance ramifications also.&nbsp; Since this happens totally transparent to the end user, it would seem like you could experience slowly degrading performance without any indication why, since there could be significant
 increased seeking.&nbsp; Are there performance tools that would give you an indication of this?&nbsp; Does the Win 7 defrag move frequently accessed files away from&nbsp;areas containing sectors flagged as bad?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I know of 3rd party utilities that will report the SMART data, but it's not clear to me how to determine how many sectors are actually flagged.&nbsp; On my Toshiba Satellite A215's Fujitsu hard drive, I can run a freeware program called HDD Health that shows
 T.E.C, (Threshhold Exceeded Count), Value, Threshhold, Worst, and Inc.&nbsp; The T.E.C fields are all blank, which I interpret as good, but I'm not sure how to interpret the rest of the fields.&nbsp; The middle fields contain numbers, but I've never seen anything in
 the<em> Inc </em>field.&nbsp; The individual entries contain some indications about relocation, but I don't see anything that tells me specifically how many bad sectors have been flagged.&nbsp; I'm betting there're better utilities out there somewhere, but the Windows
 supplied Performance and Information Tools applet in the Control Panel doesn't seem to give much info on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I see a good number of entries in this forum regarding slow performance and I wonder how many of these might be affected by this condition.&nbsp; Obviously a lot of them are due to malware and startup programs that folks have added, but it would seem that at
 least some of these could be the result of bad sectors.&nbsp; If there's a good tool for indicating this, I think it would beneficial to a number of folks to find out about it and use it.&nbsp; Norton Utilities used to have some pretty good stuff, but with each release
 they seem to've watered it down more and more to the point that I've given up on it.&nbsp; Maybe this is an area of concern&nbsp;mostly to geeks, but then I am a geek, and I'm extremely curious about all this!&nbsp; I hope I've written this in a clear and understandable
 manner so that I can get a lot of feedback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Recommendations?</p>

            <p>&nbsp;OK, that's good.&nbsp; We know when the drive's gone bad and how to determine that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;What I'd really like to know is how to determine the performance degradation caused by the transparent assignment of spare sectors over time.&nbsp; If you could know how many spare sectors have been assigned, then you'd have at least a handle on this.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd also like to know when they smartened the HD controllers up to automatically assign spare sectors.&nbsp; They haven't always been able to do this, and I'd love to know how long I've been in the dark about this feature since it was originally implemented.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 asks default program even after it being set - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 asks default program even after it being set</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I detailed in this screen-recording (https://goo.gl/Jqllnw), even I set Windows 10 default app for open video, music and image, it keeps asking "how do you want to open this file?" (pop-up window) always I run any video, music or image file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I run the files from Windows Explorer, there is no problem. The file will run directly without the annoying pop-up window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the pop-up windows always appears when I run the file through a link from any application (e.g. MS Word).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to open default program always, in any situation, without pop-up "how do you want to open this file"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.s. I already deleted&nbsp;[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Roaming\OpenWith] from the registry, as suggested in this thread:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://www.tenforums.com/software-apps/14819-windows-asks-default-program-even-after-being-set-disable-2.html</p>
<p>I also tried all workarounds suggested here:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://www.infopackets.com/news/9863/how-fix-windows-10-keeps-asking-how-do-you-want-open-file</p>
<p>No success at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for assistance,<br />

<p>
</p><p>Regarding your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Have you made any changes on your computer prior to this issue?"</p>
<p>No.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already tried, without success, the procedure in the article you recommend. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I recorded my screen (access here: https://goo.gl/Jqllnw) showing the default app is set. It works if file is launched from Windows File Manager (Windows Explorer), but when there is a link to the file in Word, Power Point (any other app), always Windows
 ask for the default app, and this is the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate any further direction to try solving the issue.</p>

            <p>This issue could be a result of missing or corrupted data files. We suggest that you use the
<strong>SFC</strong> (<strong>System File Checker</strong>) <strong>tool</strong>. This tool will help you identify and repair issues like this. Follow these steps to run the
<strong>SFC</strong>: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>

</li><li>Type <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the first resolution didn't help, you can try these steps to run the <strong>
System update readiness</strong> command:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>cmd</strong> in the <strong>Search</strong> box from your desktop.<br />
</li><li>On the left pane, right-click <strong>cmd</strong> and select '<strong>Run as Administrator</strong>'.<br />

            <p>I agree that showing only "Recent Folders" is better and less cluttered than the "Recent Items" in Windows 10.&nbsp;I can tell you&nbsp;that
<strong>Recent</strong> <strong>Folders exists in Windows 10</strong>, but&nbsp;it is <strong>
hidden</strong> and needs to be revived. ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Part 1: </span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">How to get Recent Folders displaying in Windows 10 permanently:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1) </strong>Start a Run dialog box by either right-clicking the Start button and choose Run, or by pressing the WinKey + R keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2)</strong> Copy and paste the following line into the Run dialog box, then press Enter:<br />

<p>
</p><p><strong>3)</strong> File Explorer will open and display the "Recent folders". You'll see that it is located below the Recycled Bin on the left hand side of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>4)</strong> Right-click "Recent folders" and select "Pin to Quick Access". You can also select "Pin to Start"&nbsp;if you want. When you close File Explorer "Recent folders" will remove itself from below the Recycled Bin, but&nbsp;will remain under Quick Access.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Important: </strong>The following steps are for advanced users only. It changes key permissions and settings in the registry. I've decided to share this because people are asking for it, and I spent the&nbsp;time to figure it out. Proceed at your own
 risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below&nbsp;are the steps for the&nbsp;second and permanent way to get Recent Folders to work in Save As dialog boxes in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1)</strong> Perform a System Restore point backup of C drive prior to starting</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2)</strong> Complete all the steps in "<em>Part 1: How to get Recent Folders displaying in Windows 10 permanently</em>"&nbsp;above</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3)</strong> Open the Registry (regedit.exe) with Administrator privileges</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>4)</strong> Navigate to the following registry key:</p>
<p>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{22877a6d-37a1-461a-91b0-dbda5aaebc99}\ShellFolder</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>5)</strong> Right-click ShellFolder and select Permissions</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>6)</strong> Click Advanced</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>7)</strong> At the top, click Change</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>8)</strong> Type in ADMINISTRATORS and then click Check Names</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>9)</strong> Click Ok and then Ok</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>10)</strong> Within the "Group or user names:" section, select Administrators so that it is highlighted blue</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>11)</strong> Tick the box corresponding to Allow Full Control</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>12)</strong> Click Ok to close the Permissions box</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>13)</strong> On the right side of the Registry Editor, now double-click "Attributes"</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>14)</strong> Replace the existing Hexadecimal number of 20040000 with 70010020 and then press Ok</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>15)</strong> Now navigate to the following registry key:<br />
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Wow6432Node\CLSID\{22877a6d-37a1-461a-91b0-dbda5aaebc99}\ShellFolder</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>16)</strong> Repeat steps 5 to 14 once again but this time for this&nbsp;particular ShellFolder registry key</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 LG 29UM57 HDMI</h2>
                    I recently purchased an LG 29UM57 ultrawide monitor.&nbsp; I had previously had dual dell monitors hooked up via the&nbsp;VGA until one burnt out.&nbsp; The LG monitor has an HDMI hookup but my computer will not detect it.&nbsp; I have tried restarting the computer with only
 the LG plugged in hoping the computer would detect new hardware.&nbsp; I have downloaded the Device Manager from the LG website/CD with no luck.

            <p>I have the same LG monitor and recently purchased a Surface Book with Windows 10. The monitor is working in extend mode but I cannot change the resolution to 2560X1080p (which would prevent the "stretching" of the display).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already purchased a new mini-display port to HDMI cable that supports up to 4K resolution. I have also tried updating the monitor and display adapter drivers. The system indicates that the drivers are up to date. Any suggestions here?</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t have access&#47;permissions even though I&#39;m my own computer administrator</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I recently formatted my PC [because I forgot to unplug the main HDD first so it changed the bootmgr to Windows XP and also forgot to backup the registry] and I used a nearly full backup from my external HDD but I'm having even more problems which I'll list
 below.<br />
My account's name is Maria respectively and for reference purpose and it's an administrator account and the other&nbsp;is not [the one created first when installing Windows] but I can do more things with this first account, basically anything.<br />
<br />
1. I had 2 accounts but since I didn't made a registry backup those won't appear. Well, I made 2 accounts, one when installing Windows, and other afterwards with the same name but the computer, no matter how many times I try to correct the name, it writes Maria.AI_LIFESTYLE
 [AI_LIFESTYLE is the name I gave to the PC] or Maria(2) but there isn't any other account or folder named Maria.<br />
2. I changed both themes for a Windows 98 wallpaper as well as the sound for the same OS but the thumbnail is the Windows 7 default theme, I had to delete a file in the Windows folder for it to work and it did work but the thumbnail doesn't change at all.<br />
3. I cannot search anything in the search toolbars nor the Start Menu, it displays a message if I click on "see more results" with the following "Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permission to access
 the item.".<br />
4. Every time I try to open a program situated on AppData it denies access to me so I have to force permissions on every single folder.<br />
5. I can't start some programs because of missing registry keys. My teacher told me there was a solution but never gave me one.<br />
6. Is there a way to restore the old accounts permissions without having to force my way into the folders? Because some programs still have the old account permissions "Account Unknown (S-1-5-21....)"<br />
7. I can't most commands when opening CMD on win+r because "I don't have permissions" so I have to go to System32 folder and open it myself.<br />
<br />
I don't know if it's related but I used a Portuguese installation and now I changed everything to English so sometimes things appear in both languages.<br />
<br />
I did the sfc /scannow command but nothing wrong was detected.<br />
<br />
What else can I do besides formatting?

<p>The condition of your machine is rather unclear because we do not know which disk or partition you formatted (<em>"I formatted my PC").&nbsp;</em>The long list of problems could be the result of inappropriate permissions (which could be resolved in one fell swoop
 with an appropriate console command). They could also be caused by a corrupted installation. I consider it unrealistic to solve the problems with an exchange of notes via this forum. Instead I see these options for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Live with the problems</li><li>Re-install Windows and all applications</li><li>Ask a computer-savvy friend to examine the machine</li><li>Get the machine serviced</li><li>Grant a competent respondent whom you can trust remote access to your machine</li></ul>

            While cmd is applying the commands, I'd like to know if there's a way to fix the registry as most programs don't open because the keys are missing.<br />
I know that reinstalling solves the problem (some programs still don't work after that) but my teacher told me something about fixing the registry without reinstalling...Is it possible?<br />
Thanks for the help so far, I really appreciate it.

            I went to the System32 folder and ran it with admin privileges but it gave me a denied access to that command.<br />
1. As I mentioned on the first post, I forgot to backup the registry.<br />
2. The System file does not precede my problem, it's quite recent in fact.<br />

<p>Here is how to open an&nbsp;<strong>elevated</strong> Command Prompt:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9799b393-55d8-4aaf-b98c-290c706ae8ae?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9799b393-55d8-4aaf-b98c-290c706ae8ae?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any System Restore Points that precede the problem? Maybe you don't, if "backing up the registry" means "System Restore". You can invoke System Restore with rstrui.exe.</p>

I formatted my PC so all previous restore points were deleted, but I mentioned that I have a nearly full backup on my external hard drive but my pc doesn't detect it, so I formatted another disk and did the restore to the main disk so that opened programs wouldn't
 conflict.<br />
<br />
Backing up the registry is exporting it all to a folder, there's an option for that and I forgot to do it.</p>

            Problem solved. This exact account was corrupted since day one, so it wasn't a corrupted installation.<br />
I changed the account's name and created other with the name I've always wanted and so far I don't have errors or problems.

<h2>            One of the front USB ports not working</h2>
                    
<p>One of my USB ports on the front does not work. I'll plug in for example a wired controller it will light up and than turn off... And than nothing.. The other one works no problem (since there are two on the front) anyone know whats going on or how I can
 fix it? I'm out of warranty so sending it in would just take too long and cost too much.</p>

<p>Hey there Basic,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear about your USB port.<br />
<br />
It sounds like that port on the front may be faulty.<br />
<br />
You can send it in for repairs using the online service center: https://myservice.xbox.com/Pages/Welcome.aspx<br />
<br />
But if it works for you to use any of the other USB ports on the console, that's also a viable option.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Kristen.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Your Pictures should be housed in C:\Users\Your User Name\Pictures.  The Photos app and any other pictures apps you use are just interfaces to access and edit or manipulate them from their permanent folder location which I would not move.
<br />
<br />But be aware that OneDrive has a new Folder Protection feature that can move the User Pictures (or Desktop and Documents) folder into OneDrive for safe keeping in the cloud:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn-off-folder-protection-onedrive-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn...</a>
<br />
<br />Then there is another feature that might also be set on by default (for inexplicable reasons) that stores the files only in the cloud meant for those with smaller drives:  <a href="https://blogs.office.com/en-us/2017/05/11/introducing-onedrive-files-on-demand-and-additional-features-making-it-easier-to-access-and-share-files/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.office.com/en-us/2017/05/11/intro...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Kristen
<br />
<br />Think of the Photos app as just another way of viewing your Pictures folder - that is all it basically is, with some editing features . . .
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer (folder icon on your Taskbar)
<br />One the left, click Pictures
<br />On the right you will find your Photos
<br />
<br />Please Note: a quicker way of getting Photos form that Photos App
<br />Simply select pictures in that app and drag them out onto your Desktop
<br />That will not move your Photos, it will just create a copy which you can then upload to the web .  .

    <title>Repair Windows 10 after Factory Reset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xenoborg_96  say:</h3>
<h2>            Repair Windows 10 after Factory Reset</h2>
                    <p>I recently decided to perform a reset on my computer (and selected the option to remove all files, but not clean the drives). However, during this process, after displaying as 100% complete, the computer froze on a black screen, so I turned it off and on
 again. Now, when it boots, it takes me to a login screen for "Other User", which is not a user that was formerly created on that computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried multiple methods found in other posts on this site, including attempting to enter command prompt and startup repair with a boot USB plugged in, but am always blocked by a screen that tells me: "You need to sign in as an administrator to continue,
 but there aren't any administrator accounts on this PC."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to get through to the desktop once, when booting into Safe Mode with Networking. However, nothing on the desktop was working, not even the start menu. Common keyboard shortcuts (such as Windows+E) yielded error messages and nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't need to recover the files that were on the PC, I backed up the important ones to an external drive before I reset. If there is a way to perform a fresh install without having to buy the operating system again, that would be my preferred course of
 action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How should I proceed?</p>

            Hi  Xenoborg_96 
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHICH EDITION YOUR SYSTEM CAME WITH, CHOOSE WINDOWS 10 HOME.
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

<br />
<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode with network network function to repair Windows.
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.

    <title>Windows 10 keeps asking for password. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danh_820  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 keeps asking for password.</h2>
                    <p>I have tried everything. netplwiz, control userpasswords2, turned off the settings for requiring password on wake, rebooted, signed in with a local account, even though I want to use a Microsoft Account for Cortana, I can't because I don't want a password
 because I don't need one. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It really should be an option to remove this, I don't even know why it'd be on in the first place. It's so irritating that I've had to disable the lock screen using regedit. I want a legitimate way to fix this, like there should be. I should be able to login
 to my Microsoft Account (offline) without needing a local password. Please, for the love of god take this as a suggestion. Should have been there first. Never had any issues with any version of Windows, except for Windows 10. Wonderful.</p>

<h2>            Folder disappeared from recycle bin, yet not deleted.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was attempting to delete a 2 GB folder from the recycle bin, basically emptying it. Halfway through the process I cancelled the operation, but the folder was not in the recycle bin, nor is it in the source drive.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the folder has not been deleted, but is still lingering on, hidden from view? Or has the folder been deleted somehow?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not care for the files, so if they are deleted, it's fine. I <strong>do</strong> care for my storage space, though it may just be a measly 2 GB.</p>

            Hi Ateeque
<br />
<br />follow these steps:
<br />
<br />     Restart Windows, so if there is a file that is being used, restarting it will no longer be used.
<br />
<br />     Click on the "Start" button of Windows.
<br />   
<br />  Click on the "Run" option.
<br />   
<br />  Type cmd and press the Enter key (or also called Enter). A window with a black background will open (it is called an MSDOS window or also a system window).

            Hi Ateeque,
<br />
<br />Yes, depending on the number of files in the folder . . .
<br />
<br />If the folder was full of small files, some of those would have been deleted, and the rest would have remained if you had cancelled at the start of the delete process . ..

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, that remains to be my gripe with this situation. Since I cancelled at the start, and it's a 2 GB file, approximately 1 GB should've been left behind (that's what the estimated folders left to be deleted were), but it's not.<br />
That's why I theorized that the remnants are indeed on the system and just erased from the registry or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be mentally relieving to believe my PC just went ahead with the command somehow and erased the files, but I guess there can be no confirmation.</p>

<p>Hi Maritza,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have restarted windows, and upon opening command prompt, it started in 2 different locations, first in System32 and second in my User folder (I am the admin).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In both locations, inputting "<span>attrib -s -h -r c: \ recycler" gave "Parameter format not correct -"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I still went ahead and input "</span><span>rd / s / q c: \ recycler" giving a very very long list of files all followed by "<em>Access is denied"</em>,
<em>"The process cannot access the file because it is being use by another process"</em>,
<em>"The directory is not empty"</em> and so on. <em>"Access is denied"</em> was predominant.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In System32 and my User folder different files were accessed, but the same issue resulted. I did not wait till the end of the infinite number of files because I felt cmd would just return more errors.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>May I ask what the purpose of those commands were?</span></p>

    <title>restart in safe mode freezes at loadiing crcdisk.sys - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alyson1  say:</h3>
<h2>            restart in safe mode freezes at loadiing crcdisk.sys</h2>
                    Can you help me fix this problem? On Friday, my computer (A Gateway GT 5428 desktop) froze while I was using Explorer&nbsp;8. I am running Vista Home Premium 32-bit and have Service Pack 1 installed.&nbsp; When I restarted and rebooted in safe mode, the process
 got stuck loading cd\system32\drivers\crcsisk.sys. I turned my computer off and restarted the system again. It went to a black screen with the Microsoft logo, then went to another black screen that told me it was checking the file system and that "one of your
 disks needs to be checked for consistency." After checking, the computer booted properly and Vista and all my programs seem to&nbsp;be running normally.<br />
<br />
The same thing happened again on Saturday. I am worried that the next time I restart, it may not boot at all! I have backed up my files and will not shut down the system (just put it to sleep) until I find a solution. My computer freezes and needs to be&nbsp;restarted
 almost every day&nbsp;when&nbsp;I turn it on for the&nbsp;first time,&nbsp;so this seems a very likely possibility.<br />
<br />
What can I do to fix this problem while I still can use my system?&nbsp; I've seen various solutions offered on forums including doing a system restore or deleting or renaming certain drivers (such as pcmia) that could be causing the problem.&nbsp; I am not a developer,
 however, just a regular home user so I don't know how to do any of these things or know which will work.&nbsp; I need step-by-step instructions that I can follow!
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Alyson<br />

<p><span><span>Hi alyson1,<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Answers Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>Crcdisk.sys error is always preceded by some problems in Harddrive loading. A .sys file is associated with a driver.</span></p>
<p><span>The first thing you should do is update the computers Hardware. Check with the manufacturer for the latest updates available and update them. You need to contact
 the computer manufacturer to update the drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>The link below tells you how to update drivers</span></p>
<p><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/b3c6477e-1111-4b9f-a52a-fffdc51e9c901033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/b3c6477e-1111-4b9f-a52a-fffdc51e9c901033.mspx</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>You can try running an sfc scan, The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions</span></p>
<p><span>To do this, follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p><span>Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator.
 If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.
</span></p>
<p><span>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
</span></p>
<p><span>sfc /scannow</span></p>
<p><span>You can also try doing a system restore to a point when the computer was working fine.</span></p>
<p><span>To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click Start, type system restore in the Start Search box, and then click System Restore in the Programs list.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span>In the System Restore dialog box, click Choose a different restore point, and then click Next.</span></p>
<p><span>In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click Next.</span></p>
<p><span>Click Finish.</span></p>
<p><span>The computer restarts, and the system files and settings are returned to the state that they were in at the time that the restore point was created.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you still have issues even after this, I would suggest backing up all data and run download a good drive utility from the drive manufacturer and test the
 hard drive. I think the hard drive is failing. </span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Let us know if you need further assistance.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 7 gives me &#34;Not Responding&#34; message a lot&#33;</h2>
                    Since going from Vista x64 to Windows 7 x64 RC1 (on my fast PC), I find that I get the "(Not Responding)" message a lot when there's disk I/O going on.&nbsp; I have four drives installed but am only really using the 3 fast ones.&nbsp; The Resource Monitor shows
 the reported application e.g. firefox in red and with status of "not responding".&nbsp; The problem is that the application is running but takes forever to complete it's task.<br />
<br />
I get this Not Responding frequently with IE 8 (which is my primary browser), Firefox, Excel, Outlook, Explorer, etc. etc.&nbsp; I have spent a lot of time monitoring apps in Task Manager and Resource Manager -- can't see anything weird there.&nbsp; I have shut down
 antivirus programs, turned off ReadyBoost, made BIOS changes...&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing seems to help.

            Hi all,<br />
<br />
my contribution following this thread is the following:<br />
<br />
you all seem to have a SATA configuration sometimes on multiboot systems and the Windows 7 RC 64 bit editions.<br />
<br />
There is lots of talking going on about these issues, performance as well as boot up/shut down on the Technet Forums relating to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
I suggest you all join that forum to have a better view on what's going on with Sata and 64 bit.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I don't have a bookmark to it, but just visit Technet, Forums, Windows 7 and browse over there, there seems to be some solutions already there......<br />
It's a little more advanced in user experience but please join that central point.<br />
<br />
Ciao,<br />
Sabine

<p>The "upgrade" maybe your problem. 7127 is an internal build and isn't released to the public which says to me that you got it from a torrent and as such I'm afraid that I am unable to help you. I sugguest preforming a clean install of the official RC.</p>

<h2>            Windows Virus and Thread Protection Update Notifications</h2>
                    <p>I have searched support and I am unable to solve my issue with any method previously posted.&nbsp; I receive multiple threat protection update definition notifications per day.&nbsp; I have tried turning off the notifications using group policies, and that did not
 work with the current Windows 10 build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an administrator on both this client and the entire company network, however Windows Security&gt;Virus and threat protection settings&gt;Change notification settings&gt;Manage notifications&gt;Get informational updates, the slider is greyed out.&nbsp; I'm not sure that
 this slider is the one that would stop the notifications anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are incredibly annoying.&nbsp; Can anyone help???</p>

            Hi Marc
<br />
<br />You seem to have turned those off in the correct settings locations . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to System - Notifications and Actions
<br />
<br />Do you find an option there to turn off those Notifications?       
        </p>

            Doesn't look like it.&nbsp; I see a couple of non-specific 'senders' in there labeled 'Security and Settings', (2) named only 'Settings', and one named 'Suggested'.

<h3> omi azad  say:</h3>
<h2>            DirectX End-User Runtimes &#40;June 2010&#41; on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>We all know that DirectX End-User Runtime from June 2010 is old. I think still there are some games who are widely depended on DLLs from that DirectX release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows has evolved a lot since that time and Microsoft has improved many things including DirectX itself. Unfortunately there are some games who installs that old DirectX without taking any permission from the users while installing the main game engine
 on Windows 10 platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my concern is, though the required DLLs are coming from the installation of DirectX June '10, will this replace the latest and improved files during the installation process? Will there be any other problem with this installation process?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the installer replaces the original Windows files with it's old version, what is the way to revert back?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 extremely slow to start up</h2>
                    <p>I had a problem with my PC (Asus Z97-K motherboard) taking 20 minutes or more to start up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A friend suggested I disabled the Fast Boot in the BIOS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did this as well as the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start - Settings - System - Power &amp; Sleep - Related settings (Additional power settings) - Choose what the power button does - Change settings that are currently unavailable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clear the&nbsp;<strong>Turn on fast Start-up (recommended)</strong>&nbsp;box</p>
<p>
</p><p>Save changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One or the other or maybe both of the above has so far worked for my PC - so far!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks to expertreviews - How to fix the Windows 10 slow boot bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps someone :-)</p>

<h2>            Mouse without Borders stopped working after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    Windows 10 did update, then MWB would not connect as before.&nbsp; I restored using Restore Point, and problem was fixed.&nbsp; After next Update, returned and have not been able to get it to work since (lost Restore Point due to memory not being set high enough.)&nbsp;
 Have tried deleteing and reinstalling MWB.&nbsp; Has there been a fix for this yet?

<p>Hi Anne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several factors that might have caused this issue, one possible cause is the proper setting up. To isolate the issue, we would like to ask a few questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you able to connect your Canon MB2720 wirelessly with other devices? </li><li>Have you tried to contact the printer manufacturer to assist you setting up the device so you can connect it through wireless connection? If not, we suggest that you contact the printer manufacturer to ask assistance on how to set up the printer so it will
 be available wirelessly.</li></ul>

<p>
</p><p>Okay, time for me to add my two cents also.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have 4 PC's with Windows 10 installed. 3 out of 4 were running Windows 8.1 then upgraded to windows 10. The fourth PC, I did a clean install about 9 months ago of windows 10 with no problems. The no sound problems did not happen until the latest feature
 update, 1803. Now I am doing a clean install of windows 10 on a rebuild. But now I have no sound on this earlier release of windows 10.</p>
<p>Under sound properties in device manager, all the sound devices, Realtek HD and speakers, on the events tab there is a message that the drivers were not migrated. So, I am believing that is the main issue. Windows 10 won't install the sound drivers and migrate
 the files into the system.</p>
<p>I have tried to go to compatibility mode and setting the compatibility to both windows 8 and 7, but that is still not correcting the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, this is a Microsoft drivers issue with windows 10.</p>
<p>Also the microphone has the same issue. However, with all of this, I am seeing volume spikes. Just no sound being produced.</p>

<p>I had the same problem with 1803 update. Running a Gateway&nbsp;<span>SX 2851 desktop. Everything was running OK prior to the update.&nbsp;</span><span>I have had so many major issues with Win 10 updates
 I recommend avoiding Win 10 at all costs. I am keeping this computer on Win 10 for bench marking purposes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This time the update appeared to run OK and my computer booted up with no problem after the update. However there was no sound at all. This was the case for IE, Chrome, Media Player, and every other app that is supposed
 to produce sound.&nbsp;</span><span>I had no error messages. The device manager showed everything in the sound components area was working correctly. All troubleshooting attempts found no issues.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I rolled the computer back to an earlier date before the update and the sound came back to working properly. We'll just wait to see what happens when the update runs again,. I know from horrible experience</span><span>&nbsp;that
 there&nbsp; is no way to prevent it.</span></p>

<p>This morning I got the forced update popup on my desktop again. At least I was able to power down on my own terms today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update ran to 75% and I got a black screen with no hard drive activity for over 1 hour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I know this is going to sound weird but due to other issues I had with the 1709 update I manually powered off the computer and then I opened it up and pulled out my Wi-Fi card. There appears to be a major issue with Win 10 and Anatel Wi-Fi cards. With
 the Wi-Fi card removed button everything back up and power it up again. In my case the computer resumed the update and reached 100%. It then booted up to the sign in screen. Upon signing in all was working including the sound this time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most people who have had issues with the Win 10 updates and Anatel Wi-Fi cards are replacing them with newer Wi-Fi cards not made by Anatel. One thing to note if you use device manager to look at your Wi-Fi card info and drivers, it might report some other
 Wi-Fi card name. Most people with this issue have reported that when they physically remove the card it is indeed an Anatel Wi-Fi card. Every single person has reported that removing the Anatel Wi-Fi card from the computer fixed whatever Update problems they
 were having. This has been an issue since Win 10 1703, but the solution was not posted until January 2018. A poster named&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/def2dc8d-10a7-41d3-a2a8-a4d186e38c04" title="Bobroth1951">Bobroth1951</a><span>&nbsp;posted
 to one of my other threads (answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/win-10-1709-update-freezes-at-82-complete/3fd40e52-7171-41d5-bab8-de4a5837c3e7) that he had found the solution through other posts about the issue with Anatel Wi-Fi cards.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I do not know that this is the issue you are facing but it worked for me.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Oh and just so you know I put the Anatel Wi-Fi card back in my computer after the update had run successfully and it still works. I will probably replace it since it has
 a manufacture date of 2011-01-05. Just know that if this works and you decide to use the Anatel Wi-Fi card you will have update issues that can not be prevented thanks to the fine folks at Microsoft.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I strongly recommend not relying on a Win 10 OS computer for any critical application at this time.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Task Manager &#40;and perfmon&#41; report &#126;50&#37; CPU but - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gravidar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Task Manager &#40;and perfmon&#41; report &#126;50&#37; CPU but processes list says System Idle Process 96&#37;</h2>
                    
<p>For the last week or so I've noticed (but it may have been happening longer) CPU utilisation being reported as approx 50% on both CPUs, continuously with no open applications. It's not a flat line, it bounces between 40% and 50%. However, the Processes list
 (with show all users) reports the System Idle Process as 95-99% so I can't find what's causing it.</p>
<p>Have also tried using performance monitor with the same results.</p>
<p>Q. Under what circumstances can this&nbsp;discrepancy&nbsp;be caused? Driver issue? Virus?</p>
<p>I run a virus scanner (AVG) and am all up to date with Windows updates and haven't made any significant changes to the system recently so at a loss to explain it. If it was simply being misreported then I could perhaps live with it but when running some
 applications I get the "Your computer is running slow" dialogue appear.</p>
<p>I've shut down just about every service and process I can, although if it were one of these then I guess Task Manager would be reporting the CPU usage against it anyway.</p>
<p>The system is due for a re-install but I'd like to understand what is causing this so I don't get a repeat.</p>
<p>Any insights&nbsp;gratefully&nbsp;received.</p>
<p>Richard</p>
<p>System:</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows 7 Professional x64 </li><li>Intel E8400 @ 3.0GHz </li><li>4GB DDR2 (2x2GB) </li><li>Asus P5Q Pro Turbo </li><li>ATI HD3870x2 + HD4550 </li><li>Onboard RAID setup + STLab A-410 RAID adapter (SteelVine) installed but no devices connected</li></ul>

<p>Hi André</p>
<p>Thanks for the offer of assistance, after a late night of diagnostics it turned out to be the DVD drive. I reconnected it last week and it&nbsp;seems the port I plugged it into does not support ATAPI devices and although&nbsp;the drive&nbsp;was working, the firmware/driver
 obviously didn't completely approve.</p>
<p>So that explains how the CPU can be used at 50%&nbsp;and not show in Task Manager.</p>
<p>Meghmala, thank you for the copy/paste answer but it was not appropriate to my issue.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Richard</p>
