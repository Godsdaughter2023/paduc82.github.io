<h2>            Product key is invalid for activation</h2>
                    I completely restored my computer&nbsp;recently&nbsp;and needs to be reactivated .&nbsp;When I try to activate it, the message "The Windows&nbsp;Vista Home Premium product key is invalid for activation. After reading many passages about this, I concluded I would have to buy
 a new product key. Is there a way to get my computer activated without paying anything? If not, where can I buy a new product key? Thank you.

    <title>When is Windows 10 going to stop being offered as a free upgrade&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> polorboy01  say:</h3>
<h2>            When is Windows 10 going to stop being offered as a free upgrade&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So, when will I stop being harassed by Microsoft to try and force me to upgrade to Windows 10?&nbsp; Honestly, I have no plans of ever upgrading to Windows 10, especially since I don't trust it.&nbsp; From what I hear it crashes a lot, people get some pretty weird
 and bad errors that essentially ruin their pc's.&nbsp; Also, the whole "this is free... really... you can trust us... because we 'always' have free stuff... we're not stealing your private information and selling it to the highest bidder.... we promise", I don't
 believe for one minute.&nbsp; I was pretty pissed about DX12 being a Windows 10 only stunt (which apart from a ploy by Microsoft as yet another tool to force people to upgrade to Windows 10 and has no foundation in being for "technical reasons", because the version
 of your Operating System has very very very little impact on the ability of your graphics card to work), but now that we have Vulkan that is no longer an issue.&nbsp; Especially since Vulkan has already been installed and supported on both Nvidia and AMD graphics
 cards for all operating systems (as in All versions of Windows, All versions of Linux, and All versions of Apple - which is really just Linux anyway) not just Windows 10.&nbsp; Oh, and in tests Vulkan out performs DX12.&nbsp; I disabled automatic updates a long time
 ago and now I go through each and every one, and verify that it does not in any way shape or form add the functionality to upgrade my computer to Windows 10.&nbsp; Today I noticed that Microsoft has yet slipped in another 3 updates to try to get Windows 10 on my
 computer.&nbsp; Is this going to be something I will have to continue to do until Windows 7 is no longer supported?&nbsp; Windows 7 is a great Operating system, I really like Windows 7, I like having a "normal" desktop where it is easy to find applications.&nbsp; I use Windows
 server 2012 at work and I honestly hate it with every fiber of my being.&nbsp; It is a backward OS, having that tile GUI on a server makes no sense whatsoever.&nbsp; All I ask is for Microsoft to stop harassing people who don't want to upgrade or install Windows 10.&nbsp;
 I have said this several times here on these forums (like anyone from Microsoft who has the authority to do anything and actually reads these is probably a different story - as in that doesn't happen).&nbsp; Still, Microsoft is trying to get everyone on to Windows
 10.&nbsp; Don't they realize that they are pushing away some of their best customers?&nbsp; For example, the company I work for is rather large international corporation.&nbsp; For a day or two we had the option to actually get the upgrade to Windows 10 on our workstations.&nbsp;
 That was very quickly removed and anyone who actually managed to install it had their workstations very quickly re-imaged back to Windows 7.&nbsp; Windows 10 has never been offered to anyone within the company I work for since, they are actively blocking it from
 being installed on any of their systems.&nbsp; I don't blame them, they don't trust it either.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft does not force to install or upgrade to windows 10. The pop-ups you get that's because Microsoft has released Windows Update to Upgrade to windows 10 and that is also not in important updates.</p>
<p>Windows 10 update is in optional updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can understand how frustrating this would be when you don't want to install windows 10 and still getting updates.</p>
<p>For that <span><span>I would suggest you to uninstall these below updates and check if that helps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>For Windows 7 SP1:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>KB3035583</span></p>
<p><span>KB2952664</span></p>
<p><span><strong>For Windows 8.1 Update:</strong></span></p>

    <title>Unable to boot&#59; Windows stuck at loading files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xenomic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to boot&#59; Windows stuck at loading files</h2>
                    <p>So here is a new issue that's popped up outside of the RAM issue that I know that I have (I wouldn't think this is the cause of this though). This is the second time I've had this happen to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So while booting up the computer today, I go take care of my usual business, come back, and I noticed that the screen is frozen despite me being able to move my mouse. I remember this from the first time this happened, and tried to open Task Manager (Cntrl
 + Alt + Delete). However, the screen goes black and refuses to move at all, so I reboot the computer, and it tries to load the Windows files. Says it cannot (I think there was something about I/O error or another on this screen, and it was talking about possibly
 faulty hardware or something, like external USB or CD-Rom). However, I turned the computer completely off, turn it back on, and it loads just fine. During this time, I noticed that my CD-Rom's light was green, but when I turned it off and turned it back on,
 the light never came on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am wondering what the possible causes for this is? Is it the CD-Rom drive that's somehow causing this error? Is it something else completely (because I honestly don't think that the CD-Rom should even be causing this error, and I did unplug my external
 HD once before during this and it still gave the error, so thankfully it's not that...)? What could be causing the windows files to not load properly? Again, this is the second time this has happened (the first being 1-2 months ago).</p>

            <p>I have not tried those steps. However, I decided to look at the EventViewer, since this is the 3rd day in a row that I had to restart my computer after the initial bootup (it's loading the WIndows files now, but it freezes up after a couple minutes of booting
 up. Even trying to bring up Task Manager won't work, and nothing responds). In the Event Viewer, it states this:<br />
<br />
"The driver detected a controller error on \Device\Ide\IdePort1"</p>
<p>
</p><p>And not just once, but many, MANY times. And around the same times too, only seconds apart. I believe for today alone there was about 50-100 of this error. What does this mean?</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT - Upon looking for this, I tried to find the port this is, but I don't see which one it could be??</p>

</p><p>What I am going to try tomorrow, hopefully not screwing up, is to take out one of the RAM sticks (I have 3 2GB RAM sticks, so taking one out shouldn't be too bad). Or, just take out 2 of them and run Memtest on that one single one. Dunno how long that will
 take though...</p>

            <p>Welp! So today's booting up session was...weird. Past couple days, no problems at all. Today? First thing, Windows couldn't load files, then second time rebooting, it tried to boot up my Vista HDD instead for some reason (but froze), third time it tried
 to boot up my primary HDD, but froze on the Starting screen (with the logo), then after about half a minute, it went to a blue screen that had like 4 lines, and said something about Fatal System Error that made it shut down, and now 4th try I'm on. I don't
 like how this is going at all...that's the HDD failing right there...right??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tomorrow I'm going to run the default Memory Diagnostics to see if that finds any errors in either of the RAMs. Since Chkdsk found nothing wrong with the HDD, it might just be the RAM itself being the problem. If it's neither of the RAM sticks, then...I
 don't know what the problem would be then.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 freezes following network connectivity loss - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dds2014  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 freezes following network connectivity loss</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 clean install will freeze up on me periodically, necessitating a cold reset. &nbsp;It started off once or twice a day, but then seemed to become more and more frequent until the point it would happen within 60 seconds of signing on and using
 a browser (any browser). &nbsp;Every single time, the network connection drops about 10 seconds before it freezes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As noted on previous feeds, resetting the IPstack (using the "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">netsh winsock reset" in CP-admin and then restarting) seems to fix the issue, and sometimes it will go for days
 without freezing. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the problem has returned. &nbsp;It may take several days and several restart cycles but the freezing always comes back. &nbsp;I'm at about my 10th time resetting the IPstack with varied success (ranging form several hours to several
 days without freezing).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Any chance anyone has come across a solution or at least a way I can possibly diagnose what the issue is and how to retain the changes? &nbsp;Should I just
 program a task to&nbsp;prophylactically&nbsp;reset the IPstack prior to&nbsp;each restart?</span></span></span></p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <span><span>Hi,</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>Apologize for the difficulties that you're experiencing in Windows 10.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please be assured that we will do our best to help you.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Initially, I suggest you to start your computer in safe mode with Networking and check if the issue appears there as well. If it does not appear in safe mode with Networking place
 the computer in clean boot state to identify the culprit program running in the background creating this error.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Safe Mode with Networking</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer:
<strong>Start your PC in safe mode in Windows&nbsp;10</strong></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not exist in safe mode, try to perform a clean boot and check.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2:
</strong><strong>Clean Boot</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the article How to perform a clean boot in Windows in the below link and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>(Applies to Windows 10 as well).</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>NOTE</strong>: Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section
<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 3</strong>: Let us run
<strong>SFC scan </strong>and see if it&nbsp;brings any difference.</span></span></p>
<p><span>The
<strong>sfc /scannow (System File Checker) </strong>command scans all protected system files, and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Press
<strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>X </strong>keys. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click on
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong> to bring up an elevated command prompt. </span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note</strong><span>: Click
<strong>Yes</strong> if it prompts for permission.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. In the
<strong>command prompt</strong> type in the following command and then press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sfc /scannow</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope it helps.</span></span></p>

            <p>Alright - successfully replaced with corrupt system file with a fresh one, but unfortunately it seems unrelated as I'm continuing to have issues. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some progress though - I've been able to narrow it down to a single driver:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Broadcom 802.11n Network Adapter -&gt; when the wifi/bluetooth are switched off or this driver is disabled the problem never comes up, even if I connect to the internet via a different means (i.e. ethernet). &nbsp;It's only when re-enable this driver and turn WIFI/Bluetooth
 back on that the problem quickly returns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was running version 6.30.223.256 which windows update says was the most up-to-date version. &nbsp;I manually replaced it with an older version 6.30.223.234 with the same issue, so I don't think it's a particular driver version issue. &nbsp;Perhaps it's a hardware
 problem, but why would this suddenly star causing an issue as soon as I updated to Windows 10? &nbsp;It was not causing any issues at all in Windows 7 Pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your held in diagnosing this issue</p>
<p>

            <p><span>I may have resolved my issue -&gt;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I finally narrowed it down to my Broadcom network adapter - disabling it (or turning wifi off) completely solved the issue, even when connected to the internet via Ethernet. &nbsp;Bluetooth is fine as well, it's only wifi that's the issue.
 &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;It's only when I enable this driver and turn WIFI back on that the problem quickly returns.&nbsp;</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>I was running version 6.30.223.256 which windows update says was the most up-to-date version. &nbsp;I reverted back to an older version 6.30.223.234 with the same issue, so it's not a particular driver version issue. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I ran a full hardware check on all components and there were no issues, so it's not the adapter itself</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>FINALLY, I reinstalled my BIOS directly from Dell and so far it hasn't frozen again going on 3 hours!! &nbsp; That is the longest in a while, so here's hoping this time it sticks!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope that helps - or if anyone else has some insight from their personal experiences please share!</span></p>

<h2>            I messed up on install, how best to fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 from windows 7 with no problem. My system files on ssd with Data on separate hard drive.&nbsp; I had used "shell folders move" to do this a couple of years ago.&nbsp; All works well except...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had been using a local account with no password for daily use.&nbsp; When I logged on to Windows 10, I created a Microsoft account using my hotmail address.&nbsp; Now my account points all my data to the right place, but it is all read-only as it was created under
 the old account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I see it I can either:</p>
<p>1. use the shell folders move again to point the system to the correct folders (would that even work?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. revert back to Windows 7 and start over ( but will the libraries still be locked)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. do a full re-install of&nbsp; windows 10 (figure out which data files go where under the new system) I really don't want to do this unless it is the only way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated, thanks</p>

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />What have you done so far to troubleshoot the problem?
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed: 1507, 1511, 1607, 1703?
<br />Which version of Windows did you upgrade from?
<br />
<br />Sometimes your computers firmware, which deals with things like power management, which is related to sleep needs to be updated. Remember, the issue you are experiencing here is outside of Windows, where its not resuming from sleep. Windows is in a saved state on the hard disk and can't manage the hardware resources, thats left up to Firmware (your BIOS) to handle. So, its obvious this more a hardware issue than software, but updated driver software can fix it. 
<br />
<br />It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network adapters. 
<br />If that does not work, I recommend you try two things 
<br />First: Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />When complete, restart then check if you can sleep and wake. 
<br />
<br />Second option 
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not work, well, we need to try something else. Try resetting the BIOS:

<br />
<br />You might also want to consider rolling back:
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1709, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Fall Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started.

            I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Since what governs sleep the most is the Display adapter, and there are known issues with Display adapter in Fall Creators Version, let's troubleshoot it first:
<br />
<br />Check for a newer Display driver on the PC or Display adapter Support Downloads webpage.  While there check if there are other newer drivers to Update.  You can take your time until they are all updated.  
<br />
<br />There is a known issue of incorrect Display driver being pushed by Windows Update which requires rolling back the driver.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose Display device, then Driver tab, then Roll back.  
<br />
<br />If there is no Roll Back or that doesn't help choose Update Driver on Display device Driver tab, then Browse Computer, then Let Me Pick to see a list of all previously installed Display drivers, work backwards trying each to find one that works.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can also go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update to look for the driver under Installed Updates and Uninstall it form link there.   Then you can hide the driver so it isn't pushed again using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of those work try to System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>.  Make sure System Restore is always enabled for C with plenty of disk space apportioned (5-10%) in its Configuration settings.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Thanks for you help.&nbsp; I have not solved the problem yet. Are there any problems with just turning off Sleep mode other that power consumption?<br />

            I was waiting for you to answer my questions so we could continue troubleshooting. There's no reason to give up yet.  Are your BIOS, chipset, display, sound, network and all other drivers up to date?  
<br />
<br />How about trying Hibernate?  You can enable it's button in the Start menu in Power Options&gt;Choose What Power Buttons Do&gt;Change Buttons Currently Unavailable&gt;enable Hibernate.  
<br />
<br />Then if it works from Power button in Start menu, you can set Sleep timeouts for Sleep at Never and Hibernate at 60-120 or whatever you want.

            Thanks for hanging in there with me.&nbsp; I have reloaded BIOS AO4.&nbsp; There is no update at the Dell Support site.&nbsp; Can't find a Chipset driver update for the Dell Studio XPS 9100 PC.&nbsp; Sound Blaster X-Fi Titanium driver updated from vender.&nbsp; AMD Radeon HD 5800
 updated from vender.&nbsp; Realtec PCle GBE network driver updated.&nbsp; PC still shuts off when awakened from sleep.&nbsp; I have changed Sleep to Hibernate as you have suggested and it works as expected so I can live with that.

<br />You can also work through these steps to troubleshoot Sleep which have worked for me when nothing else does:  <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-sleep-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-sle...</a>

            You need a Media Player to open an MP4 file, not WIndows Explorer.  
<br />
<br />Make sure the file is properly downloaded, then right click to Open With: your media Player (WMP, Groove, VLC, etc).  If asked tell it to always open that file type with that player.  If not then go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default Apps and Choose by File Type.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Windows couldn&#39;t create a new partition or locate an existing one</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys, need ASAP help as a client needs their computer back tomorrow and I'm having a **** of a time with this one. When clean installing Windows 10, I get the error message "Windows couldn't create a new partition or locate an existing one".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So using CMD I have tried-<br />

<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Start DISKPART.<br />
LIST DISK and identify your SSD disk number (from 0 to n disks).<br />

CREATE PARTITION PRIMARY<br />

<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have also tried removing all SD cards and extra USB's but again with no luck.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you want the long story, my clients Hard Drive was making a terrible scratching noise so I done a check disk which obviously failed, so I bought a SSD to replace it and tried to clone the disk using Acronis
 2016 but the clone was failing. So I thought it would be a good idea to clean install Windows 10 onto the new SSD and then manually copy data across but I'm getting stuck at the installation!!!!!!!</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Is this the best way to get around this issue? Any ideas on what I can do? Any help would be much appreciated!&nbsp;</p>

            <div>I've read others saying that some makes of SSD fail in Windows 10, no idea why. When you try to install Windows 10 I assume you go to custom and remove existing partitions (if there are any) then carry on with the install. Is that the point it fails or
 is it before that.</div>
<p>[edit]</p>
<p>Does the SSD need its own driver which you can supply during the custom install step.?</p>

            <p>It was a Kingston SSD I bought and it didn't come with any disks so I doubt it would need any extra drivers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the clone failed, the SSD did have some data on it. I then tried the custom install and removed all extra partitions, after that I got the error message (when I went to click next). I tried the commands shown above and also tried a secure erase using
 Acronis.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You are not giving us much to go on in reference to the system configuration.&nbsp; How old is the system, is the SSD the only drive on the system, is it UEFI or MBR?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you do an install you don't need to preformat the drive.&nbsp; You can pick the amount of Unallocated space you want to use then install in that space. But removing all partitions during the install is suggested.&nbsp; If there is another drive on the system,
 it might also be involved, so during an install I like to disconnect all other drives.</p>

<p>The SSD is the only drive in the system</p>
<p>Formatted the drive because that's what I saw looking at other forums</p>
<p>I tried removing all partitions and also tried to wipe the system</p>
<p>Only drives are the SSD and the USB I'm using to load Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just guessing here, but by chance could I have downloaded a 32-bit OS accidentally? Could I find that out somehow? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3> rainer meier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remote Desktop Connection &#40;mstsc.exe&#41; password paste</h2>
                    I have noticed a strange behavior when using the Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection client (mstsc.exe).<br />
<br />
I used to save a remote connection as an .rdp file and then connect to it by clicking the shortcut and entering/pasting the password. Usually I have the password stored in some app or plain text file opened in Notepad. Recently I tried to paste the password
 into RDP client by right-clicking into the password field and selecting the "paste" option. Surprisingly the authentication failed.<br />
Pasting the same password by pressing CTRL+V works like a charm.<br />
<br />
Can anybody explain why this happens? Is it a bug?<br />

                    Hiya
<div>I've been trying to install a printer that was working fine on a Windows XP box. Now it won't do anything connected to my Win 8 box. The drivers won't install, not even when i run it in compatibility mode for Win XP. &nbsp;We have also been trying to get it
 to work on a Win 7 box, with that one it will spit out pages of jibberish instead of printing a photo.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It is an expensive printer. We don't know what to do.&nbsp;</div>

            We downloaded the most recent drivers Ricoh had for Windows 7 and tried to install them. Because it connects to the Win 7 machine by usb, windows put a driver for that. I couldn't find a way to use a compatibility mode on the Win 7 machine. We tried a
 universal driver, and a PCL 6 and a PostScript driver for the model. Nothing worked.

<h2>            Games minimise every hour, please help me find out why.</h2>
                    <p>As I say in the title games minimize at the same minutes past the hour every hour starting from the time I boot my pc (not from starting the game) It's clear to me that I have probably inadvertently triggered this myself but I don't know how and I should
 add that this may happen to other apps (though I haven't witnessed it) it's just that I mainly play games.</p>
<p>I am using Windows 10 home edition.</p>
<p>16 GB Ram</p>
<p>R9 380X GPU</p>
<p>Soundblaster Audigy</p>
<p>Corsair 850 m PSU</p>
<p>Firefox Browser</p>
<p>Not sure what you need to know so any info will be provided on request. I've tried running event viewer in the background and going straight to it when it happens but I'm afraid it doesn't really tell me anything mainly because I am not sure what to look
 for.</p>
<p>It's getting really annoying now (three weeks and counting) I've uninstalled everything new since it started so I'm stumped.</p>
<p>Any help appreciated.</p>

            <p><span>[EDIT: Oops - I clicked on the wrong post. Was meant to be addressed to kay... ]</span></p>
<p><span>It may be a software is attempting to update and stealing focus from your games. A lot of (most ? )</span></p>
<p><span>modern software have an automated update feature in their Options/Settings. This is often (too often ?)</span></p>
<p><span>the default setting.</span></p>
<p><span>- Have a look at <em>Task Manager</em> &gt; <em>Startup</em> to see if any software update features are loading in the background when</span><span> you boot into Windows. If there are any (except your Anti-virus ) disable them.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>- Not all software will launch their update feature with Windows though, so you may need to trawl through</span></p>
<p><span>your programs that are not shown in Startup and investigate if they have an automated update feature.</span></p>
<p><span>- Some (all ?)&nbsp; Anti-virus have a 'gaming mode' which will prevent them from updating while gaming.</span></p>
<p><span>This is probably more necessary if you have the program update set to automatic than the Virus definitions
</span></p>
<p><span>update, which should always be on automatic .</span></p>
<p><span>( I don't use Avast's Silent/Gaming mode, but I manually update</span><span> the program) .</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>- I don't know if they still cause problems, but the big&nbsp; Suites from AV publishers such as Norton&nbsp; used
</span></p>
<p><span>to be notorious for running scans for this</span><span> and that all the time, which tended to slow the system or
</span></p>
<p><span>steal focus as well. </span></p>
<br />
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><em>"Turn Windows Features on and off, “deselect” Windows Gadget Platform."</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Gadget Platform is not part of the default Win10 install, so if you don't find it, that would be why.</p>
<p>From what I've read, MS discontinued this feature for security reasons (with maybe a bit of performance</p>
<p>issues due to poorly written Gadgets as an unadvertised additional reason ? ) with Win8.</p>
<p>The Gadget Platform can be installed on Win10, but there is a tendency for it to break after the major updates, requiring reinstallation.</p>

            <p>@BossDweeb</p>
<p>Hi, thanks for the reply. I kind of figured it was something either updating like the av (avg free) or scanning for changes like google drive or file manager and I've gone through everything turning off and on but no joy. I hoped someone would know how to
 make sense of event viewer to find out exactly the time it happened and find out what else was happening at that exact time. I've tried looking but I don't have the knowledge required to make sense of it. I'm going to look into this "Gadget Platform" this
 weekend, a bit pushed for time right now but thanks for your detailed reply. It is appreciated.
</p>
<p>@Wilfred Mac</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply, no, no recent changes though I had made changes since this started (installed "Fences") but I have since uninstalled it and neither installation nor uninstallation caused any change. Yes it does it to all games (Steam, Origin, GOG,
 UPlay and DRM free)</p>
<p>As I said to BossDweeb I will look into the "gadget platform" when I next have time (probably this weekend)</p>
<p>I confess I have never heard of it before.</p>
<p>Thanks to all who read this thread.</p>
<p>To both,&nbsp; the most recent major change I have made is added a VPN, but that was around three months ago and I hardly ever activate it so I doubt this is the cause because the problem started about a month ago.</p>

            <p>Generally the only thing that would be relevant in Event Viewer is if there is an error next to a process at the time</p>
<p>of the crash. You don't need to open Event Viewer before launching a game. Event Viewer is always humming away</p>
<p>in the background.</p>
<p>You will want to view&nbsp; <em>Windows Logs</em> &gt; <em>Applications</em> &amp; <em>System</em>. The exact time of each event is there on the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that an exclamation mark in either yellow or red does not always indicate a problem that needs addressing.</p>
<p>These often get thrown out due to various things such as user settings, mods, or leftovers from previously uninstalled</p>
<p>software that Windows thinks is out of order, or otherwise confuses Windows (but not bad enough to cause a problem).
</p>
<p>Even an x on red is not always as bad as it looks.</p>
<p>My GTA4 throws out about four red exclamations every time I run it (maybe because of the
<em>xliveless</em> fix ? ).</p>
<p>- Having said that, yes an exact time match to when a game crashes is a good contender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- It's not a silver bullet by any means, but another way to verify if there are conflicting processes is to troubleshoot

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;As far as I can tell "Gadget Platform" does not exist on my PC. </p>
<p>This is now driving me to distraction, I find myself waiting for it to happen.</p>
<p>As it starts happening immediately exactly 1 hour from boot up (and btw I should make it clear the games do not crash, they minimise and some of them auto pause) from start up if I start a game immediately without doing anything else it happens exactly 1
 hour from PC boot up not game start and then every hour after, I am assuming it is a start up programme that scans for something or carries out some process every hour from boot.</p>

            <p>I would disable the following,&nbsp; at least&nbsp; while troubleshooting, and until the true culprit is found.</p>
<p><em>- Java Update Scheduler</em> - I see the word, update here. ;) <br />
<em>- Daemon Tools Lite&nbsp;</em>&nbsp; - A driver for Daemon Tools has been know to cause issues in past, but this may</p>
<p>not have been one of them.</p>
<p><em>- Internet Download Manager&nbsp;</em> - Does it actually speed up downloads noticeably ? If not trash it.</p>
<p>Shouldn't need it loading with Windows though.</p>
<p><em>- Zermana AntiLogger Free&nbsp;</em> -&nbsp; I see the free edition is discontinued, and probably not getting updated definitions,</p>
<p>so you may want to uninstall or upgrade to pay for if you need keylogger protection.</p>
<p>Regardless, it probably should not be running concurrently with AVG, so disable it in Startup and run manual scans.
</p>
<p>Running more than one AV active can cause problems. </p>
<p><em>- </em><em>DisplayLinkUI </em>-&nbsp; If you use it, verify it's impact in Task Manager &gt; Performance and Resource Monitor.</p>
<p><em>- Cyberghost&nbsp;&nbsp;</em> - Maybe something in the setup options ?</p>
<p>.</p>

            Just to let you know I finally found the problem, it seems that a calender app I bought from the windows store a few years ago was running and when I removed it the problem was gone. I have no idea why it was not listed in my start up progs but it was
 running in the background (or at least certain aspects of it). I bought it for my windows phone in 2013 according to the store and I must have installed it on my pc at some time. Not sure why but problem solved anyway, thanks for the help, it is appreciated.<br />

<p>Same issue with a jailbroken IOS (8+).</p>
<p>had to move to one of the common alternative systems cause Skype is no longer usable.</p>
<p>for me the icon says: Open and not Get/Install..</p>
<p>

            I tried that, but it said I need ios 9, so still no good for my iphone 4. They have taken my money though, for a years subsciption. So it is only any good when I am in my house, not when I would need it the most

            Nope, you got it! Press F10 and enter the HP recovery process. Use the Advanced settings and do a full destructive recovery. After the recovery process is complete (and be patient, a bunch of programs will be installed after you get into Windows), uninstall
 obsolete/unwanted/trial software. Update to XP Service Pack 3 and do all subsequent Windows Updates. Install current versions of common programs such as Adobe Reader, Java, Flash, Shockwave, etc. Install a good antivirus such as NOD32 (commercial), Avast or
 Avira (both of these have free versions) and enjoy your "new" computer.

    <title>Changing my Xbox from HDMI to Component wont work&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> why recon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing my Xbox from HDMI to Component wont work&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>When playing most games I will use the HDMI connection however when I want to record with my HD PVR (I'm sure that you should be familiar with this product by now).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used to play&nbsp;in Componant so this was never an issue, but now when I make the change to component all I get is a black screen and nothing is picked up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is there that I can do to solve this problem?</p>
<p>Also I am using the original Xbox 360 Arcade as iv not seen the point in upgrading.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don' think there is a problem with the component cable and like Branddiesel has said, have you changed your settings on your TV?</p>
<p>The settings would be chancing your TVs input from HDMI to Component. There should not be any changes necessary on your console in order for it to detect the video signal.</p>

<p>Yep I changed my TV to component and the Xbox output to 720p and still nothing.
</p>
<p>After testing the component cable on its own (again with the settings changed) I got sound from my television but no video.
</p>
<p>I have everything disconnected now, just playing though the HDMI, my thoughts are that if I can get it to work with just the component cable, that will be the same problem as with the PVR.
</p>
<p>So is there any recommendation for this situation? (getting sound but no video)</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
Please try to reset the consoles display settings while the component cables are plugged in by following the directions below:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove any discs from the disc tray. </li><li>Turn off the console. </li><li>Turn on the console.<br />
<br />
<p><b>Note:</b>&nbsp;If you are using an Xbox 360 Wireless Controller, turn on the console by using the Guide button on the controller. Make sure that you use the player 1 controller when you do this. The player 1 controller will have the upper-left light illuminated.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
</li><li>As the console starts, on the controller, press and hold Y while pulling the right trigger. The display settings are reset to the default settings, and then the console automatically restarts.<br />
&nbsp; </li></ol>
<p>If this doesn't work please try to do the following:<br />
<br />
Try a new set of component cables.<br />
Try to use another TV with component (if available) with the old pair of cables and a new pair of cables.<br />
<br />
<strong>Sound but no picture?<br />
<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Try the following:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that your TV is on. </li><li>Remove any devices, such as a receiver, placed between the console and the TV.
</li><li>If your TV has an eco/energy saving mode, turn off the video options.<br />
&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p>More information <strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/audio-video-setup-and-use/audio-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
If this does not work then it's likely that there is something wrong with the component input of the XBOX 360 and it would need to be repaired. This can be done by going to the Microsoft repair site
<strong><a href="http://myservice.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. Assuming your console is not in warranty the charge is $99. However, I suggest that you put that money towards a new console if component is that important to you.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this didn't work either, I don't know why this has happened, but it is an Arcade and its been though a lot.
</p>
<p>The question is now, should I buy a new Xbox or should I just wait for the 720 :P</p>

<p>Hey there Recon! I just wanted to clarify, are you trying to swap out these cables while the console and TV are on? Can you try turning them both off, setting up with the component cable, and then turn them both on? You may need to adjust the console settings
 before swapping out the cables. Let us know if that helps, thanks! </p>
