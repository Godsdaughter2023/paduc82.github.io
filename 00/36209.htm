<h2>            Windows believes it&#39;s not genuine and won&#39;t let me attempt to activate.</h2>
                    There's been some weird stuff with my machine lately, I'll tell the long story.<br />
<br />
I've had Windows 7 Premium running on my Asus desktop since whenever they sent me the upgrade, probably mid-2010. It's an upgrade from whatever<br />
<br />
copy of Vista was running at the time of purchase in October 2009. Some time last week (the 21st), despite control panel assuring me I was<br />
<br />
activated I received a warning that Windows was not genuine. Since Control Panel gave me an activation thumbs up, I went about my merry way.<br />
<br />
On the 22nd, some of my profile settings got screwed up. For the sake of non-technical users in the household I have usernames displayed on<br />
<br />
startup to enable a nice "click and enter password" experience. That went away for some reason. I went around in circles on that one until I<br />
<br />
found some information that suggested sometimes the profiles get corrupted in the registry and need to be fixed. It also said if you were lazy<br />
<br />
you could delete them, and it was bedtime so I gave it a quick shot. Reboot, everything looks peachy, so I went to bed and on the 23rd we left to<br />
<br />
visit family for the holidays. (Also my car was burglarized that night. Merry Christmas!)<br />
<br />
Today's the first time I booted my machine since the 22nd. I was greeted with a loss all of my profile settings (desktop, remapped My Documents,<br />
<br />
etc.) which makes sense considering I nuked the registry tree that pointed to the right data. Then WGA started whining that my machine wasn't<br />
<br />
genuine again, and this time it's the black desktop of doom where I know it's serious. FizzBin! Here's the things I've tried to resolve this:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Trying to reactivate via Control Panel gives me "Access is denied" 0x80070005.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Clicking "Get Genuine" in the "you're a pirate YARR!" dialog gives me the same error.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * System restore says the file or directory is corrupted and unreadable (0x80070570). Trying to run it again yields "Catastrophic failure<br />
<br />
0x8000FFF". That's exciting.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Trying a different System Restore point bluescreens.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * slmgr /dlv yields "On a computer running Microsoft Windows non-core edition, run 'slui.exe 0x2a 0x46'. That's... disturbing.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * slui.exe gives me the same error code as control panel activation.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * slmgr /dti tells me Permission denied; that's line 835. It's in the DisplayIID method and it looks like it dies trying to run a WMI query.<br />
<br />
I'm not sharp with VBS but it looks like it ought to be eating the error.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * slmgr /xpr from an elevated command prompt is the same error on a different line.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * slmgr /rilc gives error 0x8007005 Access denied and complains I don't have elevated privileges. (I do!)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Same Access Denied error with slmgr /ipk.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Some answers on forums seem to indicate this can happen due to borked group policy settings. I'm not on a domain but hey, I'll try<br />
<br />
anything. Unfortunately Premium doesn't let you use the group policy snap-in to MMC.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * The help for activation doesn't have a phone number.<br />
<br />
I'm shut out of System Restore. I can't activate. I can't run any of the tools it looks like I'd need to activate over the phone, and I don't<br />
<br />
have a phone number to call anyway. I've got one last weapon: I use Acronis True Image and I've got a disk image from the 6th I could restore.<br />
<br />
There's no telling if that will work though; if the activation servers think I'm Seasharp the pirate then I'll just get hosed again in a few<br />
<br />
weeks. Clicking the link in one of the WGA dialogs kicked off some process that "might take several minutes" I'm waiting on, hopefully that works. It's been 10 minutes so I'm posting the thread anyway because I assume it's stuck. (Actually yes it is. There's
 a script error on the page: permission denied. Sounds sadly familiar.) What happened to the old checks that let me generate a code and paste it in? I suppose those would fail on my system too.<br />
<br />
I'm not some ____ hound looking to run cracked Windows. I'm a C# developer with an MSDN subscription and practically unlimited access to every version of Win7; I still purchased a computer with a Vista license/7 upgrade offer because I feel it's kind of shady
 to use MSDN for my home affairs. I haven't popped new hardware in the box since November 2009, so I don't know why I would suddenly start appearing as non-genuine. I think this would be solved if I were allowed access to *anything* that would let me activate,
 but all of the tools claim my administrator accounts don't have enough chops to do the job. What the heck is going on?<br />

<p>Since no one seemed to believe there was an easy solution, I took out a bigger hammer and restored a disk image from earlier in the month. Everything seems to be fine now, I did /ato and the genuine check and both came back clean. Now I've just got to put
 up with a month of updates to reapply. I'm curious if maybe an update around the 22nd caused the problem; I guess I'll know again once auto-updates are applied.</p>

 applications like Word or Excel, etc.).&nbsp; I do not have familiarity with these types of forums so please forgive me if I have asked the same question twice.&nbsp; I just downloaded the most recent drivers for this printer and I still get the error message shown

<p><span>Hey KASRBaird<span>,</span></span></p>
<p><span>This issue is mainly caused because of the incorrect printer driver installed on the computer or corrupt driver.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Researched more on this issue on Dell support website and found the following information.<br />

<strong><span>Important: </span></strong>The mentioned links&nbsp;contain steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure
 that you follow the steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, check "How to back up and restore
 the registry in Windows" article: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The computer will then proceed to install the driver with a quick progress bar.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once that is done, make sure to set the printer as the&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Change-your-default-printer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>default
 printer</span> </a>. </span></p>

            One possibility is if you have installed the&nbsp; "optional"&nbsp; Windows Update - <i>

(apparently required for IE10) and are off line it will stop some games from loading as it

tries to fetch updates (yes, even with games that did not have an option for on line patching).<br />
<br />
Also - Sometimes when a game shows in Processes but has not loaded fully if you end the<br />

I have a game or two that tends to do this.<br />

            Yes . I uninstalled it months ago, and it is a known buggy update.&nbsp; <br />
Have you verified that the game will load when you are on line ?<br />
<br />
If I remember correctly it was in the 'optional' updates.<br />
After uninstalling you can 'hide' the update so you don't accidentally reinstall it again later.<br />
You can also reinstall at any time by going to 'restore hidden updates' in the Updates Window.<br />
<br />
I just found the following thread as well. It shows a couple of other bugs I was not aware of.<br />
I may look into the suggestion by TomislavRex at some time in the future though (when I update my AMD graphics card).<br />

            As the game is showing in 'Processes' and&nbsp; ending the process and trying to reload the game has<br />
not helped you may want to try running in Clean Boot to troubleshoot possible conflicts with

Yes, that's why I asked if you were able to load while on line, as the update stops games loading only when off line, but it's worth knowing about the issues that come with that update even if it wasn't
<br />
the source of the problem in this case.<br />

<p>Hello B9918, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>The system normally downloads small updates and configures settings after a major upgrade/update. If the system process increases, check the programs running that consumes most of the resources then observe if it still happens after a
 few hours of usage. For us to learn what is causing your computer to slow down, kindly provide us the following details:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any specific changes on your computer prior to the issue? </li><li>Were there any updates installed aside from the 1803 update?</li><li>What were the activities that you’re doing wherein you experience that the computer slows down?
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>To help resolve this, we suggest that you follow these methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Perform a clean boot. </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program
 in Windows</span>. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press the "<strong>Windows + R</strong>" key to open a
<strong>Run</strong> box.</span></li><li><span>Type <strong>
msconfig</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></li><li><span>On the <strong>
General tab</strong>, click Selective startup.</span></li><li><strong><span>Clear the Load startup items check box</span></strong><span>.</span></li><li><span>Click the <strong>
Services</strong> tab.</span></li><li><span>Select the <strong>
Hide all Microsoft services check box </strong>(<strong>DO NOT MISS THIS PART</strong>).</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>
Disable all. </strong>Restart the PC.</span></li></ol>

</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Check if you are still using the built-in driver of Windows 10</span></strong></p>

<strong>devmgmt.msc</strong>.</span></li><li><strong><span>Under IDE ATA/ATAPI

Advanced boot menu</em>? A: Yes, that's screen I got to to try the repair and restore.<br />
</span></li><li><span>What is the make and model of your computer? A: Gateway NV57H44u<br />
</span></li></ol>
<p>Regarding your additional information:</p>
<p>Method 1 - nothing is connected, so this is not applicable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try the additional methods next. I appreciate you pointing out the right choices ... you have many articles to choose from, and I could not tell what was most appropriate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

</p><p>In addition to my answers above,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried method 2 &amp; 3, with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried bootrec.exe with all four options. The ScanOs and RebuildBcd replied "total identified windows installations: 0" (that can't be good!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried a virus scan from CD boot, which found no viruses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Memory Diagnostic came back with "no issues found".</p>

</p><p>I don't know how to do a HDD check without getting into Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And still my issues persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was not smart enough to make a recovery CD with my PC, which came without a Windows (or any other) disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I spend money on buying a recovery disk from Gateway, is there anything else I can try? Is there any way of knowing if the recovery disk will work after I purchase it?</p>

            <p>Hi Ratandeep,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the suggestions, but ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your first link, it suggests using vssadmin. I can only get to the "System Recovery Options" menu, so I went there and then to the command prompt. I typed in the command and received the error message "vssadmin is not recognized as an internal or external
 command, operable program or batch file."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp; then went to your second link, however, that requires connecting to the internet and downloading files onto the computer. That is not possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else do you have for me to try to fix it? How about to just diagnose the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that all files are corrupt. So, I would suggest you to perform In-place upgrade and check.</p>
<p>Refer:<br />
<strong>How to Perform an In-Place Upgrade on Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 &amp; Windows Server 2008 R2</strong><br />

<p>
</p><p>Note: Windows 7 DVD is required to perform In-place upgrade.</p>
<p>I highly recommend backing up all of your important files and folders onto an external storage device
</p>
<p>before attempting any type of OS repair or upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

</p><p>&nbsp;I went through the same, in fact just back on. I ran the repair, nothing did it again and again, then disc check started to hours to go through that and still got the same error msg powering up. I did the whole Advanced repair thing, read the log said it
 couldn't repair error code 0x45D.&nbsp; Now I don't know if repeating these things time and time again helped, but in the end I powered off my PC then unplugged the hard drive cable and for good measure ( though I don't know if I need that too) the dvd drive cable
 from the motherboard and powered up my PC, I then switched the power off and re plugged the cables they were seated well in the first place and powered back up.&nbsp; After initial start I seen the disc check again, which this time I hit a button to cancel it and
 then my windows came back up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;So I don't know if all those repair attempts and dics checks helped in the end, but it would seem unplugging switching the power on and back off then re plugging the hard drive and powering back on seems to have worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; That said right now I am not wanting to log out of windows just now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;What is the cause of this error ? is it the hard drive is faulty or has developed a fault over time or is it a software problem ?</p>

</p><p>It seems that the hard drive has some issues. You may try running check disk again using the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Click Start and type cmd in the start search box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. Right click cmd and select run as administrator.</p>

 a blue screen with STOP CODE 0xED UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME. &nbsp;I can't run system repair or restore or safe mode. I need to know what the problem is so I can fix it. Is it a problem with my hardware (hard disk etc.) or software?</p>

<p>There are two things that can cause an Unmountable Boot Volume.</p>
<p>First, if your hard drive's partition table becomes damaged and the other is if the hard drive is going bad and has physical damage.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I believe sony is one of those companies that do not give you software discs with your machine so you will have to contact sony to get one. Once you have the disc then you will boot to it and run a repair. If this does not fix the issue then
 it is going to be a hard drive going bad and there is nothing else to do except replace the hard drive.</p>

<p>Just to be clear: You are trying to boot off of the CD or DVD windows disk that came with your machine and not off a built in windows recovery that you access with one of the F keys?</p>
<p>You should not get an Unmountable Boot Volume error when booting from the CD because it bypasses the hard drive until after it boots completely. Make sure that is the windows disc and not just a driver disk. You might be thinking your trying to boot to the
 disc but the disc is not bootable so it bypasses back to the hardrive which gives the blue screen.</p>

            <p>Hi Wbslaw,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might require to create the DNS records on both the internal DNS server and the external DNS server following the below article to get the issue resolved. The article is as below</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/2566790/troubleshooting-skype-for-business-online-dns-configuration-issues-in-office-365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/2566790/troubleshooting-skype-for-business-online-dns-configuration-issues-in-office-365</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime I would recommended you to use the following settings. Click on tools or the gear icon in the Skype for Business Client and then click on Option and go to the personal tab in. Next to the sign-in address at the top there is an option named

    <title>Windows 10 Game Capture DVR 0 Byte Files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> etifuloper  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Game Capture DVR 0 Byte Files</h2>
                    If your Windows happens to go through a crash while using the Game Bar, there is a 101% chance the file, when reviewing it, will appear to be 0 bytes and unwatchable coming with the error code 0xc00d36c4. Is there a way to recover these files if both the
 Game Bar and Broadcast DVR crash alongside Windows? And if so, is there a way to simply prevent them both from crashing with your Windows, or even a secret menu where it has a setting that autosaves every 10 minutes, or uploads the file to a cloud during the
 crash as to save progress?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for choosing Windows 8 and for providing us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have mentioned that when you try to download itunes, you get an error message saying that the signature is corrupt or invalid. Don’t worry; we’ll help you with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which version of itunes are you trying to download?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue could be due to a corrupted download file or due to a corrupted system files. I would suggest you to try these steps and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Check compatibility</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to first check if the itunes version you are trying to download is compatible with Windows 8. You can check here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/ProductViewerWithDefaultFilters?TempOsid=win8&amp;Locale=en-us&amp;TextSearch=i%2Btunes&amp;Type=Both&amp;CurrentPage=0&amp;TotalPages=1&amp;ShowCriteria=0&amp;SortCriteria=Relevance&amp;Compatibility=Unknown&amp;LastRequested=14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/ProductViewerWithDefaultFilters?TempOsid=win8&amp;Locale=en-us&amp;TextSearch=i%2Btunes&amp;Type=Both&amp;CurrentPage=0&amp;TotalPages=1&amp;ShowCriteria=0&amp;SortCriteria=Relevance&amp;Compatibility=Unknown&amp;LastRequested=14</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is compatible with Windows 8, then I would suggest you to change the permission in Internet explorer. Refer these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press Alt + X in internet explorer to get the tools option</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Select Internet options and click on Advanced tab</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Under security select “Allow software to run if the signature is invalid”</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click Apply and Ok to save changes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above steps didn’t help, then I would suggest you to contact apple support:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/support/itunes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.apple.com/support/itunes/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Please get back to us with the status of the issue so that we can help you accordingly.</p>

<h2>            Bottom taskbar not working in Windows 10.....Please help.</h2>
                    Hi everyone. I've recently upgraded to windows 10 from windows 7. Everything was going fine until i tuned my pc on 2 days ago and i could not use the taskbar at all and some of the icons in the bottom right were not available. I've had a read and think
 whats happened is that I've put it into tablet mode somehow. To turn it off people are suggesting that i go into the start button and into settings and turn it off that was, however this is not an option as the start button is unresponsive as well as the rest
 of the taskbar. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

</p><p>However, this problem don't critical for me. My critical problem is the bottom taskbar not responding&nbsp;frequently, when this problem happen, I
 the mouse, and type ctrl+alt+del to restart my notebook. (in 1 day this problem happen 4-5 times
</span>approximately<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">)</span></p>
<p><br />
I suspect the problem is caused by the graphics card not compatible with windows 10 because my another pc can run windows 10 smoothly.</p>

            <p>this was very helpful to get the command prompt, since today the usual methods refuse to open the window.! Was fine yesterday, except the taskbar had shifted up , no longer on the bottom line - an entirely new problem for me!</p>

            <p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to just drag and drop the taskbar towards the bottom of the screen and that will do it. If you are unable to do so, then right click on task bar, uncheck "Lock taskbar" and drag it towards the bottom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>For what I've seen so far, the only way to fix this is to buy a Mac. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hundreds, maybe thousands have the very same problem if you look on the Internet. There are few ways to solve it, but for many of us, the only way out is to change platforms to an operating system that actually works.

<h3> kristenjansen  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#39;CL RC Engine 3 Dummy Winidow&#39;  pops up everytime I shut my computer down</h2>
                    When I shut my computer down (I'm operating with Windows 7 Ultimate) I see the following 2 messages (pls note the spelling in the following message):
<br />
<br />
CL RC Engine 3 Dummy Winidow&nbsp; <br />
This program is preventing Windows from Shutting down<br />
<br />
CL RC Engine3 Dummy Winidow: QP Service.exe - Applic....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Then in a separate box that appears after you see the previous 2 messages states:<br />
<br />
The instruction at 0x0135ec0a referenced memory at 0x00000000.&nbsp; The memory could not be written.&nbsp;
<br />
Click OK to terminate the program<br />
<br />
My question is;<br />
1.&nbsp; Why is this happening<br />
2.&nbsp; How do I fix this problem (remove the issue).&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I have Norton 360 installed on my computer and it has never identified this as an issue.&nbsp; And as I read through the previous answers offered on this same issue I want to clarify that is not happening upon the computers start up (the computer starts up just
 fine - therefore the 'safe mode' response is of no help to me).&nbsp; This issue is happening each and every time I shut my computer down.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Any help you can offer would be most appreciated.

<br />
While this may come as no surprise to you, your advice (go into MSCONFIG and uncheck HP Quick Play) was spot on!&nbsp; By unchecking HP Quick Play in the MSCONFIG Start Up tab it solved the problem (I no longer see the error message 'CL RC Engine 3 Dummy Winidow&nbsp;

<br />
The only challenge I'm faced with now is when I go into the Programs folder to uninstall HP Quick Play, while there are quite a few HP programs, there isn't one labeled HP Quick Play.<br />
<br />
Again, thank you for your advice/support!<br />

<br />
You already found it - you said it was called "QuickPlay Swing Player 0.4.6 by Swing Media".&nbsp; Uninstall it.

<h2>            USB ports not recognizing devices</h2>
                    
<p><span>Computer has 8 USB ports, all behaving the same way.&nbsp; Have had no issues with ports working normally since I purchased the machine 2 years ago.&nbsp; Just
 this week, when I p</span><span>lug in my Cruzer drive to Integral USB, get “be boop”, but no message in bottom right about “new hardware” and no ejection tool in task bar. The “removable disk (I:)” shows
 in the explorer list, but no files appear when selected. (Light on the drive stays on momentarily and turns off.)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>(screen shots not included)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Device Manager says everything AOK. Top window for first device (Printer) bottom window for second device (Malfunctioning thumb drive).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Plug in Staples Thumb drive in another port, sometimes get unknown device (1 screen shot), sometimes get three beeps and no drive recognition
 at all.<span>&nbsp; </span>When checking device manager with this scenario, get an error on device line and message “Device Can Not Start Code 10” in the general window (2 screen shot)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>No rhyme or reason when each message comes up.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Plugged Camera into USB Get message in lower right - "USB Device not recognized"</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Select on info box – lower right to get more information - shows Unknown Device in the list ... no help there...</span></p>
<p><span>Plug 4 port USB expander in and get the generic hub device in device manager.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Plug all devices into hub and they all work fine…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Still not getting task bar option to safely remove hardware…<br />
</span></p>
<p><br />
All devices are current technology USB 2.0 capable and were working up until this week.<br />
Any ideas what is going on?<br />
<br />
I have already uninstalled the USB controllers, unplugged my machine, and restarted it.&nbsp; The USB controllers all reinstall just fine, but this does not resolve the problem.<br />
<br />
Assistance would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />

<div>I just went through two weeks of diddling with my 'older' computer trying to get it to recognize my new Canon 4370dn multifunction printer after installing Windows 7.&nbsp; I tried reinstalling Windows XP, uninstalling the USB
 ports and hubs shown in the Device Manager, updating the printer drivers, and several combinations of the above.&nbsp; In my case the ports would recognize flash drives and
external hard drives, but my printer would come up as an unrecognized device.&nbsp; What finally worked for me was to again uninstall all of the USB ports/hubs listed in the Device Manager ( they automatically get reinstalled with a fresh restart of the computer),
 download a chipset driver installation utility from the&nbsp;Intel site (<a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/confirm.aspx?httpDown=http://downloadmirror.intel.com/16023/a08/infinst_autol.exe&amp;agr=&amp;ProductID=&amp;DwnldId=16023&amp;strOSs=&amp;OSFullName=&amp;lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://downloadcenter.intel.com/confirm.aspx?httpDown=http://downloadmirror.intel.com/16023/a08/infinst_autol.exe&amp;agr=&amp;ProductID=&amp;DwnldId=16023&amp;strOSs=&amp;OSFullName=&amp;lang=eng</a>),
 and restart the computer.&nbsp; When I plugged in the USB cable from the printer the normal new device process was initiated.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            windows 10 update hiding mapped X drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wondering if anyone else has noticed this or has any additional information on this as I haven't seen anything. Basically any of our customers that have anything mapped to the x: drive has had that drive disappear on them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you go into the navigation bar and put in the drive letter it still navigates to it. And if you go into cmd for a net use it still shows there. But nothing is showing in file explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've tried deleting it and remapping (both through UI and net use) the commands go through but you still are unable to see the x drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has come across this and found a way to fix it or found any documentation stating that this is happening for a reason I would appreciate it because we have a number of programs that reach out via drive letters and when those connections need to
 be refreshed we can't without manually removing and re-adding.</p>

            Turns out this was being caused by LapTech and not windows updates. the Labtech update cache defaults to the x: drive regardless of if that is in use or not. we changed our templates to use a different drive letter and the issue resolved.

<h2>            Xbox One controller &#40;wireless receiver&#41; drivers on Windows 10 make system unbearably slow and dysfunctional</h2>
                    <p>After installing the Xbox One controller on Windows 10 and rebooting, my system ran very very slow. How slow? I had never seen the "Preparing Security Options" message from Windows when I pressed Ctrl-Alt-Del, and putting up that message was all Ctrl-Alt-Del
 would do. Right-mouse-click on the Windows start icon would not bring up anything, and the Explorer would open a window but never display the contents of the folder requested. Tray icons could be accessed at normal speed. If I go to Safe Mode and delete:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>C:\WINDOWS\INF\OEM118.inf</span></p>
<p><span>C:\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\FW_ACC_00U.bin</span></p>
<p><span>C:\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\mt7612US.sys</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>my system returns to its normal zippy self. (The OEM118 file is generated by Oculus Rift install, so I think it's related but not essential to remove).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When I selected "Update Drivers" from Device Manager, I was always told I had the most current driver files for the Xbox wireless transceiver.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I use an EDIMAX wireless nub to connect to the building wifi. My board is an Asus Z170 Sabertooth Mark 1, with 32GB RAM, Intel i7-6700K 4.00GHz. I have a Samsung 950 NVMe, Intel 480 SSD, Kinect, wireless MS ergo mouse,
 and wireless 3Dconnexion space mouse, and an Oculus Rift that works with its sensor and clicker.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This is on Windows 10 Pro Version 1511 Build 10586.420, with Check for Updates saying nothing more to install.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What is causing the conflict?</span></p>

            Oh, just wanted to add that neither Task Manager Performance nor Resource Monitor (which I could start in the first couple of seconds after logging in) reported anything unusual. They continued to run and provide regular updates but all usage reported
 was nominal.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing performance issues with your system.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try some methods to diagnose this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode and then perform clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> Perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps
 eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to
 perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></a><span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></strong></p>
<p><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. It will scan your system files
 and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows. To run the SFC scan, refer to the Microsoft article below.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a></span></span></p>

            <div>
<p>Thanks for the reply Mayank! It wasn't any of those things though.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>After a bunch of binary elimination attempts with Services and Startup, I could not narrow the problem down. Eventually, I started receiving a problem similar to the one described in thread:</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10, device connect/disconnect sound plays over and over when monitor powers down (sleep)</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>That eventually led me to change the USB Power Settings under Start-&gt;Settings-&gt;System-&gt;PowerandSleep-&gt;AdditionalPowerSettings-&gt;ChangePowerSettings-&gt;ChangeAdvancedPowerSettings-&gt;USBSettings-&gt;USBSelectiveSettings. I switched that to disable, and it still didn't
 work.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>But, it got me to thinking that the problem might be, in general, in the USB. So, I investigated the topography of my USB3.0 ports and discovered the downstream USB on my monitor is USB 2.0 - only the upstream is 3.0. I also had an onboard controller doing
 USB 3.1. I had disabled XHCI handoff in the UEFI.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Over time, I had acquired 4 USB 3.0 hubs. I had two Data Max (aka Via) 4-ports, one Anker 4-port and one Anker 7 port. The Data Max were plugged into the monitor's USB 2.0 downstream and thanks to USBLogView I learned the Data Max hubs could not stay connected
 for about more than a minute (at least in the USB 2.0 downstream). So, I rearranged topography and put all my USB 3.0 devices on the Anker 7 port. I moved my legacy USB 2.0 devices around to my copious USB 2.0 ports, instead of being in the "easily accessible"
 Data Max hubs.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Something worked. At this point, I can only say that if you run into this problem, fiddle with your USB UEFI (or BIOS) settings, rearrange the USB topography, and make sure you've got no USB 3.0 devices that pass through a USB 2.0 stream.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Things are still a little flaky. My XBox One controller and 3DConnexion Space Mouse seem to take turns at being functional. My network was down and came back upon reboot, but I don't know if the failure was just local to this system.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>But, I think the problem reported here is resolved. I can right mouse click in Windows again and Ctrl-Alt-Del brings up the Task Manager again, so these improvements are monumental.</p>
        </p>

            <p>It turns out there was a network problem induced by the combination of devices. Apparently, if you have the EDIMAX wifi nub and Wireless Xbox transceivers in the same system the network - even the wired network - won't be able to stay connected for very
 long. In my case, I simply retired the EDIMAX (just had it sitting around after a Raspberry Pi project) and now the network functions normally again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(the Xbox controller and space mouse both work fine now, don't know whether was some issue or the EDIMAX removal fixed that too).</p>
