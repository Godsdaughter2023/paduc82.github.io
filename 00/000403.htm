            I'm not sure preloaded games there are free, usually they are trial. If you would like to find free games, try to visit
www.mobilegamesarena.net,
<a href="http://www.mobiles24.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.mobiles24.com</a> or <a href="http://www.mobi11.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
Hope this will help.

            Maybe your were having invalid internet settings. Did you ask your service provider to send you the correct settings?<br />
Without proper access point and web settings, you can't connect to the download page.<br />
<br />
And the reply above is all wrong. You'll get the full version of the games.

<p>@classic_sis, they are not free trial, they are full version. I have a friend who has an Asha 203 and all 40 games from EA are free and full version. Checked the Nokia website if it was true and it was indeed. Free, full-version EA games are available only
 for Nokia Asha 202 and 203 but I dont know why I can't download it too. BTW, my phone is a 202 since 203s are only available for Globe postpaid.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Welcome to the Microsoft community. It seems that the people you've sent messages to cannot see your signature logo on the e-mail. Is this correct?<br />
<br />
We'd like to know more about the problem. Allow us to ask you the following:<br />
<br />
- Does the issue happen to all the people you send e-mails or to specific recipients only?<br />
<br />
- Does the same thing happen when you try using other logo for your e-mail signature?<br />
<br />
I would suggest that you try sending a test mail to yourself using the same account to see if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
Kindly provide us the exact steps on how you've added the logo as a signature in Outlook.com<br />
<br />
We look forward to your reply.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
<br />

    <title>Network Issues with the new build 9926 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marty_don08  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network Issues with the new build 9926</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I have downloaded the new Build 9926 and I installed this onto as a VM Machine as I am using the previous build on my laptop and when I upgraded to the new build. I noticed some of the most strangest network errors I have ever seen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The previous Build on my laptop (build 9879) has no issues. All my network apps work, office, and day to day functions are great. I am the sys admin and we are testing this out now as we will more than likely roll this out as soon as its available from MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really want to start testing the new build but now when I join it to the Domain and then login as myself (I am the local admin as well)</p>
<p>The logon scripts keep stating -&gt; Access Denied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot even browse to the shared netlogon folder where my scripts are located. I can access every other share on that same server \\servername\shares. Just that one particular folder states "you do not have permission to access this" even if I use the
 domain admin account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Has this something to do with my Domain controller? The PDC is 2008 and the secondary is 2012. DNS runs from the 2012 server.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No DNS issues, but I also think that the GPO's are not being applied to the machine. None of the browser settings, printer settings are shown on the new build.</p>
<p>I am searching all possible places but I cannot see what could be causing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also now noticed that when I try to access the server share with my credentials, I am getting this error "multiple connections to a server or shared resource by the same user". I have accessed this share sooo many times before with my username and
 password on Win 7 machines</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else seen this issue before?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Marty</p>

<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are different factors that can contribute as to why your emails from a third party email provider are not reaching your Outlook account. This could be caused by the email protocol that was used when you set up your account or a recent update that was
 installed. For us to resolve your concern, kindly answer the questions below:</p>

&nbsp;How do You find out the protocol that was used in Outlook.I say this because I did use Google Plus for years and when I tried to open My emails I found all of them&nbsp; gone no explanation at all and I had way over 100,000 emails that just went puff.It seems that
 Google either doesn't care for&nbsp; the many multitutes out there the seem to only care about their net profits and losses.

                    When I have outlook open and my computer goes to sleep, upon waking up, the "recent people" pulldown is open, and appears (and remains) over the top of every other open window. I have to select a name from the list, or close outlook<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d2912c91-178f-4ec1-aece-e8132f10aa2e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d2912c91-178f-4ec1-aece-e8132f10aa2e?upload=true" /></a>

            Hi Micah,
<br />Is it always there when you wake up the computer?  Best guess, whatever you are doing to wake it up is triggering. If you click the mouse to wake up. try opening a web page or even just a new word document (you want something besides outlook to be in focus when it goes to sleep) then let the computer go to sleep. When it wakes, is recent people open? 
<br />
<br />Do you use a mouse with programmable buttons where you set one key to send mail? Or use a keyboard with a New Mail button?

<p>I thought I was going insane but I'm glad to know I'm not the only one experiencing this exact same problem.&nbsp; When I wake up my machine, I have a bunch of "Recent People" windows just hanging out there - the exact same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I got this laptop I have always followed the same steps - if I know I am going to be away from my machine for a while I'll put it to sleep or hibernate (I'm an old creature of habit). Usually when I start it back up I can get right back to what I was
 doing. But in the last week or so whenever I wake it up I have those confounded windows just sitting there. Outlook doesn't have any open windows, just the Inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have O365 Ver 1907 (build 11901.20176).<br />

<p>I'm having the exact same issue on a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 - same version of Outlook as @BaconBagels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I make it go away by opening a new blank email, then closing it (Or by closing and opening Outlook).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been happening for at least 6 months for me, possibly longer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not seen it happen on a desktop PC I use, running the same version of Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also sometimes see a similar issue with Microsoft Teams - it is the outline of a transparent&nbsp; Teams 'toast' notification that appears in that case - with the only resolution being to quit and re-open Teams.</p>

                    I recently moved from a POP3 setup in Outlook 2010 to IMAP. When looking at the Data Files, I can't remove the .pst file thats flagged as default. Even though there is another file that can become the new default. When I try to remove the folder structure
 from Outlook, it won't let me remove it.

            <div>It is not possible to delete the default .pst file in Outlook.</div>
<div>How many data files do you have in Outlook?</div>
<div>When you configure an email account as an IMAP account, a different set of folders is created to synchronize the data with the IMAP server.</div>
<div>Since that data file does not have a few folders which have to be part of an Outlook data file (i.e. Calendar / Contacts / etc.), Outlook creates two .pst file to save for IMAP account. One for the local
 personal folder and one for the actual IMAP mail store. </div>
<div>The IMAP account data file cannot be set as default because of the same reason as above.</div>
<div>The .pst for the local personal folder is used to store the local items, such as your Tasks, your Calendars, Notes, etc.</div>

    <title>Percentage calculations in pivot tables - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> king60611  say:</h3>
<h2>            Percentage calculations in pivot tables</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to figure out the best way to come up with some percentage calcucations as part of a pivot table:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>% Existing Client (cell value&nbsp;= Existing)</p>
<p>% Prospective Client (cell value&nbsp;= Prospective)</p>
<p>Overall % Success Rate (cell value = Won)</p>
<p>% Undecided Outcome (cell value does not equal Won or Lost)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought that I could just use the Count/show value as % Of, but that is returning an error.&nbsp; I'm new to 2010 and it's been a while since I had to do these types of calculated fields in 2003.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Hotmail&#47;Outlook login live sign in page different - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Hotmail&#47;Outlook login live sign in page different</h2>
                    A few days ago the sign in page at login.live.com changed. It looks different and there is no dropdown box when I start typing in my username. The internet options are still the same - forms and usernames and passwords on forms are both checked. Autocomplete
 works on other sites. It's just Hotmail (now known as Outlook?) that doesn't work. I use IE11.

<p>Uttam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already did provide feedback on this bug in the new Microsoft Account sign on page to UserVoice.</p>

</p><p><span>My account has NOT been converted to the new Outlook Mail. The problem is NOT with the user's outlook account ..... the problem is a bug in the new Microsoft Account sign on page.</span></p>

<p>1. enter outlook.com into your browser's search bar and hit Enter.</p>
<p>2. when the new Microsoft Account sign on page opens, start typing your ID into the proper text box. You will see that after typing the first few characters of your ID, that

<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes to the computer before the issue occurred?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the steps provided below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b><span>Start Internet explorer with No add-ons mode and check.
</span></p>
<p><span>Click on Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools and click on Internet Explorer (No Add-ons).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not persist in Internet Explorer (No Add-ons), then it is one of the add-ons causing this issue. Please follow the steps below to locate the problem
 add-on low: </span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart IE normally.</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Tools.</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Manage Add-ons.</span></p>
<p><span>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disable the add-ons by clicking them one at a time to highlight them&nbsp;and then&nbsp;click on disable button.</span></p>
<p><span>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-enable the add-ons one by one and check with which Add-on you get this error message.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disable the Add-on causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>Important:
</span></b><span>Reset Internet Explorer to its default configuration. This step will also disable any add-ons, plug-ins, or toolbars that are installed. Although this solution is quick, it also means
 that, if you want to use any of those add-ons in the future, they must be reinstalled.</span></p>

            <p>I had a similar/related problem - in my case, Outlook was not showing any emails from my gmail accounts. I have several POP Gmail accounts - all of which filtered into Outlook 2010 fine until I reinstalled Office last week.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After researching online for days, and trying everything suggested, I finally 'solved' my problem.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In my Gmail settings, I had POP and IMAP enabled. I've always had it that way, and it worked fine before.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, with the problems I was having this week, I decided to disable IMAP (because I really only use POP), and voila - the emails from Gmail started showing up in Outlook.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I don't know if this will help your case, but there seem to be a lot of Outlook &lt;--&gt; Gmail sync issues that don't appear to have straightforward fixes by either company (i.e., Microsoft and Google).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>

    <title>Autofills &#38; Data Integrity - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> potterjohn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Autofills &#38; Data Integrity</h2>
                    <p>Hi, bit of background; I am new to access and I have been tasked in my work to create a database from scratch with the idea of creating an asset management system for cleaning and catering products held by my work (local authority) across several buildings.
 Previously, this was all done on paper but we are looking to get it up onto Access to update and maintain a better system; I currently have a master sheet with all of the entries and am not quite sure how it all works. Please bear with me as I am very new
 guys and am just learning the ropes :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically I have the following fields populated with data;</p>
<p>
</p><p>ID (autonumber); currently my primary key&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asset number; each asset <strong>should</strong>&nbsp;have an asset number sticker on it but some are missing and therefore I can't use this as a unique field as some entries are null.</p>
<p>Condition; I've created a dropdown box of working, needs repaired, condemned</p>
<p>Type; the type of item such as hoover, buffer, fryer</p>
<p>Manufacturer; Henry, dyson etc</p>
<p>PAT test expiry; date of expiration of electrical test</p>
<p>Next PAT test; when the next test is booked</p>
<p>Location; i.e. room the asset is in such as kitchen, dining area etc</p>
<p>Unit; Now this is where it becomes tricky; I've had to seperate the unit field from the following 'classification field' as the location. The unit is the place that it is held, such as "Glasgow" "Edinburgh"</p>
<p>Classification; I have separated this because there is a list of places that have the same first part of name such as "Glasgow" "Edinburgh" but we then have "Glasgow Community Centre" "Glasgow Police station" "Glasgow Care Home" etc</p>
<p>UPRN: 9 digit unique number that is assigned to each building but there is more than one asset in each building.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I"ve began to run basic queries such as "give me all the broken hoovers in Glasgow Community Centre" and all seems to be fine but my problems begin when;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>There is too many units/classifications to fit into a dropdown box to avoid spelling errors</li><li>Staff that will be adding data don't always have access to the UPRN number of the building</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally I'd like a database where staff can simply input their unit/classification and the UPRN is automatically filled. I've tried Googling for hours to try to get a solution to my problem but most are generic and I'm struggling to apply it to my particular
 situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I am very new to Access so would greatly appreciate any reply to be broken down into as basic terms possible!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much to anyone that can help!&nbsp;</p>

            If you have three hours to cut down a tree, spend two of them sharpening the axe, i.e. when new to database development invest time in learning the principles of the database relational model, and the nuts and bolts of how databases are designed in Access
 in accordance with these principles.&nbsp; If you don't you will continue to make a rod for your own back by committing fundamental errors.<br />
<br />
Your table at present is badly non-normalized and in need of decomposition into a set of correctly normalized related tables.&nbsp; The basic model would be like this:<br />
<br />
Assets&gt;---Addresses&gt;---Locations<br />
<br />
In this I'm using the term addresses to mean the specific location of an asset, e.g. a building or other facility.&nbsp; As you can see the model is a simple tree-structured hierarchy, in that there is a one-to-many relationship type between Locations and Addresses
 (each city can contain one or more addresses, but each address is in one location only), and similarly a one-to-many relationship type between Addresses and Assets.&nbsp; The term locations is used in your sense, and could refer to a geographical unit of any size
 such as a city, town or village.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
To determine which columns are included in each table you need to be familiar with the 'rules' of normalization, but in very simple terms all non-key columns in each table must be determined solely by the key, e.g. the Assets table would not have columns AddressLine1
 and AddressLine2 as these are determined by the key of Addresses.&nbsp; Similarly Addresses would not have a column County (or Region) as this is determined by the key of Locations.&nbsp; For this there should therefore also be a Counties ( or Regions) table referenced
 by Locations.&nbsp; Note that this should contain a N/A county or region to cater for metropolitan areas which are not within any administrative county or region, e.g. London, Birmingham etc in England (this might not apply in Scotland; I'm unfamiliar with the
 administrative structure north of the border).<br />
<br />
You might like to take a look at the files DatabaseBasic.zip and Normalization.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912%21169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
These files provide simple introductions to the basics of relational database design in Access, and to the subject of normalization.&nbsp; With the latter, concentrate on the first three normal forms to start with.&nbsp; Most databases normalized to Third Normal Form
 (3NF) will also be normalized to the higher normal forms, and paying too much attention to the latter at this stage will probably confuse you.&nbsp; That's not to say that they are not important of course.<br />
<br />
When it comes to retrieving data from the database, my DatabaseBasics demo gives some simple examples, but for the situation you describe you would probably want to use correlated combo boxes in which you 'drill down' to assets by selecting a location first
 in one combo box, then an address in a second combo box whose list is restricted to those addresses in the selected location.&nbsp; The ComboDemo.zip file in my OneDrive folder includes examples.&nbsp; The simplified form for 'drilling down' through a hierarchy would
 provide an appropriate model to follow.<br />

<p>As Ken said, you need to understand database design before you can start designing tables.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You said that each building has a UPRN. Therefore you need a table of buildings. It would also appear that each building belongs in a Classification and each Classification belongs in a Unit. So that'sTHREE tables;</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblUnits</p>
<p>UnitID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>UnitName</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblClassifications</p>
<p>ClassificationID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>ClassificationName</p>
<p>UnitID (FK)</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblBuildings</p>
<p>UPRN (PK)</p>
<p>BldgAddress</p>
<p>BldgName</p>
<p>ClassificationID (FK)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now notice I haven't included UnitID in tblBuildings. That's because each Classification is associated with a single unit. So if you know the Classification you know the Unit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lets now look at your main table:</p>
<p>tblAssets</p>
<p>AssetID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>AssetNumber</p>
<p>BuildingID (FK)</p>
<p>ConditionID (FK)</p>
<p>TypeID (FK)</p>
<p>MfgID (FK)</p>
<p>PATTestDate</p>
<p>NextPATDate</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again notice that we only have BuildingID as a FK. Since BuildingID is associated with a single ClassificationID, we do not need to include it in tblAsset. As for displaying the related values see my Blog On Displaying Related Data. Notice also the FKs for
 Condition, Type and Mfg. You will need lookup tables for these items.</p>

<p>Thanks for the replies. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't add an address field, as I am going to be porting the exact field names to another server which other local authorities add in their assets to. Is there any basic VBA that I could try to paste in or anything like that? Could you provide a simple
 way of looking at how the relationships would link in together and how to add a foreign key? Thanks</p>

<p>I don't understand your rational here. Are you porting to an EXISTING database. If so, then why not use the same structure as in that database? If not, then why not build that database properly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>But whether you use a street address to identify the Building or some other method, the structure I outlined still stands. A building is an entity. Attributes of that entity as the Classification, physical location and name or other identifier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unit is an attribute of the Classification entity. Asset is another entity whose attributes are Building, Type, Mfg, Condition and test dates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>VBA to do what?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I outlined how the relationships would work by indicating the PKs and FKs. Don't accept the default ID name for autonumber PKs. rename them as
<em>tablename</em>ID, which is the naming convention I used. Then name your FKs the same, this makes your relationships clear. Adding an FK to a table is simple. The only requirement for an FK is that it match the datatype of the PK it relates to. If you are
 using Autonumber PKs, then the FKs need to be Long Integer data types.</p>

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone out there can help me. I have received an e mail from Microsoft telling me someone has tried to access my account from Turkey. The e mail I have received tells me to access my account via the e mail to verify my password within 24 hours or my
 account will be disabled. The e mail has various spelling mistakes and to be honest looks suspicious.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Keeps resetting time zone</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every few weeks Outlook keeps asking me to reset my time zone, I have changed it a thousand times now but it keeps asking me to reset it. Today I can't access my email as it keeps resetting it when I change it.</p>
<p>I click my current time zone and press Submit but it keeps appearing asking me to change my time zone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried clearing my history, cache, cookies but it doesn't help, I have also tried in Chrome, internet explorer but still getting the same.</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think this is an Operating system issue as it is mainly happening on a windows 7 and windows 10 computer or time time I access outlook.com&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
