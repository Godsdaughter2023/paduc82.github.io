            E72 does provide the ability to print to legacy printers over network though the print features are limited comparing to the solutions for computers. For example, you can print contacts and notes but PDF or Word files.<br />
<br />
I don't think E72 is able to print using cloud based printing services except the only requirement is to send an email to a specific email address. However, this has nothing to do with E72's printing function.<br />
<br />
To add an HP LaserJet printer, go to Control Panel &gt; Printers, press the Options button and choose Add to add a printer. After giving any name to the Printer field, change Bearer to LPR or Soeckets/JetDirect if your printer supports it, assign a right AP for
 your WLAN, give the hostname of IP address of the printer shared on the network, choose Monochrome LaserJet Printers at Printer Models. You also need to give Queen name if you choose LPR as the Bearer.<br />
<br />
Go back to the previous menu, you can see your printer is now added there. Try print something from Notes or Contacts using the Print Options.<br />

                    <p>I know several threads were discussing about this problem - but none of them really solve this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using 2016 Microsoft Office Outlook (Mac) . For every email attachment, it shows "This message has been partially downloaded"&nbsp; and I tried "get entire message" and it didn't work. I didn't set any rule for blocking attachment or set attachment file
 size limitation. I explored all preferences - seems no settings could incur this. I have restarted the app and even restarted my macbook. no lucks.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any suggestions. </p>

            I'm not sure it's outlook on the WEB. Something called Yosemite apparently. Not using Office Outlook for Mac that's definite. IT's called Hotmail anyway.

                    Hi everyone. BrowserModifier: Win32/SupTab!blnk has driven everyone crazy, lately.&nbsp;It's not your computer.&nbsp;Defender put out a faulty virus definition in a recent update, which they have now corrected. All you have to do is check for updates in Defender,
 again, and when the correction downloads and installs, it will magically stop being a problem. It took a few seconds, and the red box turned green and the warning stopped appearing. Poof. All gone.

<h2>            My Outlook saga</h2>
                    <p>Is it just me or do other folks have Outlook .pst (and other) problems?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Outlook journey started with Outlook &nbsp;appending “inbox” to the front on newly created folders (i.e. inboxgoober for a newly created folder called “goober.” ) Then those folders couldn’t be deleted.&nbsp; I cannot remember each step I took
 to correct the problem only that none of them worked.&nbsp; Some things I have tried include doing an complete uninstall/remove Outlook via the “remove”&nbsp; option on the Office Pro 2010 disc.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have tried deleting Outlook 2010 files from the registry:&nbsp; HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Outlook\Setup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also tried completely uninstalling Office 2010 and installing Office 2013 (I prefer the look &amp; feel of Office 2010 so I use that one but that’s another story altogether) but the program still tries to find old .pst files and it
 won’t even open except to give me a dialog box to open a .pst file that no longer exists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have even tried installing a 3<sup>rd</sup> party email solution (Mozilla Thunderbird) which was OK and worked correctly but I missed that look and feel of Outlook which I’d used for years and was pissed I had to use a work around for
 a well known Microsoft product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point I am willing to lose all contacts and emails from the past just to get this running.&nbsp; Reimaging is not an option as IMHO it’s just too much too much hassle to get Outlook running again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Isn't &nbsp;there a way to just have Outlook open and build a new .pst file on its own?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My present situation?</p>
<p>I am on a Windows 7 HP machine (with 16GB RAM), and have all the latest Microsoft updates/fixes.&nbsp; Outlook starts but just gives me a dialog box to open a .pst file that no longer exists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help if you can but be gentle (err on the side of providing too much information vs. not enough).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

            <p>To get some of the simple things out of the way</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>#1 - Your information regarding the email accounts and associated data files is maintained in the Outlook profile which persists any uninstall/re-install which is why it would be looking for the same data files. To put this another way, whatever folders
 were created in those PST/OST files would remain. The way to get to the equivalent of a fresh install of Outlook would be to create a new profile.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>#2 - Not clear what state your machine is in (more specifically, which version of Outlook you have running at the moment or what all you have done to the registry) so with that said, assuming you have only one version of office installed, use the Control
 Panel Mail app to see what data files Outlook is looking for in the current profile. When 2 versions of Office are installed ('2013 and anything earlier - there would be two Mail apps showing in the control panel - one for '2013 and one for the older version.
 When '2013 is first installed, it migrates the profiles from the earlier version.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>#3 - Re: the strange behavior, don't have a definitive answer but does sound like something that could be caused by a 3rd party addin so that would certainly be something to check (i.e Anti-virus, Anti-Spam etc) and remove any to see if that resolves the
 issue</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>#4 - To get to your ultimate question - how to get things going</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- With item #3 in mind, create a new Outlook profile </p>
<p><br />
</p>

How to create a new profile in Microsoft Outlook<br />
<a href="http://www.slipstick.com/tutorials/profile/profile.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.slipstick.com/tutorials/profile/profile.htm</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- When creating the new profile, you have the option to use an existing PST file (if this involves a POP account) or creating a new one. To get a clean PST file, let Outlook create a new one but before writing off all your contacts and old email, try and
 find the PST file that contained the old data and open that file in Outlook (File --&gt; Open Data File .....) and copy the items you want from the respective folders to your new PST file. Once done, right-click on the root of the old PST file --&gt; Close.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If the strange behavior continues after creating a new profile, then the issue is most certainly something related to a 3rd party program that is still in play. You can check for this by running Outlook in Safe mode and see if the issue still occurs</p>

<h2>            Conventional Hard Drives refuse to spinup after sleeping without rebooting.</h2>
                    <p>I built this computer and had Windows 8.1. Previously, I have never experienced any problems with my secondary hard drive not working after waking from sleep. However now, if I walk away from it for 2 hours like I have the sleep set to and come back, all
 I get is I/O errors trying to read the hard drive. It doesn't spin up like it would in Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought perhaps the hard drive is failing. So using a Windows 8.1 bootable USB HDD, I tried several times over the last day to duplicate the results with 8.1. I've confirmed that 8.1 doesn't have the same issue as the technical preview.</p>

            9879 is abusing the PUIS setting, <br />
PUIS = Power Up In Standby, <br />
actually it's a bad name because to me I read that as disk remains powered up in Standby, Sleep or Suspend mode, but what it acutally means is the drive will not spin until a specific ATA / SCSI command is sent to complete the Power Up of the drive.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The original implementation was a SCSI only feature called Staged or Staggered Spin up<br />
and the intent of Staged / Staggered Spin up, and PUIS is for multi-disk systems where simultaneously powering up several HDDs at once might cause a PSU to drop the load or PSU failure due to too much current draw.
<br />

            <p>I wouldn't say Win 10 is "abusing the PUIS setting".&nbsp; Its just a bug, and it will be fixed shortly.&nbsp; Its a good idea for laptops, since there is no reason to spin up the drive when waking from sleep.&nbsp; It means longer battery life.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait until a read/write
 request is made, then spin it up.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it is not universal.&nbsp; It appears to be&nbsp;based on some combination of drive/BIOS/SATA controller settings.&nbsp; I have the drive in question in the 2 threads you&nbsp;mention (HGST 7200 RPM 1 TB), but I have no problems.&nbsp; However, my laptop is fairly new (has
 UEFI BIOS) and works OK.&nbsp; </p>

            waking from sleep or hibernate requires the drive be accessed immediately <br />
thus PUIS Is Useless for single&nbsp; drive systems, <br />
<br />
also PUIS was never intended for use on the System drive, <br />
even back in the old SCSI days you were instructed to not set the Staged / Staggered Spin up jumper on the drive(s) which contained the OS

                    Why does Outlook 2010 hide new emails forcing the user to scroll up to see if new emails have arrived?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Outlook 2010</div>
<div>Windows 7 Pro</div>
<div>All updates as of today (Jan 13, 2012)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Every since I started using Outlook 2010 more than a year ago, I find that it hides new incoming emails from view at the top of my inbox.</div>
<div>I have to scroll up to see them. in order to see if I have new email, I am constantly rolling my mouse wheel up in order to check... it's quite the frustration.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Prior versions of Outlook would automatically scroll the inbox as new messages arrived.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I read anecdotes of a "sort-of" solution that helps out with a single day, but it doesn't work universally and has to be repeated each day:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Scroll up and select the top message.</li><li>Right-click the scroll bar and choose "scroll here"</li></ul>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, when today's messages become "yesterday"'s after midnight, the auto-scrolling stops again.</div>

            I do sometimes view other folders, but the quick fix of right clicking on the scroll bar and choosing scroll here does not even work for me.

<h2>            Mailbox on-premise and online</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I read on the forum that : <em>"one user cannot have both an on-premise mailbox and an Office 365 mailbox at the same time. The mailbox is either in Exchange Online or on-premises".</em><br />
<br />
But can somebody explain me why?<br />
<br />
If they are synchronized, that means that the mailbox is sync on-premise and online? or not?<br />
<br />
<br />
e.g. when local AD is sync with office 365 AD the users are replicated. But this is not the rule for the mailbox , why?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
Cheers</p>

<p>Hi LuRe,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>Suppose an AD user already has an on-premise mailbox, and this user is synced to Office 365. DirSync service can detect that this user has on-premise Exchange attributes, so, DirSync service knows that this user already has an on-premise mailbox. Therefore,
 Exchange Online mailbox cannot be provisioned for this user.</p>
<p>If an AD user has no on-premise mailbox, it is just a normal AD user, after DirSync syncs this user to Office 365, we can create online mailbox for this user.</p>
<p>DirSync only syncs user objects to Office 365, and it does not sync mailbox or mailbox data. On-premise mailboxes (and mailbox data: email message, calendar, etc) need to be migrated to Office 365, via Office 365 migration tool. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One user cannot see emails or access mailbox on both locations (on-premise and cloud).</p>
<p>Anything unclear, I will further explain it.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Young</p>

<p>&nbsp;If you mean the People interface as " new outlook feature ", don't waste your time switching back to hotmail.</p>

<p>If you meant wanting to switch back using hotmail :</p>
<p>1. If you were being switched to outlook.com by Microsoft, you do not have the option to switch back to hotmai.</p>
<p>2. If you have renamed your account from @hotmail.com to @outlook.com, you do not have an option to switch back.</p>

<h2>            Cortana on iOS Reminders 5hrs Ahead of my Timezone</h2>
                    im sing Cortana on iOS 9.2 on an iPhone 6s Plus. My problem is that reminders I set for 7:20pm Central Standad time in the US get automatically set for 12:20am Central Standard time. I thought it may be my timezone settings on my pc which would be at fault
 but they are set to the proper to zone (Central Standard Time, US). Any ideas on how to fix?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It is unusual that the time set would change when you set up the reminder in Cortana. Just to make sure the time is set correctly in your computer, I would suggest you to try the steps below to sync the time with Windows time and check again.</p>
<p>1. Type "<strong>date and time</strong>" in the search bar and open it.</p>
<p>2. Click on "<strong>internet time</strong>" tab.</p>
<p>3. Click on "<strong>change settings</strong>".</p>
<p>4. Check "<strong>synchronize with an internet time server</strong>" </p>
<p>5. Under server, select <strong>time.windows.com </strong>from the drop down list.</p>
<p>6. Click on "<strong>update </strong><strong>now</strong>" and click <strong>ok</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Restart your computer and check if the issue persists. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also make sure&nbsp;the time zone is set correctly by following the steps below:</p>
<p>1. Press <strong>W</strong><strong>indows key + I</strong></p>
<p>2. Click on "<strong>time and language</strong>".&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Click on "<strong>date and time</strong>" </p>
<p>4. Choose the appropriate time zone from the drop down list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't help, try uninstalling and re-installing Cortana and check again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you are still facing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Is the location setting enabled in your phone? If not, turn it on.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Is&nbsp;the Speech and language set to US English?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you continue to face the issue after the necessary changes are made, ,&nbsp;I suggest you to uninstall and reinstall Cortana&nbsp;from iTunes Store</p>

            <p>This has fixed itself once I installed redstone build 14332. I suspect insider builds are causing conflicts with production ready Cortana installs.

            <p>you usually&nbsp;download the updates from within MSE.&nbsp; Are you anable to do that if so let us know what's going on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you can also download defnitions through windows updates and through the&nbsp; Microsoft Malware Protection Center's website.
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/definitions/howtomse.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/definitions/howtomse.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My guess is that you have a 32bit version of windows and have a 64 bit version of the defintions.&nbsp;if you wish to download from the website make sure you pick 32 bit if you have a 32 bit version of windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Before a commercial software program is released to the public, it usually goes through a "beta" phase. During this stage, the software is tested for bugs, crashes, errors, inconsistencies, and any other problems. Though beta versions of software used to
 be made available only to developers, they are now sometimes made available for the general public to test, usually through the software company's Web site. However, because beta software is free, the programs usually expire after a period of time. If you
 choose to test a beta software program, don't be surprised if it has multiple problems and causes your computer to repeatedly crash. After all, it is the beta version. You can tell if a program is still in beta by checking the program's properties. If there
 is a "b" in the version number (i.e. Version: 1.2 b3) that means it's a beta version."</p>

</p><p>"Properly designed web browsers (Internet Explorer is <strong>not</strong>) contain a<br />
private list of hashes (signatures) of the public keys of <strong>EV</strong>-authorized<br />
root certificates. ONLY server certificates which have been signed by<br />
one of the <strong>EV</strong>-authorized authorities will be shown as <strong>EV</strong>."</p>
<p>
</p><p>And here's what they say:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's difficult to understand how they (Microsoft) could have messed this up so badly. Especially when the correct behavior is so clear. And it's truly unfortunate, since so many people still rely upon Internet Explorer (IE) for their default web browsing.
 What's more, Microsoft has been putting a great deal of effort and resources into recent versions of IE in an attempt to rehabilitate its previously well-earned reputation as the worst, least secure, and most dangerous web browser for the Internet.</p>
<p>Somewhere within Microsoft, someone thought: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Ooooo! Wouldn't it be cool to be able to have corporate<br />
Intranet servers also show up as highly trusted extended<br />
validation servers . . . even though they are not!??”</p>
<p>
</p><p>And in making that possible, by allowing NON-EV certificates to appear as EV in Internet Explorer, they instantly rendered ALL of Internet Explorer's display of extended validation web sites completely meaningless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd759060.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a> page you can read that:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><strong>“</strong> The Extended Validation tab is used by administrators to add an Extended Validation (EV) certificate policy to root certificates that are distributed by Group Policy. Adding the EV certificate policy to root certificates and certificates
 issued to intranet Web sites provides a visual indicator that a site is trustworthy.&nbsp;<strong>”
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>They mean that everyone can use this feature incl. hackers to make a website appear like it has an EV certificate when it doesn't have such a certificate.</p>

<p>This is a peer-to-peer volunteer-based public worldwide forum.&nbsp; Although there are those with "Microsoft" tags next to their names, they are (AFAIK) 'contracted' by Microsoft - pretty much like call center employees (if not exactly.)</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>One will, on occasion, actually catch a true 'in the trenches' Microsoft employee here - but for the most part: contracted workers and volunteers - with the latter greatly outnumbering the former.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>So when you state something like, "So you really don't bother about this?" &lt;-- the "you" that you refer to here is your peers, not Microsoft.&nbsp; ;-)</p>

<h2>            MS Access Simultaneous Editing</h2>
                    I'm making an MS Access Database that needs to be edited by multiple users simultaneously without locking one out nor getting the data erased if one person got to the form first. Is this possible? I'm thinking of splitting the database and putting it on

            <p>SharePoint (Web Databases) are obsolete so I wouldn't go down that avenue.&nbsp; They have been replaced by Web Apps which use SQL Azure.&nbsp; Obviously, this depends on your IT setup, but I personally would not start using something that was drop so quickly by MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any, and every, multi-user database HAS to be split (BE - Tables, FE - Everything else).&nbsp; You place the BE in a central location accessible to all, relink your tables to this new location using UNC path and then distribute a copy of the FE to every user
 so they have a local copy of their own to run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for locking of records, this is a form property that the developer controls and sets up to suit his/her business needs.&nbsp; It can be set to now locks.&nbsp; Perhaps that would work for your scenario.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The main question is whether all the users are on the same LAN. If they are, there is no reason to use Sharepoint. You DO need to split the database between a back end (the tables) and a front end (everything else). The front end goes on the users local

            If users are attempting to edit the same record, there will be some issues with locking. However, a properly normalized table structure and division of responsibilities suggests this is rarely an issue.

            As Duane said, the only problem will be if they try to edit the same record at the same time. And even then it might not be an issue unless multiple people try to save changes at similar times. Access can handle some levels of multiple access. This will
 not lock users completely out, but may prevent them from editing the same records.

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>You have to decide on which is the appropriate locking strategy for your operational requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp; It really comes down to a choice between 'optimistic locking' and 'pessimistic locking'.&nbsp; These are set by means of the RecordLocks property of your data
 entry form.&nbsp; It goes without saying that data must only be entered/edited via a form, never in a table or query's raw datasheet view.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Optimistic locking: This involves setting the form's RecordLocks property to <em>
'No locks'</em>.&nbsp; If a user is editing a record, another user will be able to edit the same record simultaneously.&nbsp; If User A starts to edit a record, and User B edits and saves the same record before User A saves their edits, User A will be informed when they
 attempt to save their edits that another user has changed the record since they started editing it.&nbsp; User A will be given the opportunity to abandon their edits or overwrite User B's edits.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Pessimistic locking: This involves setting the form's RecordLocks property to
<em>'Edited Record'</em>&nbsp; If User A begins to edit a record all other users will not be able to edit that record until User A has saved their edits.&nbsp; Until then all other users opening the record in the form will see a 'no entry' symbol in the record selector
 on the form.&nbsp; All editable controls will be locked.&nbsp; In the past pessimistic locking was unpopular because Access did not support true record locking, only page locking, so it was possible for records other than that being currently edited to be locked unnecessarily.&nbsp;
 For a long time now Access has supported support true record locking, however, so pessimistic locking is feasible as users will still be able to edit any other record.<br />
<br />
Pessimistic locking does impose a modest additional burden on the locking engine, so if you don't anticipate two or more users editing one record simultaneously optimistic locking would be appropriate.&nbsp; In my own line of work, however, I've nearly always adopted
 a pessimistic locking strategy as, wearing my managerial hat, I would not want staff wasting time and money editing a record only to find that another user has simultaneously edited the same record.&nbsp; At the end of the day it's your judgement call which to
 use.<br />

    <title>Structuring Multiple eMail Accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> idc1001  say:</h3>
<h2>            Structuring Multiple eMail Accounts</h2>
                    <p>This has probably been asked and answered many times but I could not find a clear answer to my concerns, maybe because this is an issue that Outlook 2016 is notoriously poor at handling for Windows users (shame on you Microsoft!).&nbsp; It is my understanding
 that Outlook 2016 cannot combine IMAP email accounts.&nbsp; It is also my understanding that Forwarding emails as a means of combining email accounts can lead to 'lost' emails because spam/scam filters will stop an email not sent from the expected source (for example
 an Amazon email not received from an Amazon email address).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have multiple email accounts (Hotmail, BTinternet, gMail, Yahoo and own domains) and I want to bring all incoming mail into one account/archive folder structure that is accessible offline on my desktop and remotely offline on my phone/laptop.&nbsp; I want the
 offline/online to be syncronised with minimum effort and maximum consistency.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I can see to do it is to have all the accounts receive their incomings and by using a Rule have Outlook 2016 put them into a specific combined email account so everything is in one account in Outlook 2016 and that account sychronises it's full
 contents back to it's server with IMAP.&nbsp; Would that work or is there a better way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 'feeder' accounts would need some maintenance.&nbsp; If the 'feeder account' is attached to Outlook 2016 by IMAP would a rule moving/deleting the incoming email also delete the copy on the server?&nbsp; (I ask this because I'm not sure how such a rule would be
 actioned by Outlook 2016, if it intercepts an incoming before it reaches the account Inbox does the server get sent a delete instruction?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to 'hide' the feeder accounts in Outlook 2016 so that the Accounts pane on the left is uncluttered?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When replying to email would the reply address always be the same as the To address of the incoming email?</p>
<p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for your reply Roady.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know IMAP and that's what I thought but then read that Outlook on Macs can combine IMAP accounts!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also appreciate the Connected Accounts feature, that's just another way of saying POP everything to one account but that loses account separation.&nbsp; That's why I thought get it all through Outlook 2016 because then at least I can choose the sending account
 from Outlook 2016 but not if sending from Outlook.com.&nbsp; :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for "2" in your reply ... "Configure a mail server lever forwarder to one of your accounts" ... can you translate that into English please!&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway to make sure I've got this right you are suggesting ...</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I collect everything server side first and IMAP this to Outlook 2016 on my desktop.&nbsp; The actual Outlook.com account can be anything because it's just a conduit.&nbsp;
</li><li>When using Outlook.com I will be able to use any email address of a Connected Account as the sender.&nbsp;
</li><li>To be able to use any email address as the sender when using Outlook 2016 I should set up each account in Outlook 2016 as Send Only POP3 accounts which will not just enable this but also keep them out of the navigation pane.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Sounds perfect, thanks for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming I've got it right may I ask just one query.&nbsp; I've never used Outlook.com and my Office 365 account as the parent with Outlook 2016 effectively as the child, I've always looked upon my desktop Outlook 2016 as the parent driving Outlook.com as the
 child.&nbsp; I have my MSN/Office365 Hotmail.com email address ... how do I add a new/different Outlook/Hotmail address to that and use it as the principle address.&nbsp; It just seems it would be neater to use a completely new address for collecting all the inputs,
 one that doesn't have any incomings of it's own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>You're welcome! :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah, the Outlook for Mac has a Unified Mailbox feature which Outlook for Desktop unfortunately doesn't have (yet?).</p>
<p>You can vote for that feature here; <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows/suggestions/11693799-unified-inbox-for-outlook-2016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Unified Inbox for Outlook 2016</a></p>
<p>You can somewhat emulate it in Outlook for Desktop with relatively low effort, but is not as efficient as having the actual feature of course. See:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.msoutlook.info/question/unified-inbox-for-recent-unread-mail-items" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Unified
 Inbox folder for recent unread mail items</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The server level forwarding is explained in the link of point 2. This also makes sure that emails arrive almost instantly in Outlook.com as Connected Accounts are only guaranteed to look for new emails at those accounts once per hour. With an SMTP only Connected
 Account, you'd still be able to send as those accounts when using the Outlook.com website. Eventually, this should also work from within Outlook without Send Only POP3 accounts, but that is still a work in progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that your Outlook.com account should be configured as an Exchange account (which Outlook does by default as well). This makes sure that you can also sync your Contacts, Calendar and Tasks between computers and mobile devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also note that you can create rules in Outlook.com so that your emails will arrive in separate folders to still see the separation between accounts/addresses. As they are now stored within a single mailbox, you can create a Search Folder in Outlook so you
 can still get them all in 1 view if needed. A similar technique is discusses here;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.msoutlook.info/question/122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Today’s Unread Mail folder</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for starting with a new Outlook.com account; That's your pick. If you currently receive just spam on your address, then you can indeed better add a new alias and drop your current one. You can do that via your Profile page;&nbsp;<a href="https://account.live.com/names/Manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/names/Manage</a></p>

<p>Roady, unfortunately my main account "@btinternet.com" doesn't have a forwarding facility, they removed a while ago claiming it had become a security issue so can't use forwarding to push incomings to a combination account which reverts me back to Outlook.com
 pulling once per hour or bringing that account to Outlook 2016 and using a rule (but then I won't be able to use Outlook.com to send from that address.&nbsp; :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>How about I both IMAP it to Outlook 2016 and then use a rule to put the emails into the combination account and connect it to Outlook.com so that Outlook.com can send emails from that address?&nbsp; If Outlook 2016 uses IMAP to delete the incoming from the server
 then no duplication!&nbsp; Am I moving in the right direction?</p>

<p>In that case, you could consider connecting to that account in Outlook via POP3 and set the delivery location to a folder in your Outlook.com account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, on the Outlook.com website, you can configure that account as a Send Only (SMTP) Connected Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the downside of that is that you won't receive those emails on Outlook.com when Outlook isn't running. This could affect your mobile strategy.</p>

</p><p>Hi</p>

</p><p>Since Yesterday, My IE11 Doesn't download anything from internet.</p>
<p>I cannot open Download list(is this right?) either.</p>
<p>Every Downloads were worked OK at chrome, and in IE, i can connect to that links either, but i can't see any message about download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've patched UXTheme.dll file, and it gave me reboot loop(but i fixed it), and moved user folders to another drive by changing registry.</p>
<p>can it cause download problems?</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />A repair may help.
<br />
<br />First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />If it does not, as a workaround, try using Word Online. It has fewer features and may not be sufficient to meet your needs, but it may be what you need right now.
<br /><a href="https://office.live.com/start/Word.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office.live.com/start/Word.aspx</a>

<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.

<h2>            Excel 2007 Math Error</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>For some reason Excel is not calculating correctly.&nbsp; I am trying to muliply a particular amount of dollars by 2000, using the formula ie. (M2*2000), and it gives me the incorrect answer.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<p>$15.83*2000 = 31659 (when it should be 31660)</p>
<p>$14.35*2000 = 28691 (when it should be 28700)</p>
<p>I read online that Excel 2007 has a math glitch...how can I fix this error so I dont have to do the math by hand for each amount?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p><br />
How are these dollar figures derived, do you enter then ot are they the result of formula?</p>
<p>Excel doesn't have a math glitch and what i suspect your reading online is about Excel adhering (nearly) to IEEE 754&nbsp; which is the standard adopted by most platforms for dealing with computers carrying out floating point arithmatic.</p>
<p>Most computers adopt this system and one consequence is that when the pc stores a decimal number there is often no precise binary equivalent. When some people read this they recoil in horror but you need to remember that this isn't limited to decimal and
 binary, there is no precise decimal equivalent of the fraction 1/3, when converted it ends up as 0.333 recurring.</p>
<p>have a look here</p>

<h2>            How can I change the ribbon in Outlook&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Every so often when I go to&nbsp;Save&nbsp;&amp; Close&nbsp;a contact in OL 2010&nbsp;I accidentally hit Delete by mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp;OL does not offer a chance to reconsider the mistake and suddenly a Contact is gone, along with any information stored there.&nbsp; If I am in a hurry I may not
 realize the Contact was wiped out until I look for him or her a few days or weeks later and wonder where the *** it went.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm looking for a simple fix.&nbsp; I want to put some distance between Save &amp; Close and Delete.&nbsp; That way I think I'll be less likely to
 accidentally delete a contact.&nbsp; Is there a way to do that?&nbsp; </p>

            Thanks!&nbsp; I figured it out with your help.&nbsp; I opened a Contact, clicked on Customize the Ribbon, created a custom group, moved the Delete command into it, renamed it and saved it.&nbsp; Then I created another custom group, moved several of the "Actions" commands
 in there, renamed it and saved it.&nbsp; Then I removed Microsoft's "Actions" group.&nbsp; Now there is a lot of space on the ribbon between the Save and Delete commands.&nbsp; Hopefully, no more accidental deletions!&nbsp;

<p>I am having the same problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically, since upgraded from Office 2007 to 2010 (actually a clean install), all my incoming Plain Text mail is displayed with 12 pt after paragraph spacing rather than zero.&nbsp;&nbsp; What's interesting is that this is true even
 for older mail messages that I recieved before my upgrade, so it's definitely a display format change and has nothing to do with the actual email contents.</p>
<p>I have been able to change the display fonts using Options:Mail:Signatures and Stationery:Composing and reading plain text messages:Fonts dialog, however, I have as yet been unable to locate a way to adjust the paragraph spacing for reading plain text messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 This is the setting that we are looking for.&nbsp;&nbsp; Does anyone know where it is?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>tom</p>

<p><br />
You need to change the spacing on the Normal style, but it only applies to messages you send, not to messages others send you. Plian text messages should not be affected unless they are getting converted to html.</p>
