    <title>N8 Bluetooth A2DP Disable&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            N8 Bluetooth A2DP Disable&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have an N8 which I connect to my car using BT HFP / PBAP, this works well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have installed an app called Road Pilot Mobile ( GPS system which warns of speed cameras) which outputs a visual and audible warning when approaching a speed camera site.&nbsp; If BT is switched off the audio warning is made over the phone speaker, if BT is
 enabled the phone tries to route the audio to the car system using BT A2DP. This fails as the car doesn’t support A2DP and therefore &nbsp;I get no audible warning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to have BT enabled so I can use the car’s hands free capability but would like to disable A2DP on the phone so that I get audible speed&nbsp;camera warnings.&nbsp; Is this possible?</p>

<p>Welcome to the forum!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately although N8 is Bluetooth 3 it currently is less well featured than say 5800XM which at least can maintain two Bluetooth connections both "hands-free" profile and "music player".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reputedly there were some issues with N8 Bluetooth stack and some pre-release firmware had more versatility than that currently released, so hopefully it is a case of work in progress with improvment in due course but don't hold your breath.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; Contacted Nokia who tried to fob me off with reply that it's all the fault of the app provider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem with that response is that&nbsp; exactly the same issue exists with their own music player on the N8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd probably be happy to accept a response that acknowledged a problem even if there was no soln is sight, but I do find the attempt to pass the problem off to a third party somewhat irritating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This must be a common issue as many car systems only support HFP and not A2DP.</p>

<p>No, still the same. Probably too much work to implement this. Having said that, on other Symbian phones this was implemented: Sony Ericsson's UIQ3 phones (setting: Enable as audio - when switched off, a headset would connect using handsfree or headset profile).
 And as I recall, UIQ was handed over to the Symbian Foundation. I guess Nokia just threw all that source away.&nbsp;:smileymad:</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi Loriann,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>An offline address book contains a snapshot of information from the Global Address List (GAL). If Outlook is left running constantly in Cached Exchange Mode, it automatically updates the offline address book one time per day (about 24 hours)
 depending on updates on the computer that is running Exchange. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>It is not feasible to turn it off for the entire organization because whenever there are new updates from user information in the GAL, this information will not be updated (after 24 hours) to the snapshot copy in your Outlook client via Offline
 Address Book. For example, names, e-mail addresses, titles, and office locations. You will not see if a new member has joined or has left your department by Distribution list, if a member has been promoted with another title, if an office location of a user
 has changed, etc.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You can prevent users from downloading the Offline Address Book without disabling Cached Exchange Mode by modifying the Windows registry, Please refer to this
</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/921927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">article</span></a><span>. Make sure you have backed up the registry before modifying it.</span></span></p>

<p>Do you have any earlier version of the Nokia Suite installed ? If so, un-install that and then try re-installing the New verion.</p>
<p>You may also try the latest Beta version from&nbsp;<a href="http://betalabs.nokia.com/trials/nokia-suite-beta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>&nbsp;...To download the installer, you need to log-in using the SAME credentials that you use on this Forum.</p>

<h2>            OAB download errors 0x80190197 or 0x8019194</h2>
                    
<p>Today I discovered that some users weren't seeing updates to the OAB that were made last week. &nbsp;Upon further investigation I see that they cannot manually download the OAB either. &nbsp;The errors seen in Outlook 2013 are&nbsp;0x80190197 or 0x8019194. &nbsp;We use a Cisco
 web security proxy but I've tested with and without that and found no change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I've searched diligently for solutions but haven't found anything that has any effect.</p>
<p>When I load the OAB.xml in a browser I receive a login prompt that I cannot seem to access correctly, despite 100% certainty of the credentials. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This does not affect all users but so far I don't have a clear understanding of who it does or does not affect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for any suggestions!</p>

<p>Hi joshg.rackercenters.org,</p>
<p>To troubleshoot the issue, I would like to collect the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Let us know the differences between these problematic users and other users who you know work fine with OAB.
</li><li>If changing the environment like at home, are there any improvements? </li><li>Let us know your detailed Outlook version. </li></ol>
<p>It is recommended that you <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-an-Outlook-profile-f544c1ba-3352-4b3b-be0b-8d42a540459d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
create a new Outlook profile</a> and then add another Exchange account which works fine in it. Vice versa, in another PC which works fine, create a new Outlook profile and then add your own account in it. Check whether the issue occurs to both these two Outlook
 clients.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Outlook 15.0.4753.1002. &nbsp;I opened a ticket with support and found the BITS UseLMCompat registry key set to 0 works for some users.</p>
<p>I still have at least one problematic user. &nbsp;In addition to the failure to download the OAB, this user cannot modify distribution groups from Outlook. &nbsp;They can modify them in OWA. &nbsp;In Outlook they receive a message that states simply "Changes to the public
 group membership cannot be saved. &nbsp;The operation failed.". &nbsp; This error persists through rebuilding the outlook profile, as well as a repair install of office 2013.</p>

<p>
</p><p>3. Ran the batch file as admin. </p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Then on my computer - Control Panel\System and Security\Windows Update - downloaded and installed updates.

<p>

    <title>can&#39;t see a picture in one message on Hotmail anymore - has now - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greg lang 01  say:</h3>
<h2>            can&#39;t see a picture in one message on Hotmail anymore - has now disappeared</h2>
                    <p>I just discovered that I can't view one embedded picture in a Hotmail account. The last two e-mails sent to me by two people - one of them the same sender - show multiple, embedded, pictures OK. But in this one, I now just get nothing but a blank e-mail
 besides the message - including on Reply (see below). I was able to view it for awhile OK at first - but it seems to have "disappeared" recently. I didn't try to Save it before.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This e-mail will display TWO boxes - instead of only ONE picture - ONLY on Forward - but NOT on Reply. I get a generic background scene (mountain) with "photo.JPG" in one box; and a solid gray background, with white paper document image, with "ATT00001"
 (probably a file #) in another box. Then when I left or right click on either, it asks me if I want to remove them. So there is still some sort of image file registering - but I can't get it to display the actual picture, even when I do Forward. I can't Save
 it either. NO red "X"s nor "broken picture" icons.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We just installed online updates for Windows 7 Home Premium on this computer. This was after I got this most recent picture - but the other previous pictures are OK. This same problem happens on both Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer. Could it be some
 sort of corrupted cached file somewhere on our computer? Can it be fixed so that the picture is properly displayed? If so, how do we do it? Thanks.<br />

            <p>My friend's computer uses Mozilla Firefox set as the default browser. Internet Explorer is the installed backup. Microsoft products are so oriented towards others by the same company, that they won't even tell me what the default browser is, if it's a non-Microsoft
 product.&nbsp; &gt;:-(&nbsp; Internet Explorer continues to be be slow, problematic, and essentially worthless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am waiting for the opportunity to use another friend's computer - he works shift work, so it's a matter of getting him at the right time. As I stated before, with the computer I'm currently using, only the ONE image in the ONE e-mail, shows in neither
 browser, Internet Explorer nor Mozilla Firefox. I still don't know why this is.</p>

            <p>I've been waiting for another reply first. The same problem is happening on another friend's computer. So it looks like optimizing my browser is redundant. It would have had to be for Firefox Mozilla, not Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see where tracing the ISP might help. The problem does look like it's in the individual e-mail. I did receive it, intact though - the problem is that original, embedded, picture simply disappeared sometime recently, before I could save it, in my own
 files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will PM you back right now, about the above in regard to this issue. Thanks.</p>

            <p>I have finally fixed this problem. Rather, I have found the source and cause of it. First, I want to reply to your request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re tracing the ISP info. I did receive the e-mail intact, and was able to view the picture originally. The "View Message Source" data says "PASS", and there are no error codes. It also verifies that an "image/jpeg" was embedded as "photo.JPG".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did finally get the "missing" picture showing again. When I went into "Actions", I clicked on "Show Message History" - but this appears to pertain to Chat History - irrelevant to actual e-mails; according to the MS Community forum. At that time, I seem
 to have somehow also clicked on the caret to the right of "Outlook.com Active View" - which I only found the significance of out later, when I was checking the status of embedded pictures in other e-mail messages on the same Hotmail account. Therefore, I have
 to conclude that I accidentally clicked on the caret - which would have to be for viewing pictures in individual e-mails - after I last viewed the picture in question. I didn't really know what any of this was about, as I've never seen any info on it. Hasn't
 anybody else ever had what was at first a frustrating, perplexing problem of this type?</p>

            <p>I've got the problem fixed - somewhat. However, I'm now not completely certain how I accomplished it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I mean by "caret" is also a "v" that becomes inverted back and forth when you click on it. These are just a reversible arrow. It's by Active View, which just tells you how to turn that so-named feature on and off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I clicked on "Show Message History" in another e-mail in this same account, with embedded pictures - and it turned it showing the pictures on and off - they became hidden instead of displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I also got chat references listed with respect to Outlook when going onto Google, I'm wondering what Show Message History is really supposed to be? That doesn't turn up; nor is it obvious; nor is it explained.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It now appears that I actually clicked on this to show the picture that had been hidden in the problem e-mail that I had described. Furthermore, I have now found out, that when I open the account and this same e-mail, that the embedded picture has become
 hidden again. While I can make it display again, this is obviously a nuisance. It wasn't doing this originally. It's also apparent that I've only partly solved the problem. What is really going on here and why is this weird phenomena happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very frustrated and I want to get to the bottom of this odd problem. Thanks.</p>

<p>I can get screenshots all right. However, I can't PM them. When I try, according to the message I get in the PM area, ONE screenshot alone, takes up @ TEN times the "character numbers" of the allowable amount (2,700,000+ vs the 60,000 maximum). I have no
 idea how many MB one screenshot is - more than the 100 MB maximum obviously; probably @ 1,000.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what do I do now? I am more frustrated....</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Grey Out Attachment</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>We are having a series of problem where more users are seeing that emails' attachments are grey out hence unable to download, reply or forward the emails.
</p>
<p>Outlook version: 15.19.1 (160212)<br />
Mac OSX: 10.10.5 / 10.11.3</p>
<p>Is there any fix or patch coming from Microsoft to deal with this?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>kin o.s on windows mobile devices - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roman david desilva  say:</h3>
<h2>            kin o.s on windows mobile devices</h2>
                    
<p><span>Re-Birth of the Kin.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I'm a ferverant believer in that there are no failures or mistakes. Just learning experiences. The Kin may have been a market flop but theres
 a lot to learn from why it didn't take off. Chief among the reasons is verizon. The Kin wasn't a smart phone. It had no apps. It was primarily a messaging &amp; social networking phone. So why is it to have a kin i needed a data plan that cost $30 not including
 text &amp; talk. An $80 phone plan for a phone that is limited compared to the htc hd2 or htc imagio. MSFT shouldv'e made the Kin a gsm phone right of the bat &amp; stuck with t-mobile. The carrier that also carried the sidekick which is made by danger. Makers of
 the kin. Or have made it available to metro pcs &amp; virgin mobile as a pre paid phone. Which is majority of market.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But anyone could be a monday morning quarterback. However once verizon said that their going to price the kins plan as if it were a smart
 phone, MSFT should released an update to allow Zune apps &amp; port some windows mobile apps to it. But the kin had a lot of cool features. I was 1 of the furst people to criticise the kin. &amp; i saw some the cool features right off the bat. These features need
 to be ported to windows phone 7 prior to launch.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li><span>Kin Studio: never having to worry about available space on a phone is a god send. I currently use windows live mobile &amp; MyPhone to back up my phone. Their very cool
 but kin studio rocked on a whole new level. Kin studio needs to become live studio. All the best of windows live mobile and MyPhone put into kin studio. Total phone backup. Viewing all my phones stuff online is great because it means that if my phone is stolen
 or lost i can getmy data back. Make it so that the zune software syncs all my data from the studio to my pc and vise versa &amp; that would be 31 flavors of awesome. That way i can access my pictures, video, contacts &amp; messages on my phone, pc or in the cloud.</span>
</li><li><span>Kin spot was an amazing feature. In windows phone 7 this should be seen where ever we experience media. Pictures, video, websites, music, Etc... Call it live spot.
 Where ever you are in windows phone 7 that is not the main screen, apps or settings, there you will find the spot.</span></li></ol>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>MSFT was right. There is a market for the kin. They were right on who that market it. But the approach was wrong. Rebrand Kin as zune phone &amp; keep it in the u.s. Much
 like the original Zune the kin needs some time to mature. New better looking handsets &amp; apps &amp; it'll become a device with a cult like following. Like the Zune is now</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For now MSFT the best idea i've got for what to do with kin is this. You've lost money on windows mobile 6.5 because everyone knows that is obselite &amp; their currently
 waiting for windows phone 7. You've lost money on the purchase of danger. Combine these 2 sales loses to make a sales winner. Kins o.s is a hybrid of both windows mobile 6.5 and windows phone 7. I bought a HTC HD2. Lots of people got an htc imagio. Fix the
 kin o.s so that it does what it does now. But allow it to run windows mobile apps in a seperate enviroment. Then Push it out as an update to Windows mobile (call it windows mobile 6.9). It will make everyone who bought windows mobile 6.5 handsets want to stay
 with windows mobile when their contract expires. It will show that you plan on maintaining the windows mobile platform. And it makes kin look like less of a failure. Its in MSFT's best interest as this would boost zune's market share. Frankly i'm love to get
 rid of windows mobile device center. I want to use the kin studio. My phone (htc hd2) would make an excellent Zune. Please make this happen. I think you owe it to all of us who have windows mobile 6.5 devices thinking it would be upgradeable.</span></p>

            I was talked into buying a kin for my entire family this week by Verizon- yes I know it is several months since you made this post.&nbsp; We were out of the loop only realized we had seen the commercials for the device after we had pulled phones out of the
 box, I had an old moto Q and the rest of my family had Envy phones.&nbsp; So we bought 5 of these without knowing what it was.&nbsp; We were told they are smart phones without needing a data plan.&nbsp; I like it, we all like the way it has been updated to be more of a Zune
 phone.&nbsp; We love the wifi support which is all we really needed.&nbsp; It would be a bit nicer if it supported ebooks/text file downloads.&nbsp; It seems you are one update short left to make this phone a winner for the average user who isn't excited about a 30-60 dollar
 a month per phone data plan.&nbsp; It allows some uploading to Microsoft gallery- it at least recognizes the phone.&nbsp; A simple text reader is about the only thing we need from this phone and the ab

<p>
</p><p>I heard awhile ago about the cross-platform gaming capability that Windows 10 will offer, and I have a couple questions about it. Which games will be supported for cross platform? Will I be able to play with users on the Xbox 360, or only the Xbox One? If
 I play a game on my PC through Xbox Live, will my saves synch across platforms? And if I already have a game on my PC (say, through Steam or Origin) will Xbox recognize that game and allow me to play it on my Xbox Live account?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Why is the trial version of MS Project disabled&#63; Is there a way to enable the &#91;Save&#93;, &#91;Copy&#93;, etc. features&#63;</h2>
                    This morning I downloaded the trial version of MS Project, which is being used in a course that I'm taking. According to all the information that I've read, both within the software and on MS' website, this software was supposed to be fully functional,
 and would be disabled after the expiration date of the trial software (April 30th in this case).<br />
<br />
I have created quite a bit of work, and find that I'm unable to save any of it which prevents me from doing any cumulative coursework.
<br />
<br />
I contacted MS directly however they are unable to provide any support for trial versions, including answering questions about the trial version being disabled.<br />
<br />
A) Why are these features disabled?<br />
B) Can they at least be enabled for the duration of the trial version as I'd expected?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any assistance.<br />
Red.

            It sounds like you did not activate the product.&nbsp; Was there ever a time when you could save the files?<br />
Look for an activation e-mail from Microsoft.&nbsp; You can always download again using a different e-mail address and then use that key (assuming the version you have has never been activated).<br />
<br />
<br />
Also try&nbsp; on the menu Help/Activate...<br />
<br />
See if that helps

<h2>            How to Delete individual student comments in Teams</h2>
                    I am trying to delete my student's comments on the General Conversation page of my Teams site. I am the Owner, the students are Members. From searching online it looks like I should be able to click on the ... next to each comment and "delete" but this
 option is not popping up (there are 5 other options such as Mute the student, but not delete and edit) I can only delete or edit my own comments. Even if I mute them, it doesn't look like that deletes their past statements, so right now this is a real problem
 and I might just have to delete the entire Team

            <p>Almost certainly the recipient has a different printer driver than you do. Word relies on the current printer driver for character width/spacing information, so a different driver can lead to different line breaks, and sometimes to different page breaks.
 See <a href="http://www.word.mvps.org/FAQs/Formatting/TextReflow.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.word.mvps.org/FAQs/Formatting/TextReflow.htm</a> for more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If exact reproduction of page layout on different computers is important, export the Word document to PDF and send that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the change in layout is acceptable but the TOC has the wrong page numbers, then the recipient needs to right-click the TOC and choose to update it.</p>

            <div>There is no converter to allow Word 97 to read a Word 2007 .docx document, so I assume you must be sending the document in .doc format. This in itself might result in some slight difference, but the main problem will probably be a difference in printers;

<p>Hi, don't have X6 but think your short cuts are limited, check settings, for appearance. You could as a workaround try installing Opera Mini and Snaptu, which will give you a lot of 'instant access' isf you set them to shortcuts :smileywink:</p>

                    <p>I have an @live.com.au email account that isn't working properly with neither my pc, laptop or phone's outlook program/app. It doesn't connect properly most of the time and I have to use the website version to check. I'm using office 365. When I open outlook,
 it initially says connected and all folders are up to date but when I press something like "send/recieve email" it updates some and then disconnects from the server.&nbsp;Whenever I try to repair it from outlook it says it can't connect to the network, when I try
 to sync on my phone it sometimes doesn't do it and says "Last synced at xx:xx". I have an @hotmail.com email that isn't affected by this.<br />

This all happened randomly a few days ago and I haven't been able to fix it.</p>

                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Excel 2010&nbsp;in Windows 10. The keyboard shortcut CTRL and left Arrow does not work for moving to end of a column. Nothing happens when I select this keyboard combination.&nbsp;It was working before I upgraded the Windows to 10, and&nbsp;CTRL + other Arrows
 are still working fine (i.e. Right, Up and Down are all working fine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know why CTRL and left Arrow does not work for moving to end of column?</p>

</p><p>Below post pointed to keyboard shortcut conflict but the solution is&nbsp;for Mac OS:</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply, really appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I also have the issue that <em>when I click Start Button nothing happen</em>, I searched for help and got the fix before I shut down the computer yesterday.&nbsp;Now seeing your reply and I tried the Excel again, it's all working fine now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it's working fine now, I have to assume, in my case, the issue is related to the DWORD (32-bit) value&nbsp;is&nbsp;missing in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced\.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has the same issue as me, including the start button not working, you can try below as it works for me:</p>

    <title>Dollar Signs Appearing in Sum Formulas in Excel - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Dollar Signs Appearing in Sum Formulas in Excel</h2>
                    In my Excel Workbook, a dollar sign has started appearing in the formula given (in the line at the top) for all sums on a series of sheets. E.g., where it previously said =SUM(C1:C50), it now says =SUM(C$1:C$50). Where another cell has a value derived
 from from one of these Sum cells, it does it there too. E.g., if cell C51 is a Sum cell, it will say, e.g., = C$51*7. I have "Saved As" the file a few times since I started it. Maybe this creates errors. Or is there another explanation? And is the file now
 corrupted and liable to cause more errors even if I stop doing "Save As"?

            <p>Dollar sign $ is used in a formula to make cell reference Absolute. By default when you apply formula, it is consider as relative reference, hence no dollar sign. But sometimes we need to make our reference fixed which may absolute or mixed. In case of Absolute
 reference we use 2 dollar sign, one for row and another for column while in case of mix reference either of one is used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This dollar sign can be applied either manually or by pressing function key F4 while you are in edit mode and selected the relevant portion of formula.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think that dollar will be applied automatically, may be you put it by mistake by pressing F4 key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now in case you want to get rid of it, then either remove it manually if there are few ones and known or you may do Find and Replace where in Find box put a dollar sign and keep Replace box blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may replace one by one or Replace All as per your need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 attachment blocked - notify recipient</h2>
                    
<p>hy. &nbsp;i can block the unwanted attachments and notify the recipient with a text.
<strong>is it possible to include some information, for example, who was the mail sent from</strong>?&nbsp;<br />
right now the sender will get a reply, that the attachment has been blocked and &nbsp;recipient can get a predefined message from microsoft outlook, but i would like the recipient to know, who the message was sent from (and maybe some other usefull options), so
 they can decide better, if this is something they would like to pursue or not. &nbsp;later on i would like to remove the notification for the sender and only notify the recipient.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Anton</p>
<p><em>Is it possible to include some information, for example, who was the mail sent from?</em> The answer is no.</p>
<p>I understand that you created a transport rule with the action “Reject the message with the explanation”. It means the entire email will be rejected on the Office 365 server side. It’s not feasible to notify the recipient with the information in the original
 email or give some other options. But we can add an action “Generate incident report and send it to” to send a report with some information of the message to specified users.</p>
<p>In addition, if you think these features are very important and Microsoft should include them, we welcome and encourage you to share your ideas through:

<p>
</p><p>The fields displayed in the Outlook AddressBook cannot be modified. There are also one two sort options for the AB (&lt;First Last&gt; and &lt;FileAs&gt;) fields.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the question about "Could you help me with the "People" tab - those are the options when you have a new email message option so not at all clear as to what you're asking about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're asking about how to sort a contact folder (which is not the same thing as the Address Book) - then</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - Open a contact folder</p>
<p>2 - Click on &lt;View&gt; in the menu/tab bar</p>
<p>3 - Click on &lt;View Settings&gt; and change the desired settings for the view including columns displayed, sort order etc</p>

<h2>            how will windows insiders be receiving their free windows 10 pro product keys</h2>
                    I have a&nbsp;IBM/Lenovo T60 with ATI x1400 graphics and while I cannot upgrade due to the fact that Microsoft seems to think the graphics card is not compatible with Win 10, which is so not the case as I am running build 10240 (inactivated)&nbsp; and it works perfectly
 with the same driver I used for Win 8.1&nbsp;so <strong>I would like to know when and how Windows Insiders will be receiving their product keys</strong> so I can activate it.&nbsp;<strong>Would hope by now someone at Microsoft would give a straight answer to this question
 for every Insider once and for all.</strong>

            I have a qualifying OS, windows 8.1 Pro, that is active, but as I stated earlier I have ATI X1400&nbsp;graphics that according to whoever decides these things that it is not compatible, but it is and works perfectly, so I cannot go the normal route of reserving
 a free upgrade but I did download it from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a>&nbsp;as you suggested and&nbsp;installed it.&nbsp; A day later and it still is not activated.&nbsp; So back to my original question which no one seems to be able to get an answer to,
<strong>when&nbsp;and how will I receive my windows Insider&nbsp;product key so I can activate it?</strong>

            Be patient. It is taking some time for some folks to get activated. You will not receive a product. Activation is done by Microsoft's servers.

            <p>There is no "windows Insider product key." &nbsp;Everybody has the same key. &nbsp;Not just the Insiders but everybody who also upgrades from Windows 7 and 8. &nbsp;The product key is embedded by the upgrade installer and is the same as the product key in Build 10240.
 &nbsp;The activation problem is probably not due to the key. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you try to activate does the wizard ask for a key? &nbsp;This is the key we all have for Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T</p>
<p>
</p><p>That key is only good on a device already registered as a Windows 10 device and will not work for a clean install on a device that hasn't already been upgraded from W7 or W8 at least once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you resolve the graphics card issue. &nbsp;I did on my oldest computer by replacing the adaptor. &nbsp;You will get graphics, but when you check the Device Manager you will see that Windows isn't using the card's driver. &nbsp;It is using the Microsoft generic
 drivers. &nbsp;That means the some of the graphics processing is done in the cpu. &nbsp;That is a big hit on performance.</p>

            <p>As you can see below&nbsp;I don't have a graphics problem.&nbsp; It's Microsoft that seems to think that the ATI X1400 is not compatible but it works perfectly as it did with Vista and 8.1 and as anyone can see at 1680x 1050 (Recommended) &nbsp;resolution.&nbsp; Print Screen
 and paste into paint.&nbsp; Seems crystal clear to me.</p>

            <p>Hi Waseemulla</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like there is a deaf ear being used by Microsoft, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of us never had a qualifying OS to start with, it was not a requirement. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My first install, back in 2014, was straight onto a cleaned formatted disk. it never had windows on it, it was a spare machine for testing and in this case it was Linux.</p>
<p>
</p><p>now we come to the end of the line and all Microsoft is shouting about is qualifying systems, that was not the agreement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are we going to get a key/full system&nbsp;as was agreed? or are you going to send me a qualifying system so I can get an activation of 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have waited for over a week to get an activation and still nothing and I have a horrible feeling that hell will freeze over before I do.</p>

            <p>According to what I read from Microsoft, the base has to be a qualifying version of Windows, 7 or 8, in order to get the free upgrade. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may not have been a requirement to install the first Preview that it be an upgrade over a qualifying OS, but apparently it is a requirement for receiving the free Windows 10 offer via product key permanent activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you clean installed the Insider then the Insider never had a qualifying product key to capture. &nbsp;Those who upgraded a copy of 7 or 8 to the Preview and are now on Build 10240 are permanently activated. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what was on the computer before you clean installed the Preview but you may have to put it back and activate it. &nbsp;Then you can use the media creation tool discussed in other posts to do the upgrade. &nbsp;That will get your computer registered as
 a Windows 10 device and you won't have this hassle anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may turn out that it will take less time and hassle just to do it that way than to continue to "fight the system." &nbsp;What Microsoft "woulda, coulda, shoulda" be doing isn't helping you get it done.</p>

            <p>Windows10 does not use "keys" the same way as Win7/Win8 did.&nbsp; Rather than having the old-style 25 digit key, Win10 assigns a license to a microsoft account and that's it.&nbsp; Much simpler and no more codes to remember or possibly lose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your machine needed to be activated on a previous Insider build using the pre-release key for the license to be assigned to the account.&nbsp; If your machine wasn't activated, no key was assigned.</p>

            There were many recommendations by MS personnel on here to run Win 10 insider preview in Virtual Box. That's fine. Now I have an activated Win 10 in Virtual box but want to move it to a hard disk, or&nbsp; I would like to clean install it and use my insider
 account for the activation. What should I do to get this on a hard disk and activated?<br />

            <p>From a licensing standpoint that should not work. &nbsp;The hardware profile of the vm is different from that of the host. &nbsp;Imaging the virtual harddrive and transferring to the host harddrive (V2P) will work, but as soon as the computer starts and builds the
 device table Windows will trigger the activation wizard and your product key won't work because the host computer is not registered as a Windows 10 device. &nbsp;If the issue is the vm is running Pro and the host is running a Home version of an OS then I see where
 you're going with this. &nbsp;However, you won't get there with V2P because of the licensing. &nbsp;You didn't say what the host is running now, but if it is 7 or 8 simply upgrade to 10. &nbsp;That will register the host as a Windows 10 device. &nbsp;By the time you reach that
 point, of course, you have Windows 10 for free already and you might as well continue to run the vm in the Insider Program. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you researched to see if VirtualBox is ready to run on a Windows 10 host? &nbsp;That it runs a Windows 10 guest does not guarantee that VB the program is ready to run
<strong>on </strong>Windows 10.</p>
