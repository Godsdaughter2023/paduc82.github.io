<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to make this message go away, fix it or whatever.&nbsp; The Notebook address is showing up "CORRECTLY" in my Documents\OneNote notebooks folder within the Onedrive folder -- but when I click on the error message (like it says), it relocates
 the folder to some hyperlink address (like<span>&nbsp;"</span><em><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/self.aspx?resid=AAAF2E62562C6E59%211161&amp;id=documents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/self.aspx?resid=AAAF2E62562C6E59%211161&amp;id=documents</a>").</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp; In the first place, I don't understand why the error appears.&nbsp; I am using OneNote 2016 out of Office 365 (Windows 10) and I don't know why another program would be syncing with this Notebook (or the files in the Notebook).&nbsp; Why is OneNote saying that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp; Why is the Notebook relocated when I "Click here".&nbsp; It is "in/on" my PC where I want it, so why is it located to some cloud (I assume), and I can't get it back into my Onedrive folder although through the linkage magic, File Explorer seems to think (display)
 it is there in my Onedrive folder, but OneNote File&gt;Info identifies the file location as a hyperlink address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is happening with NEW Notebooks that I am creating, as well as re-locating (has already relocated) some of my old Notebooks.</p>

<p>Your fault is to place your <strong>OneNote notebooks folder</strong> within your computers
<strong>OneDrive folder</strong>.</p>
<p>This is the local mirror of the OneDrive cloud and confuses OneNote creating the mentioned messages.</p>
<p>The right place is in the standard <strong>Documents </strong>folder under your user account, technically</p>
<p>seen: under C:\Users\<strong>&lt;user&gt;</strong>\Documents\</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks you very much for your response.&nbsp; I have spend countless hours over the past 2 days trying to figure out what is going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the location of OneNote, I guess it got into the OneDrive folder because when I set things up initially to use Onedrive, I did so by Moving my entire Documents folder from the xxx\Users\Documents location into the Onedrive folder, which I thought
 was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Let me pause here and say I am on a new computer (lost the hard drive, crashed, on the old system), but had "not" been using Onedrive because I had been experimenting with Onedrive a couple of years ago and did not have anything in the Onedrive folder on
 the old system, but luckily had Documents backed up on Carbonite.&nbsp; Anyway, I wanted to catch up and move into the real world and start having everything backed up on Onedrive -- and my first step was to move my Documents folder into the Onedrive folder on
 my PC -- so that is the history -- old Windows person and heavy OneNote user, but new to Onedrive.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>So let me now ask a couple of more questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) If OneNote is moved back to the Users\Documents folder (currently located at C:Users\xxx\OneDrive\Documents\OneNote notebooks), will it not be backed up on OneDrive -- or just how does that work.&nbsp; As I mentioned, I am a pretty heavy OneNote user, probably
 use it far more than any APP on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I have been really anal with my attention of when I am on the Onenote File&gt;Info screen, most (all except for the ones I have not clicked on the yellow warning that started this post) of the locations for the individual Notebooks are "https:\\onedrive.live.com/self
 . . . ." hyperlinks.&nbsp; I have been beyond-worry about what is going on there, where as everything else looks normal for these Notebooks as far as I can tell in File Explorer.&nbsp; &nbsp;My latest thinking, as of literally midnight of last night, is that File&gt;Info is
 just displaying the hyperlink address for the Notebooks in OneDrive, as opposed to the Notebooks just being located out there in some cloud, someplace, maybe not even associated with Onedrive (i.e. subject to being lost).&nbsp; &nbsp;Could you tell me what is going
 on there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again, I really appreciate your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ron in round rock</p>
<p>
</p><p>[EDIT] And P.S.&nbsp; &nbsp;3) Does your "local mirror" comment in your response somehow explain the reason that the Notebooks go "Not Syncing" once I click on the yellow warning and the Notebook address get changed into hyperlinks -- the REAL reason I am on this
 quest..</p>

<p>Let me start with your 3rd question:</p>
<p>What I called a local mirror is the fact that for normal files you see in your local OneDrive folder what is mirrored to the OneDrive server(s). Where mirrored = backuped.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Normal files </em>means: all files, <strong>except </strong>OneNote files. They need a special treatment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your idea to copy the Documents tree to the local OneDrive folder to get a backup on OneDrive was generally clever; not knowing the special treatment necessary for OneNote files.</p>
<p>OneNote, from the beginning, allowed live shared access to its notebooks by more than one user. This started with using standard Windows features as Shared Folders in a LAN or WiFi network at home.</p>
<p>Since OneNote 2010 they introduced sharing notebooks over the Internet. For that they changed the data structures of OneNote in an incompatible way and invented a new solution for shared access to these notebooks on SkyDrive, later renamed to OneDrive. The
 workaround for the incompatible data structures was to use the new file format only on OneDrive, while still using the old format for locally stored notebooks.</p>
<p>This is no problem when creating a new notebook on OneDrive, which is possible since OneNote 2010. But this is a problem if you want to move a locally created notebook to OneDrive. This step obviously makes necessary a format conversion. This missing format
 conversion created your problems.</p>
<p>There is only one way to make this conversion: use OneNote 201x and its File -&gt; Share feature to move and convert an existing notebook to the right format on OneDrive. A side effect of this conversion is that such a notebook now appears in the local OneDrive
 folder (and in OneNote itself) as a hyperlink. Using such a hyperlink in your browser opens the notebook in your browser, in OneNote Online, to be exact.</p>
<p>As long as you use OneNote 201x, not the builtin OneNote for Windows (the OneNote without a File menu) you have a local backup. Where it is you can see in my screenshot.</p>
<p>

<p>Bernd,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help and your detailed response about the OneNote history.&nbsp; And yes, in all my research trying to create a non-hyperlinked Notebook (which was the thing I was most worried about and thought was the source of my syncing problem), I did see
 references to opening OneNote in my browser, which I avoided like the plague because I thought they were talking about using the TOY OneNote (my name for OneNote online) -- and I really don't want anything to do with involving the Toy OneNote in my use.&nbsp; And
 I even understood most of your explanation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if I am really understanding everything you are saying, if I move the OneNote folder back to the "currently empty" Documents folder (i.e. C:\Users\xxx\Documents), everything will start working again, in the manner OneNote used to operate, in the manner
 I am used to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that all I have to do -- because I still got a little lost in the incompatible data structures explanation -- and am wondering if the data structures are resolved automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my simple way of looking at this situation is that OneNote already places copies of the Notebooks in Onedrive to facilitate the sharing of Notebooks between users -- and the syncing problem arose because Onedrive was trying to sync or back up data that
 was already in Onedrive.&nbsp; Is that too simple of a way to look at it, because I did not understand exactly where the incompatible data structures took place (i.e. is there one structure on your computer and a different structure on the copy stored on Onedrive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to be so anal about this, but really would like to pretty much fully understand what is happening.&nbsp; And again, thanks for the help.</p>

<p>I'm afraid you have a mix now of local notebooks and unintentionally moved ones to OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should start with moving back your notebooks from the local OneDrive folder to the empty Documents.</p>
<p>Then you should look in file explorer whether they are complete. If you are unsure about that, close all notebooks open in OneNote (right click ...) and open your local notebooks from now Documents to look at them.</p>
<p>If they are complete you have to make a decision: will you use locally stored notebooks or do you want to move them to the cloud ?</p>
<p>If you miss a notebook (OneNote may have moved it to OneNote as reaction to the error message you mentioned) it may be open in OneNote.</p>
<p>So you have to create an overview of all your notebooks and where they are stored actually.</p>
<p>I'll stop here to not create more confusion and await the result of your investigation of the status of your notebooks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the help.&nbsp; This is a partial update because I am going to have to leave to go to one of my granddaughter's volleyball games - 9-years old, a lot of fun, just getting the ball across the net is a challenge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, with your help, here is where I am at.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Was able to close all of the "new" hyperlinked Notebooks I had created in "trying" to produce a non-hyperlinked location address -- about of 8 of them - all empty - all closed OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp; Back to my original 7 Notebooks, except that an 8th Notebook (Ron's Notebook) magically appeared at sometime when I was doing all of my experimenting (don't know where it came from).&nbsp; This one was funny in that it had one of the hyperlinked locations,
 yet it was syncing (synced) - and I was able to close it..</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Next I did a Properties (File&gt;Info screen) on the 3 notebooks "not" hyperlinked and was able to click on "Change Location" and was able to move them to the Users\Documents\OneNote notebooks folder.&nbsp; They were actually copied, not moved, but they appear
 intact -- although the sizes do not match, but the Files and Folders count matches.&nbsp; However, I re-opened them at the new locations and they all look good.&nbsp; These 3 Notebooks, by the way, still had the yellow "Notebook may not sync correctly . . ." in them
 because I had never clicked on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Next I tried to do the same Change procedure with one of the four hyperlinked Notebooks -- and OneNote would not let me Move them because they had not completed being synced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that is where I am at.&nbsp; I will pick this up when I come back later tonight.&nbsp; There appear to be a lot of other options, like closing the Notebooks, and the un-synced sections will be moved to misplaced sections at the bottom of the Notebooks list -- maybe
 I can pick up the changes there.&nbsp; Or I have thought about trying to move Sections from Onedrive folder to the Users folder, but doubt that that will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, out of time.&nbsp; If you have any more suggestions, let me know -- and will update all of this later tonight,</p>

<p>If you find more than the mentioned 3 notebooks (you relocated successfully to the standard documents folder) in the local OneDrive folder (notebook = folder with the notebook's name containing .one files and one .onetoc2 file) then just move them back to
 Documents\OneNote Notebooks with Windows explorer. Maybe OneNote left them back after "hyperlinking" them.</p>

<p>
</p><p>OK, back from the volleyball game - not a good one - my granddaughter's team got beat badly - not because they could't get the ball over the net when serving, but because the other team could and our team just couldn't return the serve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, been home for a couple of hours - and I think I can get the hyperlinked Notebooks moved.&nbsp; Spent 30-40 minutes doing the move and another 1+ hours typing up a long, long note with the background of the problem and the solution.&nbsp; At least it seemed
 to work on the one Notebook that I know had a lot of changes, but I want to double check everything tomorrow to be sure it is working.&nbsp; And I am still wondering if it is worthwhile posting the long, long explanation and solution -- or if I should just abbreviate
 it to what I will now tell you I did (actually I am surprised that it worked).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Throwing aside the non-hyperlinked Notebooks, the 3 I had never clicked on the yellow warning message and I described what I did with them earlier, I will just let you know what I did on the first of the four hyperlinked Notebooks, the Software Notebook,
 the one I know I made changes to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp; As you suggested, I did a copy and paste of the "onenote notebooks" folder, with Notebooks, into the Users\xxx\documents folder, the one outside the Onedrive folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp; Next I renamed all of the Notebooks, by putting a 1 in front of the notebook name (i.e. "1Software"), to avoid duplication and confusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Next in OneNote, I Opened the newly renamed "1Software" Notebook and to my surprise, it opened -- and I thought I was home free (with the correct Location of Users\xxx\documents\onenote notoebooks).&nbsp; Next I clicked on the TurboTax Tab(Section), a section
 I knew I had made a lot of changes to, and alas, the recent changes were not there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) So my next step was to rename the TurboTax Tab(Section) in the "1Software" Notebook to be "1TurboTax".&nbsp; Still in OneNote with all of this still on the screen, I accessed the TurboTax Tab(Section) in the hyperlinked Software Notebook, and dragged (Control
 key down, so it was a copy) TurboTax from the hyperlinked Software Notebook (the Tab(Section) with all of the updates) into the "1Software" Notebook, and there was no conflict since I had just renamed the TurboTax Tab to be "1Turbotax".&nbsp; The drag and drop
 worked nicely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) And when I clicked on the newly moved Turbotax Tab(section) in "1Software", it came up with all of the recent changes intact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So maybe with your help, I am all done -- except I want to double-check everything again tomorrow.&nbsp; One small problem I am faced with is that I don't specifically remember (other than the Turbotax Tab(Section) if I have made changes elsewhere in the hyperlinked
 Notebooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose it is not the end of the world if I miss a couple of changes, updates to my Notebooks -- but I think I have other options.&nbsp; Since I only have 7 Notebooks and roughly 5-10 Tabs in each Notebook, I could rename all of the new Tabs and in the new
 Notebook and drag the Tabs from the old Notebooks into the newly located Notebooks. Or I could just delete all of the Tabs in the New Notebook (or even create a new empty Notebook) and drag individual Tabs from the old hyperlinked Notebooks into the new Notebooks
 location.&nbsp; Maybe I will try that tomorrow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, guess what, I guess I thought I was just writing this note to you, wringing my hands over whether ot not to post my long, long explanation -- and I have just disclosed the solution -- pretty much making my long, long explanation posting decisionfor me,
 at least for those that can understand the above abreviation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some other details not mentioned in this post (were in the long, long set of notes), like NOT being able to Close the hyperlinked Notebooks, without losing all of my recent changes (at least that is the way I am reading the OneNote pop-up error
 message), so I want to leave everything intact for a little while until I am certain that it is safe to just delete the old stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any of this turns out to not be true or accurate, of course I will follow it up with a corrective post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And again, thanks for the help and explanation as to what is/was going on.</p>

<p>This is the next morning and this is a follow-up to the long post I made last night (immediately above).</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, just to confirm, the above process works like a charm.&nbsp; I found another Page (in the "Family" Section Tab) that I had updated in my old, original "Personal" Notebook (a note about a birthday, made on April 15 (yes, granddaughter's birthday in on
 tax day).&nbsp; I opened "1Personal" in the new Notebooks folder and the changes were not there.&nbsp; So I re-named the Section Tab to be "1Family" -- and then copied (drag and drop) the "Family" Section Tab from my old "Personal" Notebook (still open in OneNote) into
 my new "Personal" Notebook, and voila, the recent changes are all there, now in my new, newly moved OneNote Notebooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So with 2 completely successful updates of my Notebooks (on a Section-by-Section basis), I think I can endorse this process as good, working, worked.&nbsp; The ONLY problem here is that you have to remember which Sections of a Notebook that you changed in order
 for this to be successful, unless you want to just replace them all, in order to make sure you have not forgotten which Sections you had updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another approach that I want to investigate is the "Misplaced Sections" processing.&nbsp; OneNote is so good about not losing any of you data, changes -- that if it cannot sync the new changes, at some point, LIKE WHEN THE NOTEBOOK IS CLOSED, OneNote with save
 any changed, non-synced Section(s) in the Misplaced Sections area at the bottom of the Notebook list.&nbsp; The problem (maybe not really a problem) is that I don't know if it saves "all" of the Sections there when a non-synced Notebook is closed or if it saves
 "just the Sections" that have been changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That would be very nice (probably too much to ask) feature (if it saved just the changed Sections), but my guess is that it saves "all" of the Sections there because it is trying to sync on a Notebook (i.e. folder) basis.&nbsp; But it is kind of hard for me to
 check that out because right now, I have about 100 Sections in the Misplaced Sections of my OneNote, due to all of the things I tried to get the original Not Syncing problem fixed.&nbsp; So my question Bernd, if you are still around (or anybody for that matter)
 if there is a way to Delete all 100 of the Sections in Misplaced Sections, all at once.&nbsp; The information I have read does not give a process to delete them all at once, just right-click and one at a time -- and I want to have an empty Misplaced Sections when
 I try the next experiment, option of Closing the hyperlinked Notebooks, so I will know precisely what is placed in the Misplaced Sections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am starting to get the feeling, maybe understand that my original panic of losing my recent changes to my Notebooks was a little over the top because it appears OneNote (actually my favorite App, although I wish the entry and editing features could be
 improved a little) goes to great extremes to not lose your data and automatically provides alternatives for any of your data that has not been synced (backed up) for saving these changes.</p>

<p>At first: I love to read such real word reports about real word problems and I think some other people will do too. Thank you.</p>
<p>Some additional comments:</p>
<p>I don't know of a mass delete of Misplaced&nbsp; Sections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much of the trouble is caused by the fact that OneNote only copied+converted&nbsp;the notebooks after clicking the yellow message. And left behind the files in the local OneDrive folder as orphaned childs. So these remaining notebooks got no changes you did in
 the new hyperlinked copies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After your reorganisation you now have all your notebooks stored as local notebooks.</p>
<p>This brings up&nbsp;again the question of backups. I mentioned the automatic backup by OneNote. Make sure that
<strong>both </strong>related options are set. The second let you think you need it only in the case of using Sharepoint. That's just a misnamed option.</p>

<p>
</p><p>An alternative for Backup using another cloud is using Dropbox.</p>
<p>That is my personal solution. I sync my local notebooks using the old Microsoft tool SyncToy to the local Dropbox folder which is automatically synced to the Dropbox cloud and therefore to my backup computer.</p>

<p><span>Prior Security Software?&nbsp; &nbsp;What about a trial version of an antivirus program that was pre-installed when the computer was purchased? McAfee, Norton, Trend Micro?&nbsp; If you reformatted/reinstalled the

</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes remnants of prior security software will suddenly cause issues with your current antimalware program.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>A <b>possible</b> reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC.&nbsp; Be sure you have removed&nbsp; all other security software from the PC.</span></p>

            <p>I chatted with Support and we cannot remove it. &nbsp;I have suggested that they adopt a procedure like Fitbit uses where you can select what trackers you want displayed in the Health App itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sharing is a popular option on Fitbit so it is OK to have the option. &nbsp;However, for those of us who use the Band, and don't want it, we should not have it at the #1 slot on the display. &nbsp;It is annoying.</p>

    <title>Outlook Social Connector&#58; &#34;Unable to log in to&#58; My - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tewill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Social Connector&#58; &#34;Unable to log in to&#58; My Site.&#34;</h2>
                    I use the Outlook (2010) Social Connector and have an Office 365 Exchange Online plan. Recently the social connector has been displaying the error: "Unable to log in to: My Site." which doesn't make much sense, as not only do I not have a SharePoint server,
 I also don't have "My Site" checked in the list of Social Network Accounts. So, I'm&nbsp; not sure why it's trying to log in to My Site to begin with nor why it just started doing so recently.<br />
<br />
Before I signed up for an EO plan, I did trial the P1 plan, and did run the Office 365 desktop setup application, which I assume configured connectivity of Office products to SharePoint, but I didn't use any of the SharePoint functionality and have been using
 EO now for a few months but just recently starting seeing this error with the social connector. I tried uninstalling the Microsoft Online Services Sign-in Assistant, but this error still appeared.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any idea why this error might be appearing or how to fix it?<br />
<br />
Thanks!

            Thanks for the response, but this issue isn't related to Exchange Online. I've posted in the SharePoint forum - even though I don't have a SP server - because "My Site" is part of SP. But, as I'm getting this error message even though I don't have "My
 Site" checked in the list of Social Network Accounts in the Outlook Social Connector, it also could be an Outlook issue, as it shouldn't be trying to connect if it's not checked to begin with. That's why I also posted in this forum.<br />

            <p>Hello Tad W,</p>
<p>Sorry about the misdirection. </p>
<p>When there is a lot of activity on the forums sometime there are mistakes.</p>
<p>You needed the forum for Office 365. </p>
<p>This forum is only for local installation of Office and since you state in your post that it is Office 365 you can be better served&nbsp;where they have&nbsp;more knowledge of how Office 365 works. We also have very limited knowledge of Exchange since this forum is
 primarily for people that are connecting to POP or IMAP for email. </p>
<p>Here is the forum for Office 365 and if you think the issue is with connecting to Exchange you can use the forum that Varun provided.</p>

            Thanks also for the reply, but this isn't an issue with Exchange Online, it's an issue with the Outlook Social Connector, which is part of my local installation of Outlook 2010. I have posted in multiple forums (including Office 365) because it is not
 clear what might be causing the problem. But, like I said in my previous post, at the very least the Outlook Social Connector shouldn't be trying to connect to "My Site" when it has not been configured nor selected to connect, which superficially appears to
 be a problem with Outlook.<br />

                    <p>This is on a HP Envy DV7-7250US laptop with Intel Centrino Wireless N-2230. &nbsp;When Bluetooth is on (enabled and SW switch is on) in the device manager under Bluetooth devices all the devices show OK but under the event tab all of them say " ..... requires
 further installation." &nbsp;This includes the Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator and LE&nbsp;Enumerator. &nbsp;The Bluetooth devices under Network adapters also say the same thing. &nbsp;Is this because

            <p>Hi Paul,<br />
<br />
Thank you for the detailed reply. <br />
<br />
Please note that paired and connected are different states. Once paired&nbsp;- devices can reconnect on demand and would drop connection when it's no longer used/needed.<br />
<br />
Do not concern yourself with 'unknown' devices - those are just driverless devices which get grouped under "Other devices" in device manager. This is perfectly normal.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</p>
<p>Denis<br />

<p>Hi Cristie here are the conclusion I came to after some research:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"After much research&nbsp; on this subject it turns out that WAH, Work at Home and HUP, Home Use Program are 2 different beast.&nbsp; The WAH is strictly for you to actually work for your employer at home on your personal computer and cannot use it for personal use.&nbsp;
 You do not actually pay for the software but your employer pays another small fee to have you copy it onto your system and you must remove it from your system once you are no longer employed with your employer.&nbsp; Only aloud on one device.&nbsp; Now this program
 has been canceled and everyone shuttled over to HUP.&nbsp; HUP is the employee actually purchasing a license themselves at a greatly discounted price and can load it on there personal computer and a portable device so long as the software 1. Is never being used
 at the same time 2. Is removed from your system once you are no longer employed with your employer.&nbsp; Also you will NOT be given a free upgrade as with the WAH you will have to purchase another HUP license and&nbsp; in turn remove all previous HUP software from
 your device because you can only own one HUP license at a time.&nbsp; The Program can be installed on a licensed device and a portable device."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I believe you are correct in assuming that software assurance is not required&nbsp; and I am not even sure if that is an option for WAH volume purchase.&nbsp; But the program is no longer in service and everyone will be going to HUP.</p>

<p>You could try Digital River, MS's "official" online supplier, but that is a really long shot:</p>

<p>Other than that, your best bet is trying your corporate IT department, they may have old disks "floating around". Or you could try any small 1-man computer repair shop. They often have old stuff like that because they are still supporting it. Last chance
 would be to find a "computer club" in your area. Computer 'geeks' are really likely to have them.</p>

    <title>TEXT Box Question&#33;&#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 24ggirl  say:</h3>
<h2>            TEXT Box Question&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I have something that is driving me up the wall! When I go and created a Text Box in Word 2010 and put it down below the page and go to print it out, it shows in the print preview part of it, but when it prints it out part of the left side is missing.
 How can I fix this so that I can print what it sees?

            I have tried that, but the some of the text in the text box doesn't appear as some of it comes up missing still even in the print preview before I click print. What else can I do to resolve this issue I'm facing with it?<br />

    <title>Using formulas in word 2016 table - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Using formulas in word 2016 table</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to use the formula function within a table in Microsoft Word 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a table where row 1 is the titles and rows 2 and 3 contain figures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to check if the value entered in a cell is within a range of the value in another cell. &nbsp;i.e. is the value within the range of 99.7 to 100.3. &nbsp;if the cell value is within that range then the cell in a further column is pass, otherwise if it is outside
 of this range then the value will be false.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any suggestions</p>

<p>
</p><p>The first time we tried to re-sync her laptop with the shared folder, it said "A [Common Folder] already exists in your [OneDrive for Business] folder," with a further warning that "If you choose this location for your [Common Folder], files in this folder

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">We went ahead and re-synced to the same Common Folder location on the cloud--because the Common Folder was NOT showing up in her laptop's File Explorer. Well...it must be there invisibly, because it did indeed wreak havoc to our
 then newly re-organized directories.&nbsp;</span></p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This time around, the same thing is happening. For some unknown reason, OneDrive for Business shared folder has disappeared from her File Explorer (as described above). When we try to just re-sync with the shared folder, it says

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Second, how do we re-sync her laptop with the cloud shared folder without creating havoc as before? The shared folder isn't visible on her laptop, so it's not like we could just delete that and start from scratch. It's not there!

<p>Hi EricaJones2,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your discription, please check if the user marked the shared folder visible in setting&gt; account&gt; choose folder or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This article named "<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-my/help/4028633/windows-10-change-the-location-of-your-onedrive-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Change the location of your OneDrive folder</a>" explains why this prompt came up to you
 and how to deal with it.</p>
<p><span>It mentions:&nbsp;</span><span>You'll see a message letting you know that the OneDrive folder in the new location already has files in it. Select&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Use
 this location</strong></span><span>, and then finish setting up OneDrive.</span></p>

<p>Hi Jerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, I can assure you that this user did <strong>not</strong> go through the steps shown at&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-my/help/4028633/windows-10-change-the-location-of-your-onedrive-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-my/help/4028633/windows-10-change-the-location-of-your-onedrive-folder</a>
 to unlink her PC.&nbsp; We do not know why her laptop unlinked itself the first time, and we don't know why it did it this second time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think your workaround addresses the issue. If we have her choose a different folder for her (currently invisible) version of the shared folder to land, then she will not be linked to our actual shared folder.&nbsp; However, are you suggesting that we
 have her choose a new directory, so that at least something on her harddrive becomes visible and then spend hours and hours&nbsp; figuring out what files we can delete and which to keep? And after weeding things out from her version of the shared folder, we could
 then change back to the actual, real shared folder?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the hours and hours trying to solve this seems to take, does anyone here know why a PC would just unlink itself like this? Can it be fixed/avoided?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Erica</p>

<p>Hi Erica,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might be a possibility that the OneDrive folder was somehow removed from the left navigation in File Explorer, but it is still synced to your drive. If it is shared folder, then it will be synced to C:\Users\&lt;Username&gt;\tenaant by default, you can go to
 this location and check if the synced folder is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, please check <strong>shared with me</strong> view in userâs OneDrive (open a browser, go to https??
<a href="http://portal.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://portal.office.com/</a> and click OneDrive tile) and check if user still has the access to shared folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, please confirm if the issue with just was a shared folder or entire OneDrive is unlinked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Neha</p>

<p>Hi Neha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I confirm that this user still has access to the shared folder, by checking OneDrive via a web browser at&nbsp;<a href="http://portal.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://portal.office.com/</a></p>

</p><p><span>Her personal OneDrive is linked and showing up in the File Explorer. The connection to the company OneDrive/shared folder is what has disappeared from File Explorer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>2 PCs show different number of files in OneDrive folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martin_ch  say:</h3>
<h2>            2 PCs show different number of files in OneDrive folder</h2>
                    <p>Bought a MS surface studio. Turned on OneDrive, waited about a week to get all files from the cloud onto my PC.</p>
<p>Since I have a second PC, I thought I would compare the number of files on both PCs in the OneDrive folder - and surprisingly the count is not the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that does inspire confidence as there are more than 100,000 files and more than 12,000 folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get all PCs back in sync? How do I know what's missing?</p>

<p>Hi Martin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better understand the situation, Iâd like to confirm the following information.</p>
<ol>
<li>Do both OneDrive clients show up to date when you click on them? If not, what the error message?</li><li>Click the OneDrive icon and go to Settings. Under account, check the storage used for both PC. Are they the same?</li><li>If they are different, click the OneDrive icon and select Pause syncing, then resume the syncing on the PC which fewer storage is used.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ran</p>

<p>Hello Ran</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience.</p>
<p>Let me reply to your three questions first:</p>
<ol>
<li>Yes, both show that they are up-to-date. No error message.</li><li>According to Settings I am using 492 GB of my storage. In Choose folders both PCs have all folders selected. The number here is 491.9 GB used. It is the same for both PCs.</li><li>I see that files are sync'd when they change.</li></ol>
<p>The difference comes about, when I use File Properties on the OneDrive folder on the respective PCs. It reads as follows:</p>
<p>PC 1 contains 102'722 Files, 12'459 Folders</p>
<p>PC 2 contains 102'671 Files, 12'459 Folders</p>
<p>As a result the Size of the directories are not exactly the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So tried to copy the whole directory OneDrive to an external hard disk. I have made a funny observation. I cannot do it in one go, as the amount seems to double miraculously. It seems that at the beginning of the copy process there is a lot more storage
 necessary than when the process has ended. I copied directory by directory as a result onto the hard disk.</p>
<p>I have used FreeFileSync then to compare that the contents PC1 - HD - PC2 are the same. And it does seem to be the case. Yet there are some files that may not be transmitted. It does not give me that much confidence in being SURE all is there.</p>
<p>It does not give any reassurance at all when I look at the Status of the folders in OneDrive on PC2 - see attached picture. There is just one folder in green. I do not know when I have told OneDrive to synchronize so selectively (considering PC2 is new and
 I just installed OneDrive on it). On PC1 it showed a similar (but not same) picture regarding Status.</p>
<p>So where are my files? Am I sure there is all there, physically on my PC? Am I told the right things? How can I be sure?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC 2 is a brand new MS surface studio PC. Out of the box, I configured OneDrive to discover these issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Martin</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Martin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the picture, we can see that some files or folders are still in the syncing status (the ones with two cycle arrows icon). I would suggest you right click on the items and select either Always keep on this device or Free up space to force the sync. If
 the issue persists, please let me know.</p>

<p>Hey Ran</p>
<p>Yes, I wondered about that too. So I set all the Always keep... and this is the result (after a reboot just to be sure). Some did change status, but for example on folder that should be online is flagged as Always keep...</p>
<p>That is a very inconsistent behaviour - and as I said earlier it makes me doubt that the solution actually works reliably.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c8359ff5-36cb-4a49-b227-6f1cd3a958d5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c8359ff5-36cb-4a49-b227-6f1cd3a958d5?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ccfca114-ca1e-4cc7-91b9-84e82ec053be?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ccfca114-ca1e-4cc7-91b9-84e82ec053be?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you are syncing a large number of files, it may take some time for the status to change. Since it has been several days, Iâd like to collect your tenant information for further investigation if you are still experiencing the issue. to protect your privacy,
 I have sent you a private message.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Office back-up files into Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I recently had my laptop in for servicing but came back with the Windows 7 Operating System re-installed without my consent! &nbsp;I have since up-dated this to Windows 10 so was wondering if I am able to use my last Windows 7 back-up to restore my files that
 were wiped together with Microsoft Office, Word documents and other programs etc.

            Hi Geneva_314,
<br />If they are getting an error back saying it can not be delivered because of a problem Have you logged into your gmail account directly as your email would be received on the grmail server first and then sent to outlook. Are the messages there (just not downloaded)? if so we can troubleshoot why they are not being delivered to your outlook. 
<br />Please let me know so I can help you further!
<br />Regards,
<br />L

            Seems then it's not getting to your Gmail account. The person sending it may need to do some troubleshooting from their end on why they cannot send email. If it's not showing up in your email and they are getting the error they may need to contact their email support to find out why email is not being sent.

            Very strange you may want to check with Gmail support if the email was getting to the gmail account then we could troubleshoot the problem but it's not getting to their server where the mail replicates from.

                    I prefer not to uninstall from the control panel and would prefer if someone has office 2010 can they say or is there a flowchart starting with cdrive showing WHERE THE PST FILES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE. mine are in mixed up locations with outlook working for
 a while then not working.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>also on the control panel i will attach a screencapture that shows that one or 2 could be causing the problem espeically the one that sais social network plug in. &nbsp; can i delete that garbage which i dont want it trying to read and locking up anyway?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>i have my disks however it started with 2007 and various download upgrades with no disks. &nbsp;will i be able to find support if the reinstallation DOWNGRADES my computer such as to student version??</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>my issue isnt as severe as other posts where the person simply wanted to wipe the computer clean of outlook email totally--i want to fix it and or uninstall then reinstall. but ive had the disks for years &nbsp;will it lock me out with things i dont remember
 such as passwords from years ago??</div>

<p>Nor do you need the PP Viewer</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you wish to uninstall you do so via the Control Panel, there is a method of doing it manually if the Control Panel (Programs &amp; features) doesn't work</p>
<p>Uninstalling Outlook and then reinstalling is unlikely to fix any Outlook problems as the reinstall uses the original Outlook Profile, and its data files.</p>

            thats why its so mixed up. att uses yahoo servers. &nbsp;so i believe if i changed my profile such as on yahoo--POSSIBLY outlook is somehow tied into it. &nbsp; thats why i want to know if i can uninstall the SOCIAL PROFILE thing--the one on the bottom. &nbsp;i already
 just now uninstalled the top 2 like you said. &nbsp;then rebooted and it didnt help. &nbsp;the proble, with the pst files is one is about 6 megabytes and im willing to kiss it goodby. but i dont know how to get outlook to start fresh with a new pst file. &nbsp;there is no
 way to create it--and no way to look at it. it only allows you to use it or open it in outlook--WHICH NOW DOES NOT WORK.

            ok thanks.  i put the pst files in the correct place and have backed them up on an external drive after deleting emails and sent and deleted emails to try and get the pst as small as possible before i uninstall and reinstall again from the disks this morning 26-jan. 



it also gives an error sometimes "unknown error registry error--may need to reinstall" 



so i will do that. the best way to describe the problem is it hangs for as much as an hour on each thing and the test mails it sends both go through to my other emails and my smart phone--but not to outlook. it does not show them as sent--nor arriving.  in other words it could be a display problem. its like it refuses to VISUALLY show the incoming test mails.  at times the past couple days if i let it sit open for hours--a couple mails do pop through.  so the settings are not wrong--something is corrupted someplace.  no other program on the computer malfunctions.  word and virtually everything i click on and use to experiment--all work perfec

<p>Data files are not impacted upon in any such process</p>
<p>Any uninstall/reinstall uses the original Outlook Profile, if this profile is damaged in some way, so will any reinstall be.</p>

            no doubt about it--outlook 2010 simply does not work anymore with the fast changing computers and updates. &nbsp;i did a total uninstall of office and reinstall from disks including entering my code then doing the updates (service pack2) for outlook. &nbsp;reboot
 computer do all the correct things and not one thing has changed. &nbsp;takes half hour to come up--sends tests emails fine that go to my phone and even this computer on live mail. &nbsp;says 'loading" that never ends. &nbsp;totally non working and they ran off with the
 money. &nbsp;i saw another post the person had struggled for days and had same problem. &nbsp;no uninstall or reinstall works--nothing works. &nbsp;there is also "repair" and those things--those also do nothing. &nbsp;create new data file?--error--does not work. "please reinstall
 to fix" &nbsp; do it five times--does not work nothing changes. &nbsp;outlook apparently is just hopelessly bogged down with updates and old algorithms and they should provide people with a similar redone email modern system. &nbsp;its 100% hopeless.
<div><br />
<div>nothing is worse then a program that you cannot uninstall nor fix nor reinstall even when you have the disks and everything that say $279 right on the box--just for office including word--outlook etc</div>

<h3> bernardmarquardt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lock Screen Slideshow does not start</h2>
                    <p>This concerns Windows 10 Preview. I've tried to get the slideshow working in Build 10074 and 10122 with no success.</p>
<p>The background slideshow works fine. But the lock screen just will not start. I've tried all sorts of settings. Nothing works, except that the display turns itself off after the set time. But what is missing, from what I can tell, is the inactivity setting.
 There is no way to tell the system after how many minutes to start the slideshow. Also, on one of the PCs I am trying 10122, the slideshow reports in red 'You need more than one picture for the slideshow'. Well, even there the picture&nbsp;folder is selected and
 has over 100 pictures. So what is the answer? I've posted this on the windows 10 forum and no one has come up with a solution. Strange... Is this a minor thing for people? Now if I do win key + L, the lock screen starts and does the slideshow. It just does
 not start automatically and again the setting for inactivity is missing. </p>

            Thank you, Srimadhwa B. I just wondered if this works for other people and what they have noticed concerning the inactivity setting (which you have in 8.1, but I don't see it in my builds).

    <title>Placeholder Master - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicole 2010  say:</h3>
<h2>            Placeholder Master</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi ,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>we have created a master with many layouts and are&nbsp;facing problems which I cannot resolve.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I&nbsp;have created various layouts in my master using different placeholders. Each slide starts on the top left side with a number e.g. 1 followed by a second text placeholder for the title/heading. Under that I have added for instance text or content
 placholders.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When I try to apply my master to a blank presentation (but with text in the blank presentation) on some slides the content has been moved into the right placeholders and on some it hasnÂ´t. I see for instance my bullet points in the small number placeholder
 I have created on the top left corner instead of the placeholder below that. I noticed that it makes a difference in the outline view how my placeholders are numbered. So you see for instance:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The number 1 than the icon of a slide followed by the title.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In the line below that, I see little boxes with number 1, 2 or 3 for each of the placeholders I have inserted. On some slides my numbering for the top left hand corner is in the little box 2 and on others in box 1. I believe that here is my problem.
 I need to get the order of these placeholders in a special way, so that PowerPoint can put the content in the right placeholders when the layout changes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If I compare two slides, considering that both slides start with the number on the top left side followed by the second text placeholder but once with a text placeholder and another with a content placeholder underneath I see the following order in
 the outline view:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1 - Slide icon - Heading 1</span></p>
<p><span>[1] 01</span></p>
<p><span>[2] Text</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2 - Slide icon - Heading 2</span></p>
<p><span>[2] Text</span></p>
<p><span>[2] 01</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I need to move on slide 1 the placeholder [1] 01 to the second position like on Slide 2. I have created both slides in the same order, yet, PowerPoint creates its own order. But I want to have a proper master set-up in order to avoid the problems I
 have mentioned above.</span></p>

<p><span>Any ideas? By the way, is there a "best practice" how to set-up a master in order to have as less problems as possible when users mix slides from other presentations? I know how to set-up a master and donÂ´t need instructions how to do that but more
 tips and tricks how to set-up a master so that we do not run into other technical problems when working with other masters.</span></p>

<p><span>Be grateful for any information on that.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Kind regards,</span></p>

<p><span>Nicole</span></p>

            <p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>Sure I can share (see: <a href="http://sdrv.ms/ZeRgaT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://sdrv.ms/ZeRgaT</a>). I have removed logo etc.</p>
<p>See slide two and three in the outline view. I have already entered information. As you can see on slide two, the number 1 is on the first place while on slide 3 the number shows on the second place. That wouldnÂ´t bother me only that when we mix with other
 presentations (e.g. a presentation without a master only text using the standard layouts see:<a href="http://sdrv.ms/ZeRgaT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://sdrv.ms/ZeRgaT</a> ) you will see that the text will be placed in the little placeholder
 on the left hand corner (see: <a href="http://sdrv.ms/UJVJiK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://sdrv.ms/UJVJiK</a>&nbsp;slide 2).</p>
<p>This drives me mad as I see future complains when users are using our master.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Nicole</p>

            Hi Nicole<br />
<ol>
<li>I don't seem able to access your links.</li><li>This isn't really my area of expertise but if you mean you are trying to control the order that placeholders are used when you apply a complex custom template? As far as I know you can only do this by editing the XML data. Is this something you might tackle?
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>Maybe one of the template experts (Echo?) knows a better way.<br />

<p>Oh dear, no I am not fit in XML data. I just donÂ´t understand why on some slides the order are correct and on some not. I was hoping for a "user friendly" option ;-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yes, I am trying to control the order that placeholders are used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

            It's been a problem since custom layouts became possible. As far as I know once created the only way to control the order is to edit the XML.<br />
<br />
If you can find someone who can look into the XML each layout has a collection of shapes(placeholders) and most (not Titles) of these have an idx number. It seems to be this number that controls the order. I don't think there's any user friendly way to access
 this.<br />
<br />
Example<br />
&lt;p:cNvPr id="9" name="Content Placeholder 7"/&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;p:cNvSpPr&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;a:spLocks noGrp="1"/&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/p:cNvSpPr&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;p:nvPr&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;p:ph sz="quarter" idx="13"/&gt;<br />

Hello Nicole and John.</p>
<p>Steve and John pointed me at this post from here: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-powerpoint/what-determines-the-order-that-text-appears-in-the/388a5986-b39b-4cc5-8dc1-08fdfb04cf2b">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-powerpoint/what-determines-the-order-that-text-appears-in-the/388a5986-b39b-4cc5-8dc1-08fdfb04cf2b</a>.&nbsp; Having read your post, I think I have been having the same problem ever since I was able to
 add additional placeholders to the Custom Layouts (but had learned to live with it / given up on a solution).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to confirm, the issue is you take a slide that's laid out in an old or not very controlled way and you paste it into your latest template.&nbsp; Then you apply a Custom Layout&nbsp;like this for example:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fbizqkw.sn2.livefilestore.com%2fy1pQjpnDna3G-0RgjdJwL-xBdgfGARo6a80iUWzu02RzM7spKFOGd3vK9I2A3mn1zBBUeYDCd7RD_7bCpHHP7jwB0FErE_j0uGY%2fSlide%2520Layout.png%3fpsid%3d1" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>with a Title placeholder at the top, and above that a placeholder for a "Section Title", and two main placeholders for the main slide text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the "bad" slide I have has a <em>similar</em> layout to this with two main text placeholders, but when I apply the above Custom Layout, the text from one of the main placeholders ends up in the Section Title placeholder!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until now, the only work around I had was to have <em>another</em> Custom Layout just like the above BUT WITHOUT the additional Section Title placeholder.&nbsp; If I apply that first, THEN apply the one with the Section Title placeholder, it all works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, now John has suggested there is a way to fix this.&nbsp; First up, editing XML is not that hard.&nbsp; First you change your *.POTX file into *.ZIP by renaming.&nbsp; MAKE A COIPY OF YOUR TEMPLATE FIRST!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you can double-click on it and browse to ....<strong>.</strong>zip\ppt\slideLayouts where you will see an xml file "slideLayout1.xml" for each Layout in your template.&nbsp; You can copy one of those files to your desktop (I find it safter to do this than
 edit while in a zip file).&nbsp; To edit the XML you <em>could</em> just use Notepad, but I've been using the XML Notepad 2007 which you can get from here:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=7973" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=7973</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open the slideLayout<strong>#</strong>.xml file that you copied to your desktop, make any changes and save and close.&nbsp; Then paste the file back into the zip (I find Window Explorer crashes if I try to over-write a file, so instead delete the original in
 the zip and then paste in the modified file).&nbsp; Close the zip file and rename back to *.potx.&nbsp; Job done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NOW, all we need to do is figure out WHAT changes to make to the XML!?!?!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where I have ground to a halt.&nbsp; I tried changing the idx values for the three placeholders in the above example Custom Layout.&nbsp; In the XML Notepad 2007 editor, I did View &gt; Expand all, then scrolled down to find them.&nbsp; The first one is in:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;p:sldLayout &gt; p:cSld &gt; p:spTree &gt; p:sp &gt; p:nvSpPr &gt; p:nvPr &gt; p:ph &gt; idx</p>
<p><br />
It didn't appear to matter what I set the three placeholder's idx values to (1 for the Section Title placeholder, 3, or even 99999).&nbsp; Whatever I did with the idx values, the text from a large placeholder always goes into the Section Title placeholder &lt;grrr&gt;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>John, are you sure it's the "idx" value?&nbsp; Where did you hear this?&nbsp; Could it be the "id" value?&nbsp; I think that will be my next test.&nbsp; Watch this space.
<strong><em>[UPDATE: No joy with id either.&nbsp; :o(&nbsp; Any other ideas John?]</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers<br />
Rich</p>

            I didn't say it was easy but I am pretty sure it is the idx value. I didn't hear it I stumbled upon it!<br />
<br />
Have a<a href="http://www.pptalchemy.co.uk/Downloads/reverse.pptx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> look at this file.</a><br />
<br />
There are two "two content layouts" They are duplicates and exactly the same except I opened the XML and changed the idx values in the reverse version.<br />
<br />
Insert a normal two content slide and add text a,b and c. Now apply the reverse layout you should see the text switch placeholders?<br />

            <p>Thanks for the example John, very nice, all works as you describe... but... if you add another placeholder for text then with my example "bad" slide, it still populates the wrong placeholder (ignoring the idx order).<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>BINGO!&nbsp; Got it!&nbsp; Not only do you have to ensure that the idx of each placeholder is in the order that you want them to be populated (i.e. idx=1 will be populated first, idx=2 second, etc.), but you also have to make sure they are all "Content Placeholders".&nbsp;
 If your "bad" slide has a placeholder (even if itâs a "Content Placeholder" with the icons in the middle when its empty), ...if that placeholder contains text, when you apply a Layout it will first hunt out any Text Placeholders and populate that/those Text
 Placeholders first, regardless of their idx values.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you add a new placeholder for Text to a Layout (use the dropdown on Insert Placeholder and choose Text) and then examine the xml, at the following "xml path":<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p:sldLayout &gt; p:cSld &gt; p:spTree &gt; p:sp &gt; p:nvSpPr &gt; p:nvPr &gt; p:ph &gt; <br />
&nbsp;<br />
you will see a node called "type" with the value "body".&nbsp; All the other "Content" placeholders do not have this node (the Title placeholder has it and its value is "title").</p>
<p>If you delete that "type = body" node (in the XML Notepad you can just right-click on it and Delete), then re-insert that xml file back into the presentation/template, now it will be a "Content Placeholder" and itâs idx value will be used to determine the
 order of population.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
So, problem solved...?&nbsp; Nicole, are you going to try this?&nbsp; The skydrive links to your files didnât work for me, so I couldnât test on yours.&nbsp; Do you think youâll be able to follow the above?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Unfortunately, although the mystery may be solved, Iâm not sure the "problem" is solved for me.&nbsp; The problem now is if I have a slide with a populated Section Title, and a single "Content Placeholder" for the body of the slide, and then I decide I want to switch
 to a Layout with more main placeholders (like the picture I posted previously), the section title populates one of main body placeholders!!!!&nbsp; If you leave that section title placeholder as a Text Placeholder then that doesnât happen (i.e. the section title
 text always stays where it should).&nbsp; So I think Iâll be leaving this as is in my templates, for now, until I figure out which is the lesser of two evils.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Thanks again John.<br />
Hope this helps you Nicole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Cheers<br />

            <p>Hi Rich,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry, I just saw the new responses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the instructions and next time I will give it a go and try it myself. For this issue I saw your instructions too late. We had already given it to a programmer to get it fixed. But when you fix one problem another one starts coming up ;-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
