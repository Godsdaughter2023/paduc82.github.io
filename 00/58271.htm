            Greatly appreciate the information but my fax function, as well as print and copy work OK.<br />
<br />
The problem is with the scan function, as I keep getting an error message that says the new printer (HP 410A) cannot find the SCAN.MSI file on the network. This gives you an error message that you either click OK, which causes it to search again, or select
 CANCEL. This selection then gives you an Error 1706 message and the option to click OK.<br />
<br />
If you repeat the process of CANCEL-OK a few times, the printer will start scanning, but you have to do this over and over for each document you want to scan.<br />
<br />
Uninstalling and reloading the system software helps, but for some reason, the printer software cannot find the SCAN.MSI file in the 7zS53EO file (Scan) folder.<br />
<br />
An HP Tech support rep in India says its a problem with the version Q14 software for the printer that has been around for 3 years, but the escalation Tech Support in Canada says this is not true, that it is a Microsoft problem. The HP tech support in the Philippines
 is useless other than for spending hours and hours of "experimenting" and reinstalling the software.<br />
<br />
The C410a all in one printer is supposed to be an improvement of the C309 which I previously owned, and was quite satisfied with. It was generally trouble free, but an ink hog. The C410a uses the same printer ink cartridges, which I have in ample supply, another
 reason for purchasing the C410a.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions how to fix the scan.msi problem, whether it be HP or MS problems, would be appreciated<br />

                    I have not figured out what triggers it but recently it has been happening more and more recently to the point that I have to do something about it. I have a Huawei matebook x pro and whenever I use my Sabrent USB hub to connect more than one device (usually
 a razer mouse, focusrite scarlett audio interface, and multiple portable hard drives) they usually work for a while and then at some point it says "windows does not recognize the device etc". Further, that message pops up over and over as if I were plugging
 and unplugging it over and over. I used the hub and devices with othe computers and they worked fine. All devices work fine as long as they are directly into the computer and not the hub. Further, I bought an anker hub and had the same results. I went into
 device manager and tried uninstalling the root hub and every other usb device that was plugged in. I restart my computer and it works great (like it always does at first) and then at some point it stops recognizing it and start

                    So I installed minesweeper a year ago and it was working fine. But I tried to open it today and it shows Microsoft Minesweeper then closes. I don't know the problem. No updates and everything is up to date. What is the problem?

            Hey Cool.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try resetting the game at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Minesweeper &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Reset. 
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then try reinstalling the game by Uninstalling in the same place, restart PC, then reinstall from Microsoft Store app Settings &gt; My Library.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi cool1232212 
<br />
<br />You can try to reset that game, though you may loose any user data during that process
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Apps and locate Minesweeper in the resulting list
<br />
<br />Select that game, choose 'Advanced options and click Reset
<br />
<br />If that does not fix that game for you, your best option would be to uninstall and re-install that game . . .

    <title>Continued problems with blurry text and external monitors &#40;Jan - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geofflangdale  say:</h3>
<h2>            Continued problems with blurry text and external monitors &#40;Jan 2018&#41;</h2>
                    <p>On two entirely different setups that I have (both a work computer and a home computer) - with
<em>completely&nbsp;</em>different computers, monitors, cables, etc., I have encountered the identical problem: specifically, connecting an external monitor with a higher resolution than a laptop's native resolution on its regular screen just doesn't work right.
 Text is blurry and horrible. Scaling doesn't fix this. Neither do new cables, driver updates, messing with the Properties menu to launch in various weird modes, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost every thread I've seen about this has someone from Microsoft turning up, regular as clockwork, to suggest that it's a problem with hardware/drivers/cables/whatever. It is not. It is a defect in the operating system. This still doesn't work properly
 in Windows 10 even after Creator's update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost every thread I've seen also has "weirdo" solutions (set external monitor as 'main' monitor, sign-out and sign-in, replace cables, wave a dead chicken over the Properties menu), etc. Perhaps some of these solutions work, but frankly, I don't care -
 they are all time-consuming, ineffective or awkward. I'm particularly tired of all the fixes that amount to "change something random, sign-out, sign in again, hope for the best".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Microsoft ever going to fix this glaring deficiency? It's nuts that such a basic problem (a) still exists and (b) that Microsoft reps keep posting disingenuous "have you tried turning it off and on again" responses when people are asking for help with
 something that is *known* to be a problem in their *software*.</p>

<p>I will be honest with you. Most laptops people buy, are not very high end, not to mention it is a lap top and not a desktop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most likely your system memory, processors speed, video card memory and speed is just not enough to perform this in a good way. There just&nbsp;may not be enough system to do this efficiently.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but this response (while not from Microsoft), is completely typical of the sort of vague nonsense that derails every thread of this kind. You have absolutely no idea of what you're talking about. My laptop is has a recent model graphics card (the
 mobile version of the NVIDIA 1060) and is perfectly able to drive the display (it can actually drive a 4K display, and I'm only trying to use a 2650x1440), and I have driven such displays perfectly well with an inferior processor (6 years old!) and inferior
 graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't understand that this is a software problem in Windows 8 and 10 (that didn't exist in Windows 7, nor does it exist on other operating systems, including Linux) please don't inject random speculation into the thread. The advice you post below
 also does nothing to fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lowering my resolution works, but that's not the point (and the suggestion to dim the monitor brightness is completely unhelpful). I can drive 1920x1080 perfectly well, but I'm hooking up the external monitor so that I can use the added realization.</p>

</p><p>Hey listen here, I said at first, if you have a LOWER END LAPTOP, then you can experience this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>then you say that 1280x720 helps, therefore I see no nonsense. I been doing this a long time and run 3 monitors on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another person had this same issue and then said some settings for something were reset to default and fixed their issue. Click on my user name and look through my posts and see the topic for this same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do see you have plenty there to run two. I did not know this at first right?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So your ignorant obtuse reply was unnecessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe it is software issue, maybe hardware. I also know that setting 2 different resolutions on two screens can cause this too. Many things can cause it. I was only trying to help you buddy!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does your PC have Microsoft generic drivers and software for your display card.</p>
<p>Most likely yes, Unless you installed the drivers from the card CD for win 10 or downloaded and installed them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just like AMD cards, there is no Catalyst or Pro control center program installed by Microsoft which has many advanced display settings for the card such as my&nbsp;AMD Radeon dual cards running 3 out of possible 4 monitors. Windows 10 installed generic basic
 driver and no&nbsp;Control Center for&nbsp;advanced settings. I had to install&nbsp;software drivers&nbsp;for these features and install them&nbsp;and to also control the advanced setting for running 2 video cards. Even if I had one card, same facts. I did not need these drivers as
 my 3 run fine but I installed them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most likely you can go to Video card manufacturers website and download their current packages for windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the 2nd monitor whatever it is TV or Monitor, what size is it. maybe there is a physical setting on the front of that monitor, like most monitors have. Maybe it is a refresh rate issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck!</p>

<p>OK fair enough. Sorry to take my frustration out on you. But I've tried all the actionable things you suggest - all drivers are NVIDIA drivers, latest versions, etc. Tried the NVidia control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a software problem with Windows 10. It always has been. I had the identical problem with a laptop at work, tried everything, then just gave up on having proper resolution. It's clear that there are many potential *other* sources of the problem but the
 reason this is so pernicious is that at the root of it Windows 10 <strong>just doesn't really work&nbsp;</strong>reliably with external displays with different resolutions - so people get told to try 15 different things, but a lot of the time at the end of it all
 nothing works. Further, there are so many different possibilities for what's broken AND the sign-out-and-sign-in-again workflow (or maybe 'update 15 different things and reboot each time') for testing them is insane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still think going down to a lower resolution is a bad solution. The whole point of buying a relatively expensive 27" monitor with high resolution is to get the screen real estate of 2560x1440, not to blow up the pixels to finger-painting quality. I'm using
 Visual Studio and by default this uses a ton of screen space.</p>

</p><p>What's really frustrating is that I'm running Win 10 on a desktop hooked to the same monitor via another input (single monitor setup). It looks perfect (and it's a much older h/w setup that I'm using there). So MS has no inherent problem figuring out how

<p>OK fair enough. Sorry to take my frustration out on you. But I've tried all the actionable things you suggest - all drivers are NVIDIA drivers, latest versions, etc. Tried the NVidia control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a software problem with Windows 10. It always has been. I had the identical problem with a laptop at work, tried everything, then just gave up on having proper resolution. It's clear that there are many potential *other* sources of the problem but the
 reason this is so pernicious is that at the root of it Windows 10 <strong>just doesn't really work&nbsp;</strong>reliably with external displays with different resolutions - so people get told to try 15 different things, but a lot of the time at the end of it all
 nothing works. Further, there are so many different possibilities for what's broken AND the sign-out-and-sign-in-again workflow (or maybe 'update 15 different things and reboot each time') for testing them is insane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still think going down to a lower resolution is a bad solution. The whole point of buying a relatively expensive 27" monitor with high resolution is to get the screen real estate of 2560x1440, not to blow up the pixels to finger-painting quality. I'm using
 Visual Studio and by default this uses a ton of screen space.</p>

            Hi John
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Can you confirm if it is showing up in the BIOS?
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Disk Management
<br />
<br />Do you happen to see the drive there as unallocated disk?
<br />
<br />Also...
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Type: disk part
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Type list disk then hit Enter.
<br />
<br />This will reveal all attached storage devices. 
<br />
<br />To select the D drive if it shows up, type: select disk followed by the number then hit Enter – ie select disk 2. If you had more storage devices connected or attached, they would be listed as disk 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.
<br />
<br />Once the drive has been selected, type clean then hit Enter.
<br />
<br />Type create partition primary then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Type active then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Type format fs=NTFS label=”DRIVE LABEL HERE” quick then hit Enter
<br />
<br />This command will format and label the drive, e.g. format fs=ntfs label=”Backup”.
<br />
<br />Type exit and hit Enter again.

It doesn't show 2 drives in bios! I have a Dell XPS 8910. Yesterday their SupportAssistant software indicated that there was a important download available. It was a Bios update. I ran the update and after it rebooted I had no boot drive! When I brought the
 disk management system up it didn't show any drives available!!! I have Acronis 2019 running incremental backsups, so I booted from the Recovery CD and it found a drive! I actually have 2 HDD's a 2TB Seagate and a 1TB Toshiba. I run 2 backup routines 1 for
 system and one for data(2GB Seagate). I needed my system running so I did the system drive restore and I had a running PC&nbsp; :-}. But I now have only the one drive. Extremely agitated with Dell at this point!!!! Diskpart didn't show my internal drives only my
 seagate and external usb 1 TB Seagate

<br />If that does not work and you have a desktop computer...
<br />
<br />Power down 
<br />Unplug it
<br />Open the system unit
<br />
<br />Remove the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in, start the machine, wait 10 seconds
<br />
<br />Power down, unplug it, reinstall the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in again, power up
<br />
<br />Check if it then shows up.

<h3> jonbenson_2013  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD - DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE - storport.sys</h2>
                    <p>While shutting down this evening, my computer blue-screened with a DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE. When I opened Blue Screen View to look at the minidump file, I noticed that it had apparently blue-screened a number of other times recently, but this is the first
 time I've actually seen the BSOD. The other two most recent times were times when I was away from my computer; not sure about the ones before that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the dump files except one point to storport.sys as the cause of the problem; the other was hal.dll. But I don't really know what that means or which driver(s) need to be fixed. Can anyone help?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've uploaded the DMP files to this <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gf0olydzqbbbfrp/AADLRh8Lmq2Dm2VlgVZA2ZRYa?dl=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Windows 10 Edge Start page showing blank after anniversary update</h2>
                    <p>Since the upgrade to the new anniversary update on Aug. 2nd, when I launch the Edge browser, the start page is blank. It only shows the top sites on the top but no suggested content underneath it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought the upgrade to anniversary edition did not go well, so I restored back to before and did it again. But, result is same.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 Education. I know in this version, Cortana was removed. Now the search icon is a magnifying class and Cortana is gone. Did they remove the suggested site from showing up in Education version in Anniversary update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>I tried both and neither one fix the issue. I have another PC with Windows 10 Pro which was upgraded to Anniversary Edition and Edge does not have this blank start page issue. I suspect it is because of the version that I am running is Windows 10 Education
 edition. Some reason, Education Edition has&nbsp;the start page of Edge to show no suggested content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone from Microsoft support that can confirm this? Or, is this a bug in Edge?</p>

<h2>            How to open multiple windows</h2>
                    <p>Whereas I used to open multiple windows, I can't seem to be able to do this with 8.1.</p>
<p>When I have several open windows on my task bar,&nbsp; I can't see how to open more than one at a time.</p>
<p>No, I don't want to get into the start screens.</p>
<p>I do use skydrive and I use dropbox.</p>
<p>Something as simple as opening dropbox and sizing it to one side of my screen then opening up my mail and downloading attachments so I can copy and move to dropbox used to be a simple procedure. I can't seem to do the things that were so easy in the past
 now that I am using with 8.1.</p>
<p>I'd like to copy to dropbox, close dropbox and open skydrive without having to jump through hoops to copy email attachments.</p>
<p>Help, please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steve Koenig</p>

</p><p>If you need a recommendation of a good desktop-based email program, I use the mail program from

            <p>Thank you for trying to help me isolate the cause of the problems I seem to be having with windows 8.1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been using msn.com for my email for many years.</p>
<p>The problem I am having is not specific to opening email and another program.</p>
<p>The problem is opening any two windows on my task bar, such as my photos in one window and my Dropbox files in another. I can never get two or more windows open at once without having to open everything through the start screens.</p>

            <p>That's fine, the Start screen might be bigger with big icons, but the function hasn't changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 7, you might have gone:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start &gt; Programs &gt; Outlook<br />
<br />
then<br />
<br />
</li><li>Start &gt; Programs &gt; Paintbrust</li></ol>
<p>Once you have both programs open, you can use them just like you have for the past 25 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>--</p>
<p>
</p><p>This works the same way in Windows 8. Just because the Start screen has bigger icons than the old Start menu, doesn't mean that the operation actually behaves different.&nbsp; After you open your email program and your drop box files, you can drag them around
 in any order or arrangement on the screen you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use OneDrive instead of DropBox, but the concept is the same.&nbsp; Here's my OneDrive folder, along with my email program, both running on the desktop in Windows 8.&nbsp; It's identical to Windows 7:</p>

            <p>I do appreciate your replies and want to try to be clear what difficulties I am having.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 7 I clicked on start and selected photos. Then I would go to the appropriate folder of the pictures I was wanting to copy and paste.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I would minimize this and open dropbox from a desktop icon.</p>
<p>Once I had dropbox open and sized and both windows open,&nbsp;I would simply right click from the large photo thumbnail and click on copy then&nbsp;go to the location where I wanted the photos to be pasted in dropbox by right clicking and selecting paste. Simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I found I no use for all the distractions of the multiple start screens that came with windows 8.1, I had someone familiar with 8.1&nbsp; install a patch to open windows 8.1 to the familiar desktop screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am trying to eliminate as many variables as possible to isolate the problem so I tried to do as you described.
</p>
<p>I begrudging went to the cumbersome &nbsp;(personal opinion I realize) start screen and selected and opened up my OneDrive&nbsp;destination. This isn't where I actually want to put the photos, but did want to try to follow your suggestions as closely as possible.
</p>
<p>After shrinking my OneDrive destination to one side of the screen, I again went to the start screen and selected the desktop. From there I opened up my photos stored on the computer. I was able to get both up at the same time.</p>
<p>Just a note - &nbsp;I still don't think with 8.1 I could get more than two windows open at the same time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With both windows now open I selected the photo to copy to OneDrive by right clicking it and selecting copy. I moved my cursor to the OneDrive location and right clicked and do NOT get the option to paste.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This just doesn't work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading and any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>On the Windows 8 desktop there should be no difference or limit to how many windows you can show at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This picture is a Windows 8 desktop for instructions I created for another purpose, but as you can see I have several windows dragged around the screen, basically the same as it would have been since Windows 95:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bb986465-d07a-4489-980a-b4c8fbb84aba" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds to me like what's probably getting you into a sticky spot is that you're opening the tablet (full screen) apps.&nbsp; I wouldn't use those if I were you - I would recommend you just stay on the desktop and use the traditional floating (non-tablet) programs,
 so that it's the same as it was before you got Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually wrote a little bit about how to do this, it takes about 1 minute to setup the first time, but after that I bet you'll be in a more familiar comfortable environment where you can work the way you're accustomed to.&nbsp; If you won't mind trying my suggestion,
 that would be here:</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>I read and followed your instructions per your link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me start out as simply as possible with what doesn't seem to work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the desktop I opened up YouTube.&nbsp; I resized this and then clicked on yahoo.</p>
<p>Now neither are showing on my task bar. When yahoo opens, YouTube disappears.</p>
<p>I thought perhaps it was simply on top of the other open window so I tried to move it over and it moved without anything under it. When I minimize the now open yahoo, neither show up on my task bar. The symbol for IE does show up on my task bar and when
 I click on that, both programs show up as open. </p>
<p>I have been unable to get both to show up. I tried other sites and applications and for some reason when I open the second, the first goes away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems very basic, but with this not working for me nothing more advanced has a chance of working.</p>
<p>Is this something you have ever heard about?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p />

</p><p>Are you opening a YouTube app, or opening Internet Explorer and then going to YouTube.com website?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, open Internet Explorer from your taskbar <strong><em>e</em></strong> icon instead of from the Start screen and it should work more like you expect as a free floater.</p>

            <p>I just clicked on Internet Explorer from my task bar and MSN came up. I left it on the screen and clicked on Internet Explorer again to open another window and MSN disappeared. When I open another site, such as google, google shows up and MSN is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried an alternative way to get two windows open and that is I opened up Internet Explorer and got MSN on the screen. Instead of trying to open another window via Internet Explorer, I got to the internet via another search site, DuckDuckGo to open another
 site. When the new site, google, comes up, MSN goes away.</p>
<p>I checked to make sure the http for these sites were the basic sites, that is, google.com and msn.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe my total frustration with windows 8.1 is the result of something causing the inability to open more than a window at a time. I was able to open two windows when I went through the start menus, but I really do not want to have to go there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what is happening or if this happens to anyone else.</p>

    <title>Surface Laptop not showing full ultrawidescreen resolution - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> commanderthor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Laptop not showing full ultrawidescreen resolution</h2>
                    <p>I have a surface Laptop i5 model, bought mid 2018 so I assume the 2nd version. I bought an LG 25 inch ultrawide screen monitor. Also bought a HDMI to mini display cable (not an adapter, a cable that converts. Plugged the surface laptop to the monitor and
 it immediately displayed, but only at 1920 resolution, and not ultra widescreen resolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things to know:</p>
<p>- First and foremost.... if I simply unplug the cable from the surface laptop and plug into my surface pro 2, it immediately shows a perfect ultrawide screen resolution as expected. So surely it's nothing to do with the hardware.</p>
<p>- the display adapter for the laptop says "Intel(R) HD Graphics 620". I have updated the drivers and it says its up to date.</p>
<p>- I tried downloading generic intel graphic drivers but wont let me install with an error saying the manufacturer has prevented me being able to install the driver.</p>
<p>- I've tried multiple cables. The one I am currently using is a cheapie, but have also tried a more expensive Belkin cable and still didn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- I have tried reducing the frequency of the ultra wide screen monitor and it still wont let me go to an ultrawidescreen resolution.</p>
<p>- I have tried both HDMI ports on the monitor, neither worked, but again, its not the setup because it works perfectly fine with my surface pro 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is much appreciated. Kinda **** that the latest and greatest laptop doesn't work, but the old school works flawlessly. I guess Microsoft quality has gone down hill.</p>

            Alright, I finally managed to set the 2560x1080 resolution on my Surface Laptop 2. The downside is that I am not able to define what it took to finally switch to the desired resolution as I have performed so many actions. I still think the issue was caused
 by the combination of outdated drivers and miniDP&lt;&gt;HDMI adapter.

<p><span>Hi Krisbasar,
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for using
<strong>Microsoft Answers </strong>Forums!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Microsoft Sync Framework</span></strong><span>
 is a data synchronization platform from Microsoft that can be used to synchronize data across multiple data stores. We can restore the IE to default settings instead of turning off the RSS Feeds.
</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Optimize IE</span></strong></span><span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Clear cached data in Internet Explorer</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To determine whether a performance issue or an error message is caused by corruption in the temporary Internet
 files or in other cached information that is used by Internet Explorer, you must clear cached data. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
<strong>Internet Explorer 7</strong> </span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Open Internet Explorer 7.
</span></li><li>
<span>Click <strong>
Tools</strong>, and then click <strong>Delete Browsing History</strong>. </span></li><li>
<span>In <strong>Delete Browsing History</strong>, click
<strong>Delete All</strong>. </span></li><li>
<span>Click to select the
<strong>Also delete files and settings stored by add-ons</strong> check box, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>. </span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Internet Explorer 8</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Open Internet Explorer 8.
</span></li><li>
<span>Click <strong>
Safety</strong>, and then click <strong>Delete Browsing History</strong>. </span>
</li><li>
<span>In <strong>Delete Browsing History</strong> area, click
<strong>Delete</strong>. </span></li></ol>
<p><span>A progress bar is displayed to indicate that the browsing history is being cleared. After this process is complete,
 test Internet Explorer to verify that it works correctly. If issues still occur, try Method 2.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Reset security settings for Internet Explorer</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you configure security settings to be too restrictive, you may prevent Internet Explorer from displaying
 certain Web sites. To determine whether an issue is caused by overly restrictive security settings, revert to default security settings. To do this, follow these steps:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Open Internet Explorer.
</span></li><li>
<span>Click <strong>
Tools</strong>, and then click <strong>Internet Options</strong>. </span></li><li>
<span>Click the <strong>
Security</strong> tab. </span></li><li>
<span>Click <strong>
Reset all zones to default level</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>After you do this, test Internet Explorer to verify that it works correctly. If issues still occur, try Method
 3. <br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> If this method does not resolve the issue, you can restore Internet Explorer to its previous security level.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3: Run Internet Explorer in "No Add-Ons" mode
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Internet Explorer add-ons, such as ActiveX controls and browser toolbars, are used by some Web sites to provide
 an enhanced browsing experience. An error may occur if an add-on is damaged or if an add-on conflicts with Internet Explorer. To determine whether the error is caused by an add-on, run Internet Explorer in "No Add-Ons" mode. To do this, follow these steps:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Click <strong>
Start</strong>, and then type <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box.
</span></li><li>
<span>Click <strong>
Internet Explorer (No Add-Ons)</strong>. Internet Explorer opens without add-ons, toolbars, or plug-ins.
</span></li><li>
<span>Test Internet Explorer to verify that it works correctly. If issues still occur, try Method 4.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>If no errors occur, the problem is caused by one of the add-ons that typically load together with Internet Explorer.
 In this case, use one of the following options. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Option 1: Reset Internet Explorer</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Reset Internet Explorer to its default configuration. This step will also disable any add-ons, plug-ins, or
 toolbars that are installed. Although this solution is quick, it also means that, if you want to use any of those add-ons in the future, they must be reinstalled. To reset Internet Explorer settings, use Method 4.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Option 2: Use the Manage Add-ons tool to determine which add-on is causing the issue</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Use the Manage Add-ons tool in Internet Explorer to individually disable each add-on to determine which add-on
 is causing errors. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
<strong>Internet Explorer 7 </strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Open Internet Explorer 7.
</span></li><li>
<span>Click <strong>
Tools</strong>, point to <strong>Manage Add-ons</strong>, and then click <strong>
Enable or Disable Add-ons</strong>. </span></li><li>
<span>In the <strong>
Show</strong> box, select <strong>Add-ons that have been used by Internet Explorer</strong> to display all add-ons that are installed on the computer.
</span></li><li>
<span>For each item in this list, select the add-on, and then click
<strong>Disable</strong> under <strong>Settings</strong>. </span></li><li>
<span>When you have disabled all the items in this list, click
<strong>OK</strong>. </span></li><li>
<span>Exit and then restart Internet Explorer 7.
</span></li><li>
<span>If issues do not occur, repeat steps 1 through 3.
</span></li><li>
<span>Click <strong>
Enable</strong> for a single add-on. </span></li><li>
<span>Repeat steps 6 through 8 until you determine which add-on causes errors to occur.
</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Internet Explorer 8</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Open Internet Explorer 8.
</span></li><li>
<span>Click <strong>
Tools</strong>, and then click <strong>Manage Add-ons</strong>. </span></li><li>
<span>On the <strong>
Show</strong> drop-down menu, select <strong>All add-ons</strong> to display all add-ons that are installed on the computer.
</span></li><li>
<span>For each item in this list, select the add-on, and then click
<strong>Disable</strong> in the Information window. </span></li><li>
<span>When you have disabled all the items in this list, click
<strong>OK</strong>. </span></li><li>
<span>Exit and then restart Internet Explorer.
</span></li><li>
<span>If issues do not reoccur, repeat steps 1 through 3.
</span></li><li>
<span>Click <strong>
Enable</strong> for a single add-on. </span></li><li>
<span>Repeat steps 6 through 8 until you determine which add-on causes errors to occur.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>After you have used this process to determine which add-on is causing errors, you can disable that add-on.
 Or, you can uninstall the software that installs the add-on. We also recommend that you contact the software vendor that provided the add-on for additional troubleshooting and support.

    <title>Entered an Incorrect PIN too Many Times - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harish3k  say:</h3>
<h2>            Entered an Incorrect PIN too Many Times</h2>
                    <p>Looks like this is a common issue "Entered an Incorrect PIN too Many Times"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am hitting this problem when my Dell XPS Desktop go to sleep and awake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't even type single key, but appears that some back ground process input random letters without me typing anything. It happens so fast</p>
<p>that only option I have to click OK. After couple of times hitting OK (Without me entering any PIN). I see msg "enter an incorrect PIN too Many times"</p>
<p>
</p><p>After re-boot, window 10 will prompt me to enter 8 alphanumeric text challenge (e,g, "BGY4TD"). because I had too many incorrect PIN input.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(In fact i didn't even input 1st number of my PIN)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When start typing&nbsp; B and then G,&nbsp; B is replaced by G and when I type Y, G is replace by Y.&nbsp;</p>
<p>so I am never able to enter challenge word.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I am not able to enter challenge word, Windows 10&nbsp; &nbsp;never give me prompt to input PIN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rebooted couple of times but same issue. Prompt me to enter challenge and I am never able to enter challenge because each previous input letter is&nbsp; replace by new one that I typed. (tried insert key but not effect)</p>
<p>
</p><p>One time I hit F2 while booting and change BIOS setting (Some kind VM setting) and it worked. But issue came back when windows 10 went to sleep&nbsp; (took 1 hour break) and came back alive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen similar issue when I click on chrome or Edge Browser bar, without typing anything letter and number automatically appears and keep on going. Once I run into such situation, no matter which text input box I click - random character start appearing
 as if somebody is typing 1000 words per seconds. I just have to hit power button and restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe both issues are same except that while logging I could see error msg "Enter an incorrect PIN to many times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issues is so bad that I stop using Windows 10 and Switch to MacBook and use external display (which was connected to Win10)&nbsp;</p>

<br />3. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

            If you have an external keyboard then disconnect it &amp; use the onscreen keyboard- bottom right-hand corner, 3 quarter circle, osk. 
<br />It may be there's several stuck keys including the delete button.
<br />If doing this the log in screen still does the same then you may have malware.

                    <p>What I do:</p>

            Hi Emile
<br />
<br />File associations are officially broken in Windows 10, lots of users are reporting they cannot get file associations to stick permanently . . .
<br />
<br />Here is a very old way of making that file association, it should be worth a try:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator
<br />
<br />Paste this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />assoc .srt=txtfile
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Double click an srt file, does it open in Notepad?       
        </p>

            Hi Emile, yes, ut it is a bit of a process . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />Open Sublime Text
<br />
<br />Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift +Esc)
<br />
<br />Find Sublime Text in the list of processes
<br />
<br />Right click that and choose Open File Location
<br />
<br />Note down the exact location of Sublime Text
<br />
<br />Close all open applications
<br />
<br />
<br />Open Command Prompt as Administrator
<br />
<br />Paste this Command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />assoc .srt=srtfile
<br />
<br />Paste this Command (Replacing the location and name of the Sublime Executable)
<br />
<br />ftype txtfile=c:\Program Files\Accessories\wordpad.exe "%1"
<br />
<br />That's It!
