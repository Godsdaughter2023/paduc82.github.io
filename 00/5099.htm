<p>Hi Hassan,</p>
<p>In Office 365, we usually follow the procedure below to deal with your scenario:</p>
<p>1. Back up data.</p>
<p>1) Mailbox items:</p>
<p>a. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Configure the user’s email account on a new Outlook profile</a>.</p>
<p>b. <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Export-or-back-up-messages-calendar-tasks-and-contacts-d791fe88-5c67-44c5-a3f6-a484508082a1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Export all mailbox items to a PST file</a>.</p>
<p>c. <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Import-Outlook-items-from-an-Outlook-Data-File-pst-345ad0da-7bc0-4a02-9cb7-2d1cf48ba8e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Import the PST file to your Outlook profile</a> when you need to access the mailbox data. You can create a new Outlook profile without an email account associated to access it so that you needn’t worry data confusing.</p>
<p>2)OneDrive for Business Online items:</p>
<p>Follow the steps in <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Sync-OneDrive-for-Business-or-site-libraries-to-your-computer-23e1f12b-d896-4cb1-a238-f91d19827a16" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a> to sync OneDrive for Business Online data to your computer as backup.</p>
<p>2. Remove the user’s Office 365 license.</p>
<p>3. Assign the license to another new account if there is a new employee in your company.</p>
<p>If anything is unclear or you encounter any problem during the procedure, feel free to let us know.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Larry</p>

<p>Hi Larry,</p>
<p>thank you for your answer.</p>
<p>but your explanations for email &amp; onedrive involve a local backup of datas.</p>
<p>It's a pity to remove datas from online services.</p>
<p>I wonder if it's possible to keep datas online with a limited license (cheap) and continue accessing the account online for a while until not necessary.</p>
<p>but the problem is that the user seems to be active for other users (GAL).</p>
<p>is there a way to "disable" an account , make it "not visible" for other users , and active for the administrator ?</p>
<p>thank you,</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi Hassanb,</p>
<p>Yes, you can make the user's mailbox an inactive mailbox. You can turn the mailbox into an inactive mailbox by placing it on In-Place Hold or Litigation Hold and then removing the corresponding Office 365 account. The contents of an inactive mailbox are
 preserved for the duration of the hold that was placed on the mailbox before it was made inactive. For more information about inactive mailboxes, please refer to:</p>

<p>Please let me know if this is exactly what you want, if not, please feel free to post back and tell me your detailed requirement.</p>

<h2>            One Note File tab</h2>
                    <p>The "File" tab option on my OneNote menu bar has disappeared. I now only have "Home" as the first tab which means I have no option to "Save As" or "Send". I can't send my notes by email which is useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to restore this tab&nbsp;and get back the send or export options? J.</p>

            <p>Hi Praveen</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Surface Pro 3 running windows 10, upgraded from 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under 8.1 One Note worked fine and I had all the tabs and full functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have however, since placing this post,&nbsp;just upgraded to 365 2016 and since then (obviously at a cost) I now have my full tabs back! Consequently I haven't taken a screen shot of my original version of One Note.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its annoying that I had to do that and can only assume that windows 10 changed something which stopped One Note having full functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to me anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jon</p>

<h2>            Word 2016 saves to d.docs.live.net instead of LOCAL drive, no matter what I do</h2>
                    <p>Word 2016 saves to d.docs.live.net. I try to get it to save to my local drive. It adds a lot of hang time, while I wait for each save to connect to the internet. I am a speed user and this slows me way down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This week, it has added a new twist. I click "Save" and it brings up a "Windows Security" window that says "Connecting to d.doc.live.net, Enter your credentials" and asks for my user name and password. If I click "Cancel", it then takes me to "This PC/Documents",
 not to the local folder I opened from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's all this complicated stuff of looking to the web to save. I don't need this or want it. I save everything to my local drive on my computer, and then I have OneDrive in the background updating OneDrive on the web and then to my other computer and phone.
 So, I don't need this added step of having Word try to save to the web OneDrive every time I click "Save".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Word Option, I already have checked "Save to Computer by default". It seems like this is the solution but it doesn't work. I also have checked "Don't show the Backstage when opening or closing files" and have unchecked "Show additional places for saving,
 even if sign-in may be required". My default local file location is set to "D:\OneDrive\2016\, which is where I want everything saved by default.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent dozens of hours and have not been able to solve this. Please help.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi CDB &amp; MLK - sorry to see we are inflicting pain as you work with Office. I'm going to give you a bit of background on why things are set up the way they are and then hopefully get you working the way you want to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First - we look at cloud storage as having three big advantages:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1/ "safe storage" - your PC explodes, you don't lose your data</p>
<p>
</p><p>2/ "global storage" - you can get to your files from any device, and even replicate it locally for offline access</p>
<p>
</p><p>3/ "shareable storage" - documents stored in the cloud can be shared with other folks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>========================================</p>
<p>
</p><p>We feel that safety (1/) alone is enough for us&nbsp; to make the cloud the default, to ensure that people who don't know/don't care where their data lives will usually&nbsp;have a safe backup and the ability to revert to older versions after those "oops" moments
 -&nbsp;&nbsp;our aim is to deliver "it just works" experiences and keep our customers safe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Replication (2/) is useful for folks who move from device to device, and you've noticed that we fix up the File Open MRU&nbsp;"most recently used" list (which roams with most users) to target the cloud copy so that all of your devices can share/open these documents
 from the MRU and you don't need to type/remember long URL for OneDrive or SharePoint stores.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, the last of the background, as part of (3/) we work to provide maximum concurrent access to the document to allow multiple users to open the same, shared document simultaneously. This support varies from client to client (sometimes just the Web client,
 sometimes just the desktop) but is a very effective way of a team of folks coming together in a document and being productive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=========================================</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case I understand that you want to work with the benefits of (1/) &amp; (2/) but not (3/) (your feedback is that server-hosted file save and even the initial open is just too slow) - I think you can get set up the way you want by doing a couple of things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A/ In the OneDrive sync client (exposed as the white&nbsp;cloud icon in the system tray area) ensure that Office integration is off. We're pushing through a lot of sync optimizations here at the moment so the UI to do this is pretty fluid - for example on my
 own&nbsp;PC&nbsp;there is an "Office" tab, with a single option to uncheck.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>There is a downside to this (which applies to other cloud storage providers as well) - if you change the locally synced file at the same time as another user changes the server file/another synced copy then you'll see "forks" (multiple copies of the
 file with a version number added to the name) and you'll have to reconcile the changes yourself by comparing files.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>B/ In the Office app clear your MRU (file open, right mouse on the recent files, then "clear unpinned documents") - you need to do this as otherwise we'll remember that they are server files and open from the server directly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>C/ Now open sync'ed documents by treating them&nbsp;like other local files and navigating to the sync folder via "This PC"&nbsp;and opening the document/or starting from Windows File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>One last data point for you, we are working on substantial performance improvements&nbsp;in this area, we've started with the Enterprise "OneDrive for Business" client and will pivot to the OneDrive client soon (next couple of months).</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be changing the flow to open the locally synced copy (and get you started with your read/edit session) and then syncing up with the server without getting in your way. Big architectural changes&nbsp;are required for this but things are looking&nbsp;much faster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading, and again, sorry for the pain....pc&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>OK, I hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the issue is related to the one-drive sync settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click the OneDrive icon in the notifications area, and check settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then under Settings tab, ensure the "Use office to work on files with other people at the same time" is checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart your MS word or office, and hopefully that does the trick for you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked for me.&nbsp; (And when it is unchecked, I get the dreaded d.docs.live problem, which I agree is not efficient).</p>

<p>Hello tcpipimp,</p>
<p>Microsoft limits the number of times one can download a trial of Office per email account.</p>
<p>Maybe someone needed another trial download and randomly typed in text that ended up being your email address, or maybe "ant hill" just made a typo when entering his/her email address?</p>

            <p>If I read your question correctly you are getting 1000s of bounce messages for emails you have not sent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two possible reasons for this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. You have a trojan which is sending out emails.&nbsp; Not too likely as if you were blasting out vast quantities of spam then your ISP would have closed you down by now.&nbsp; Do a virus/trojan scan anyway to check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. A spammer is spoofing your email address - the most common reason.&nbsp; They send out the spam and you get the bounce messages for addresses which are not valid.&nbsp; Don't take it personally, they will normally move to a different address within a few days.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Calendar Conditional Formatting</h2>
                    <p>Hey Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that I can set specific conditional formatting to make calendar appointments show up a different color based on certain criteria that I set. I am wondering if there is a way to apply my conditional formatting to ALL employees in my company, so that
 they can see the same colors that I do based on my conditional formatting rules on my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just looking for a way to avoid having to manually type the conditional formatting onto each of my employees computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi AaronSpiritos,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the late response, your case has just moved into our category. Based on my experience, it's not feasible to share view settings to others in Outlook. If you'd like us introduce this feature
 into Outlook, you may send us a feedback via the following link: <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows</a> Many features of current programs might be designed and upgraded based on customers’ feedback. Users' experience is the crucial motivation that we continuously improve our products.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a workaround, you may send a teaching message to users in your organization to teach them how to manually set up view settings like yours.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leo</p>

<p>This happened quite a bit on early 5800s. Check first if you are able to update the software (see
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/softwareupdate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.nokia.com/softwareupdate</a>), several updates have been available for this model (depending on your regional/network variant).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise, back up your personal data, reformat the phone with the code *#7370# and afterwards take care to set the time and date correctly the first time the phone starts up after the reformat. This should resolve the issue.</p>

    <title>Word 365 -- Word Warp Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> relentlesspry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 365 -- Word Warp Issue</h2>
                    <p>The bug happens when you finish a sentence that wraps to the beginning of the next line. I have been able to replicate this bug many times in multiple documents.<br />
</p>
<p>1. Place the cursor at the&nbsp;<em>beginning</em> of any line <em>after </em>the first line in a paragraph.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Press the backspace key. The space between the first word on the current line and the last word on the previous line will be deleted, and the two words will combine into one word (or word jumble).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Press the spacebar. The words will separate, like normal, but now the word from the previous line will have "warped" to the beginning of the the current line. There will be empty space on the previous line, unless you have Justify turned on for the paragraph,
 in which case the remaining words will spread out to accommodate for the missing word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening and closing the document will return everything to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked through the community and didn't see anything like this bug, so I started a new post on the subject. If anyone else knows of a post, the mods can close this one and hopefully post a link. Otherwise, can anyone else reproduce the issue? Is there
 a fix for it that doesn't involve me closing the document?</p>

<h2>            Outlook Calendar not sending invites from certain email address</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently have encountered an issue where I cannot send calendar invites from the Outlook application from a specific email address. Everything works fine when sending invites with my personal gmail account, but when trying to send using another google
 account, it will not send the calendar invites out. I can create the invite and press send and it will show up on my calendar just fine, however will not actually send to participants. Then, when I open the invite, it shows the blue bar "this invitation has
 not been sent".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can however send invites from that account when I use the google web application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have no idea what's going on here it didn't seem to be linked to an update either, at least that I noticed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />
Janice</p>

<p>Louie -</p>
<p>Thank you for the quick response and detailed reply.</p>
<p>Apologies...&nbsp; I may not have worded my question correctly.</p>
<p>I'm wondering if it is possible to search for the&nbsp;<em>"Important (Ctrl +2)" </em>
<p>As I work with each notebook I add the "Important" star to indicate items that are a priority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to be able to search across all notebooks for Stars in each.</p>
<p>Is this possible or can anyone recommend a better option.</p>

<p><span>Do you mean searching all notebooks that contain <strong>Important</strong> tags (Star icon) within the pages? If yes, have you already tried checking the

 with further information about searching for tagged notes in OneNote. I’ve tried replicating this as well and I’ve got the list of notes that were tagged as Important. It provides the list of the

    <title>App Installation Error Code 80073CF9 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hwalker84  say:</h3>
<h2>            App Installation Error Code 80073CF9</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have an App Install issue that I hope someone from the WP team can assist with. I've done a billion soft resets.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Lumia 1520 OS version 8.10.14219.341 Firmware Cyan<br />
App's defaulting to the SDCard<br />
<br />
A few days ago Microsoft Health was updated. For some reason the app progress bar would get to around 35% and never move. It stayed this way for hours. I canceled the download and tried several more times with various states of antennas being on or off . The
 download would be stuck around 35%.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I also tried to move the app from the sdcard to the local storage. That was unsuccessful. I then uninstalled the app and tried installing it from the store. Error code 80073cf9<br />
<br />
I changed the default from the SDCard to the phone Error code 80073cf9. I tried to another SD card Error code 80073cf9. I tried without an SD card Error code 80073cf9. I tried to download the file and installing locally to the SDCard or phone Error code 80073cf9.
 Nothing works. I'm getting sick of Error code 80073cf9.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like a resolution without hard resetting the phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? </p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply,</p>
<p>This is quiet unusual situation, specially that it occurs only with a single app.<br />
<br />
I would advise you to process the following :</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please Sign In with the Used on the phone Microsoft Account (you can double check its' email address in Settings &gt; Email+ Accounts) to the web site :</span></p>
<p><a href="https://account.live.com/SummaryPage.aspx?mkt=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://account.live.com/SummaryPage.aspx?mkt=en-us<br />
</span></a><span>And&nbsp;update all the information there.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After that is done, Sign In to the :
</span><a href="https://account.xbox.com/en-US/Profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://account.xbox.com/en-US/Profile<br />
</span></a><span>This&nbsp;should Create your Microsoft Account's Xbox Live Profile, (needed for Windows Phone Store)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Next web site to visit and again Update the profile information is :</span></p>
<p><a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com/PaymentHub/Profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://commerce.microsoft.com/PaymentHub/Profile<br />
<br />
</span></a><span>And a last one :
</span><a href="http://g.live.com/0fsenus4/nexusmigrate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://g.live.com/0fsenus4/nexusmigrate</span></a><span><br />
This link should take you to outlook.com web site, in some situations it will present you with a terms of use to accept, if so please do that.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now that you have your Microsoft Account's Profile updated.</span></p>
<p><span>Soft Reset the Phone (Volume Down + Power Buttons, hold together for about 15 seconds)</span></p>
<p><span>When the phone turns back on go to&nbsp;Settings &gt; Date + Time, disable automatic and manually set the correct Date and Time.</span></p>
<p><span>Next Settings &gt; Find My Phone - Enable all options there Please,</span></p>
<p><span>Settings &gt; Backup - Enable all options there,</span></p>
<p><span>Settings &gt; Applications &gt; Internet Explorer - Delete browsing history.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Last thing to do would be in Settings &gt; Email + Accounts, over there tap and hold your finger on your Microsoft Account and Select Sync.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank You.</span></p>
<p><span>Marek.</span></p>

            <p>It happens with multiple apps. Everything is good, apps installed all the registration information and everything you ask for is done then all of a sudden it refuses to install updates. Nothing has changed, apps were updated before with no problem, integral
 apps to the OS, built in ones like music and sky drive. Then all of a sudden this error comes up on every update that becomes available. Twice I have had to completely wipe and reset my phone because NOBODY here can give a straight answer, probably because
 NOBODY KNOWS and is guessing.</p>
<p>It's not settings, it's not a new SD card, it's not a storage space issue, none of these have changed. I do not nor have I ever had a developer version, only the official windows 8.1. I am tired of this and refuse to reset this phone again.
</p>
<p>As much as I support MS and hate Google and Apple I am contiplating getting an android phone, at least then all these advertised apps will work, ones for my vehicle , ones for my bank, ones for many many services that refuse to develop for windows phone
 because of all this buggyness. </p>
<p>Windows phone 10 is coming out and 8.1 doesn't even work. I don't get it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please answer exactly what error code 80073cf9 means?&nbsp; What is the error?&nbsp; Quit guessing as to what caused it and give a definition of what it is, someone must know.</p>

            <p>Wskrs, well said, I love your passion, clear and crisp. YES! Nobody knows... Or probably some big sorcerer knows but has no time for us, so we are left to the apprentice which, like in the story, got things out of his control.</p>
<p>I wish I could hear back from you after moving to android or ios (I am stuck with windows too). Just curious if life is really free of bugs and bumps there.</p>
<p>And, to add my guess, I just got the issue with&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">error code 80073cf9 (which brought me here) when trying to install a new version of an app that I had on my phone (Nokia Lumia 1520 Windows
 Phone 8.1). What did the trick for me was to uninstall the old version of the app, then the installation of new version went through.</span></p>

            <p>I think I'm going back to Android also..&nbsp; I love the interface on Windows phone but the developer and support incompetence and marketing ignorance has resulted in product that is broken at best..&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sick of these problems with all Microsoft products that can only be solved by reset, reinstall, reboot, rebuild, reconfigure..&nbsp; No one can actually help..&nbsp;&nbsp; There are no tools to help with diagnosing..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been a somewhat nice experience but I need a functional device and in my opinion Windows Phone is just not meeting that definition..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should have known better than to believe Microsoft could&nbsp;deliver a functional and reliable product.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I refuse to hard reset my phone to get an app to work.. Instead I'm moving&nbsp;back to what's worked in the past - Android. &nbsp; My contract is up and if I'm going to spend my time setting up a device then I'm going to make that effort WORTH my time.. Windows phone,
 Windows, MSN.. even Microsoft and all their flawed development, ignorant marketing,&nbsp;and lousy support is simply NOT worth MY time.

    <title>Why have I been asked to update my security details&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bacchantegirl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why have I been asked to update my security details&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been asked by Outlook Express to update my security details.&nbsp; I did not request this - and I had to get a new email account (I used Yahoo) in order to comply with the questions I was forced to go through (it would not accept my Gmail account as it
 said it was already linked to my Outlook Express account).&nbsp; When I had gone through the procedure (successfully), I was sent an email saying that my new (Yahoo) email address 'had started a process to replace all of the security info for my Microsoft account.&nbsp;
 If this was you, please disregard the rest of this email. If this wasn't you, a malicious user might know your password and is trying to gain access to your account. They were unable to access your account, but you must still cancel their request and change
 your password. To do so, click "This wasn't me".'&nbsp; I didn't click 'this wasn't me' as that email address belonged to me (even though it had been created to comply with the the procedure and hadn't instigated it).&nbsp; I wondered if this had happened to anyone
 else - and if anyone had any advice about what I should do (if anything).&nbsp; Thanks :)</p>

<p>I have been asked by Outlook Express to update my security details.&nbsp; I used my partners e-mail address and received a four digit code...the code did not work and&nbsp;I was asked for a seven digit code.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also received&nbsp;an email saying that&nbsp;the email address

</p>
<p>The next screen said (<em>Did you request a security info change? Someone with the email address of
</em><em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em><em> started a process to change the password or security info for this Microsoft account, and it will be available again on 4/6/2014.

            <p>I don't know what's going on either, I'm afraid.&nbsp; I don't know if this is a process that Microfsoft initiates every so often, or whether it is because someone else has tried to access your account.&nbsp; I am lucky in that at least the code I was sent 'worked'.&nbsp;
 But I had to create a new email address in order to receive it (I picked a different provider).&nbsp; I tried using a friend's email address.&nbsp; But, because he didn't respond immediately, I got locked out and had to sign in and give another email address (one which
 I had immediate access to).&nbsp; I already have an email account I use associated with my Outlook/Hotmail account - but I couldn't use that as I was told it was already associated with the account.&nbsp; So, I'm stumped as to what's going on.&nbsp; All I can suggest to
 you is that maybe you try and set up a new email address (I used Yahoo - but Google would be another option) and try to see if you can use that as the email address for the security code to be sent to.&nbsp; Good luck anyway!</p>

            <p>This happens if you have updated your security info (Alternate email address or password) the 30 day waiting period is just for your updates to take effect but you can still access your account as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 30 day waiting process for your updates to take effect is designed for your account security too. So that if ever someone tried locking you out by changing your security info you have 30 days to cancel the changes and retrieve your account.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It’s not feasible to directly get the usage report at user property level such as department, region. We only can get usage report at user level. To learn more, see
<a href="https://blogs.office.com/2016/09/13/new-usage-reports-for-sharepoint-onedrive-and-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
New usage reports for SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business and Exchange Online</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To achieve your requirement, you may need to use scripts. Get the usage report for each department. For this part, I suggest you post a new thread in our

<p><span>Hi Choomin,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Copying text from pictures is not possible in OneNote Online, you can use the OneNote desktop app on your Windows PC or on your Mac to do so. The Optical Character
 Recognition (OCR) in OneNote lets you copy text from pictures or scanned images and paste it into your notes for editing or formatting.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Not seeing the options could be due to the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) still working in the background or the quality of the image. To assist in resolving
 your concern, kindly answer the questions below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>When did the issue start to occur?</span></li><li><span>Were there any changes made or updates installed prior to the issue occurring?</span></li><li><span>What troubleshooting steps have you completed?</span></li><li><span>Are you using OneNote online, OneNote for Windows 10 or the OneNote desktop app?</span></li><li><span>Are there any pending updates that need to be installed on your device?</span></li><li><span>Which version and build of Windows 10 is installed on your device?</span></li></ul>
<p><span><br />
We look forward to your response to our queries.</span></p>

    <title>&#34;ActiveWorkbook.AutoSaveOn &#61; False&#34; throws a VBA error in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> delia watson &#40;group&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;ActiveWorkbook.AutoSaveOn &#61; False&#34; throws a VBA error in Office 2013 because the object can not be found.</h2>
                    <p>My scenario: <br />
The AutoSave button is on by default when working on a workbook saved to a SharePoint online library folder. It continuously save changes and&nbsp;updates&nbsp;the modified date and any&nbsp;status changes which should only be updated&nbsp;when the workbook is saved and closed.
 The status change triggers a workflow in SharePoint to move the&nbsp;saved workbook into a "Status" folder, with the AutoSaveOn&nbsp;a duplicate&nbsp;workbook is being created as copy and a new document ID is assigned. The content type template from which the workbook is
 created,&nbsp;is set up to upload the file to the correct SharePoint folder after the workbook is saved based on a status change linked to a file property, before it is moved to the new status folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the AutoSave runs automatically the SaveAs macro in the workbook return an error stating that the another file or add in with the same name is open, when only one copy is open (this error only occurred after the most recent office update). I've added
 a macro to the template as a work around to switch the AutoSaveOn to&nbsp;false when the document is opened, but now the template can not be used by users on Office 2013 as the "ActiveWorkbook.AutoSaveOn = False" object does not exist in the Office 2013 object
 library. Is there a vba code that I can add to address the missing object and will work on both Office 2016 and Office 2013?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The AutoSave On by default is creating a very negative user experience and in my opinion should not be ON by default, it should be the users choice to switch it on or not. In three instances the AutoSaveOn also caused a SharePoint online Content Type Template
 to be overwritten because it automatically saves to the location the file was opened from -&nbsp; even though the content type is set to read only.

            Probably not good news for you, but currently AutoSave is on by default for SharePoint and OneDrive files. However, you can turn it off on a file by file basis. There is more info on AutoSave here:

<br />
<br />You can submit a request to Microsoft to change that default setting in future updates by submitting the request here:

<p>In my experience, the default setting AutoSaveOn=true is a kind of taboo for the files with macros.<br />
All kinds of errors appear by the AutoSaveOn setting.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I hope that Microsoft will come up soon with a solution.<br />
<br />
On your question , you could try the following code:<br />
<br />
In ThisWorbook:<br />
<br />
Private Sub Workbook_Open()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Val(Application.Version) &gt; 15 And ActiveWorkbook.AutoSaveOn = True Then ActiveWorkbook.AutoSaveOn = False<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
‘version 15.0 is from Office 2013 <br />

<p>Thanks for clarifying that it is only happening to a few people in the UK. That is probably why there's no general notice as Outlook runs on 150,000 servers, so it would take a lot of them to be having issues for Microsoft to post any notification.</p>
<p>Microsoft will probably have a fix in a day or two if not already.</p>
<p>

            Hi Pradeep,<br />
<br />
You may try to perform soft reset by holding down the&nbsp;<span><strong>Power</strong>&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f71780ab3-e8a1-45b0-a0d1-220bfbe6b989%2fhardware-icon-power-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />+<strong>&nbsp;Vol</strong><strong>ume
 down</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />&nbsp;until the phone restarts. It is the same this as pulling your battery (on devices
 where that is possible). This method will not remove anything at all from your phone and is completely safe to attempt in any problem situation.<br />

<h2>            Making a field in Access that auto-populates using the username of user entering data&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm making a database and am looking to see if there is a way to fill a certain field with the Windows username of the user adding data&nbsp;the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance, if I make an entry, for a field called "User_ID", I would want it to have my username, say if it was Johndoe</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, if another user adds another data entry on their computer, I'd want it to have their username in the field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to do this?</p>

            <p>When you create your form, add a hidden control to the form bound to the User_ID field. Then set the Default value of that control to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=fOSUsername()</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the name of the function that Daniel linked to (same one I use). Unfortunately you can't set this on the table level. I've tried and for some reason it doesn't accept a User Defined function for a Default value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try it with a Data Macro. I haven't tried that. But the only drawback to doing it on the Form level is if you populate data in code (in which case, you need to include the function in the code) or a User enters data directly into a table. But since
 users shouldn't access tables directly, that shouldn't be a problem.</p>

            <p>No a macro is not VBA code which this is. You need to open (or create) a global module to paste the code into. Just don't name the module the same as the function. Name it UDFs or something similar.&nbsp;</p>

 Load" option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you mean by putting "=fOSUserName" as the default value of a textbox and linking it? I know it's probably super simple but I'm not familiar at all with Access and only a little familiar with VB, so I'm assuming it's just something I'm doing wrong
 in Access.</p>

<p>I been with windows insiders for about a year. what i have noticed. </p>
<p>Just with in their learning program. Is when they give out their exercises </p>
<p>that they try to make you do with in their program. I found out that these exercises
</p>
<p>do more harm to your system. Then any thing. Now I go to LinkedIn website. For all of my
</p>
<p>studies that deals with network marketing. There you can get the help if you are stuck on a course that you are wanting to take. Windows insiders gets attacked by hackers everyday.
</p>
<p>from people on the other side of the glob. To where what the hackers do with in windows</p>
<p>insiders also affects your computer system. They should have people looking out for these hackers that bring harm to others.</p>

                    After upgrading to Windows phone 10 I lost access to my photos stored on Gootile Photo Lock. A message "something unexpected happen, please try again! appears. Is there an update for this app? Have I lost these photos for good?

            The apps are pulling out of the mobile 10 device and they left me with no way to retrieve my one of a kind photos. Come on Microsoft make them give ample notice to stop apps. Facebook Instagram all pulling out with some notice. These privacy apps can't
 be opened now and leaving people in a horrible situation. Unprofessional totally unacceptable&nbsp;

<h2>            chart depth profile</h2>
                    Hello,
<div>I would like to make a chart in excel that is rotated by 90 degrees. &nbsp;I would like one axis on the top of the graph and one on the left side. &nbsp;I am trying to show data from a depth profile and it doesn't make sense to have to turn you head to see the data
 correctly. &nbsp;I have done this on a PC using excel, but I have the hardest time with office for mac.</div>
<div>Is there a good website out there that has tips for office mac users, I would love to get me hands on that as well?</div>
<div>thank you in advance for any assistance. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

            Why do you need to rotate the chart? It sounds to me like you simply want to have the Horizontal Axis Title at the top rather than at the bottom. There is no menu option to position it there but you can drag it to wherever you please. To make room for
 it, the Plot Area can be dragged &amp; resized as well.<br />
<br />
If I've misunderstood, please be more descriptive of the issue, including some idea of what the data is, what type of chart, as well as any additional details that will paint a more vivid picture of what you want to accomplish.<br />
<br />

                    <p>Dear Satya Nadella,</p>
<p>I'm on&nbsp;Windows 10 Tech Preview Build 9841, and updating to the *whatever* next preview build you have in store for us.
</p>
<p>There's a pretty circle of 5 purple dots chasing their own tail on the PC settings window, and all I can do is navigate back or "change the time my PC installs preview builds". I have no idea how big this download is going to be, what *number it is&nbsp;or how
 long it's going to take. Where is the downloading progress information for the preview build? The Download Now button is greyed out and apparently also serves as the progress bar (?). {And I'm not sure about that - pure conjecture on my part).</p>
<p>It's pretty and minimalist, but pretty useless too, especially to the technical user, not to mention foreseeably exasperating for the laymen. I'm having deja vu nightmares about the time Windows 8.1 threatened to complete the update in 2 days plus.
</p>
<p>These are not issues that plague the Tech Preview, these are fundamental design and implementation flaws.
</p>
<p>I've just installed it on my desktop and reporting feedback from my experience.
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Okay, so you totally blew us away with that Hologlasses thing. Way to go, man! Looking forward to all that and the 3D Printing support. Hope you don't disappoint.</li><li>I love the way Windows 10 looks and behaves, so far. Make Windows Defender stronger and save us from all those Antivirus bloatware, please. I'm not installing any third-party antivirus on this Tech Preview because a) I plan to report back on Windows 10
 and Microsoft software alone, and b) I seriously hope I never need a third-party antivirus tool. Be strong, Microsoft, the world needs you.</li><li>So far IE has been a breeze too.&nbsp;No annoying popups or warnings from Windows that I need to install some Web protection. Hope it stays that way.</li><li>However...</li></ol>
<p>I know you want us to *love* Microsoft the way Apple has a cult, but dude, not happening, man! You're still following Apple blindly. The world loves the man who stands unique. This is how you're copying Apple again in the wrong ways, and this is how you're

 come. You can make all versions of Windows are free as fresh air, but mark my words, Satya, if you don't make developer tools free, Microsoft will die.</li></ol>

<br />
<strong>Are you serious? What is particularly wrong with NT Codebase why it would need to be re-written? First of all, Apple had no choice to move to a UNIX base codebase because their previous operating system Classic was based on a foundation dated back to
 1984 when the original Mac OS&nbsp; was released. <br />
<br />
Windows NT was designed as a portable operating system in mind with a lot of inspiration in original operating systems such as VMS. In fact, the lead designer of Windows NT Dave Cutler knew what he was doing. Windows NT's first bit of code was checked in 1989,
 two years before Linux, which puts them in the same age group.<br />
<br />
This is not about using the latest and greatest, there is no necessity in re-writing Windows or moving it to a different architecture. Windows NT has proven itself well, for the 26 years, it has ran on a variety of architectures: x86, MIPS, POWERPC, Itanium,
 ARM which in itself proves how well it has been designed from the outset. Also, it spans mobile, desktop PC and Servers and even the cloud with Microsoft Azure.<br />
<br />
So your 'spaghetti' code quip sounds like the usual in the know news clip thought a lot of persons like to use who don't know about this industry.<br />
<br />
Also, you need to read up about HFS+ and its notoriety for file loss and corruption:<br />

</strong><strong>I don't hear about that with NTFS. <br />
</strong><strong><br />
</strong></li><li>XCode is free, the resources and documentation for developing apps in Objective-C is free. Android SDK and documentation is all free. Shouldn't you make your developer tools and documentation free? Think about it. I'd happily join up if I didn't have to

 come. You can make all versions of Windows are free as fresh air, but mark my words, Satya, if you don't make developer tools free, Microsoft will die.<br />
<br />
<strong>If I a Windows user wanted to write an iOS app right now, what is the cost of entry?
<br />
<br />
1. I need a Mac, cheapest, an under performing&nbsp;Mac Mini starts $700, probably can get away with a refurbised Mac Mini for about 500.<br />
<br />
2. I need buy a monitor,&nbsp;mouse&nbsp;and keyboard or use one if I have it, but lets add the cost, thats about 250 dollars.<br />
<br />
3. Next, I need to purchase a Developer License from OS X so I submit apps to the app store. Thats about 100 dollars.
<br />
<br />
4. Next, I need to purchase iOS devices, includes iPod Touch, iPhone 6, 6 Plus, plus some older devices and if I have to also write OS X apps, I need some additional Macs to test too, because iOS emulator and Apples limitation on VMs will not work, so thats
 an additional at least 5,000 investment there if I plan to make this a business.<br />
<br />
<br />
You said Microsoft needs to make its developer tools free, hmm, then what is this:<br />

Also, you can use it on an individual basis to write apps you can sell on the Windows Store and make money. Its not limited in anyway from Professional edition or Ultimate edition which is used by by large developers who actually are writing major apps that

<h2>            Downloads don&#39;t resume from where they left off after pausing and rebooting the system</h2>
                    <p><strong>Hi,</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>This is to inform you that I am using Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 x64 on my laptop Acer Aspire 5742G. It has Intel Core i5-430M 2.27GHz, 4GB RAM (3.87GB Usable), 1GB NVIDIA GeForce GT 420M Graphics Card and&nbsp;500GB HDD.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Now, I am using the Download Manager which is built into IE 9 in 32-bit mode to download the Windows Automated Installation Kit Supplement for Windows 7 SP1 from the Microsoft Download Center. The file size is about 1.25GB.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I paused the download in the Download Manager and shut down my computer. The file had already downloaded about 10% before the download was paused. When I restarted my computer and went to the list of Downloads in the Download Manager and clicked
 on Resume, the file started resuming the download from 0% instead of resuming from 10% from where it left off or was paused last, when&nbsp;the computer was shut down.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I've tried this on 2 downloads now, and it seems to repeat the same behaviour explained above.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Please let me know how can I resolve this issue.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thanks,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cliff</strong></p>

            <p>Hi Debbie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, I tried pausing and resuming the download from the link you had given in your post, and the downloads pause and resume normally with Add-On's Enabled as well as when IE is running in No Add-On's Mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still unable to isolate the issue and understand why the downloads didn't resume as expected twice before I reported this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for my knowledge, I have not installed, uninstalled, enabled or disabled any of the add-on's in IE 9 during this test period or even when I actually experienced the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I am not experiencing the issue anymore, but I am still curious to try and find out if this behaviour is constant with my USB Mobile Broadband Internet Connection, since the IP Address assigned to me in that connection everytime I connect to
 the Internet is different.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try with that connection and post back here again, but that could take some time, since that connection is currently suspended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks Debbie.</p>
        </p>
