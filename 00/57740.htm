            i did try as you suggested, however it did not wo. i still kept getting the bluescreen and wdf violatio. i ended up which suprised it let me since he said after a month would not be able to, but i downgraded back to windows 7 and then the usb recovery
 worked without any issues. i guess maybe since i was running windows 10, using my windows 7 recovery was the issue. thats my guess. thank you for response anyway.

<h2>            Nextbook Flexx 11.6 not charging properly- really slow to charge but drains quickly</h2>
                    <p>my nextbook&nbsp;Flexx&nbsp;running windows 10 came back from the shop a few months ago and it was working wonderfully for a stretch. Two days ago I was working on a project and I forgot to plug in the laptop to charge over night and it died. The next&nbsp;day when I returned
 to do more work I plugged it in and it never turned on so I left it to charge for about an hour and when I checked the battery it only had 1% and the system wouldn't&nbsp;complete its boot up. Again I left it alone for a while, but when I checked on it again it
 said 0%. I kept checking it over the course of the day and it never got above 5%. I let it charge over night and it only reached 21% in hopes of getting some work done I booted up the system and proceeded to use it while it was plugged in but while I was using
 it died. I let it sit for even longer and the battery is consistently falling despite being plugged in. I've read everything that I can online but nothing seems to be quite like this. I've&nbsp;uninstalled and reinstalled the Microsoft ACPI- Compliant&nbsp;Control Method&nbsp;Battery
 device multiple times and restarted the system&nbsp;about 10 times but to no avail. Any help would be great!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Do you receive any error code?<br />
2. Do you face this issue only with this particular application?<br />
3. Did you make any recent changes on your system prior to this issue?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: </strong>Boot the computer to Safe Mode with Networking.<br />
<br />
a) <strong>Remove </strong>all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.
<br />
b) If your computer has a single operating system installed, <strong>press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts.<br />
</strong>c) You need to <strong>press F8 before the Windows logo appears</strong>.<br />
d) If the <strong>Windows logo appears</strong>, you'll need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then
<strong>shutting down and restarting your computer</strong>.<br />
e) On the <strong>Advanced Boot Options screen</strong>, use the arrow keys to highlight the
<strong>safe mode with networking option </strong>you want, and then press <strong>
Enter</strong>.<br />
f) <strong>Log on to your computer </strong>with a user account that has <strong>
administrator rights</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Refer: </strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</a>
<br />
<br />
Check if the issue persists in Safe Mode with Networking or not. If the issue do not persists in Safe Mode with Networking please try the next step.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2: </strong>Try to set your computer in Clean Boot state.<br />
<br />
By setting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.<br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>Note: </strong>After clean boot troubleshooting step, follow Step 7 in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.<br />
<br />
Hope this information is helpful.<br />

<h2>            Email attachments occasionally open in Windows Media Player when the text is in MW.</h2>
                    Occasionally, when I try to open an email attachment, the Windows Media Player tries to take over and can't open the attachment as it's in Microsoft Word! Is this a security setting? Cheers Moff3

<h2>            Spinning Wheel when trying to open Windows Store</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title: windows store stopped working during game app</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows store was working fine on my 8.1 laptop.&nbsp; During a game I had installed from windows store, I attempted to purchase virtual coin.&nbsp; The cautionary message from windows store appeared and I chose to proceed.&nbsp; As I had not yet set up a windows store
 account a prompt appeared asking if I would like to set one up now.&nbsp; I chose to and the store load screen appeared with the load wheel spinning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's where it stopped. Now any time I try to access the store I get the load screen and no further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the powershell re-register cmd, and WSReset with no result.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the games tile works fine, directing me to the xbox section, and the game app I was using is still functioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else I can try without doing a full restore?</p>
<p />

            <p><span>Hi Andrew,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community Forum. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please be assured that we would do our best to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could be caused due to some incorrect settings or due to some other program preventing the Windows store service from contacting the Windows servers.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to try the methods below and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to check if the Windows store service and the Windows update service is running. Refer to these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>
Windows key + R</strong>, type ‘<strong>services.msc’.</strong></span></li><li><span>Locate the ‘<strong>Windows store</strong>’ service and the ‘<strong>Windows update</strong>’ service is running.</span></li><li><span>If not, right click on the service and select ‘<strong>Start’</strong> to start the service manually.</span></li><li><span>Also, right click on each service, select properties and set the startup type to ‘<strong>Automatic’</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sometimes, security software like antivirus and firewall can also cause such issues. So I suggest you to temporarily disable any third party security software that you have installed and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Important Note:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install
 other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3: </span></strong><strong><span>Create new user account</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to create a new user account and then check how the Store works with new user account.</span><span>
<span>Follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press “<strong>Windows Key + W</strong>”.</span></li><li><span>Type <strong>Users</strong> in the search box and select “<strong>Users</strong>” option from the left panel.</span></li><li><span>Select “<strong>Add Users</strong>” under “<strong>Other users</strong>” option.</span></li><li><span>Add the user profile details.</span></li><li><span>Then login to the new user account and then check if this fixes the issue.</span></li></ol>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance, we’ll be glad to assist you.</p>

<p>Hi Jessen,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should let Microsoft R&amp;D double check the edge browser. Sometimes it works (too slow, but it works), and other times it keeps reloading and I cannot surf online! I have to say the edge browser looks like a semi-finished product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, I tried to install chrome, but the installation failed. I installed firefox, and the windows 10 keeps informing me that I should set edge as my default browser. &nbsp;Well, I am a lazy people and I won't use another browser if the edge can work stably
 every day!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am done with windows 10 and edge. I am going to quit the win10 club. I can't even surfing online? The alternative Internet Explorer will freeze after opening several pages? This is really annoying! This win10 is even worse than windows vista.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            I feel as if I'm being hijacked by microsoft now that I have the latest Windows 10,v. 1709!&nbsp; I cannot get some websites at all in Edge,&nbsp; yet I'm unable to use my default, Chrome,&nbsp; which is very superior in every way!&nbsp; edge still feels like a beta project!
 How do I default to Chrome,&nbsp; which is downloaded,&nbsp; and I have used for years!

</p><p>I can manage to use Edge somehow. Edge is not good enough but it's workable now. I can't visit your site, because our country blocked almost all the google sites. The only assible google site is google translate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you receive any error message related to Ares?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the program is not compatible with Windows 7, run the program in compatible mode and check if it helps.</p>

</span></span></span>Right click on the program you want to install in compatible mode.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 64bit corrupted, no backup, no repair disk, no recovery set, no image saved,</h2>
                    <p>My granddaughters ASUS K53E Laptop (purch about 2010) with Win7 64 (Home?) stopped working and wasn't used for 2 yrs or so.&nbsp; Didn't register it, no recovery or repair set, no image or backup.&nbsp; Needs it now - hard drive was full with games and a couple viruses.&nbsp;
 I freed space and got rid of viruses.</p>
<p>Windows update had automatically downloaded about 150 updates - it wouldn't let me select to install only some, so they all began to install, almost done when windows crashed and couldn't even get a DOS prompt.&nbsp; No setup option for recovery worked.</p>
<p>I used my Son's Win7 64bit Pro disk (came with his HP ProBook) to install Windows, and found all the ASUS drivers from ASUS.com.&nbsp; But now I can't activate Windows.&nbsp; I tried the license key from the ASUS sticker (for Win 7 64 Home/Premium(?)) no dice.&nbsp; Tried
 the key for my son's Win7 64 Pro disk and no dice.</p>
<p>She paid for a Windows 7 license when she bought the ASUS K53E.&nbsp; Single mom at 30, she is going back to school and broke.</p>
<p>Is there any way she can activate this Windows7, or some other way to get an operating system short of $130 purchase?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n</p>

            <p>You have the wrong edition installed and you used an HP Reinstall disc. You need to specifically download and reinstall Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the past 5 years Microsoft made it quite easy for users of the Windows 7 operating system to obtain reinstall media. If you lost your retail installation disc or recovery media; either it was damaged or faulty; you could download a copy of the edition
 you have a license for from an affiliate website named Digital River. Most recently, Microsoft ended availability of reinstall media which you could download as a .ISO file from Digital River, which is a digital replica of a optical disc.
</p>
<p>This was especially handy for persons who could not easily obtain recovery media from the manufacturer, did not want to pay the cost required to obtain it or preferred a clean configuration without the manufacturers bundled software or even a non-functional
 recovery partition. It was easy to use, all you had to do was reinstall and reactivate using the product key located on the certificate of authenticity and download any appropriate drivers from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>Since this option is no longer available, what are your options? See article for details:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_7-system/how-to-what-are-my-options-for-obtaining-windows-7/528163c1-0b2e-4ad2-a26d-7112851d1dc2"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">How to: What are my options

<em>
<p>What to do if you cannot get recovery media from your manufacturer, refuse to use or purchase it or the Microsoft Software Recovery Website is not working?</p>

<p>Do you know the system make and model, or is it something built from scratch?</p>
<p>Can you read any kind of model number from the case?</p>
<p>It would seem that solid green would be good - don't know about blinking green though...</p>
<p>Sometimes there is a 1/0 looking switch near where the power cord plugs in.&nbsp; Make sure it is set to 1 (1=ON usually), but try it both ways.</p>

<p>Try plugging it in to a different outlet. Is there anything else plugged into theat same outlet? Is it plugged into a power strip that's full of OTHER high powered devices?</p>
<p>Yesterday, did you leave it on? And then when you cme back it had shutdown.</p>
<p>Or did you shut it down and it just will not&nbsp;start up&nbsp;anymore?</p>

<p>That is what I wanted and here is what HP has to say about the condition of your symptom and some troubleshooting steps:</p>
<p>http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=us&amp;docname=bph06788&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN</p>
<p>I read several other posts on the Wide Wide World of Web and they all seem to say "replace the power supply", but there are some steps to check for a potential loose connection inside the box with the cables that go from the power supply to the mohterboard...&nbsp;
 I did not read about the "ah-ha!" revelation though - most people just replaced the PSU and some posts just petered out with no apparent ending.&nbsp; When you replace the PSU, you have to redo all the connections anyway, so maybe those really were just a loose
 connection.</p>
<p>Is the unit under warranty?&nbsp; Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!</p>
<p>No beeps when you press the power button?</p>
<p>There are power supply testers and you could use a meter to check it, but then if it is bad you will not be able to fix it unless you are an electronic technician.</p>
<p>Over here in a strip of shops called "computer city", I can get a replacement PSU pretty cheap (less than $50) and it actually takes me more time to drive over and pick it up than it does for me to replace it.</p>
<p>After reading about the problem, I think I would spend a little time with the troubleshooting guide and then if that didn't work out, I'd replace the PSU (or take it to a shop and let them diagnose it).</p>

<p>This is what I've found so far.&nbsp; I did the troubleshooting on Microsoft and when I unplugged the clip&nbsp;that has a bunch of different colored wires hooked to it&nbsp;on the inside of the tower, the the flashing light on the back of the tower went to solid green.
 The only problem is, is that I don't know what that wire bunch is or what it's connected to.&nbsp; It's circled on the Microsoft website for troubleshooting power supply problems, but I can't copy &amp; paste it to show you.&nbsp; From what I understand though is that it's
 not the power supply if the light went to solid.</p>
<p>Do you have any more suggestions that may help me?</p>
<p>Thank you again for your help &amp; knowledge in this situation. :)</p>

<p>&nbsp;That wire "Clip" is what provides the power to your lights, and any internal speaker you have. It also, if I am not mistaken "powers" the on off button(I'm surprised I didn't think of that ^-.-^) Anyway, I take it that your computer STILL doesn't work?
 Hmm, I'm not entirely sure now. I'll check MY computer case XD. That may jog my memory some &gt;.&gt;</p>

            <p>Sounds like you have a hardware problem and not a problem with Windows XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is your system make and model?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We don't even know if it is a laptop or a desktop - sounds like a desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No information leads to guessing and trying things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Begin the process of fault isolation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Find a wall outlet that you know is good (test with a lamp or other device) and plug the unit directly into the known good outlet eliminating the current wall outlet and power strip from the equation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the unit will still not power up, suspect the power supply inside the unit of unspecified make and model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Power supplies usually take less time to replace than it takes to go to the store any buy one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is a desktop, power supplies are not very expensive from a local computer shop or even a big box store, between $35-$50 USD at Walmart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not comfortable replacing the PS, find yourself a geeky friend that knows about such matters and coerce, bribe or barter them into helping you replace the PS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before going to the store to buy one, write down all the information from the stickers on the current PS so you can get one of the same or better power output and specifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you take the system to a shop, they will probably replace the PS for free if you purchase the replacement PS from their shop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have access to a female, let the female take the unit to the shop to get the PS replaced.&nbsp; Almost guaranteed no charge for labor.&nbsp; This strategy works well when replacing automotive things too...&nbsp; batteries, bubs, blades, fluids, etc.&nbsp; Always send
 the female.</p>

    <title>HDMI audio - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobtrotterripley  say:</h3>
<h2>            HDMI audio</h2>
                    A few months back, I decided to use an HDMI cable for my ASUS monitor, having used DVI until then.<br />
<br />
For whatever reason, when I tried to switch back to the DVI output, I no longer got sound through my system to external speakers.&nbsp; I could only get sound by using the HDMI connection, which fed the sound to the monitor, and sending that sound to my amp.<br />
<br />
I have updated all drivers for every audio device involved.&nbsp; I do not have a sound card; audio is onboard.<br />
<br />
Even though the sound control dialogue box will show volume bars for the external speakers when I disable the HDMI audio, there is no sound going to the amplifier.&nbsp; Unless, and only unless, I use the HDMI cable, I get no audio.<br />
<br />
I don't want to have to do that because I can control my desktop and audio remotely, but if I shut down the system, the monitor stays on the HDMI screen and uses a screen saver to move the error signal box around the screen.&nbsp; The monitor will not shut off,
 unless I do that manually.&nbsp; That renders remote control useless, as far as the entire system is concerned.<br />
<br />
Of course, since the HDMI must be used for sound, if I turn off the monitor to eliminate the need to go back to the&nbsp; system, then I have no audio: the monitor controls the audio from the MB.<br />
<br />
What can I do to fix this?&nbsp; I am willing to try a registry edit if that would fix this.<br />
<br />
Windows 10, 10.0, build: 14393 (x64)<br />

            <p>Referring to the suggestions in the link above, here's what i tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>DVI does not carry sound - only video.<br />
<br />
I never have depended on the DVI for sound.<br />
<br />
You need to connect speakers to your computer, or if the monitor has speakers use an audio cable to connect them.<br />
<br />
Speakers are connected.<br />
<br />
If you do have speakers connected:<br />
<br />
No Sound<br />
<br />
1) Have you installed the newest audio drivers? If not download them from the manufacturers website or try to run Windows Update - that might include the generic drivers for your sound device.<br />
<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
2) Have you set the correct sound device? Click Start, type: sound. Then click Sound under Control Panel. Then set the default sound device.<br />
<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
More options:<br />
<br />
3) Is the sound device disabled?<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
A. Right-click the speaker icon on your taskbar<br />
B. Select "Playback Devices"<br />
C. In the white empty space right click and select both Show Disconnected/Disabled Devices<br />
D. Do you see icons for your speakers and headphones now? &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
E. If you now see it you may need to right click on the correct sound device and select "Set as default device"<br />
<br />
Have done this.<br />
<br />
4) You can also try the troubleshooter below to discover any connection issues that may exist, instructions are below:<br />
<br />
A. Click 'Start' &gt; Select 'Control Panel'<br />
B. Type troubleshooting in the top-right search field &gt; Select 'Troubleshooting'<br />
C. Click 'Hardware and Sound' &gt; Select 'Playing Audio'.<br />
<br />
Tried this, too.<br />
<br />
5) Also go through the steps mentioned in the article below - Tips for fixing common sound problems<br />
<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Tips-for-fixing-common-sound-problems<br />
<br />
<br />
Low Volume:<br />
<br />
??There are many different places to adjust the sound. Are all of these turned up?<br />
<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
1. On the speakers, or if you have a laptop there might be a sound adjustment nob somewhere.<br />
<br />
This is a desktop.<br />
<br />
2. On the program you are using to play music/video.<br />
<br />
No problem here.<br />
<br />
3. Next to the clock on the bottom right of the screen there is usually a sound icon you can click.<br />
<br />
Audio is at 100%.<br />
<br />
4. In the Control Panel under the Sound section. Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Hardware and Sound -&gt; Adjust System Volume.<br />
<br />
Only "Sound" appears in my control panel, and three sound options appear.<br />
First, and default, is the ASUS sound control.<br />
Second, Realtek Hi Def Audio, shows as ready.<br />
Third, Realtek Digital, shows as ready.<br />
<br />
When I disable ASUS and check Realtek HD, the volume bars show, moving up and down.&nbsp; But there's no sound.<br />
<br />
The Digital also shows bars, but no sound; the "digital out" is not connected.<br />
<br />
In configuring speakers for Realtek HD, the icon animation shows up when "testing", but no audio.<br />
<br />
I ran the audio10.diagcab, but it found nothing other than what I've already found.&nbsp; The only analysis it gave was that the device (any item other than the ASUS monitor) was not set to default.&nbsp; But it was, with the ASUS disabled.&nbsp; There was still no sound.<br />
<br />
At this point, I just suspect it's a registry thing, and that the registry sees the ASUS as default regardless.&nbsp; But I'm not a programmer, and don't know anything more than to suspect this is a problem.</p>

<h2>            Defragmentation will not complete</h2>
                    
<p>When I run a defrag, it completes with no change in fragmentation. I have tried using the Windows Defragmenter and Defraggler which are both showing different degrees of fragmentation!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As shown in the Defraggler picture, I have one 500gb hdd partitioned into an 80gb and 385gb, both with over 70% free space.</p>
<p>I was asked on another website if I was clicking&nbsp;analyse&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;defragment, I wasn't, I&nbsp;analysed&nbsp;the drives so you could see the amount of fragmentation otherwise Defraggler does not show it.</p>
<p><strong><span>I have run a chkdsk, sfc /scannow, pagedefrag and attempted it in safe mode - none of which have helped.</span></strong></p>

<p>Thorlain,</p>
<p>My understanding is that Windows Defragmenter and Defraggler determine a fragmented file differently. Defraggler will consider a file fragmented if it has a single fragment where as Windows will allow a handful of fragments before feeling the file needs
 to be defragmented.</p>
<p>The reason this is important is that if your HDD has large files (2-10 GB in size) and they have a single fragment, this can cause Defraggler to show a very high fragmentation level where Windows would not.</p>
<p>Hope this makes sense! Let me know if you need further help!</p>

    <title>Xbox live connection terrible - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jordanmwallace  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox live connection terrible</h2>
                    
<p>Not sure if this is the correct place for this but couldn't find any where better.</p>
<p>So here I am playing xbox live with my buddies, everything is fine, and then suddenly (no major changes occurred to any hardware, my 360 did have a software update about a month before but had been playing on it for the month and no problem so I don't think
 it was that) suddenly more often then not my connection is so awful that I cannot even play. after a week or 2 it was constant, I never received good connection. And that is still the same.</p>
<p>I tried calling the help line and was on the phone for over 2 hours with a guy. He was really nice and all and certainly tried but couldn't figure anything out. I have done almost everything I can think of or try. I've run troubleshoots, googled and searched
 error codes. I've manually input DNS and IP addresses, opened ports, reserved IP addresses, had my service provider come out and upgrade hardware, researched hardware, checked on these forums what the recommended download upload and ping numbers were for optimal
 gaming and my provider is good for all of them (I am rural so my service provider doesn't have great numbers for download and upload and ping but they were all well enough above what I found (in several places as optimal numbers)</p>
<p>I would love to get a reply from an xbox help employee (or anyone that has had this same or similar problem). Did something change with xbox live that made these requirements higher? SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME!!</p>

            <p>Hey there Sun! I'm sincerely sorry to hear about the connection issues! It definitely sounds like you've done a ton of troubleshooting so far, so I'll try my best not to go over anything you've already done.<br /><br />If you're using a wireless connection, I suggest starting off by giving a wired connection a try. That would be the simplest solution to try and will also give us a hint as to whether the issue may lie with the console's wireless receiver, etc.<br /><br />Please let us know how that goes! If you continue to experience connection issues with a wired connection, please check out our sticky HERE and reply back with the information in <strong>bold</strong> at the bottom.<br /><br />Happy Holidays! We look forward to hearing back from you. =)</p>

<p>Yes i have tried almost everything, i am currently on wired connection (ran a 90 foot cable through ducts and roofing all through my house to get it to my xbox and still am having problems.
</p>
<p>Now i have also done this little form thing i have here below, except last time i did i got no reply, so since im doing it again i would really appreciate if it could also then move passed this stage.
</p>
<p>just a heads up, i have three situations that occur while on the xbox. </p>
<p>1. i cannot connect to xbox live whatsover, this gives an error (the code i dont have memorized) but it says cannont connect blah blah blah, check that your actually connected blah blah blah, this console is not connected. (im paraphrasing here to save time
 and again dont have the whole thing memorized)</p>
<p>When this guy happens i get ZERO service. also on this running the test connection and looking at suggested fixes, almost always it says something is wrong with the DNS, wrong DNS, cannot work out the DNS, etc etc.</p>
<p>2. I can connect and it says everything is dandy. loading things takes a while but i can usually get into games. NAT type is almost always moderate (have tried the fix for NAT to get it to be open, but it never works, also it is occasionally open but that
 doesnt make any difference). I get into games and the lag is unbelievable. Like i stated in my first post, i always played with lag, living out in the country, rural connections are nothing like in the city, but it was doable. now it is so impossibly slow.
</p>
<p>and finally 3: this is very similar to the previous case, can connect, things take a while to load. get in game everything is fantastically laggy. Now the only difference to the previous situation in this one is that i get a warning that the nat type is
 really bad and this has only ever affected me (other then the lag problem persistent in both cases) in the fact that it takes extra long to find games i can match up with.</p>
<p>Since i cannont get my xbox to put out all three of these problems this is filled out for the one it would give me, which happened to be the 3rd situation.</p>

            <p>Hey again Sun! Thanks so much for posting in such detail. It definitely helps me get a clearer picture of what you're seeing.<br /><br />Reading through your situation, it really sounds like the connection you're using may be rather unreliable for Xbox Live. The setup you're describing sounds like internet through RF (Radio Frequency). That signal can be interfered with and disrupted by all sorts of things from trees to snow/rain, etc. It's highly possible that something is interfering with the signal and that's what's causing the service interruptions on your end.<br /><br />For this situation, I think it's best that we get you on the phone with a connectivity specialist. I see in your initial post that you say you've already spoken with someone from phone support about the issue. I suggest using the <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Us</a> page to get in touch with phone support again. When you do, please let them know that you've a

<h2>            Minecraft&#58; Windows 10 Edition Beta Is broken.</h2>
                    I didn't play MW10E for a long while but when I tried to play it again, It wouldn't launch. It would bring up the&nbsp;launch window then close after showing the Mojang words. It all happenes in a second. I also recently upgraded to the windows 10 anniversary
 edition, could that be the problem?

 would let me veiw the page but nothing helped. I contacted SOI and they did a remote visit to my computer and couldn't figure it out either. Everything is fine on their end. Any help you guys can give will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>If you remove (delete) all links mentioned in Internet Explorer&nbsp; (Favorites and other drop down menu links) that point to the&nbsp;SOI site and then restart IE, and after the restart, type the correct URL in the Address Bar does IE allow you to log in to SOI&nbsp;and
 see your paycheck?&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you want to revert back to IE 8 have a look at installed updates and uninstall Internet Explorer 9.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can do it via Installed Updates in this location -&nbsp; Control Panel\Programs\Programs and Features\Installed Updates.&nbsp; Uninstalling will revert you back
 to IE 8.<br />

In IE 9 pressing, F12 (or choosing it via IE's Tools) will allow you to open the Developer Tools, in that if you click on "Browser Mode" and you can select IE 9 to run as IE 8.&nbsp; Changes require an IE restart.</p>

<p><span>Hi Rodrigo,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you check if your wi-fi connection works in Safe mode with networking?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you receive the error only when you tried to change the program from Outlook to Internet through taskbar or also other programs?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you using Internet Explorer as your default web browser or any other third party web browsers?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 happens when you use your wi-fi connection to connect to your Internet? Do you receive any error?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>AcSvc.exerefers to Access Connections which is a feature from Lenovo. It seems like the system is not able to access this feature
 and that’s when you receive the error message.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As of now, I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Test your wi-fi connection in Safe mode with networking</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Use
 F8 while restarting the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Under
 Windows Advanced Boot Options menu, select Safe mode with Networking and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>Check if you can use your Wi-fi connection successfully or not.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Use the Network Troubleshooter in Windows 7</span></strong></p>

<h2>            How to keep pictures within the body of a forwarded email.</h2>
                    <p><em>[Moved from Windows]</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;use Windows Live Mail and whenever I receive an email that has several pictures contained within the actual email(not as attachments)and then try to forward the email the pictures don’t stay within the body of the email. They are all placed in a row at
 the top of the email and right below the pictures it says “view slide show.” The problem is that I don’t want the pictures removed from the body of the email. Many times the pictures will have captions with them and when the email is forwarded, the pictures
 are at the top of the email and the captions are below a blank square with a little box with a red “X” in it in the upper left hand corner of the blank square.&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't happen with all emails. I haven't kept track exactly, but it seems like if there is
 just one picture, then there usually is not a problem, but not always. I have noticed it the most when there is a series of pictures contained in the body of the email. Then if I attempt to forward that email, I will get a pop-up that says something to the
 effect that one or more of the pictures could not be found and asks if I want to send the email anyway. If I continue with the send process, I have noticed that sometimes, although rarely, the pictures will not be sent at all and all that will be in the email
 will be the captions that were under the original&nbsp;pictures. Most frequently, after receiving that pop-up and continuing with the send process, as mentioned above,&nbsp;the pictures will all be displayed at the top of the sent email in a horizontal series with a
 link to click which says view slide show. The slide show rarely is a slide show, but rather you have to click on each individual picure to enlarge it, and, of course, the captions are still in the body of the email where the picture should be. How can these
 emails be forwarded without having the pictures removed from the body of the email?</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have made some experiments and found out that if the pictures on the email are pasted on the body of the message, it would
 not go to the top part of the email. On the other hand if the picture in the message was inserted using the attachment buttons in Hotmail messaging pane, it would always go on top. So if you receive messages with attachments on top of the message, you can
 simply download them, then copy and paste to the email body&nbsp;the ones that you want to put caption on.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks.</span></p>

            <p>I have a similar issue.&nbsp; When friends include pictures within the body of their message and I attempt to forward the message (with pictures) to someone else, I often get the error message something like, "the pictures&nbsp;in this message will not be included
 when the message is forwarded.&nbsp; Do you still want to send the message?"</p>
<p>I have noticed that this happens more frequently when emails come from aol accounts.</p>
<p>I have clicked on the option "reply to sender in format used to send email" to see if that would help, but it hasn't.</p>
<p>I use Windown Live Mail with Windows 7</p>

            <p>I DID what was requested in the private messages and forwarded the email with the picture that I could not forward (the picture was embeded within the body of the received&nbsp;email).&nbsp; I've heard nothing back since.<br />
<br />
This problem continues: Windows Live Mail will SOMETIMES let me forward a picture sent to me which I wish to pass on.&nbsp; Other times it will only forward an empty box with a red + sign.&nbsp; I cannot tell the difference--why forwarding sometimes works when it does
 not at other times.<br />
<br />
If Microsoft will only pay attention you will see that there are many customers with the same problem. Do you have any idea how frustrating this is?&nbsp; And all the "help" offered is simply passing the problem from one person to another with no real solution.<br />
<br />
PLEASE OFFER:</p>
<p>1. Some explanation of why this happens</p>
<p>2. A workaround that doesn't include copying and pasting pictures into our own files and then pasting them back into the email we wish to forward.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Keeps Asking Me to Insert a UserName and Password when I attempt to access a share on Windows 2003</h2>
                    
<p>I have Windows 7 Premium installed on my laptop and used to be able to access shares on Windows 2003 Server. However for some odd reason everytime I attempt to access the shares now, I am prompted to enter a UserName and Password. I did not change anything
 on Windows 2003 nor has there been a change in any firewall rules. I am also not running a domain and all computers are part of the same workgroup. Even if I try using a UNC path e.g.
\\IPAddress\AdministrativeShare e.g. \\192.168.0.1\d$ it doesn't work. Even if I enter the Administrator UserName and Password, it doesn't work. How can I resolve the issue?</p>

<h2>            Quickbooks 2015 on Surface&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Will the the Desktop Version of Quickbook 2015 run on a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 computer?&nbsp; It has Windows 10 on it.&nbsp; I read something that said QuickBooks and the Surface are not compatible, but I uploaded it to the Surface anyway.&nbsp; The font is terribly
 small.&nbsp; I am just wondering if I am likely to run into problems.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>History backup settings conflict - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pwrusr&#38;ee  say:</h3>
<h2>            History backup settings conflict</h2>
                    Trying to do a History backup to external USB flash drive. &nbsp;Using the "Settings" app to choose folders and files to include in the backup and files and folders to exclude. &nbsp;When the backup is completed, the backup doesn't backup those folders I chose in
 "Settings" but does backup those locations shown in the "Control Panel" History backup settings: "Libraries, Desktop, Contacts and Favorites". &nbsp;Why is the file History backup defaulting to the Control Panel settings and is there a way to get the History backup
 to those files and folders I've selected in the Settings app? &nbsp;I recently upgraded all the way from Vista to Windows7 to Windows 10 but I understand that the new "History" backup has no relationship to my past backups under the previous versions of Windows.
