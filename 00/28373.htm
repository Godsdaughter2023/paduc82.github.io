            <p>Hi Joddy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To deal with hidden files, please see the following compliments of Le Boule:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>See if this will help:</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.mypchealth.co.uk/SpywareHidden.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><em>http://www.mypchealth.co.uk/SpywareHidden.php</em></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>See the following compliments of Bleeping Computer:</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><b><span>If you are infected with ****it is important that you do not delete any files from your Temp folder or use any temp file cleaners.</span></b><span> This is because when this infection is installed it will delete shortcuts found in various locations
 and store backups of them in the %Temp%\smtmp folder. It does this so that you when try to launch a program from your start menu, none of your shortcuts will appear and thus making you think that your computer has a serious problem. Therefore, you do not want
 to delete any of the files in your Temp folder as it will remove the backups that we will use later in the guide to restore your Windows Start Menu. For a list of folders that shortcuts are deleted and the corresponding directories where they are stored, please
 see this topic: </span></em><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic405109.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><u><span><span><em>Unhide.exe - A introduction<span>as to what this program does</span></em></span></span></u></b></a><span><em>.</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><em>To further make it seem like your computer is not operating correctly, ****will also make it so that certain folders on your computer display no contents. When opening these folders, such as C:\Windows\System32\ or various drive letters, instead
 of seeing the normal list of files it will instead display a different folder's contents or make it appear as if the folder is empty. This is done to make it seem like there is corruption on your hard drive that is causing your files to not be displayed. It
 does this by adding the +H, or hidden, attribute to all of your files, which causes your files to become hidden. It will then change your Windows settings so that you cannot view hidden and system files. Once the rogue's processes are terminated you can enable
 the setting to view hidden files, and thus be able to see your files and folders again, by following the instructions in this tutorial:</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial62.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><u><span><span><em>How to see hidden files in Windows</em></span></span></u></b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your system is still infected, please proceed as follows (in addition to and/or in conjuction with the above):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full ESET online scan: <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>. &nbsp; You may also try Microsoft Safety Scanner:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a>&nbsp;and TDSSKiller: <a href="http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/solutions?qid=208280684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/solutions?qid=208280684</a>.&nbsp; This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected or the
 problem goes away, you shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first or just skip over all of this and get the expert help you really need as described below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you can ignore
 the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Are you running Microsoft Security Essentials? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>If so</span></b><span>: </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Start here - </span><a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</span></a><span>and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected. Options will vary
 by region, but phone support leads you to Microsoft Answer Desk (</span><a href="http://www.answerdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.answerdesk.com/</span></a><span>)<b> in the US at this time.</b> After an initial free consultation, a fee will be
 charged for assistance, based on the details of the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>If not</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can start here: </span><a href="https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/</span></a><span> (which will also lead to the paid support options if you are in the US)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In other regions not served by the link above, go here: </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://Support.microsoft.com/security</span></a><span>and go to the “assisted support” or contact us menu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the above is too expensive and you'd like some free options, consider this web site -</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com</span></a><span> - contains details for many of the common

<p>Hello, TheGermanAfghan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an Independent Advisor and will assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried pushing harder to get the charger plugged into the device?</p>
<p>Have you tried taking a toothpick to see if anything comes out of the plug?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How long have you had the device?</p>
<p>Devices do come with a limited 1 year warranty.</p>
<p>If the plug is faulty I advise contacting Huawei Support. If the device is faulty they should repair or replace it free of charge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you purchased it from a retailer nearby then I'd advise taking it back to the place of purchase with&nbsp; a copy of your receipt - do not give them the original copy but have it with you. They may replace the unit if the plug is faulty.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Jordie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Box and Whisker and other new charts available in Excel 2016 are not available in Excel for the Mac. In fact, they won't even display in Excel 2016 on the Mac. All you will see is a box telling you that they are not supported. They will most likely be supported
 in a future update, but for now they're off limits in Mac versions of Office.</p>

</p><p>Microsoft is in the process of folding Office for Mac into Office for Windows groupings. The Mac MVPs have mostly been reassigned to other Office categories. I anticipate that when all the changes have been made, in the future, Office for Mac will be listed
 under Office instead of having its own category. That's just an educated guess on my part, though.</p>

    <title>Family Safety problem as all the child accounts deleted - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fran.lab  say:</h3>
<h2>            Family Safety problem as all the child accounts deleted</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to last Windows 10 build (10041), something goes wrong with Family Safety feature. All settings related to my children were deleted and connection between my Microsoft user and my children was lost. So I've tried to delete my children accounts
 from the PC and recreate them (as a new child account) but the problem is that Windows 10 see them as standard users and there is no "Child" option in the "Account Type" list box (see attached image).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you any suggestion on how to solve the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on the Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to let you know that on Build 10041, there is no option to convert a Standard account to a Child account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would directly need to create a child account. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>a. Press 'Start', click on 'Settings'.</p>
<p>b. Click on 'Accounts', 'Other users'.</p>
<p>c. Click on 'Add a user' and choose 'Add a child's account' to create one. </p>

            <p>Hi RajithR,</p>
<p>thanks for you answer. The problem is that I've recreated my children accounts from scratch as "New Child account with email" but in spite of this, Win10 consider the account as "Standard" (and, as you rightly report in your post, there is no way to convert
 a standard account into child one).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the issue is not only related just to the conversion process "Standard"-&gt;"Child", but even to the creation of a new child account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Family Safety is a very good way to control children PC access, so I hope could be a fix for this or, more hopefully, a configuration trick to make it works in this build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ciao,</p>

            <p>I had the same problem with child safety account. after upgraded to new build automatically, the children accounts controlled now has gone. I understand that it is not&nbsp;final version, but just give Microsoft who develop the product a feedback. I love the
 new style of parent safety controlled Microsoft have brought into Windows 10 and hopefully we will see it in the final release.

            <p>To answer the question on this is: </p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, if you want to get back the child safety controlled again after it is upgraded to new build 10041, you could do restore it to previous build by restoring your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. go to Start -&gt;System -&gt; Advance System Settings -&gt; System Protection-&gt; System Restore</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. then pick the point before system upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. finally, disable the system upgrade automatically at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>hopefully this will works for you, before&nbsp;Microsoft fixes the problem in build 10041.</p>

            <p>Just checking for any kind of Update. &nbsp;I recently purchased a few spare computers and combined them into one so I could practice controlling accounts. &nbsp;I created the child account so my kids could play on the machine as well, &nbsp;was really excited about the
 family safety feature and had configured it to my preference. &nbsp;I updated the O.S. and all that went up, I keep getting the same message to enable in the O.S. settings under accounts but won't let you do it. &nbsp;I wish I came here first when I notice the issue
 because I thought it was me linking my account to microsoft ( I even deleted the account trying to get back to the Family Settings). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short I love this feature and hope that Microsoft can enable this version again, it is extremely beneficial.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading my long... long story,</p>

            Dono if this helps, buttttttt, make sure your speakers are plugged into the "green" port thing (you&nbsp;probably&nbsp;already know this), if it is, try switching where it's plugged in, ie if there plugged in the front of the computer, try the outlet in the back,
 and vice verse.

<h2>            OneDrive for Business - Account Sign In</h2>
                    
<p>I have tried to find information online and I have tried testing myself but here I am...</p>
<p>My issue is our company is using OneDrive for Business and we have an employee trying to share out a document with multiple people so they can all edit their part and save it. Whenever a user goes to the link/file provided they can either
<strong>Open in Word Online </strong>or choose to <strong>Open in Word</strong> (the application).</p>
<p>Every time we&nbsp;try to <strong>Open in Word </strong>the user is prompted to sign in (even if they have a window opened and signed in).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are trying to avoid having to log in to edit documents for certain users (and this will also be an issue when we try to share with external users).</p>
<p>We have unchecked the option requiring a sign in when we share out the file and went through the permissions as best as what I could tell.</p>
<p>Is this sign in to edit in Word (the application) intended? And is there a reason why the users keep getting prompted every time, even if they are already signed in?</p>

<p>hi john,</p>
<p>to clarify the situation, i’d like to confirm the following:</p>
<p>1. regarding “the user is prompted to sign in”, if he/she sign in, can the document be opened correct?</p>
<p>2. for the “even if they have a window opened and signed in”, is the account they used to log in to on office 365 portal?</p>
<p>generally, to edit files in sharepoint online from local client, we need to use the correct account have right permission. for example, if we shares a document with *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, we need to sign in with the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** in the office client so the
 document can be opened and edited properly.</p>
<p>you can check the signed in account via click <strong>file</strong> &gt;<strong>account</strong> as the following shows:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=d448269a-3ecc-4fab-8cba-402205589f34" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dd448269a-3ecc-4fab-8cba-402205589f34" /></a></p>
<p>3. if the shared user sign in with the correct account but still needs to sign in, could you capture a screenshot for our reference?</p>

<h2>            Styles in Style Toolbox in Word are way too small are are hard to identify&#59; how do I make them larger&#63;</h2>
                    We received a Word file from another person (also a Mac user). They created paragraph styles, but these styles show up in such small type in the style toolbox that they are impossible to read. Unfortunately there are 20 of them, so what should be a simple
 job is now very difficult, without accessing the styles elsewhere.&nbsp;
<div>I would really like to use the toolbox.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. Why are the styles from another user so small (if I paste the same text into a new file, the style copies over but now appears at normal size in 'my' toolbox! Have tried restarting the program and other plausible fixes but nothing works.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2. How do I change the settings of the toolbox display?</div>

            Word Mac 2011 style displays (three of them...) are pretty awful! &nbsp;None of them are useable.
<div><br />
<div>You can't change the display size of anything in the&nbsp;Toolbox. &nbsp;You "could" set your screen to a lower resolution: if you did, the toolbox would be proportionately larger. &nbsp;That's the only way you can change it: but of course, that would affect every other&nbsp;application&nbsp;also.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Word 2011 enables you to define a custom toolbar: I put all the styles I use on that, so I can find them when I want them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>

<h3> trentsc  say:</h3>
<h2>            ActiveSync prroblem - won&#39;t connect, can&#39;t open from system tray</h2>
                    OK, relatively new to all this modern telephony and getting to grips with my HTC HD2 (also called Leo, I think).&nbsp; I'm running Windows XP SP3 and Office 2003 on my desktop, with a fresh installation of ActiveSync 4.5; my phone is running Windows Mobile
 6.5.&nbsp; Windows firewall is running.&nbsp; The phone is sync'ing my contacts and calendar (I've set up a separate email, so I'm not collecting mail through Outlook.<br />
<br />
I'm seeing two problems and would be grateful for some advice.<br />
<br />
The first is when I boot the computer and connect the phone: ActiveSync opens fine and I can see it on my desktop.&nbsp; However, once I've minimised it to the system tray, I can't get it back on-screen, either by double or right clicking on the system tray icon.&nbsp;
 A reboot solves this, but only temporarily.<br />
<br />
Secondly, once this has happened, the phone stops synchronising when I plug it into the computer with the USB cable.&nbsp; A reboot appears to fix the problem, but this takes me back to problem #1...<br />
<br />
I've tried reinstalling ActiveSync and find the same problem; can anyone suggest what I might try to resolve the issue?<br />
<br />
Many thanks.

            Hello. I think you are having trouble with <span>wcesmgr.exe (the
<a href="http://windowsitpro.com/article/articleid/27080/how-to-reboot-activesync.html#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span>application</span>
</span></a>that displays the ActiveSync window) and wcescomm.exe, a background program that doesn't automatically stop when the ActiveSync window closes. I can't believe that Windows firewall isn't allowing those programs but you could check. See if the workarounds
 fix your problem. It's better than having to reboot...</span> <br />

            Hi there.<br />
<br />
No, the problem hasn't gone away.&nbsp; Once I've rebooted, ActiveSync behaves perfectly well, but after a time (overnight, in this instance), the phone fails to sync and, if I "close" ActiveSync, I can no longer open it from either the system tray or the Start
 menu.&nbsp; Trying the workaround described in the link you kindly provided makes no difference, and once I've terminated
<span>wcescomm.exe it doesn't reopen when I connect my phone.<br />
<br />
Restarting </span><span>wcescomm.exe manually makes all the right noises (a higher-pitched set of bleeps than the normal USB connection noise) but it still fails to open on my desktop and while my phone tells me that it's trying to sync, nothing
 happens.</span> &nbsp; I've looked at the MS troubleshooting guide for ActiveSync 4.2 and tried the fixes suggested, but they are either not relevant or don't work.<br />
<br />
The ActiveSync troubleshooting window opened for the first time today, and after the scan offered the following diagnosis: "Unable to establish a connection between the PC and the device."<br />
<br />
This is getting boring.&nbsp; If I really have to reboot my computer every time I want to sync my phone, it's going straight back to the shop and I'll get an iPhone: bizarrely, an Apple device connects perfectly happily with my Windows PC, but a Windows device doesn't
 want to talk to my Windows PC.<br />

            Thanks for the suggestion, but since this is a clean installation of XP and none of the symptoms suggested in the article you referenced are occurring on my machine, I'm hesitant to delete and recreate a user profile on my machine.<br />
<br />
However, here's a new thing: after rebooting this morning, ActiveSync worked fine until a few minutes ago.&nbsp; Nothing additional plugged into the computer, no new internet/network connections established.&nbsp; ActiveSync remains on my desktop, it just resolutely
 refuses to sync.&nbsp; It does, however, allow me to add and remove programs through the desktop interface.&nbsp; How weird is that?<br />

<br />
After 24 hours of happy sync'ing, ActiveSync is now refusing to do the honours - the little symbol is just spinning away on my desktop and it's saying "connecting" endlessly.<br />
<br />
Another reboot beckons...

If you are using Outlook, why would you not want to transfer them using Activesync/WMDC?

    <title>New Laptop, old HDD, old System and sad Activation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> themeganeme  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Laptop, old HDD, old System and sad Activation</h2>
                    <p>Hello. Just today, August 19th I finally got my hands on a new laptop and switched my good old Lenovo B590 with Windows Pro on board to Asus G751JY. Got old trusty HGST hard disk drive inside the new monster of a machine, waited for devices to set up, installed
 all the extras from Asus official website only to notice later that my Windows is not activated anymore - kinda expected that, since it's a new hardware and all, but here comes the sad part - running the Troubleshooter did nothing, only told me that my new
 device can only have Windows 10 Home on board for free, which in turn requires me to reinstall the OS or buy Pro from store for extra bucks. Since I'm an Insider (third laptop already not to mention the Desktop - it got Pro just fine) I expected to keep Pro
 status from previous laptops and stuff, so here's the question: can I retain my WIndows 10 Pro Insider Preview (Early Access) status or I have to switch to home/waste money on something I already had and now lost?</p>
<p>tl;dr: Can I get my Pro edition back? I'm an Insider and stuff.</p>

            <p>Sorry, I understood your situation alright. I was commenting more on what Mel had described.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was officially never intended for Insiders to end up with activated Windows 10 Pro on devices that never had Pro to begin with, but when activation was based on the supplied Insider Product Keys and Insiders did clean installs of Pro, that is what happened
 in many cases. &nbsp;But, as has been already said here, that process ended prior to July, 2015, when Digital Entitlement took over as the ongoing activation process. &nbsp;That meant that only devices licensed for Pro could activate Windows 10 Pro, even if they were
 running Insider Builds (since there were no longer any Product Keys that would activate current Windows 10 public or Insider builds for free).</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I'm using MS exchange for my emails.</p>
<p>2. Not every email. I'm sending an email with a pdf attachment and the recipient can open the email, but the pdf is changed to a winmail.dat file and they can’t open it.</p>

            <p>HI Praveen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a very similar problem as Andhag described and it is very annoying. I'm using Win10, Office365, Outlook 2016 all at most current update. My primary email account is hotmail.com (Exchange hosted by Microsoft). Ever since upgrading to&nbsp;Win10, Office365,
 Outlook 2016 from Win7, Outlook2010 I have the problem that ANY attachment I send to ANY gmail recipient who is using Mac Mail or iOS Mail receives a
<strong>winmail.dat attachment</strong> instead of the original attachment. Also, if my email body contains a link, the entire body is stripped out and winmail.dat is attached. If I send from another email host (not Exchange) I don't have the problem. I did
 not have the problem when using Outlook2010 with the very same hotmail.com account. I have verified that Outlook2016 is set to send emails in HTML format according to online instructions I have found.</p>

    <title>Outlook Account Suspension And Recovery Broken - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tortugas00678  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Account Suspension  And Recovery Broken</h2>
                    <p>So I posted something similar on my other Microsoft account because at the time I was not able to get on this account. Someone helped me by giving me a few links to recover my account. I still believe this system is very much broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know how an account gets suspended. Ever since the first time my account was suspended I have to recover it everyday! It gets suspended as soon as the next day starts. And the process to recover an account is broken, which I crazy. I have
 to enter a phone number to recover my account, but i have to use a different phone number each time! I&nbsp; have used all the phone numbers in my families house to recover it. Each time i try to use one that I already used is says "Usage Limit Exceeded, Please
 Try Again Tomorrow." I try it again the next day and it still says the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The links that Parmi gave in my other form question have me create a new password, and that is another thing that is makes everything confusing. I have changed my Password about 6-7 times now an its hard to keep track since I am changing it so often. I have
 also checked my the account activity and have not had an account breach over a month, so I don't know what is getting my account suspended.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I just really want my account to not be suspended tomorrow! This is a business email account, I would really to keep this and not create another. I would have to print new flyers and business cards if i create a new email.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Dear Tortugas00678,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />Quote from Microsoft article <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/13956/microsoft-account-temporarily-suspended" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/13956/...</a> ( you will also find more about how to unblock your account in it) :
<br />To help protect you from fraud or abuse, we might have temporarily suspended your account because we noticed some unusual activity. We know this is frustrating, but we can help you get back into your account easily in a few steps.
<br />
<br />Also when you are going abroad and try to access your account, system checks the location and device. If those two are unfamiliar system may block access to the account due to security reasons (as it thinks that it may be compromised <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/10494/microsoft-account-how-to-access-a-compromised-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/10494/...</a> )
<br />
<br />In order to avoid this situation you can do the following:
<br />1. Add your devices to the list of trusted devices <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12369/microsoft-account-add-a-trusted-device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12369/...</a>
<br />2. Update security information and add your phone number <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12428/microsoft-account-security-info-security-codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12428/...</a>
<br />
<br />This should allow you to get access to your account in any location (tested myself, as I had the same problem, and as for now it works)

                    <p>Just bought my wife a new laptop. Installed Office 365 and in the process upgraded her from Outlook 2007 to Outlook 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook works fine with one exception,when she accepts a calendar invite, the event is correctly added to her calendar but the reply to the invite is forever stuck in her outbox. All other email works just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Details:</p>
<ul>
<li>She has two Gmail accounts that she has used successfully for years</li><li>Both accounts are POP</li><li>One of the accounts is set as DEFAULT</li><li>If I send an invite to the DEFAULT account, invite is visible in her inbox, she can accept it, it goes onto her calendar, reply gets stuck in outbox</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>If I send an invite to the non-DEFAULT account, invite is visible in her inbox, she can accept it, it goes onto her DEFAULT calendar, reply gets sent successfully</li><li>Both accounts have IDENTICAL setting in Outlook</li></ul>
<p>What I have do to try to fix this after numerous Google searches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run Outlook in safe-mode...problem still persists.</li><li>Disabled all add-ins...problem still persists.</li><li>Disabled Microsoft defender...problem still persists.</li><li>Disabled Malwarebytes...problem still persists.</li><li>I have no other anti-virus software on this computer</li></ul>

    <title>Build 9879 turning HDD on and off continuously - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> techie007l  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 9879 turning HDD on and off continuously</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just discovered a really nasty bug in build 9879.&nbsp; Whenever Windows turns the screen off while running on battery power, it also continuously sends the spin-down command to at least the C: drive, causing it to spin up and spin down every couple of
 seconds, which will cause the drive to fail prematurely.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's a screenshot showing all the spin-up and spin-down events, and the short list of running processes:<br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/14a9c047-4ac3-4af2-843e-9797ee6bd9de" height="452" width="455" /></p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the laptop running on battery power, I launched another program I wrote to send the
<strong>SC_MONITORPOWER</strong> -&gt; <strong>MONITOR_OFF</strong> message (same thing that Windows does after 60 seconds at the Lock Screen).&nbsp; As soon as the screen turned off (at 5:20:00 PM), the spin-down/spin-up sequence started and continued until I moved
 the mouse to turn the screen back on.&nbsp; The behavior is exactly the same if I let Windows turn the screen off in five minutes (or whatever the timeout is set to in Power Options).&nbsp; However, if the laptop turns the screen off via hardware when I shut the lid,
 the HDD keeps running as it is supposed to (with my Power Options setting to do nothing when the lid is closed).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Researching further, I discovered even stranger behavior:</p>
<ol>
<li>This only happens when the laptop is running on battery power.</li><li>While the screen is off, if I unplug the laptop, the HDD starts cycling, the screen turns back on for a couple seconds showing the lock screen, and turns back off.</li><li>If I plug the laptop in, the HDD immediately stops cycling, the screen turns on again for a couple of seconds showing the lock screen, and turns back off.</li><li>After moving the mouse to wake the screen, the HDD stops cycling, and the lock screen shows for 60 seconds.&nbsp; When the screen turns off again, the cycling resumes if on battery power.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's a download link to an MP4 video I made of the behavior.&nbsp; The hum is the HDD, and the whirring is the CPU fan.&nbsp;
<a href="https://mega.co.nz/#%21ZJI0mCDC%21R3D2XQQ8huJ41v6UeiRoAL6sZeEO7POsmJjbras7qeE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows 9879 turning HDD on and off.mp4</span></a> (6.2 MB).&nbsp; You will hear the HDD rapidly and repeatedly spinning down and spinning up.&nbsp; The cycling speed does seem to vary.&nbsp; In my screenshot, it was approximately every
 4-6 seconds; in my video, it is much faster; and when I tested again later, the HDD would stay off for 5-15 seconds at a time.&nbsp; In each case, the "on" time was usually about a second or two, so Windows is sending the spin-down command frequently, and the drive
 is spinning back up whenever it is being accessed by Windows.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>I'd love to hear from those of you running build 9879 on a laptop, whether you see this same behavior or not</strong>.&nbsp; The easiest way to test is to press [Win]+[L] and wait a minute for the screen to turn off, and watch the HDD LED/listen to the
 HDD.&nbsp; When the HDD is spinning up/down, the HDD LED glows continuously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you would like, you can download <a href="https://mega.co.nz/#!IIYAnIAA!v-HON2BQIwZaXLCgbWrD18qBFBea1DQVnpWPtu_i94g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">HddPowerState.exe from here</span></a>, and
<a href="https://mega.co.nz/#!wEx2xBIZ!CpiFKPpLG1RKtFbnTlqLe0kPKndUTt4ZxOvWhlHxLnQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ScreenOff.exe from here</span></a>.&nbsp; Both are standalone and small.&nbsp; ScreenOff.exe passes VirusTotal with 0/56 detection rate.&nbsp; HddPowerState.exe doesn't do so good, with a detection rate of 8/56 (probably due to its
 low-level device access at launch to retrieve device names).</p>
<p>
</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft, please fix this bug!&nbsp; And while you're fixing it, please make it so that the screen stays off when power is plugged-in and unplugged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows XP was your last operating system that could sit still (and only after quite a bit of tweaking).&nbsp; I strongly suggest that your programmers start studying their work with Process Monitor.&nbsp; What is visible there for both the HDD and the registry
 is very embarrassing, a display of inefficient and poorly thought out program structure throughout many components in the OS.&nbsp; With Windows as it is now, there is no way that you can keep the C: drive off, because Windows never sits still.&nbsp; In Windows XP as
 a live camera/audio server, I was able to get it to the point that the C: drive would only spin-up once or twice a day.&nbsp; Nowadays, the C: HDD won't ever spin down, even at the 10 minute setting because Windows 7/8/10 can't stop accessing it.&nbsp; And this is even
 after I disable a pile of services and scheduled tasks!</p>

            i am hoping to do a fresh build from the 9879 ISO over the weekend in order to see if it behaves any differently. i'll give it a test using just battery power too and see what happens.

            <p>i dont think i am seeing your issue on my thinkpad t61.&nbsp; hgst 7k1000. fresh install from 9879 ISO. plus available updates, the&nbsp; PUIS HDD problem is still present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cycled from ac to battery and back several times with screen both on and off. I did not see any difference in the HDD led operation.&nbsp; with screen off, inserting/removing ac power causes screen to light back up briefly as you stated. i did not hear HDD
 spinning up or down either. i do not use password at screen turn on so mine goes directly to desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no internal instrumentation or data to verify exactly what is happening.</p>

            <p>I&nbsp; do not have an HDD on my laptop and my desktop does not show options for Battery&nbsp;verses Plugged in but what do your Power Options show?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have setting for Hard disk or PCI Express when on battery, set them to "Do Nothing" or "Off"&nbsp;and see what happens after you re-boot your laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Control Panel/Power Options/Edit Plan Settings/Change Advanced Power settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also click on "Change settings that are currently unavailable" when on the last&nbsp;dialog that shows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also&nbsp; check to see if you have any other power settings that might be related to disk or disk controllers.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for the information, but I am quite sure that Windows is the culprit here, since the HDD works just fine the rest of the time, and the spin-up/spin-down events show in my program.&nbsp; At least in Windows 7, the GetDevicePowerState API that my
 program uses only returns the correct information if Windows sends the spin-up/spin-down commands.&nbsp; If the HDD spins-down on its own, or a 3rd party program (like HDDScan) sends the command, the GetDevicePowerState API still says the drive is on!<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, I have experimented with ridiculously low HDD self-timer settings, and the HDD doesn't attempt to spindown until the entire duration (even a couple of seconds) has elapsed since the last access.&nbsp; In my case here, the HDD is repeatedly attempting
 to spin-down while accessing data, which is exactly what happens if I were to repeatedly click the [Spindown] button in HDDScan.&nbsp; While accessing data, I can hear it park the head and begin to lose speed, and immediately spin back up and unpark the head.&nbsp;
 Repeatedly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will check (and experiment) with Power Options as soon as I have access to the laptop.&nbsp; The settings are certainly set correctly, although it will be interesting to see how changing them affects things, particularly the
<strong>High performance</strong> profile.</p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for testing.&nbsp; Some HDDs are really hard to hear, or perhaps your system is not exhibiting this behavior.&nbsp; I added download links for my HddPowerState and ScreenOff programs, if that would help you test.&nbsp; They can be found in my opening post.<br />

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Correct.&nbsp; Since at least Windows XP, Windows has shipped with the Visual Basic 6 runtime libraries, and these two programs don't use an advanced UI.&nbsp; Because of these things, they don't install anything; they just function when launched, and are gone
 when closed.<br />

<p>Greetings to all mates.&nbsp;I've not been here for long time.</p>
<p>Okay, I've a problem with my N97 web browser. When I try to log on to my school email acc, the N97 shows the error above.....but when I refresh(reload content), then it shows the content. My n95 doesn't do that(same settings, same operator, same wifi)....so
 why?</p>
<p>I've done both hard and soft reset just in case, but none helped.I'm dumbfounded! I try to acces my school email via opera mini Which i installed on my n97, but it works fine....no error...! huh!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone has a suggestion? Thank you.</p>

<p>It's a student /uni email account...</p>
<p>yea I don't mind using opera but I just don't like its interface sometimes. It trims off a few letters when page is wide and the mobile view which fixes this issue isn't that great either. I prefer the bulit in browser but now I'm confused by the error I'm
 encounting.</p>

<p>Yeah I figured it be a uni email account but do they use Microsoft exchange? caz if it is you can just use the Microsoft exchange on your phone. And if they don't honestly unless your on Wifi there is no point of using the Nokia's web browser, its slow.</p>

            <div>Hi Greg..A,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Without your sheet this question is impossible to answer.</div>
<div>Try to optimise your calculations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For example, if you are using many lookups, perhaps use a helper column in </div>
<div>which you do a look up once using the MATCH function and subsequently use the </div>
<div>helper column as an argument to INDEX functions. That should speed up calcs </div>
<div>considerably.</div>
<div>But as I said: without any idea of your sheet, this is hard to answer.</div>

            <p>If your table contain many formulas that contain functions like VLOOKUP(), MATCH(), FIND() and others that can reference entire columns, try giving them specific row references to prevent the possibility that they are trying to look through all 1-million+
 possible rows in an Excel 2007/2010 worksheet.</p>
<p>For an example, perhaps you have a formula like this</p>
<p>=VLOOKUP(A1,Sheet2!$A:$F,4,False)</p>
<p>and your data on Sheet2 goes down to row 367, you might change the formula to become;</p>
<p>=VLOOKUP(A1,Sheet2!$A$2:$F$367,4,False)</p>
<p>or to give yourself some "breathing" room for more data entries on Sheet2:</p>
<p>=VLOOKUP(A1,Sheet2!$A$2:$F$450,4,False)</p>
<p>Other array type formulas should also be looked at such as COUNTIFS(), SUMIFS() and SUMPRODUCT() for the same type of issues.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the replies, however it has not really helped.&nbsp; The spreadsheet&nbsp;mainly utilises:&nbsp;nested if's, and sum.&nbsp; It has a couple of countif's (not critical) however when i deleted them it only reduced the total calculation time from&nbsp;36 seconds to&nbsp;34
 seconds. There are no vlookup's and i have everything looking at only the cells needed rather than entire columns.</p>
<p>Maybe the next version of excel will be better able to multi-thread as when this calculates, my CPU usage max's out at 25% (i have a quad core).</p>
<p>A friend has a computer that he has overclocked running at 5 Ghz (vs my 2.8Ghz) and his calculation time is approx. 20 seconds for the same spreadsheet.&nbsp; Is the amswer in more grunt?</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

<p>Thank you for the replies, however it has not really helped.&nbsp; The spreadsheet&nbsp;mainly utilises:&nbsp;nested if's, and sum.&nbsp; It has a couple of countif's (not critical) however when i deleted them it only reduced the total calculation time from&nbsp;36 seconds to&nbsp;34
 seconds. There are no vlookup's and i have everything looking at only the cells needed rather than entire columns.</p>
<p>Maybe the next version of excel will be better able to multi-thread as when this calculates, my CPU usage max's out at 25% (i have a quad core).</p>
<p>A friend has a computer that he has overclocked running at 5 Ghz (vs my 2.8Ghz) and his calculation time is approx. 20 seconds for the same spreadsheet.&nbsp; Is the amswer in more grunt?</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

<p>Hello Greg,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Are you sure that you have no INDIRECT function calls in your sheet?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You could analyze your sheet with FastExcel. And Tom's link really should give you some direction.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Bernd</p>
