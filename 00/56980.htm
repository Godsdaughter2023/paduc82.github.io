<h2>            Microsoft settings &#40;updates&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Folks</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I type update in the search box, to try and bring up the update settings page, the page appears without details of updates in the body of the page, It is just blank. Also on the left side of the page you can not access the functions.</p>
<p>This has happened twice, and lasted for about 36 hours. It will then reappear, usually stating that updates need to be installed.</p>
<p>Hope I have explained that well enough. Can anyone advise?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>Is there’s an error message when signing in to the Skype application? Are you having the same issue on Skype for Windows 10 (UWP)? I suggest you try
 this instructions below for the meantime and check on the issue again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Uninstall and reinstall the Skype application.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Temporary disable any security programs and firewall on your device. This is to check if it’s blocking the Skype app.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Try to use the other Skype app on Windows, which is the Skype for Windows 10 (UWP).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Try to sign in with a different account and check if you will have the same issue.</span></span></p>

<p>Thanks for your help :)</p>
<p>But I uninstalled and reinstalled again but it doesn't work.</p>
<p>I also tried the Skype Preview for windows 10 but it worked the first time then I only can receive messages but I can't send. When I try the web version it works but I prefer the Desktop version because it guards the history of conversations and the media.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;did&nbsp;deactivate&nbsp;the&nbsp;antivirus&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;firewall&nbsp;but&nbsp;still&nbsp;can't&nbsp;sign&nbsp;in.&nbsp;Always&nbsp;after&nbsp;I&nbsp;type&nbsp;the&nbsp;password&nbsp;It&nbsp;asks&nbsp;again&nbsp;for&nbsp;entering&nbsp;it&nbsp;again (I'm 1000% sure the password is correct) and when I try to sign in with another account the same will happen.</p>
<p>There is no error message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking for your replies.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h3> adamlaviguer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why don&#39;t notifications popup when I adjust volume by my keyboard&#63;</h2>
                    This happened to my laptop that was running Windows 7 and recently on my new desktop running Windows 7. It is quite annoying not seeing the setting the volume is at when I adjust it via keyboard. It still changes the volume, the notifications just don't
 pop up anymore. The volume icon is visible on the taskbar. I've been to the taskbar properties, then to customize the notification area, and have the volume set to "show icon and notifications." I still don't see any notifications. This is a very irksome problem.

            <p>Hello Adam,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<ol>
<li>Did you make any significant hardware and software changes to the computer prior to this issue?</li><li>Do you get any error code or message? If yes, what is the complete and exact error message?</li><li>When you say, "notifications just don't pop up anymore", do you mean that the volume icon on the taskbar does not slides up or down?
</li><li>If not, then, are you referring to any volume manager utility preinstalled by the system manufacturer that gives a notification on the screen when you change the volume?</li></ol>
<p>Please send a screen shot of the issue for clarification:</p>

            1. Yes, I downgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 7 before this started happening.
<div>2. There are no error messages.</div>
<div>3. The volume icon does change, but the popup that I would get on the desktop when I changed the volume by keyboard does not appear anymore.</div>
<div>4. I'm thinking I am referring to that.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There is no way to screenshot the problem because the problem is nothing appears when I change the volume via buttons on my keyboard.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regarding Method 1:</div>
<div>- I will try that as soon as I submit this post.</div>
<div>Regarding Method 2:</div>
<div>- The problem does not lie with the icon in the notification area on the taskbar.</div>
<div>Regarding Method 3:</div>
<div>- I do not wish to restore my computer back to Windows 8.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I feel like I'm missing a driver of some sort. I downloaded and installed all the driver's that could possibly have anything to do with this problem but I still have it. If you have any other ideas, please let me know!</div>

    <title>Corrupted files after switching Xboxes&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reraised  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupted files after switching Xboxes&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So this is a strange problem and I'm pretty sure nothing can be done about it, but anyways:</p>

<p>I recently bought a refurbished Xbox (and older one that I believe is an Arcade) &nbsp;to replace an Xbox that I had - but kept the same hard drive and everything else.</p>
<p>I went to play Forza Horizon, a game I downloaded off the Xbox Marketplace, but I got an error message saying that the disc was unreadable. I went to the storage part of the settings on the dashboard and found that one of the Horizon files - my singleplayer
 save file - was corrupted. It's strange because the multiplayer portion of the game was not corrupted and that will still load all of my cars and whatnot. I would think that the multiplayer part of the game wouldn't work either considering it consists of a
 lot of the same memory that the singleplayer would use, but I've never had a corrupted file before so I guess I don't know how they (don't) work...</p>
<p>So after I found that out I went through my other games in storage and found that the only other game that had corrupted files, and a few of them as well, was Modern Warfare 3, but I haven't tried playing it yet.</p>
<p>I know that most of the time files are corrupted due to doing something with the Xbox while data is being saved. But that's not the case here...at least I'm pretty sure it's not. I was just playing both of these games before I bought the refurbished Xbox,
 and I'm not one to just randomly shut off my Xbox while data is being saved.</p>
<p>Has anybody else ever had this problem? And is there a way to fix this?</p>

<p>He says it's an arcade, and mentioned Modern Warfare 3...So not an Xbox One.</p>
<p>All I can say, is make sure that your Arcade is updated to the latest dashboard version. Don't attempt to read the files, or in any way modify them (through respective game). If there's a mismatch in dashboard versions (especially when going from a very
 new one to a very old one), things like this can happen.</p>

<h2>            Issues with installed Windows Update and security.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: My own naive stupidity = Constant security problems after sharing TOO MUCH with the wrong guy - bogus window updates? (Attached)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I know far too little to understand how my basic security is violated&nbsp; - but naively left all the doors open and invited disaster - and for the first time in 20 years - I got it, bigtime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure you experienced users see alot of this from paranoid individuals - but I am not paranoid per se, though I justifiably became so with PC to the extent I tried moving to an iMac. Unfortunately, some of the coolest programs I do understand and used
 to help optimize my sites do not work with Apple - so it has been traumatic trying to shift over - now back to PC all over again. Before moving to Apple I bought new hardware but to no avail, but here I am again on a brand new HP laptop - seeing some of the
 same stuff which does not look right at all. I am DESPERATE for someone to help me determine if what I am seeing COULD BE&nbsp; the first steps to opening up my new machine (again).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 paragraphs on background as to how this started based on what I have learned since - showing how I left myself wide open:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The individual I shared info with is a brilliant student at Cornell - a coder. I gather he has a "dark side" and initially mistook him for somebody else when we met. Info related to an App with potentially wide appeal and I yapped about it in enough detail
 that I guess he felt he could do it on his own - with a little more info. He feigned great excitement about meeting to discuss development terms. When I asked for his phone number he said "I prefer to communicate thru email" and I naively emailed him from
 my main address a few days later to set up our meeting.</li><li>I did so from a machine I had just moved from the West Coast with, had virtually no security set up, was using an admin account, had all of my critical files including IRS correspondence and App info saved right to my desktop, with spooling on. I have since
 learned what a disaster that opened me up to, and after not hearing back after numerous emails - weeks later when the "oh ****" notion occurred (as his mistake was never even answering me with an ' I'm too busy' or 'sorry but not interested any more' after
 that initial 'count me in I will do it!' response) I right clicked on all the important desktop files and saw they had ALL been opened the day after my first email to him.
</li></ul>
<p>BOTTOM LINE - On this new Laptop I am setting up, I bought a new router as well - and ran thru initial set-up, after which I created a standard account and set UAC to max and deployed Webroot. I work solo and have no network, so narrowed any entry point
 I could think of (from an amateur to intermediate standpoint, etc) though I know nothing about specific ports etc. I thought the computer did its thing with all updates etc, but yesterday when I turned on router for several minutes got the 'limited connection
 notice" and today have numerous "windows updates" which are pending a restart (last image below).
</p>
<p>===================================================================================</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know where I was this morning&nbsp; was this morning - because the format looked different than the windows updates in the screenshots below - and I am sure there were about 50 or more updates pending a restart - whereas now in screenshot 'windows update
 4' I only see a handful that do not have any install date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost ALL the updates I saw this morning related to multiple frameworks versions 3 thru 4.5 and many many security updates for Microsoft Visual C++ in different versions going back to 2010. I still see a few showing up now, though these look more like real
 updates even though they state the installation was in 2014, and out of order as far as the other install dates go. is this all normal?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done nothing more than check my email and visited a few familiar (whitelisted) sites. Am I turning into one of those paranoid freaks?&nbsp; this stuff is driving me crazy.. so a few more questions if anyone has the time:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the resources and am willing to spend the money if it is feasible, but can I hire someone to help me with security? I am one man on one machine - but feel like there are exploitable holes everywhere for a brilliant coder. If so, however, where?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone set up a honeypot in my case? I know who the individual is but he, too, knows I know little to nothing. Can anybody be truly effective? Or realistically, if I have some brilliant nut who wants to get into me (and I emphasize - think top 1%
 of talented hackers) is there as little that someone with my level of knowledge can really do to keep him out? The latter statement is my understanding of the security situation in today's world for a basic novice like myself.
</p>
<br />
<p>I've included a few screenshots and the updates "pending a computer restart" - which I am very hesitant to do - but is there any point in worrying this much?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opinions and or suggestions, no matter how critical, are appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks, Tom</p>

</p><p>Any ideas are welcomed, please!</p>

<h2>            Skype keeps making my daughter download a new version, every time</h2>
                    I'm fine -- on Windows 10 -- but my daughter has a Mac, and when we tried to Skype she had to go through a long process of updating her Skype version. We didn't mind that time, but then two or three days later the exact same thing happened. This doesn't
 make sense. She just wants to abandon Skype. Anyone else have this problem? Thanks for your help.

    <title>Windows 7 no longer recognizes or allows ASIO drivers for my usb audio - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dpdrake  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 no longer recognizes or allows ASIO drivers for my usb audio interfaces</h2>
                    <p>Hello All, last year I purchased a new version of Propellerheads Reason and the &nbsp;Balance digital audio interface that came with the bundle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything was fine it all worked well, especially when I added asio4all drivers. (The Balance comes with its own asio driver).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Super low latency on my keyboard and midi guitar. &nbsp;I was using my midi guitar and set up at jams for several months last year and it was great!</p>
<p>
</p><p>One day I was getting ready for the jam session and I noticed that the latency on my midi guitar became so bad that I could not play in time with the other musicians.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked out the preference/audio page in Reason and saw that my asio drivers were missing! I immediately went and down loaded asio4all again and installed it. It would show up in any of my music software. I have tried removing and re-installing the stock
 ASIO driver that came with Balance and no luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that shortly before this &nbsp;huge problem ( my music software is basically useless without asio drivers) I allowed a windows update to my system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that somehow during one of these "updates" something changed and windows 7 no longer allows asio drivers on my computer. This really sucks!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some way to get rid of the offending "update" that ruined my music system?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don</p>

            <p>Hello Ramesh, I tried everything that you mentioned. I particularly noticed that the audio troubleshooter simply does not recognize any usb audio devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far no luck, I have narrowed it down to windows 7 being the cause of the problem. I may have to switch to Apple if I want to use pro audio equipment.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Making a guest account but locking certain apps and folders on windows 10</h2>
                    I am using a laptop and i have plenty of apps and folders on the main hard drive that the guest account is using that i don't want it to have access to. Unfortunately the only "Native" way to lock the guest account from doing certain things is to lock
 it to only one app. which is both a hindrance and if the guest needs other programs it would need me to go into my main account and change it which is not something i wish to do all the time. Is there any way to lock certain apps to be only used on my main
 account and files to be locked from the guest account.

            <p>The best way I can think is using Local Group policies (or Registry edits). I am not sure how comfortable you are editing local policies or Registry.</p>
<p>For example, you can block access to Windows store using policies: <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/itpro/windows/manage/stop-employees-from-using-the-windows-store?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h3> daveguppy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Surface Pro 2 - Power Cover</h2>
                    <p>I know a Power Cover is due to be released in 'early 2014'</p>
<p>Does anyone know how:</p>
<ul>
<li>How heavy it is going to be? </li><li>How thick it is going to be? </li><li>How much longer battery life it will give? </li><li>When 'early 2014' will be : Jan or July!</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;don't want to buy one of the current ones and miss the benefits of the additional battery - butI don't want it to add much to the thickness or weight!</p>

<p>Have you heard anything in regards to the power cover? The link they gave for the product only covers the battery life increase of 50 percent. That means if you get&nbsp;6 to&nbsp;8 hours on the surface then with the cover you will get 9 to 12 hours of life.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But nothing in regards to it being backlit, the added weight, or how thick it will be.&nbsp;</p>

Me either... No information at all. I bought surface back in November and held off for the power cover to come out. Meanwhile, I'm bearing with extra inconvenience of carrying a separate BT keyboard such as the one from Logitech. Most of the time I just simply
 leave the KB at home because it's such a hassle to carry separate item with me rather than a single device (for note taking in class).<br />
<br />
I kept checking and checking with MS website to see if there's anything new about this power cover. I just want to know WHEN it'll be available as it's almost the second month in 2014. SOON it will no longer seem to me to be EARLY...<br />

            I bought my new surface pro 2 back in November and have been holding off buying a new cover waiting for the power cover.&nbsp; MS delayed the release of the docking station so I created my own USB dock for my surface pro 1 and it still works great with the
 surface pro 2 so I recreated the USB dock solution for my wife's surface.&nbsp; The delay in releasing the docking station cost MS&nbsp;3 sales in just my 1 house because that is how many USB stations I have created.&nbsp; My wife didn't want to wait for the battery cover
 so she opted for a plain type cover.&nbsp; I am still using a usb keyboard and don't usually take the Surface to meetings because I don't have the battery type cover to use to take notes.&nbsp; Delaying this release is not only costing MS sales, it is also costing them
 free advertising because many of us are leaving the Surface on our desk when we go to meeting and still using notepads instead of the surface because we can't get a battery type cover.&nbsp; WAKE UP MS!!!&nbsp

<br />
Recently, I bought a second hand Surface Pro (1) but there're a few problems with the setting.<br />
1) I can't use wifi on it</p>
<p>2) When I tried to install drivers, the message "Intel (R) network adapter not present on this computer" popped up. I searched the Internet, ran through many forums, followed solutions from many replies and yet nothing works.<br />
<br />
If anyone can give me some guidance/solution, it would be GREAT. Thank you so much for your time!<br />

<p>Generally partitioning a single drive is of no advantage, the only possible advantage is if you store data on the second partition and it makes it easier for you to backup</p>
<p>If the drive fails so will all your partitions, if you install apps to the second partition you will still have to reinstall them if you format/redo your win drive</p>
<p>You should allow win to manage your performance / paging file and no you cannot do without it</p>

<div>Can you? Yes. Should you? Definitely not!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. If you don't have a page file, you can't use all the RAM you have.</div>
<div>That's because Windows preallocates virtual memory in anticipation of</div>
<div>a possible need for it, even though that allocated virtual memory may</div>
<div>never be used. Without a page file, that allocation has to be made in</div>
<div>real memory, thus tying up that memory and preventing it from being</div>
<div>used for any purpose.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. There is never a benefit in not having a page file. If it isn't</div>
<div>needed, it won't be used. Don't confuse allocated memory with used</div>
<div>memory.</div>

<p>your system does has a small disk drive so managing the amount of data you are storing on it may become a constant headache.</p>
<p>so in the future you might want to consider adding another harddrive to the system</p>
<p>in anycase, you can't disable the pagefile because programs need it.</p>
<p>however, it is likely that they don't need as much pagefile as it is set for now.</p>
<p>my suggestion is to set the virtual memory to a custom size.</p>
<p>set min=2 and set max=1150</p>
<p>1150 is an odd number but it was recommended by microsoft in the old days and i keep it in mind.</p>
<p>further, if the system needs more pagefile it will tell you and you can set the max to a higher amount.</p>
<p>incidentally, your partitioning scheme is sound.</p>
<p>be sure to keep your personal documents seperate from the system files.</p>
<p>that way if the event occurs and you need to format the system partition to reinstall the o.s., you won't loose you personal files.</p>
<p>also, you can change "my docs" to the second partition by right clicking on it, pulling up its properties page and change the defaul location.</p>

<p>Sure you can disable it - XP will run with no paging file, but it will not run as well if you have a properly configured paging file.</p>
<p>Unless you know more about managing memory than XP, you should leave your paging files at System managed size and let XP deal with it.</p>
<p>If you are seeing pop up information messages about the virtual memory or paging file, the solution is usually not to change the paging file, but to figure out what is using all your virtual memory and fixing the problem. &nbsp; &nbsp;If you just increase the size,
 you have not fixed the problem, but you fixed the symptom and the problem remains. &nbsp;Your machine will run better too when it is happy.</p>
<p>If you want&nbsp;usable&nbsp;analysis and advice about your configuration do this:</p>
<p>Please provide additional information about your system:</p>
<p>Click Start, Run and in the box enter:</p>
<p>msinfo32</p>
<p>Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste&nbsp;the information back here.</p>
<p>There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to&nbsp;be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</p>
<p>This will minimize back and forth Q&amp;A and eliminate guesswork.</p>

            <p>I have 16 GB of RAM. I have disabled the swap file (pagefile.sys) of Windows 8.1. After a reboot and a double check to insure that Windows did what it was told, here is the result:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Booting is faster</p>
<p>- Loading of programs is faster</p>
<p>- Surfing is faster</p>
<p>- Gaming is faster and smoother</p>
<p>- My SSD drive is not getting worn out by Windows</p>
<p>- I got a little space back on my drive after deleting pagefile.sys</p>
<p>- shutdown is almost instantaneous</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sad fact is that Microsoft has never fully utilized or understood the caveats of having extra RAM. So, they tell everyone the official answer which is to use their swap file system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An example of this ignorance was illustrated by the default Windows 8.1 installation. It set up my swap file so small that some applications were actually slowed down because of the bottleneck that was taking place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I checked on it, Windows 8.1 showed a notation stating that the pagefile.sys needed to be at least double its current size set by the Windows install routine. If this was so, why didn't the flag ship of Microsoft just set that up during the installation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set a restore point just in case, turn off the swap file, and see the results for yourself. If you are still convinced that you need a swap file, it should start out at 2.5 times the amount of RAM you have. As a default, I recommend 16 GB of RAM for any
 machine running Windows 7 or higher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're not gaming, switch to Ubuntu Linux. It's free and isn't crawling with bugs. It knows what to do with RAM, your hard drive, and all of your hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck.</p>

            <p>the page file was invented back when machines were limited to small amounts of memory. so back then, the page file was an ingenious method to give machines more power, per se.</p>
<p>
</p><p>but as i recall, later machines could accept more ram but were still limited as to how much more they could have. this was not a microsoft problem, but an engineering problem inherent to the design of motherboards. so the page file was still handy to have
 even on machines that could use up to 4 gigs of ram.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i think what you have found is the result of further improving the machines and the engineers (people or computer), allowed even more ram to be usable on machines, as such relying very little on the page file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>but unless microsoft made a change in windows, windows will create a hidden page file when none has been established by the windows user.&nbsp; i dont know much about this behind the scenes / hidden process because i have better things to do with my life than
 to second guess a multi billion dollar company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>also, third party programs, may still rely on the page file even though windows may not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what i do, is just set my page file size, ie the min and the max, both to the max size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i also set the pagefile on a different partition exclusively sized a bit bigger and used for the one pagefile.&nbsp; in otherwords, a have a partition just for the pagefile and i have very good results.&nbsp; but ideally, the pagefile could be on a seperate hard drive,
 if possible.</p>
<p>

            Hi OFS500 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />The only way to downgrade Pro to Home is a clean install of Windows 10 Home again. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

            Hi OFS500 
<br />
<br />The only options you would have to rectify this, are to either backup your data and clean install the Home Edition of Windows 10, or to purchase a Windows 10 Pro upgrade licence for $99 form the Microsoft Store
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues

<h2>            So Microsoft Finally listened to me and others that have made suggestions but...</h2>
                    
<p>I want to jump right into the meat of this thing.</p>
<p>For those that don't know me I've been lurking around the forums giving feedback where it's needed and making sure the competition stays fresh between Sony and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Honestly Microsoft has come a long way and with their recent price drop/Titanfall bundle I think they've finally managed to hit a home run. Basically you get a great new console, one of the year's best games, and some of the bundles even come with a month
 of xbox gold (something I've been asking for them to do for a long time).</p>
<p>All of this for $499.96 USD or cheaper.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-One-Console-Titanfall-Bundle/dp/B00IIHU44E/ref=sr_tr_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1393543483&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=xbox+one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-One-Console-Titanfall-Bundle/dp/B00IIHU44E/ref=sr_tr_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1393543483&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=xbox+one</span></span></a></p>
<p>I am thrilled about this and this should have been done from the beginning. Not when Microsoft is suffering and possibly losing this next gen race.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/02/15/microsoft-corporations-xbox-one-looks-like-a-total.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/02/15/microsoft-corporations-xbox-one-looks-like-a-total.aspx</span></span></a></p>
<p>Now this is where it gets kind of hairy for me. On one hand I'm glad to see Microsoft "fight back" with a vengeance, but on the other I'm like hey where's my month of Gold, where's my Titanfall?</p>
<p>I honestly feel like we're being punished for being an early adopter. From beta testing a glitchy UI that doesn't have things most consoles have (storage capacity info, controller battery life, etc.) to paying a higher premium price of admission. Most of
 the time early-adopters/alpha users get the product at a discount (just look at some of the games on Steam =P).</p>
<p>I've read numerous posts and one question I've seen asked: Will you be upset when next year they release [insert bundle here] with this free stuff? The answer is really simple, nope. But I am upset at this current time, just 3 and half months roughly of
 launch and they are already slashing console prices and offering a free AAA game with their console. Not paying any mind to those that have already purchased/renewed their Gold subscription.</p>
<p>The PS4 is going to be offering a similar bundle with Infamous (not really excited about that title), but the savings aren't going to be no where near what Microsoft is offering. You're getting almost $70.00 of free stuff for purchasing an Xbox now when
 we should have had that at release (Sony did).</p>
<p>When this was first announced I thought this was UK only since the Xbox was losing in that territory 2 to 1 or better. Not to mention the conversion rate still worked out they would still be paying more than I did(not saying I agree with that mind you) so
 I "got" it. Now I'm starting to see all of these mark-downs, store gift cards, and Titanfall bundles saving big time money in my currency- USD.</p>
<p>I get what they're doing and in some ways I appreciate it, but like many others I feel kind of burnt as well. I don't expect them to give me a free game at this point, but they could throw a free month of Gold and some store credits (something like $10)
 our way for being an early adopter - better yet offer us the digital version of Titanfall for $20-30.00 and I'd be happy.</p>
<p>This is what I have been preaching about. This shows Microsoft would rather pick-up new customers than offer value to their existing ones.</p>
<p>I want it to be known I'm still in agreement with what Microsoft is doing overall. This gives the console some value and should really push the console and Titanfall to new customers. However, this is one customer that just canceled his Titanfall pre-order
 for Xbox one and ordered an additional copy for PC (hey my wife likes the game too!).</p>
<p>Now I'm sure there will be a quick deadly response from the Xbox loyalists out there and before my old pals Rippen, Fallout, etc burn me at the stake I just wanted to speak my peace =).</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Thanks for reading guys,</p>

<p>I'm sure that sucks, but there are already like 8 threads about this very issue. &nbsp;Just stop it! &nbsp;This happens with any substantial purchase. &nbsp;You buy a new fridge for $1100 and a month later it's on sale for $900. &nbsp;Yes, it stings a little, but it happens.

<p>Well then you should had waited like the late adopters.... I don't care that they dropped the price. I've had my X-Box since DAY1.... LoL I've mastered about 5 games already, where as to the new Xbox 1 owners are just now learning how to play their new consoles....

<p>I'm not in agreement at all. It's inevitable that the will be discounts and freebies. Am I upset about it? No way. Buying at launch is always the most expensive time. If you don't want to deal with. Don't buy at launch. You have no one to blame but yourself!</p>

<p>And buying at midnight on a console launch is always fun. They may get a free game, which I also did but they will never have that Day 1 experience as trivial as that may be.</p>

<p>Again I think people missed the point. This should have been in the feedback section and it was my mistake for posting it here.</p>
<p>It wasn't just about the price drop or inclusion of Titanfall. It's about Microsoft not giving its current customers value, but you guys don't see that. So in all honesty I should probably stop wasting my time posting anything for or against this system.</p>
<p>This time next year I'm sure we'll all be happy with our Dreamcast, I mean Xbox One.</p>

                    <p>Original; Title: Problem with Booting Windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I'm currently having problems with my graphics drivers in which my computer starts, shows the blue windows logo, then moves on to a completely black screen where I can only see and move my mouse and it has a loading circle next to it and it never starts
 up. After doing some research I was unable to find a way to boot into safe mode on windows. Has anyone else experienced a problem like this or know how I can boot into safe mode so I can try to fix my computer?</p>
<p>

<h2>            USB hard drive does not appear in My Computer</h2>
                    I have an ADS tech external hard drive that allows one to put any regular HD in the case and connect it to the PC via USB.&nbsp; My 2-week-old machine has Windows7 running.&nbsp; After successfully accessing and removing all data on a HD using the USB external,
 I removed it from the computer, and placed another HD inside the USB case.&nbsp; Upon reconnecting, Win7 recognizes that a USB device is being connected.&nbsp; Windows also lists the device in the device manager and it is listed under Devices and Printers (from the
 Control Panel).&nbsp; Upon attempting to troubleshoot the device, I'm told that no problem can be identified.&nbsp; After rebooting with the device attached and unattached, it still does not appear in the list of Hard Drives in My Computer.&nbsp; Any suggestions/advice/solutions
 would be appreciated.

<p>This sometimes cures the problem:<br />
Firstly, go to Control Panel &gt; All Control Panel Items &gt; Folder Options &gt; View Tab and make sure there is not a tick in ’Hide empty drives in the Computer folder‘ and further down, confirm that there is a tick in ‘Show drive letters’.</p>
<p>Right-click Computer &gt; Manage &gt; Storage &gt; Disk Management, then right-click on the drive that is 'hidden' or ‘unallocated‘ &gt; Change Drive Letter/Paths... &gt; select a letter from nearer the end of the alphabet &gt; OK and the disk should show in Computer. Try
 another letter if it stays hidden.</p>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hi James</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are getting error "driver unavailable" while connecting the
<strong>HP 4570c </strong>scanner with the laptop.<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Here the root cause of the issue is compatibility. I tried checking for the drivers and found that the Scanner model&nbsp;<strong><span>HP 4570c&nbsp;</span></strong>doesn't
 support new Operating System Windows 8.1.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">However, if you want, can install older drivers to work with the Scanner by manually running the program in
</span>Compatibility mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most programs created for earlier versions of Windows will work in this version of Windows, but some older programs might run poorly or not at all. You can run the
<strong>Program Compatibility Troubleshooter</strong> on most programs to detect and fix common compatibility problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Below are some troubleshooting steps that you can follow.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp; </span><strong>Method 1: </strong>Run the<strong> Program Compatibility Troubleshooter</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap <strong>Search</strong>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click
<strong>Search</strong>.) </li><li>Enter <strong>run programs</strong> in the <strong>search</strong> box.</li><li>Tap or click <strong>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</strong>, and then tap or click
<strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Select the program you want to fix.<br />
– Or –<br />
If you don't see the program in the list, select <strong>Not Listed.</strong></li><li>Tap or click next, and then follow the instructions in the troubleshooter.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Method 2: <span>&nbsp;</span></strong>You can also install <strong>Windows Updates</strong> along with
<strong>Optional Updates</strong>. </p>
<p>Updates help to run program smoothly and automatically updates the device drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1:&nbsp; Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap <strong>Settings</strong> ,tap&nbsp;<strong>Change&nbsp;PC&nbsp;settings.<br />
</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2: Tap or click <strong>Windows Update </strong>.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>3. Try installing Updates if any pending updates are there.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>4. Once it is done try to install <strong>Optional Updates</strong>.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Ethernet bug &#40;Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ghjkdthgg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Ethernet bug &#40;Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller&#41;</h2>
                    <div>Hello!<br />
</div>
<div>
<p>Please let your developers know that there is some bug with <strong>Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller</strong>. I will repeat the problem's description:</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><em>I upgraded to windows 10, and during the first week everything was working fine. This night my PC installed win10 update, and after that, ethernet has stopped working.</em><br />
<em>Device manager does not display any errors.</em><br />
<em>It shows that all drivers are up-to-date.</em><br />
<em>I remind you that the issue appeared after recent update; at first, after upgrade to Win10 everything was working fine.</em><br />
<em>My computer is HP Pavillion 500-315nj (stationary PC)</em></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>So, directly after the upgrade to Win10 everything was fine, it's the recent upgrade (this night) that broke everything apart.<br />
I checked every part of my network (modem, router, cable) and they appear to work very well with Windows 10, so this issue is about Ethernet controller. As I said, mine is Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>What I tried:<br />
</p>
</div>
<div>1.Manually installed the newest driver 10.1.505.2015 (issued at 05.08.2015) - no effect.<br />
2.Disabled IPv6 everywhere I could reach (meaning, I did it via Fixit tool, via regedit, as described on MS site, and also disabled it in adapter itself) - no effect. I did it after reading suggestions from people who got the issue solved this way http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/win-10-dns-resolution-of-remote-network-via-vpn/513bdeea-0d18-462e-9ec3-a41129eec736</div>
<div>3.It is also proposed to turn off SplitTunneling, but I don't know how to disable it, and how to find out its current status (is it even enabled on my PC?).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Of course, turning IPv6 off is not a solution, since Windows counts it to be important for functionality.
</div>
<div>So, Windows 10 has a bug with Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller.&nbsp; If moderators here do not wish to help users solve those issues, then at least please tell your dev monkeys that they broke things with their "update" (which I even cannot revert or disable,
 because Windows 10 counts itself smarter then the user and, obviously, the computer should decide what is appropriate for user and not the other way around).<br />
<br />
<strong>Addition: troubleshooting tool says that "DNS server does not respond". </strong>

<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to be BitDefender Internet Security 15 (in my case). The second I turn its Firewall off, Internet starts working. When I turn it back on, DNS server does not respond and - no Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally: try to temporarily disable all&nbsp;anti-malware (antivirus, firewall, etc.) that you have, and see if it solves the issue..</p>

</p><p>Same here. Win10 was working fine till Aug 12, about 3AM. After that I could reach (ping)&nbsp;up to the first router only but not beyond.&nbsp;DHCP &amp; gateway etc. were showing fine. The second&nbsp;I switched off Bitdefender-FW all worked fine again</p>

            <p>Just for info -</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded from Windows 7 Premium to 10 a couple of days ago and as soon as 10 booted up my Internet stopped working.</p>
<p>No driver errors are shown - just an annoying message telling me that my Ethernet cable is no longer plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had to roll back to Windows 7 to cure the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same Realtek Bus controller shown above and this issue has been reported elsewhere so I guess&nbsp;Windows 10 has a bug that needs sorting before I can try the upgrade again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am using McAfee security which I did NOT disable for diagnosis.</p>

            For me the problem is that windows disables the peripherical. I have to manually enable it and then it works.

            <p>Have the same problem.</p>
<p>In the system management tools there is a little yellow triangle on the icon of "Controller i Realtek PCIe GBE-series".</p>
<p>When I acces properties I can read the following in hardwarestatus:</p>
<p>"This hardware is not functioning right, because windows couldn't read the drivers for the unit. (Code 31)."</p>
<p>"There wasn't found an object-ID in the file."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this will help a solution along, fast. I have to go back to win 7 again now. For the second time. I think I am going to wait till November before I try to install Windows 10 again.</p>

            last update lost the internet yellow triangle in the Ethernet window, device manager no errors working, trouble shooter error no IP, with the newest driver 10.1.505.2015, called Microsoft, on hold for 12 hrs no luck, tier 2 called next day no luck. reverted
 back to 9.1.401.2015 and internet works again.

            <p>So I am not actually in any of the boats any of the others are describing. The only "viras tool" I have is Windows Defender and turning that off briefly did not do anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried disabling the adapter - Nothing</p>
<p>I have tried manual IP and DNS - Nothing</p>
<p>Have installed the new Realtek Driver for Win10 - Nothing</p>
<p>Restarted PC - Nothing</p>
<p>Uninstalled the driver completely - Nothing</p>
<p>IPConfig /Release and /Renew</p>
<p>
</p><p>It all comes back to "Unidentified network". Digging further into this I found this exact same issue occurred on Windows 8.1 for some users upgrading from Windows 8. Every post was the same. The driver and hardware are fine as the device is sending packets
 but it is not able to receive packets packet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if any Microsoft person has any thoughts here, please chime in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDit:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Found another link to a couple of other articles talking about deleting the DNI-DNE entry in your netcfg via command line. Obviously this is not the answer as lots of people are still saying this is not working, not found or it does not pertain to them (DNI_DNE
 entries are made for VPN clients, if you do not have a VPN client, you do not have the entry).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems that something else is going on here. And it needs a fix... soon.</p>

            <p>I'm in the same position as you, I bought a brand new Lenovo Windows 8.1 desktop that worked fine when it installed all the 8.1 updates - including the Ethernet adapter. I allowed it to upgrade to Windows 10 and everything else is fine apart from the Ethernet
 adapter telling me that the cable is unplugged. I've checked and swapped the cable, but it made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spoke to the retailer's helpdesk and after we went through the deleting the drivers, reinstalling the drivers, downloading the latest driver from Lenovo (which resulted in a Code 10 fault) and reverting to the previous driver, they told me I have to wait
 for Realtek to update their driver. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a new updated driver on the Realtek site - but that didn't help, so I emailed the Lenovo helpdesk for help. They told me I had to do a reset, so I did, but the only advantage there was that it got rid of all the Lenovo preinstalled stuff, the Ethernet
 adapter&nbsp;stubbornly refuses to believe that I have a cable plugged into it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I'm going to have to just sit and wait patiently, just like everyone did during the debacle of the Windows 8 upgrade to 8.1</p>

<h2>            Computer Won&#39;t Recognize eHome Remote</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Hello all,</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>I'm using a Dell Inspiron E1705 laptop that I bough a few years ago and came with an Angel USB TV Tuner and the eHome Media Center Remote and IR Receiver.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have never gotten the remote to work with my com<span><strong>puter, and I would like to finally have it working now that I am using Windows 7.</strong></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>The IR receiver recognizes the signals coming from the remote - both the remote and the receiver light up, but nothing happens.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have tried a few fixes already. I have tried changing the IR channel, I have tried shorting the remote to reset it (as per an answer I saw here from an MS employee), I have tried downloading the free version of LM Remote Keymap, I have tried plugging
 the IR Receiver into a USB hub, and I have tried unplugging the receiver and tuner, rebooting, and plugging them back in to different USB ports. Obviously I didn't do all of these at once.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have checked the "Live Trace" on LM Remote Keymap when pressing keys on the remote, and it does not show any kind of input. The device manager shows the eHome Infrared Receiver as installed correctly, as well as Consumer IR Devices. When I tried
 unplugging and re-plugging, the computer also said the Infrared Transceiver installed correctly.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>I can't for the life of me figure out what's going on, since everything appears to be in order but the computer still shows no response to the remote.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your help, I really appreciate it.</strong></p>

<p><span>Hi Harvey Danger,</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to setup TV tuner troubleshooter,</span></p>
<p><span>It makes sure that your computer is receiving a TV signal, and that your TV tuner is connected and configured properly.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Open the Set up TV tuner troubleshooter by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button, and then clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>. In the search box, type
<strong>troubleshooter</strong>, and then click <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>. In the left pane, click
<strong>View all</strong>, and then click <strong>Set up TV tuner</strong>.&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.

<p>Hello Fouzan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but my problem has nothing to do with my TV signal. I get a signal perfectly fine and in fact I'm watching TV right now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem has to do with my<strong> remote, </strong>as I stated several times in my post.</p>

<p>I may have somewhat of the same problem. I have all of the latest drivers, and I, too, have tried shorting my remote and "remapping" the usb ports (unplugging, rebooting, etc.).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The difference between our problems is that my remote works, but not all the time. It will work temporarily for about 3-4 buttons presses, and then it's like the computer times-out on my presses and won't respond for a second. It seems like such a menial
 thing to be upset about, but when you're trying to scroll through the guide... there's no reason to use a remote if it only responds half the time.</p>
<p>Anyway, I MAY have one more thing you could try to alleviate your problems. It might be worth trying to Reset your remote control if you're using a microsoft associated remote. Hold down the DVD menu + "1" keys at the same time for about 5 seconds. The red
 light will flash twice and then you're done. Basically this makes your remote send out signals on IR frequency 1. If you want to send signals on channel 2, DVD Menu + "2"... and so on up to I think frequency 8.</p>

<p>I appreciate your help, WoolyBear, as well as the plight of anyone else that's in the same eHome remote problems boat as me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems I forgot to mention in my original post - I tried resetting the remote with that button combination as well, with no luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really wish I knew what the heck was happening. :( I wish stuff like this would "just work" as Apple likes to tout.</p>

            Hi Hans.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Did you create the media using only the Media Creation Tool?  Are you booting it as a UEFI device from the Boot Menu interrupt key for your PC?
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />If any further errors report back the number and full text as well as when exactly it occurred.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Try simplifying your configuration by keeping only your mouse and keyboard attached, that means:
<br />
<br />    Disconnecting multiple display monitors.
<br />    Remove discrete video cards, use the on-board graphics if your motherboard supports it.
<br />
<br />    Swap out memory modules - a RAM module might be corrupt - you can also ensure RAM sticks are installed slots 1 and 3. Your RAM modules might be corrupt, try scanning them for errors. <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/use-the-memory-diagnostics-tool-to-check-for-errors-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/use-the-memory...</a>
<br />
<br />    If you have more than one hard disk installed, disconnect all except the target disk where Windows 10 will be installed.
<br />
<br />    Reset your BIOS Defaults. <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />    Disconnect all external devices, since connected devices can sometimes confuse setup. 
<br />
<br />If setup is successful after performing these tasks, you can reinstall each removed component.

            Have a Sony Cybershot Camera, and can no longer access the memory card with the new upgraded windows 8.1. This is just so poor customer service. No updates available either. Wish I had not bothered to upgrade - finding more negatives than positives now.

Thank you, thank you!!!&nbsp; My Sony Cybershot DSC-F828 connects and works in normal mode now, e.g. I can copy pics to Windows 8.1 or delete pics in the camera from Windows.

            Many thanks, but I guess that means I still can't download my pictures, because I get automatic updates to Windows, so I must already have it.&nbsp; But it still doesn't work, so I don't know what else I can do.&nbsp; I'll try a card reader from ebay, or just buy
 a new camera with more modern technololgy.
