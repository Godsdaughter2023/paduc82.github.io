<p>This make 1 big pivot table with all the information.&nbsp; Now I have been asked to, instead of making one big one, make 3. (1) all the data except for 35,41 (2) only 35 (3) only 41.</p>
<p>Now I figured out that I can add the following code to exclude 35,41 from my main pivot table</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With ActiveSheet.PivotTables("PivotTable1").PivotFields("Succ")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .PivotItems("35").Visible = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .PivotItems("41").Visible = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With</p>
<p>But How can I make another pivot table, but limit it to only 35, not knowing how many other "succ" will be in the raw data?&nbsp; Is there a way to llop through the PivotItems for a specific PivotFields()?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>QB</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each PivotItem In .PivotItems<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If PivotItem &lt;&gt; "35" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PivotItem.Visible = False<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next PivotItem<br />

<p>There may be a better method, but this one does work!</p>

            I have a source code text file which does not end with .txt .docx etc. which I want to view and edit on my phone, but the phone won't open it from OneDrive because it doesn't know what app to use because the stupid Windows file system doesnt track that
 seperately from the name extension, so I can either change the extension or add associations. Unfortunately Cortana and the rest of the help is useless about these things on Mobile.

            I found a 3rd party file manager app that allows renaming extensions and also allows editing of text files regardless of extension, so my problem is doubly solved, even if such a seemingly simple task appears impossible via the native &nbsp;OS.

<h3> joel peabody  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sharepoint 365 - How to share with outside people when Live.com denies the ability to create an account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>We are just starting to use Sharepoint in Office 365 and have hit a dilemma already. &nbsp;We want to share things with people outside our company. &nbsp;We do not want to use "anonymous" links but would rather limit access to people by domain name. &nbsp;The people we
 share with are with other companies, and they all have their own domains. &nbsp;For most sharees, this has worked, but we've hit one that can't access the material. &nbsp;When he tries to create a Microsoft.com account using his company email, he is told that he cannot
 use a work address. &nbsp;The fallback for this would seem to be his creating an account through hotmail or gmail or something, which defeats the purpose of limiting access to a specific domain. &nbsp;I've done some googling and found it's most likely due to his company
 having Azure AD installed, and that this "feature" was implemented last year in order to...do something not quite clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since we deal in sensitive material and would like to utilize this major feature of the O365 system, what can be done to allow users who hit this block on their domains to access material we share with them? &nbsp;Is there some other path to validating this user's
 email address to create a Microsoft.com account? &nbsp;Or some other method of sharing that doesn't run into this block but still maintains the fractional security an account affords? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Joel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, we'd like to explain the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we share SharePoint online files with external users requiring signing in, the external users need to sign in with his Microsoft account or work/school account.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If the affected user is not using Office 365 online services(he does not sign in Office 365 online with his email address), it is an expected behavior that he cannot use his email address to sign
 in to access the shared material. </p>
<p>While you want to limit access to specific domains.</p>
<p><span>Given this, you can only use
</span><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">anonymous sharing. (not require signing in)</span></p>
<p><span>For your reference:
</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-external-sharing-for-your-SharePoint-Online-environment-C8A462EB-0723-4B0B-8D0A-70FEAFE4BE85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Manage external sharing for your SharePoint Online environment</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(89, 89, 89, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If the affected user is using Office 365 online service, please feel free to post back with detailed information, and<span>&nbsp;
</span>describe the issue with a related screenshot of the error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/514743ce-a9bf-4466-aed9-ba322e9fbf37" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/514743ce-a9bf-4466-aed9-ba322e9fbf37" /></a></p>
<p>But you can't actually use:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/05b041e4-4d21-4fed-a2e6-4d5f320ce012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/05b041e4-4d21-4fed-a2e6-4d5f320ce012" /></a></p>
<p>which is bizarre. &nbsp;Since we handle confidential information, and so anonymous sharing is off the table, I'm trying to understand
</p>
<p>1) if that is what the message actually means</p>
<p>2) how to get around that</p>
<p>3) why Microsoft would do that</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forcing potentially thousands of people we plan to share with to set up a new email addresses simply so we can use this product is not going to fly.</p>

<p>Hi Joel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that we cannot use a work or school account to sign up for a Microsoft account.
</p>
<p>These two accounts apply to different services. Work or school account is related to Office 365 for Business plans and Microsoft account is the one that you use for personal services like Xbox Live,
 Outlook.com, Windows 8, Windows Phone, and more.</p>
<p>That is why you get the error message in red.</p>
<p>Here is an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/dn531048.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> for your reference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding "For most sharees, this has worked, but we've hit one that can't access the material." in your post, for the affected user who cannot access the material, when he sign in with his work or
 school account, did he get any error message? </p>
<p>Please capture a screenshot of the error message for further troubleshooting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<p>Do you not see the screenshots in my previous reply? &nbsp;I mean, I guess you do, as you refer to them. &nbsp;The login screen has a link to "Create one!," which seems to refer to creating a Microsoft.com account. &nbsp;The user does not have a Microsoft.com account,
 so he clicks the link. &nbsp;When he tries to register one, he cannot use his email address, apparently because it's a "work" email address. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I use a business-centric platform like SharePoint to conduct business with outside businesses if the employees of these outside businesses cannot use a business email address to create a Microsoft account? &nbsp;Why would such a prohibition be in place?
 &nbsp;Furthermore, how does it know it's a "work" address? &nbsp;If I make up an address like "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" it doesn't give this warning, and someone with a bmw.com address is using a "work" email address, as far as I can imagine. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Joel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A <span style="font-weight: bold">work or school account</span>(which looks like ellen@contoso.onmicrosoft.com, ellen@contoso.edu, or ellen@contoso.com.) is the email address and account that you use to sign in to
<a href="http://portal.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 for Business</a> for work or school.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is related to Office 365 for Business service.</p>
<p>Please refer to the detailed information in this article:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-is-my-user-ID-and-why-do-I-need-it-for-Office-365-for-business-37da662b-5da6-4b56-a091-2731b2ecc8b4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What is my user ID and why do I need it for Office 365 for business?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The email address(jimxxx@****) should be a work or school account which uses custom domain. The custom domain is added to Office 365. And this type of account cannot be used to sign up for a Microsoft account, because these two types of account are applied
 to different services.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regarding another email address you mentioned (anyone@****), it can be used to sign up for a Microsoft account because it is
</span><span>not a work or school account. </span></p>
<p>For signing up for a Microsoft account, as long as not a work or school account, we can use Gmail/Yahoo account, outlook email address, or something like 123@aaabc.com<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>anyone@wewewe.com<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>…</p>

<p>I don't know if I'm not explaining this properly or you are not understanding, so I'll try again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The person I want to share a document with is not a user in our O365 system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>He is from an outside company. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I authorized his company's domain name in SharePoint sharing, and shared a document to his specific email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He does not have a Microsoft.com account, Office 365 account, Live.com account, Xbox account, or any other account you've referred to, so he is trying to create one. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>His email address is being rejected because it's a work email address. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This makes it very difficult to share with him. &nbsp;None of the other outside vendors I've shared with via SharePoint have had an issue creating Microsoft accounts using their work email addresses. &nbsp;Is there a fix this issue without having my correspondent
 create a new email account in a different domain just for this purpose? &nbsp;</p>

            I am reading the replies, but they make no sense. &nbsp;Tina keeps referring to the user's "accounts" when he has no account. &nbsp;An account is what the user is trying to create. &nbsp;People from four other companies have been able to follow this process, this user
 can't for some mysterious reason. &nbsp;So, fine, tech support it is.

<p>Hi Joel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update.</p>
&nbsp;<br />
<p>We have checked the affected user's email address. It is an Office 365 account(work or school account), which is created in local and synced to Office 365. So when he get the invitation email, he should be able to use his account to sign in to access the
 shared material which was shared in<span> </span>SharePoint. And there is no need for him to create a Microsoft account to access the shared files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's focus on the issue that he cannot use his Office 365 account(work or school account) to sign in to get to the shared file.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>3.In the following sign in page before accessing the shared file, after he type in his email address and password, did he get any error message? Please provide a screenshot of it if there is any for troubleshooting. Or describe the detailed information of
 the issue.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5b885532-de8c-4e17-b6b9-e46ef2e3ff6f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5b885532-de8c-4e17-b6b9-e46ef2e3ff6f" height="362" width="286" /></a></p>

    <title>Cannot remove calendars from &#34;Other Calendars&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danielbrowning  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot remove calendars from &#34;Other Calendars&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>in owa calendars i have a number of calendars listed under "other calendars" that i cannot view or delete. they do not show up in outlook 2013 or outlook 2016, only in owa.</p>
<p>clicking on one of these other calendars results in a "couldn't open calendar" - "a connection couldn't be made with the shared calendar. remove the calendar and try to add it again, or ask the owner to share it again."&nbsp;message.</p>
<p>right clicking and selecting remove from favourites results in simply "couldn't open calendar".</p>
<p>we used to have exchange 2007 on premises with a number of public folders, and these calendars were among the public folders. we migrated to 365 with a &nbsp;cutover migration, but did not migrate the public folders as we didn't want to keep them. it is my believe
 that 365 believes that my account has links to these calendars, but since the calendars do not exist it won't allow me to do anything with the links to them.</p>
<p>please help!</p>

<p>Daniel,</p>
<p>From the information above, I understand you did cutover migration to Office 365 but not chose to migrate the on-premises Public folder’s calendars. However, these are showed up in OWA. Outlook 2013/2016 does not display them. Can you confirm the if it is
 the scenario above? Meanwhile, I would like to collect the following information below to have a further understanding of the situation.<br />
1.&nbsp;Are you the only user who encounters this symptom? Do other users who once had permissions to these Public folder calendars notice the calendar display in their OWA?<br />
2.&nbsp;Meanwhile, can you run the <strong>Get-PublicFolderItemStatistics</strong> command with Exchange Online remote PowerShell and in the result, check if the old public folder is listed?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Ran <br />

<p>Hi Ran, thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>Yes, the scenario you described is correct. I am not positive that these calendar links represent the pre-migration public folders, it is my best guess and I am unable to find where it thinks they are linked to.</p>
<p>On 365 we only have 20 Public Folders, all calendars.</p>
<p>1. I am not the only person who has these. Other members of my team have some of the same calendars, but not all of the calendars I can see.</p>
<p>2. Get-PublicFolderItemStatistics requires that I give it an identity. Anything valid that I enter ("\" or any of the names of the existing Public Folder Calendars) gives me no details in the reply. If I enter any of the names of the 'ghost' calendars I
 have, such as "\Network Calendar", it returns "Couldn't find public folder "\Network Calendar". Please make sure you typed the name correctly. Reason: The operation couldn't be performed because '\Network Calendar' couldn't be found.".</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Daniel</p>

<p>hi daniel,</p>
<p>thanks so much for the information. since the result does not contain any calendars in your owa calendar view, it indicates that they are not existed in office 365. meanwhile, to prove that, can you use the
<a href="http://mfcmapi.codeplex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>mfc mapi</strong> </a>tool on your outlook 2013/2016 pc and logon via:
<strong>session &gt; logon…</strong> &gt; select the mail profile &gt; double-click on your mailbox &gt;<strong> root-mailbox</strong> &gt;<strong> ipm_subtree</strong> &gt; double-click
<strong>calendar</strong>? then check if the old on-premise exchange server calendars (such as
<strong>network calendar</strong>) appear under it.<br />

<p>my view differs to yours slightly... i have root container rather than root - mailbox, and there is no ipm_subtree. i've selected root container &gt; top of information store &gt; calendar (which is the closest)</p>
<p>there are no sub-folders in calendar on the tree view. clicking calendar gives me an item list on the right pane, but nothing in that indicates the ghost calendars in owa. double clicking calendar gives me a new window containing all of the items in my calendar,
 none of which seem to refer to the ghost calendars in owa.</p>
<p>screenshot of my view:</p>

<p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>I got the update from our relevant team that your issue is already fixed.</p>
<p>The backend will deploy the permanent fix to the server once the fix is ready. But it may take some longer time. If cx cannot wait for the fix, please perform the workaround action to the other effected users.</p>
<p>Here are the detailed steps for the work around:<br />
Step 1: Configure MFCMAPI to connect to your profile in online mode <br />
Note Run MFCMAPI from a computer on which Outlook is installed. Before you run MFCMAPI, exit all Outlook clients that may running on different systems.</p>
<p>1. Download MFCMAPI from <a href="https://mfcmapi.codeplex.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mfcmapi.codeplex.com</a> &lt;<a href="https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3a%2f%2fmfcmapi.codeplex.com&amp;data=01%7c01%7cmiaozhan%40064d.mgd.microsoft.com%7cdd69b0823c65412830a008d380965a5c%7c72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7c1&amp;sdata=cVXiUJsuxzDzJBRwqdM8kUnngkvN%2fB7R9Gl7OCxPMfQ%3d&gt;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/</a>.
<br />
2. Double-click Mfcmapi.exe to open MFCMAPI. <br />
3. Click OK to dismiss the dialog box that's displayed, and then on the Tools , menu, click Options .
<br />
4. In the Options dialog box, select the following two check boxes:</p>
<p>• Use the MDB_ONLINE flag when calling OpenMsgStore <br />
• Use the MAPI_NO_CACHE flag when calling OpenEntry <br />
5. Click OK to close the Options dialog box.</p>
<p>Step 2: Remove public folder favorites by using MFCMAPI</p>
<p>1. On the Session menu, click Logon to open a session. <br />
2. If you have multiple MAPI profiles on your system, select the profile in the Choose Profile dialog box. Otherwise, sign in to your mailbox. You may be prompted to enter your credentials.
<br />
3. When the logon is successful, you see entries for the databases to which you can log on. Double-click the database that has your email address (the mailbox database).
<br />
4. After you open the mailbox database, expand the Root Container folder, and then locate the Common Views entry.
<br />
5. Right-click Common Views , and then select Open associated contents table . <br />
6. In the Common Views table, sort by subject, and then find all messages that have the subject set to the target public folder. Right-click the message, and then click Delete message .
<br />
7. In the Delete Item dialog box, under Deletion style , click Permanent deletion (deletes to deleted item retention if supported) .
<br />
8. Close the Common Views table. <br />
9. In the mailbox table folder view, find the Shortcuts folder. <br />
10. Right-click Shortcuts , and then select Open contents table .<br />
11. Click through each entry in Shortcuts until you find an entry in which the target public folder has a property tag that's set to 0x7C00001E . Right-click the entry, and then click Delete message .
<br />
12. Close all MFCMAPI windows, reconnect to Outlook Web App, and then verify that the public folder favorite is removed.</p>
<p><br />
Regards,<br />
Poppy</p>

    <title>Office 2013 Delegate Permission - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joshjeffries  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2013 Delegate Permission</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys, thank in advance for any contributions</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Okay so we needed a mailbox to be set up where three people had access to it. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This has been completed fine, however when we set up delegates so that they can also send from the email address, we have run into a security issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you go to New Mail -&gt; Options -&gt; From and then select any email from the list, anybody can send a email from anybody who is on the Exchange server.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have tried adding delegates and giving them no permission but the problem still persists.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Does anybody know how we can stop anybody from sending emails on others behalf other than if they have been added as a delegate on the Account settings?
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have been searching all morning, but not been able to find anything. Would this be on the exchange server?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If anyone can help, it would be much appreciated!!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Update : Even if they are not set up as a delegate they can send on others behalf, just to get that clear, this is what we want to stop :) Thanks!!<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Josh. </p>

            <p>Then someone might have really messed up the Security Permissions within your Active Directory or within Exchange.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Check the Send As security permissions of the AD object's that are affected to trace back how everyone got the right to Send As.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Send on Behalf Of permissions are Exchange-level permissions but these should also show up for the user within&nbsp;Outlook.</p>

    <title>Ars Technica review got it right - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cmoya  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ars Technica review got it right</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Sadly none of these issues have been addressed two months later. So much for that expedited&nbsp;release cadence we heard so much about.&nbsp;<a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/07/review-windows-10-is-the-best-version-yet-once-the-bugs-get-fixed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Ars
 Technica review of Windows 10 </a>totally got it right. But I would go a step forward and say Windows 10 is very simply
<strong>unpleasant to use. </strong>Sure, it works. Sure, performance is pretty good (kudos to the underlying OS team). But after just a few minutes it makes you want to get up and grab a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Here's just a few brainnumbing bugs that, added up, lead to this feeling (on top of the mish mash UI paradigms, inconsistent menus, etc mentioned in the review):</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Tooltips that hover directly over their target rendering the target unclickable (Task View and Notifications icons when Taskbar is set to autohide). Embarassing.<br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Expanding a folder in Start All -&gt; All Apps doesn't scroll the folder's contents into view. This is UI 101 basics.<br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Uninspired Task View with window sizes that render it useless for pinpointing windows you're interested in without serious squinting and scanning. (Compare it to Mac OS X to see a fantastic implementation of this feature). Task View will go the way of Flip3D.
 Watch.<br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Edge doesn't remember its last window position. Wait what? Again, UI 101 basics.<br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Inexplicably, neither does File Explorer! Although not as egregious as Edge's behavior, File Explorer always opens a few pixels down and to the right. Eventually starting back to the top the screen after opening and closing a few times.<br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Unable to open new instances of Edge by right-clicking its icon in the taskbar. Why not?<br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Edge web site shortcuts in Start Menu don't show favicon (or show it unpredictably).<br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Drag and drop completely missing from almost all new apps. You can't drag attachments onto email. You can't drag email attachments out. You can't drag out Edge web site icons to create shortcuts in a folder. etc.<br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Pinning sites to the taskbar and creating "apps" out of them no longer works. IE9 introduced this feature. Chrome has it too.<br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Replacing the far more capable Windows 8.1 OneDrive with outdated and deprecated SkyDrive that makes using Windows 10 on a 32gb tablet a nightmare despite Windows 10 performing outstandingly with it otherwise.<br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Continuum works on almost no convertible I have seen (about 6 different ones from different manufacters). The decision to offload the work required to implement it to manufacturers is a mistake Microsoft makes time and time again. Why not just detect a keyboard
 and pop up a message and be done with it. Why overthink it and require BIOS changes, yada, yada?<br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>[Edit] One more brainnumbing behavior: Scrollbar that disappears right as you're hovering over it. Sure, I understanding that disappearing scrollbars is the new fad... but you don't do it when the pointer is right over it. Microsoft Word learned this. As
 long as&nbsp;the pointer is over the scroll area, Word&nbsp;won't fade away the scrollbar. The Windows 10 made this rookie mistake. And, it's embarrassing for them.</p>
</li></ol>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>There's more. None of these are dealbreakers. But taken together they amount to an experience that just makes you want to get up and go for a walk. Sadly, many will consider Windows 10 a success because the pre-existing built-in Windows XP/7/8 base will
 upgrade to it sooner or later.&nbsp;But, make no mistake, the QA on Windows 10 is a sign that something is very wrong at Microsoft. I would in no way be surprised&nbsp;if we see OS X gain a bigger market share in the next 1-2 years. It is simply a more engaging and
 fun OS to use... not to mention&nbsp;iOS&nbsp;on the&nbsp;iPad Pro. We&nbsp;shall see.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Yes I have. Here, in the Feedback app and also&nbsp;in TechNet concerning File Explorer and&nbsp;Excel files when Hey Cortana is enabled... I forgot to even mention that one. That would be:</p>

</p><p>#13 Cortana hogs up the ancient DDE channel and causes opening Excel (and Access) files opened&nbsp;directly from File Explorer&nbsp;to take 20-30&nbsp;seconds to open (100%&nbsp;of the time when Hey Cortana is enabled and&nbsp;unpredictably&nbsp;even when its not).</p>

    <title>Save multiple custom margin settings in Word 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> icarol  say:</h3>
<h2>            Save multiple custom margin settings in Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have several frequently used margin settings for Word documents - Windows 10 Word 2016. I have saved the most common one as the default. However, I cannot find a way to add custom margin options - instead I have to set them for each document. Is there
 not a way to save several custom settings to choose from instead of the word preset options?</p>
<p>Tx,</p>

<p>Create a separate template for each set of margins you want to save, and base each new document on the template that has the desired margins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because margins are a property of a section, and an otherwise blank template usually has only one section, you can't save multiple margin settings in one template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To simplify choosing the correct template to create a new document, name the templates to identify their margin settings. You can use the NewDocUserform add-in from my web page at&nbsp;<a href="https://jay-freedman.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://jay-freedman.info/</a>&nbsp;to
 select the template from a dropdown list quickly.</p>

            Hi Carol, <br />
<br />
<strong>Following up on the excellent advice from Jay... </strong><br />
I agree that custom templates are the best option or you. You could also use the classic File New dialog to use your template and even the built-in File New dialog.
<br />
<a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/fileNew.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">File New Variations in the Versions of Word</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>An alternative would be to create macros for your settings. That would still not put them in margin dialog, though.</strong>

<p>Thanks all for the advice.</p>
<p>I was able to make .dtox templates and store them in an easily accessible place.</p>
<p>When I open a new document and follow instructions to use file/options/add-ins/templates/attach/apply to all/OK</p>
<p>However, the margins of the new doc never actually change.</p>
<p>Don't want to take up more of anyone's time, will just deal with wordisms.</p>

<p>Attaching a template to an existing document won't change the margins. This is by design. For more, see

<p>
</p><p>Instead, what you can do is create a new document based on your template and then bring in existing content via Insert | Object | Text from File.</p>

<p>OK got it open the .dotx file, then start typing instead of open a new word file, then ask to adopt the template.</p>

<p>You still don't appear to have got it. You don't open templates to use them, you create new documents from them. File &gt; New.</p>
<p>Recent versions of Word don't exactly make it easy to locate those template you have created, so you might find

<p>Hi Carol, <br />
<br />
<strong>What you need to do is create a new document based on the template, not attach it.
</strong>Attaching a template gives you some resources from a template but does not give you that template's document structure. It gets that from the creation template.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>If you double-click on one of your templates, you will have a new document with the margins that you set.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Jay, Graham and I were trying to steer you to easy ways to create a new document based on your custom templates from

<li>Expect Word to act rationally, or at least like another word processing program.</li><li>Expect words used describing features in Word to mean what they do in everyday usage.</li></ol>

    <title>Xbox Music Pass content download to phone for offline play&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve243kd63  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Music Pass content download to phone for offline play&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This post got long, sorry...I just wanted to capture everything on my "journey" to move a playlist to my new phone to help show that I am not here to complain, but rather seek constructive feedback from the community on how I might better use my new phone
 (I am sure I am the issue, not the device or its software).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am still learning a bit about Windows Phone 8 on my new Nokia Lumina 920.&nbsp; I replaced my Samsung Focus S over the weekend, and so far and very impressed with most things (lack of encryption support for Excel\OneNote is still a thorn).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For music, I didn't think losing Zune would be a big deal as I was never too attached it and just needed basic playlist creation and management.&nbsp; I now see the fallacy of assuming that simple capabilities would be preserved with Windows Phone 8, but enough
 people have posted their thoughts on the backward-momentum MSFT seems to have settled on with regards to the phone synch experience with the desktop with regards to media management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I am a good little fan boy and I set up a paid subscription to Xbox Music Pass...when in doubt, give away more money and blindly expect better service or products.&nbsp; In general, money well spent -- I really like the concept of unlimited music on a "its
 yours so long as you pay a flat monthly fee" basis.&nbsp; I was even initially interested to see that Xbox Music on the Windows 8 Pro laptop picked up much of the files in my existing music collection and tagged them 'in the cloud' so they appeared on my phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now here's my issue: it turns out, despite having my phone say I had these thousands of songs on it auto-magically, I really had 0.&nbsp; The little streaming icon (looks like a monopole) soon alerted me to the fact that I had just pointers to cloud files to
 stream these songs.&nbsp; I installed the Windows Phone app (both Modern and Desktop) and tried each.&nbsp; It detected my Zune playlists, and showed all my music, but my playlists were all duplicated.&nbsp; So I turned off the phone's cloud synch, and then was back to just
 the playlists from the connector.&nbsp; When I added files in the Xbox music app on my PC, I quickly realized that that app was not using the Zune playlist files that the Connector app was reading...and I have yet to find where in the filesystem the Xbox music
 app playlists are stored to be able to write a quick script to convert its playlists to a file that the Windows Phone Desktop app will support so that I can build playlists in Xbox music and (seeing as synch from that app to phone isn't&nbsp;a possibility), then
 go to the synch desktop app and re-synch each time.&nbsp; So I am left with installing the Zune desktop app, to manage my new Windows Phone 8 as a means along-side the Desktop Connector to avoid constant manual playlist creation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried Windows Media Player, and also Windows Explorer, but came up to the same problem: once content was transferred, there was no way I stumbled on to actually manipulate and maintain a playlist on the phone with content that is not cloud-attached for
 streaming.&nbsp; A good old fashioned playlist of physical MP3 files seems to be a lost&nbsp;skill in the eyes of WP8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So out of desperation, I decided to just rebuild one playlist (the one I Run to every morning) using just my&nbsp;Xbox music pass rather than the ripped collection of MP3s I was listening to before (some are from Amazon MP3 store, many are ripped from CDs and
 some yet were acquired DRM free from other on-line stores).&nbsp; I built the playlist from the Xbox Store using just the songs available there (most of mine were available), but then hit the problem spawning this post:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Xbox Music Pass site says this: "Or download your favorite songs so you can listen offline".&nbsp; This appears to be the extent of the instruction manual.&nbsp; I've read the FAQ and everything else I could find at every MSFT owned domain, and it all appears
 to be the same three or four marketing sentences regurgitated without any substance to how someone can actually DO the things claimed to be possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my case: I can find no way to actually download Xbox music playlists to my phone, so they are available where I run (its a trail a ways outside town, where I do not have reliable enough data coverage to stream music for the 90 minute run...nor do I want
 to have to hit my data cap every month).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my PC, the Xbox music store app automatically downloaded the MP3s in the background as local files just by my selecting "add to playlist" for any song I found.&nbsp; There doesn't appear to be a similar option on the phone?&nbsp; How do I tell my phone to not just
 synch the playlist with pointers to the cloud, but rather to actually synch the physical media from the cloud while I'm home on WiFi so that my phone is not useless in offline scenarios (or even while sitting at work all day, where streaming media is blocked
 at the corporate proxy thanks to a draconian IT dept.)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried using the desktop synch app to move the mp3 files downloaded by the Xbox music app to the phone, but (somewhat funny, in a sad way) the phone then showed in the Music app that the same song existed twice (one with the streaming icon, the other without)
 and the playlist still only referred to the one without.&nbsp; The Xbox music playlists do not appear in the Desktop Synch app, so I am having to manually re-create the playlists on the phone by adding songs to now playing, then re-saving that as a playlist.&nbsp; This
 is not a long term solution, as even for a &lt;100 song collection just for running, it is nuts.&nbsp; To do this across my full collection is not even a hypothetical worth considering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have enough faith in Microsoft to assume that I am overlooking something about this new "8-everything" ecosystem, and that the problem lies in the user misunderstanding the use-cases and not the solution's inability to serve so simple of one as "create
 playlist on PC, send with associated files to phone".&nbsp; So can anyone help me see the light?&nbsp; Is there an instruction&nbsp; manual or user guide that is beyond the 3rd-grade reading level marketing stuff that is splashed on Microsoft's webpages (even MSDN when perusing
 my options to develop my own connector using my developer credentials for the store fell short of anything promising...given that I don't want to make a career out of this).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hear Windows Media Player (feels like XP all over again) is an option, but I am still hitting the wall of having to re-create my playlists in there after finding\grabbing music in the Xbox Music App and downloading on the PC.&nbsp; If there is no easy solution,
 I am open to feedback on how I can pragmatically gain access to the playlist data from the Modern Xbox Music App somewhere in the filesystem (or through a cloud API) so that I can use that to find the physical file paths and then update the zpl files&nbsp;so the
 connector desktop app would be a one click operation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry this was so long, and thanks ahead of time for any help.</p>

<p>I went to that suggestion and gave it three votes (removed from some other items since closed in WP8).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully someone in Microsoft is reviewing this and considering where they want to position their product; the rest of the platform meets my needs in ways that Android\iPhone\BB didn't before, so I have the tenacity to keep finding a way to make this music
 experience work for me...most consumer's probably won't.</p>

            I'm in the same boat. I just cannot figure out how to get my playlist from "Xbox Music" to my "Windows Phone 8" (Lumia 920). Just silly that we even have to think about this. Playlist, Music, and Photo syncing should be easy. With Zune it just worked.
 Now I have to try and explain to my wife how to get music onto her phone and we both think it's way to complicated. What were they thinking.... /facepalm.

You can pretty much just build and save a playlist, no editing.</p>
<p>Add a bunch of items to your Now Playing screen, then go to Now Playing, tap the ... in the bottom right corner and choose "save as playlist".</p>

            <p>I was able to sync my playlists to my NL920.&nbsp; I used the desktop Phone App beta to do so.&nbsp; The metro phone app in its current state&nbsp;is total garbage.&nbsp; Once I fired it up, it found my Zune playlists. I was then able to select that and hit the sync button.&nbsp;
 2 playlists and so far&nbsp;no problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't tried to modify the playlist, connect the phone and resync to see if the changes move over though.&nbsp; This was on a Windows 8 desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm also a Zune pass (Xbox Music pass now) subscriber and all my downloaded songs with DRM sync'd and play just fine as well.&nbsp; I had to remove one of my allowable devices though and wait a day before the phone would start playing DRM music.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also disabled XBox music cloud collection as it was making things to cluttered. I just want to see what's on the phone and that's it. If I want to stream from the marketplace, I'll just search for it and stream from there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps someone.</p>

            <p>Thanks for this idea.&nbsp; I did what you tried, and disabled the cloud music synch on my phone to disable it from mirroring any of my Xbox Music collection and playlists.&nbsp; I then ran&nbsp;a synch from the Windows Phone Desktop app, which opened and found all of
 my .zpl playlists from Zune.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem is, the end result on my phone is that all of the songs are there after the synch (a good first step), but the playlists it moved over all show "0 songs".&nbsp; These playlists all were made up of mp3s from non-Zune\Xbox music sources (all DRM free).&nbsp;
 The one playlist I added a Zune pass song to synched just that one song, never attaching itself to the hundreds of other mp3 on the phone that show as being in that playlist in Zune.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looks like I will be manually setting up playlists one song at a time added to now playing, saving that, and starting from scratch if I ever need to change them.&nbsp; I'll consider giving up on playlists and using an IDE tagger on my desktop before the Windows
 Phone Desktop Synch to creatively change Genres of each song based on playlist preferences, then use the genre browser on the phone to get at pseudo-playlists.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>I was able to sync my playlists to my NL920.&nbsp; I used the desktop Phone App beta to do so.&nbsp; The metro phone app in its current state&nbsp;is total garbage.&nbsp; Once I fired it up, it found my Zune playlists. I was then able to select that and hit the sync button.&nbsp;
 2 playlists and so far&nbsp;no problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't tried to modify the playlist, connect the phone and resync to see if the changes move over though.&nbsp; This was on a Windows 8 desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm also a Zune pass (Xbox Music pass now) subscriber and all my downloaded songs with DRM sync'd and play just fine as well.&nbsp; I had to remove one of my allowable devices though and wait a day before the phone would start playing DRM music.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also disabled XBox music cloud collection as it was making things to cluttered. I just want to see what's on the phone and that's it. If I want to stream from the marketplace, I'll just search for it and stream from there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps someone.</p>

Hi:<br />
Can you clarify whether you are using the desktop app beta running on a windows 8 PC, or with a windows 7 PC.&nbsp; I am asking because, i did exactly the same as you describe but with windows 7 pc as microsoft has released a desktop version of the windows phone
 app as well.&nbsp; It all works, with the albums and playlists syncing to my Lumia 920.&nbsp; However...When i try to play the albums which were synced over, I get an error which says "we are unablke to confirm the media usage rights for this content"&nbsp; there is no error
 code with this message.&nbsp; So if you can clarify what desktop OS you are using with success that would help as I suspect that this is the issue...you need a windows 8 desktop to be able to transfer zune drm music to the phone and have it play
        </p>

            <p>RussLeong -&nbsp;I'm also interested in how you are getting playlists transferred over to your NL920 keeping the association with the local files that move over from your PC.&nbsp; I tried the same on Win 8 Pro using the Phone Desktop synch client, and had 0-song
 playlists after the transfer, even though the songs in the playlists were transferred to the phone.&nbsp; Are your playlists (ZPL files) that are being picked up by the synch tool entirely composed of Zune\Xbox pass files, or are there mp3\etc of multiple original
 sources?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jake Gamlieli - I received this error too for music files I had from the Zune Pass downloaded using the Zune&nbsp;Desktop application.&nbsp; Even after playing each file in Zune on my Win 8 PC, proving that the media rights were associated with my latest Live profile
 that is shared across my desktop and phone, I still got the error on the transferred files on my NL920.&nbsp; I further noticed that I cannot play files now downloaded from the Xbox Music hub in Win 8 inside of the Zune client, similar error (and neither Zune nor
 Xbox music files in Win Media Player).&nbsp; Seems like a very close-minded DRM solution.&nbsp; I've simply blown away all of my previously Zune downloaded tracked, and restored them to my library from inside the Xbox Music hub.&nbsp; That said, I hope there is another solution
 given that this won't help Win XP\7 users&nbsp;(the 99%) who don't have the Modern Xbox app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>General note, for those sharing my predicament of media management on Win Phone 8:</p>
<p>I've taken to re-building my playlists using all Xbox Music files, synching those over the cloud, then manually selecting each song individually on my phone to Download so it is then a local copy.&nbsp; This is a mindless task of a few thousand clicks,&nbsp;but I
 made it through them all while running on a treadmill and then let it sit on WiFi to transfer everything down in hardcopy.&nbsp; Not I can run on a remote trail or sit in the subway&nbsp;with no signal and still enjoy all my music.&nbsp; Tedious, but OK as a done-once maneuver...if
 I have to repeat, this will become an untenable option.&nbsp; For 95% of my music, this works since Xbox Store has the music available for stream\download&nbsp;on a pass.&nbsp; The 5% of my stuff that's foreign&nbsp;or off-label stuff will be a manual move to add to 'now-playing'&nbsp;produced
 playlists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another interesting tidbit--as I just noticed this on my commute this morning and maybe some others haven't stumbled on it yet given the lack of any SW user's guide out there--there is a green "All" text on the phone above any Song list in the Music hub
 (or Xbox app, not sure the correct term yet).&nbsp; Tapping that green text allows you to select between displaying all music, the default, but also just your music on the phone that is physically present as a file and the items that are 'from the cloud' and just
 a link to the streaming version.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Before the disappearance of these files, what did the system do? Is the currently logged-in account the original account used?<br />

If there is an upgrade installed, was there a prompt to retain personal files and configuration before moving forward with the upgrade? If so, did you check the option?</p>

<h2>            Office 2007 Japanese&#47;Chinese&#47;Lao &#40;Laotian&#41; office language packs</h2>
                    <p>When I installed the Japanese, Chinese, and Lao (Laotian) language packs for Office 2007, the black checkmark and the ABC besides it that would normally show up in Office 2007 to indicate that the language has been installed
 is not showing up in Microsoft Word 2007. I bought the Office 2007 Multi-Lingual Pack off of Ebay and it was a legitimate copy, not pirated or anything like that. There is also a problem in Office 2007 where if I have the Serbian (Latin) and Serbian (Cyrillic)
 keyboards in Windows 10, the ABC with the black checkmark indicates Serbian (Cyrillic Serbia and Montenegro) and Serbian (Latin Serbia and Montenegro) besides it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also the issue with Spanish (Cuba) in Office 2007 where the black checkmark with the ABC is not besides it and the same thing with Spanish (Latin America) in the same program on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Microsoft Office 2007 on a computer that has Windows 10 and Windows XP and I cannot get the Japanese, Chinese, and Laotian language packs to work, but I can get the Korean and Thai ones to work and show up with the black checkmark and
 the letters ABC besides it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was is the solution for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having problems with installing these language packs in Office 2007 and I would like to receive help from the community and I am not sure where this post goes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having trouble finding the Belorussian language pack for Office 2007 and the ones for Latin and Hawaiian.&nbsp; I am looking to be able to type in Belorussian, but I cannot find the language pack anywhere for download.</p>

    <title>Forcing Outlook email to synchronise - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> miriamvee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Forcing Outlook email to synchronise</h2>
                    <p>It would be great if you could force Outlook to synchronise using IMAP, like the Windows 10 mail app does. Or even better, to synchronise all the emails in an account, not just the past couple of months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it stands, on my system it's broken and doesn't work. I see that lots of other people have spent days trying to get it to work, even doing a clean install of Windows without success. I'll wait for the update that works, rather than mess any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has a suggestion for a decent email app that isn't broken and that will archive emails locally, I'd love to hear about it.</p>

<p>Yes</p>

<p>Yes</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>3) Are you trying to sync only emails through IMAP or calendar and contacts too?</em></p>
<p>Calendar and contacts have synchronised. It's the email accounts that are having trouble synching.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>Make sure your sync slider is set to "All".</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Done that. I also tried shorter periods.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The various webmails are fine for the different email accounts. The Windows 10 Mail App is great, but only keeps the most recent weeks of mail, which is fine for sending and receiving.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I need is something to back up emails locally so that I can search the entire mailboxes more quickly than webmail can manage. Also, the mailboxes will use up the quota in time so I will need to archive old messages locally (or elsewhere on the cloud).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook chokes. I left it running over night and it still didn't synchronise the email account (I only tried it with one account other than Live), so I'm currently trying other applications. At the moment I'm seeing if Postbox will do the job. So far it
 seems to be working well and is much faster than Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish there was still Outlook Express. It was lean and fast.</p>

<p>&gt; Calendar and contacts have synchronised. It's the email accounts that are having</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you are using IMAP, then it's not possible; for contacts and calendar to sync. IMAP is a mail-only protocol and knows nothing about contacts and calendars.<br />

            <p>Thanks, Brian. I may have misunderstood the original question. My calendars and contacts are in Windows Live, so I presume they are automatically synchronised in Outlook by Microsoft Exchange or whatever it's using now. They have nothing to do with the IMAP
 email accounts I was trying to add.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now been testing Postbox for a couple of days. I have no affiliation with Postbox, but I'm very pleased to report that it's working very well so far. It's downloaded and indexed 30,000 plus emails. I've been able to link to my WindowsLive email account
 too. So that means I now have a single app that shows all emails, with quite good (and fast) filtering and querying. It is more capable than Windows 10 Mail app in many respects, and works for me - unlike Outlook 2016. The only thing that I'm losing is the
 link to the Calendar and People apps - or that's the only loss I've discovered so far. That's a small price to pay for having all the emails in one place (plus the extra functionality that Postbox offers). You can import contacts from Outlook btw. Postbox
 also works with listserver emails, which Windows Mail app doesn't do properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(It's working so well that I'll probably use it instead of the Windows Mail app for day to day use. I might even go to the trouble of uploading older emails going back 12 years or so.)</p>

            I have several IMAP mail accounts in MS Outlook, they have all synced and show mail +5 years old<br />
What I do often experience is that new mail is not shown/refreshed until I select the inbox

    <title>How to retrieve Cookies programmatically from Internet Explorer 11 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peter_kl_liu  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to retrieve Cookies programmatically from Internet Explorer 11 running on Windows 10 Fall Creators Update &#40;Build 1709&#41; or above</h2>
                    <p>We used to call the Windows API InternetGetCookie() /&nbsp;InternetGetCookieEx() (using C#)&nbsp;to retrieve the Cookies of a specified URL (e.g., http://www.something.com ) from&nbsp;Internet Explorer (IE) 11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked fine before Windows 10&nbsp;Fall Creators Update (Build 1709).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, something changed in&nbsp;Windows 10&nbsp;Fall Creators Update, the above APIs no longer work.</p>
<p>For InternetGetCookieEx, we had already tried all 8 combinations of flags (&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">INTERNET_COOKIE_THIRD_</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The API works only if we add the URL to IE trusted sites or start IE by Administrator.<br />
</p>
<p>So, my question is how to retrieve IE Cookies programmatically in Windows 10&nbsp;Fall Creators Update ?</p>
<p>We don't want to ask our users to add the URL to&nbsp;IE trusted sites or start IE by Administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For reference, IE11 normal Cookies are gone since Creators Fall Update.</p>

<p>The cookies files ( *.txt, *.cookie) are no longer there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since&nbsp;<span>Windows 10&nbsp;Fall Creators Update (Build 1709), the cookies are no longer stored&nbsp;</span><span>in files.</span></p>
<p><span>The problem is even the Windows API cannot retrieve the cookies.</span></p>
<p><span>It seems like the security requirement for retrieving cookies programmatically is more strict than earlier versions.</span></p>

</p><p>I would like to know where I can purchase music now that purchasing and downloading music is no longer available in the MS Store?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like purchase and store my music on my device's internal storage like I used to in case I am in an area with no coverage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to sign up to a monthly subscription to Spotify or just stream music and put up with their annoying ads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to purchase and download music as you would in iTunes. Does that mean I have to go to iTunes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What other sites/apps are there that allow me to purchase, download and store music?</p>

    <title>Equation 3.0 in Word 2016 doesn&#39;t work properly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Equation 3.0 in Word 2016 doesn&#39;t work properly</h2>
                    <p>So after the update to version 1607 on Windows 10 I've an issue with the Equation 3.0 in Word 2016. I place my marker after the word "Marker" (see picture)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/141224a9-831b-43f6-bc0e-e88a38280d79" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/141224a9-831b-43f6-bc0e-e88a38280d79" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I go to insert -&gt; object -&gt; Equation 3.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the result:<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/95aa2ff3-1633-465b-8b9e-f63ab849e8fd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/95aa2ff3-1633-465b-8b9e-f63ab849e8fd" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>The problem here is that first of all, the typing area is not at the same place as the marker were. Well that's not a huge issue. But the problem is that when I click for example the dropdown for fraction symbols (that is the option on the second row and
 the second one from the left) I cannot open it. I see that the icon for Equation 3.0 in the bottom at the taskbar is refreshing each try as if I was opening it again and again and again.<br />
<br />
Anyone got a solution on this one?</p>

<h2>            I am having trouble activating Office for Mac which I have installed on my macbook</h2>
                    When trying to activate it, it is giving me an error message "Key Already Used - The key associated with this account and product has been activated on another machine, or reactivated on this machine too many times, please choose another if available."
 I have a multiple licence and cannot understand why this is coming up as an error.

<p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Snap Assist works when you have multiple window open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Snap one of the windows to a side of the screen and Thumbnails of the other open windows will appear in the free space. Click any of these thumbnails and that window will snap to the other side of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
