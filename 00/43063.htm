            Originally, it was prior 2010.&nbsp; I got upgraded to 2010 via a special offer from MS for gov. employees.&nbsp; After the recent upgrade of my drivers, etc. I noticed today that those MS applications (Excel, Word, etc.) only appear , on the open list, but when
 I click on the application, a window pops up stating "This action is only valid for products that are currently installed".

<h2>            Buzzing sound in skype.</h2>
                    Buzzing sound in Skype, when I play any sort of games. It starts exacly when I start a game. If I alt-tab the game back into the desktop the buzzing sound dissapears but, once back in the game window it starts again.<br />
<br />
I have an onboard audio card. I did read some comments, that my GPU may be causing the buzzing and I should move it furter away from the audio card, but that isin't an option, since I have only one slot for the type of GPU I'm using.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>I would suggest that you uninstall the Sound card driver that is present on the computer and later install the latest driver for Sound card from manufacturer website and check if it works fine.</font></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Now check if you still face issues with the yahoo messenger and Skype software.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">If the other windows programs sound works fine and there is only issue with the yahoo messenger and Skype software would suggest uninstalling and reinstalling it and check.</font></p>

            Thanks for trying, but neither of the steps helped. Though now, not only does the sound appear to others when I speak in skype, I can also hear it through my headphones, when I set the headphone volume up. Though, when I remove the headphones and connect
 the speakers, the sound is not present.<br />

                    <p>Original title: I can't get my wlmp file to open in windows live media player</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was making a video earlier today for a client and saved it as an unfinished wlmp file onto a memory stick.
</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried to open it on my home computer and it is saying that the file isn't compatible with the version of windows live movie maker I have.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>"Sorry, Windows Movie Maker can't open this product file. the file might not be compatible with Windows Live Movie Maker or be corrupted. Please select a different project file.&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>Sorry, this project can't be opened because it was created in a version of Windows Live Movie Maker that isn't compatible with this current version</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><u><b>How can I open this project in Windows Live Movie Maker?"</b></u></div>

</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I then tried loading two old versions of windows movie maker, and it wouldn't load on those either.... I am at my wits end - I spent hours on this video and don't want to have to start over entirely.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can't find a codec, I can't find an old version of windows live movie maker, and I can't find any way to salvage the project. Even if I had a way to turn the project to a video file I would be happy with, but nothing is working.</div>

            <p>A project file isn't a movie at all.&nbsp; It is the project file with just the instructions to build a movie from the original source files.&nbsp; If all you have saved is the .wlmp file, it doesn't matter if you can open it or not, unless you have the same source
 files with you as well.&nbsp; So I hope you have those too.&nbsp; Otherwise, it's like trying to follow a recipe without ingredients.&nbsp; :)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, as a first step, you need to know what specific version your client was using.&nbsp; That project file cannot be opened in an earlier version, so I suggest making sure you have the latest version possible on your computer.&nbsp; The latest version is
<del>16.4.3505.0912 and is part of <a href="http://download.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Essentials 2012</a>.</del></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Update: </strong>The latest version is 16.4.3532.0331 and isn't available on the Microsoft website anymore. Read more about your options in the following link:</em></p>
<p><em><a href="https://goo.gl/kTA0x8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Movie Maker went away on January 10, 2017</a></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If on the other hand you are trying to open this in Windows Media Player, it obviously won't play at all because it isn't a movie, as a mentioned before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are still having issues, please post back with:</p>
<ol>
<li>What exact verison of Movie Maker is on your client computer?&nbsp; (Check About Movie Maker)</li><li>Did you copy all the source files too?</li><li>What version of Movie Maker are you running?</li><li>If you open up the .wlmp file in Notepad, what version does it show on the Project line (65538?&nbsp; 65540?)</li></ol>

            <p>A project file isn't a movie at all; it's just the instructions for making a movie.&nbsp; Even if you could open the&nbsp;.wlmp file, unless you have the same source files and the same version of Movie Maker, this will not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What your friend should have done is given you the actual movie.&nbsp; To create a movie from a project, your friend would need to use&nbsp;<strong>File</strong> &gt;&nbsp;<strong>Save movie</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;That will create a .wmv or .mp4 file that can be viewed in Windows Media
 Player.&nbsp; It does not require&nbsp;you to have Movie Maker at all.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incidentally, 14.0 is pretty old since the latest is 16.4; if your hardware meets the specs and you have the correct graphics drivers loaded, you may want to update to the latest version of
<a href="http://download.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Essentials 2012</a> (which includes Movie Maker).</p>

            Ya. I said I failed to open a project, I didn't mean movie. The source files are all in the pendrive, and while my friend created that project she used source files from the same pendrive.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>She just got the problem of couldn't save as movie... What she got from saving as movie was only audio with black screen.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After upgrading, I succeeded in opening the project. And, the timeline is perfect. But why is it the preview part showing black screen? Only audio can be heard.... How can I solve this?</div>

            <p>Hi xiaoxia9339,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for providing us additional details. I understand that the preview in Movie Maker is showing a black screen. This could be caused by an outdated video drivers or corrupted codecs. To resolve this, we request you to follow the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><strong>Check that the files you are using are of a supported format</strong><b>–</b> Some file formats are not supported by Windows Live Movie Maker. A list of supported formats can be found

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Ensure that you have the proper codecs to play your videos and audio files</strong> - Audio andVideo require codecs to play the file and it’s important to have the right codecs installed
 or updated in your PC.</font></span></p>
<ul>
<li><font><span>Try running the Microsoft FixIt tool for codecs: </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/</a></span></font></li><li><font><b><span>Media info</span></b><span>

</li></ul>
<p><font><b><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></b><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">: If can't find the codec you need you may convert the video to a supported format (eg.wmv) and then add it to your Windows Movie Maker project.</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><strong>3.</strong>
<b>Ensure that your video card drivers are up to date- </b>Movie Maker makes extensive use of the video card GPU (graphics processing unit). The display driver affects the reliability, performance, and compatibility of the video cardwith various software.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To determine the version and video card driver date, run the DirectX Diagnostic Tool (dxdiag):</span></font></p>

<h2>            Inspiron 15z 5523 not shutting down in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am currently facing a problem which is not very pleasing...<br />
&nbsp;[:(]</p>
<p>One day, when I hold the SHIFT key on keyboard while clicking "Shut down" to shut down laptop, sometimes laptop restarts instead of shutting down, and sometimes the screen turns off but the Power button is still turned on and fan is still running, so holding
 the power button will turn off the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read about this through internet and I found out that I should uncheck the option "Turn off fast startup option in "Choose what the power buttons do"</p>
<p><a href="http://en.community.dell.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-discussions-components-files/3518/3681.1.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fen.community.dell.com%2fresized-image.ashx%2f__size%2f550x0%2f__key%2fcommunityserver-discussions-components-files%2f3518%2f3681.1.JPG" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now I set my computer to show the logon screen when I leave it idle for 5 minutes and next time it shows the logon screen I enter my account password.</p>
<p>Now I leave "Internet Download Manager" to download and when it finishes downloading I set it to "Turn off computer when done" but it doesn't turn off the laptop when the screen is turned off and Windows is locked and requires the account password. However
 when I check the option "Force processes to terminate" it does turn off the computer even when it is locked with a password.</p>
<p>However it did a strange behaviour, one time instead of it turning off the computer, it restarted it.</p>
<p>I left the laptop and went to bathroom leaving "Force processes to terminate" checked" and I was sure it will turn it off as it did for the first two times, however when I logged on with my password I find out Windows was restarted...</p>
<p><a href="http://en.community.dell.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-discussions-components-files/3518/8132.2.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fen.community.dell.com%2fresized-image.ashx%2f__size%2f550x0%2f__key%2fcommunityserver-discussions-components-files%2f3518%2f8132.2.JPG" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>This issue is really annoying as I am sure I already unchecked "Turn on fast startup" so there is no reason Windows 8.1 will restart itself instead of shutting down.. This leaves me a bad feeling that it could be the motherboard behaving strangely??</p>
<p>Where the issue could come from?</p>
<p>- Can "Force processes to terminate" when checked in <strong>IDM</strong> cause this? Restarting instead of Shutting down computer sometimes?</p>
<p>- Or is this a bug in Windows 8.1?</p>

            Noooo. 


Now I left IDM to shut down laptop after finishing downloading. 


And I returned to see that Screen is turned off, power button is turned on and fan is spinning so fast... 


Now why the **** this issue happens? I have turned off "Turn on fast startup" which I have read that it is the cause when I keep it checked. 



Can IDM be the cause?

            <p>And no, the power troubleshooter is not helpful..</p>
<p>It reported that I have to make computer sleep after 30 minutes which of course will not fix the shut down issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am saying is that I am not always facing shut down issue. It was this time IDM finished downloading and I came to see that screen is turned off, Power Button is turned on and fan is spinning so fast which I am sure if I had left the laptop and slept
 that time, it would have burnt!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question, WHY DID THIS HAPPEN......?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure I "UNCHECKED" the option "Turn on fast startup" SO WHY DID THIS HAPPEN again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And just in case, I am using IDM "Internet Download Manager" Version 6.07 it was released in 2011, Windows 8 was not released that time am I right? It was released in 2012?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So may the IDM behaves strangely with Power settings? because the version I am using was released still before Windows 8 was released?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>thanks for your help :)</p>
<p>But I have the latest Chipset driver installed, however the problem persists.</p>
<p>I found out it is not an IDM issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to shut down windows 8.1 in the normal operation by clicking on "Shut down" button in Power Menu in Windows. When laptop shuts down, I press the power button again to turn it on and then when Windows starts, I shut it down again normally from the
 Power Menu, however, sometime Windows restarts instead of shutting down..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look at my screenshots below, I will describe in details what I have figured out but I hope what I have done didn't screw up my laptop.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.community.dell.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-discussions-components-files/3518/5751.1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fen.community.dell.com%2fresized-image.ashx%2f__size%2f550x0%2f__key%2fcommunityserver-discussions-components-files%2f3518%2f5751.1.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>In this screenshot, I have turned off and turned on my laptop 35 times...</p>
<p>You'll notice a correct mark beside the number, that means the laptop shut down successfully.
</p>
<p>For example, the first time, laptop shut down, (2) laptop shut down, (3) the third time, laptop shut down, etc... whereas the number marked by "x" that means laptop hanged on shut down...</p>
<p>Notice the title at the top I type on the board when "Screen is off" I mean by screen is off that I let Windows turn off the display after 1 minute,</p>
<p>Now I let Internet Download Manager turns off laptop after it finishes downloading, so it will turn off it while the screen (display) is turned off, so when the display is turned off, the 11th time, laptop hung on shut down, only power button and fan was
 running.... I have to hold the power button to shut it down..</p>
<p>Now, see when "Screen is not turned off" and when IDM finishes downloading and shuts down laptop, I tested this 22 times as in the picture and laptop shut down successfully.
</p>
<p><a href="http://en.community.dell.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-discussions-components-files/3518/6116.2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fen.community.dell.com%2fresized-image.ashx%2f__size%2f550x0%2f__key%2fcommunityserver-discussions-components-files%2f3518%2f6116.2.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><br />
Now look at picture number 2,</p>
<p>I tested again when the "Display is turned off" and letting Internet download Manager turns off laptop when it finishes.</p>
<p>In the first time, laptop restarted instead of shutting down, the 7th time it restarted instead of shutting down, and in the 14th time laptop hung on shut down..</p>
<p><a href="http://en.community.dell.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-discussions-components-files/3518/0028.3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fen.community.dell.com%2fresized-image.ashx%2f__size%2f550x0%2f__key%2fcommunityserver-discussions-components-files%2f3518%2f0028.3.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I read through internet that I can disable "Wake on Magic Packet" in Device Manager &gt; Wireless and Lan...</p>
<p>However, in the 17th time, laptop as well hang on shut down.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.community.dell.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-discussions-components-files/3518/6355.4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fen.community.dell.com%2fresized-image.ashx%2f__size%2f550x0%2f__key%2fcommunityserver-discussions-components-files%2f3518%2f6355.4.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Now, I set "Turn off the Display" to "Never" now the screen is not turned off, and when Internet Download Manager turns off the laptop, see, I tested this 30 times, laptop shut down successfully except for this in the 12th time it restarted instead of shutting
 down.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.community.dell.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-discussions-components-files/3518/4666.5.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fen.community.dell.com%2fresized-image.ashx%2f__size%2f550x0%2f__key%2fcommunityserver-discussions-components-files%2f3518%2f4666.5.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><br />
I turned off laptop and turned it on 50 times this time but this time I didn't use IDM to turn it off nor I turn off the display, it is just normal shut down using the "Shut down" command in Windows 8.1</p>
<p>See in the picture, in the 12th, 32nd and 37th times, laptop restarted instead of shutting down...
</p>
<p>Even the normal "Shut down" operation often causes windows to restart instead of shutting down and when Windows shuts down while display is turned off, it often hangs on shut down which can leads my CPU fan to wear out eventually if I am not using the laptop
 and sleeping that time...</p>
<p>However, I am still unsure if laptop only hangs on shut down when display is off or no as I can't test this anymore because I have turned off laptop and on about 200 times in a day just to test this...</p>
<p>However I am not going to "turn off display" if I am letting IDM to shut down windows when it finishes downloading, however it may restart Windows instead of shutting it down sometimes which is still a problem for me, if I am leaving laptop to download for
 about 10 hours and went to sleep say for 10 hours, the IDM restarted laptop so it will be 20 hours for laptop being on.... Do you think this is good for a system like mine???</p>
<p>Inspiron 15z 5523 i7-3537U????!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And if you're going to say "DISABLE" "Turn on Fast startup" option.</p>
<p>I have already done that, however laptop still restarts sometimes instead of shutting down and
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Look at this video, this is how laptop hangs after Windows Shuts down.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM5nF8jY_3I&amp;feature=youtu.be</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could be causing this?<br />
I think this hang problem occurs when laptop shuts down while Display is turned off.<br />
Because everyone says DISABLE "Turn on fast startup" option because it often causes this issue and that's because Windows 8 shuts down while display (screen) is turned off...<br />
<br />
If the option "Turn on fast startup" is enabled and then when you try to Shut down your laptop, your display (screen) will immediately turn off but the Power Button is still on, and sometimes your system will hang like this....<br />
<br />
And when the option "Turn on fast startup" is disabled. When I let Windows to turn off the display after sometime, I use IDM to turn off computer when done in Scheduler tab, note that it will turn off your laptop while Display is off (Remember when you made
 this in Turn off display after..." which is the same as when you shut down Windows 8 when the option "Turn on fast startup" is enabled, the screen is turned off while Windows is shutting down..<br />
<br />
So I presume the problem persists within Windows shutting down while Display is turned off..</p>

            <p>I have tried to re-install Windows 8.1 Enterprise yesterday from an installation disk, however for the first time I tried to let IDM shut down laptop when the display was turned off, the laptop hang on the black screen leaving the power button lit and the
 fan spinning so fast.... I tried to leave the laptop for 10 minutes to see if it will shut down or restart, it doesn't do anything rather than the Power button is lit and the fan is running so fast then I was afraid about the fan so I hold the power button
 to shut it down..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think this can be caused by Windows 8.1 sometimes? Does this even exist in Windows 8? But when I purchased the laptop, it came with Windows 8 I didn't face such problems when I used utorrent to turn off laptop even when the display is turned off..</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the bad in this issue is that I hear that people also face this with Windows 7 and Vista.</p>

<p>
</p><p>But I think this is a bug in Windows 8 or 8.1 because there are many people as well complain of similar issue, when they try to shut down their laptop, the screen goes black but power button still lit and fan spins fast.... So do all these people who complain
 about this issue get hardware problem in their laptops? I have seen this with people having Sony VAIO, HP, Acer and Dell laptops.</p>

            <p>I am just wondering......<br />
Why the **** the laptop often hangs after Windows shuts down when the display is turned off??<br />
<br />
Now, I am testing my laptop to see if IDM will always shut down laptop completely when the Display is not turned off...<br />
I hope you understand me of what I mean by the <strong>Display is turned off</strong>.<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi1187.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fz393%2fBlackCitadel%2fCapture_zps92894cc6.jpg" /><br />
<br />
As you see, I set Windows to "Turn off the display" when plugged in after 1 minute.<br />
Now the display is turned off right?!<br />
Now, when I let Internet Download Manager to turn off laptop when it finishes downloading, SOME TIMES but not ALWAYS, laptop hangs on leaving the Power button lit and fan keeps running at full speed (So risky)...<br />
<br />
So IDM will turn off laptop while the display is turned off resulting sometimes in system hang not fully shut down...<br />
<br />
Remember, when people was advised to disable "Turn on fast startup".. because this also often causes this. Windows 8 first turns off the display and you still see the power button is still lit and you wait for about 10 seconds while the display is turned off,
 sometimes laptop will shut down and sometimes it will hang on as I described previously....<br />
<br />
So, do you think the issue isn't that you should turn off fast startup, but I think the bug is that when Windows 8 shuts down while the display is turned off...<br />
<br />
Do you really think this can be an issue in my laptop's hardware not able to shut down sometimes?<br />
<br />
But if it was a hardware problem, then why the laptop will always shut down normally if the display was not turned off?? or when I manually click "Shut down" from Power Menu in Windows?<br />
<br />
And that's why I am testing this, I will let IDM to shut down laptop automatically while the display is not turned off to see if it will hang someday.. If it doesn't, then the problem was indeed was when the display being turned off and Windows is shutting
 down..<br />
<br />
Next, I will try utorrent to automatically shut down PC while display is turned off, may it is the IDM but I don't think so because this problem of laptop hang when Windows shuts down while display is turned off is very identical when you enable "turn on fast
 startup" and you manually click "Shut down" then screen goes black for moments and then it's your luck laptop may shut down or it may hang.

<blockquote>I was very happy for having this laptop for being an intel core i7 and a 2 GB NVIDIA card because my previous one was an i3..<br />
BUT this shut down issue let me down. <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.win8forums.com%2fstyles%2fdefault%2fxenforo%2fsmilies%2ffrown.png" /><br />
<br />
I will be happy again if someone assured me that's not a hardware related bug or issue because everything else is perfect in the laptop.
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A message to Microsoft:</p>
<p>Please please please, can you do a little bit work to release another version of Windows 8.1 and just before you release it please test it with this issue, shut down PC or laptop while the display is turned off (You can do this by letting a download app
 like IDM to automatically shut down pc when it finishes downloading, while the display is turned off) you have to test this several time and see if the device hang on sometimes not powering off but the screen is black..</p>
<p>
</p><p>And please fix this in the next Windows release (Windows 9??) I hope and I wish you REMOVE this controversial "fast startup" feature, it causes many problems with many laptops and PCs and if the owner of the PC didn't notice that his laptop didn't actually
 shut down and left it at this point and slept, then his device would have wore out when he wakes up since the CPU fan runs very very fast when this issue happens. (I don't have any idea why this happens!!!!)</p>
<p>Is it running a HEAVY graphics or CPU intensive game?? All is there is JUST the screen is black, power button is turned on, laptop is not actually shut down, so for which reason the CPU fan would be running so fast??!!

    <title>Would love to see an iTunes app on Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Would love to see an iTunes app on Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>I am sold on the idea of Xbox One being the complete media hub for my living room. &nbsp;I never thought I would like the TV integration as much as I do. &nbsp;What's missing though is iTunes (specifically for music). &nbsp;I've invested a lot of time and money building
 my iTunes library and playlists and I have to switch to my Apple TV to access it all. &nbsp;This isn't that big of a deal of course, but like I said, I'm sold on the Xbox One being my media hub. &nbsp;It would be REALLY cool if there was an iTunes app where I could
 access all my music and stream it via iTunes Match. &nbsp;Xbox Music isn't bad, and I'm open to the subscription model, but Xbox Music doesn't work at all on my Mac (at least I'm unable to get it to run in my browser) and I can only stream on my iPhone (that doesn't
 work when I'm out and about). &nbsp;Xbox has all sorts of various media apps that compete with their own video store, I don't see why they couldn't add iTunes. &nbsp;If there's iTunes on PC, I don't see why there can't be iTunes on the Xbox One. &nbsp;I know it's a long
 shot, but it would be great if&nbsp;Apple and Microsoft made this happen! &nbsp;Then my Xbox One would truly be my central media hub!</p>

    <title>Headphone&#39;s microphone detection problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lawrence_ingham  say:</h3>
<h2>            Headphone&#39;s microphone detection problem</h2>
                    <p>I have been using a set of Qpad QH-90 headphones for 18 months, and everything seemed to work fine, however recently I tried to use the microphone on the headset for Skype, and it didn't work, no one could hear me. So I did a little digging and found that
 the audio manager doesn't actually register my headphones as being 'there', it detects an audio device being plugged in to the front jacks, but the headphones icon doesn't appear, it just detects 'speakers'.<br />
<br />
I remember using the microphone before, but can't remember how long ago this was probably around 4 months ago? maybe longer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried updating audio drivers, connecting the headphones to the back jacks (and thus removing the actual speakers), and with removing all the extension cables to the headphones. I have even tried putting the mic straight into the PC.</p>
<p>The microphone does work if plugged into my ipad so it's not a problem with the headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using windows 8.1, and am using NVIDIA and Realtek sound drivers/devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In summary:</p>
<p>Headphones audio work, mic doesn't and neither detected in device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any help would be much appreciated</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Lawrence,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are unable to use your microphone as your computer is not detecting and sound from your microphone. The issue might be related
 with the microphone configuration or with the driver of the sound card. We need few more details to understand the cause of the issue better.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Have you made any hardware changes in your computer recently?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Verify whether your microphone has an in-line adjustment. Many now provide either noise dampening or muting as a slider or switch.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Is your microphone working on another Windows computer?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check your microphone to ensure that it is plugged correctly into the motherboard or sound card. The jack should be connected to a port with a microphone symbol, typically
 colored pink. If a USB port is used, ensure it is plugged into a powered connection.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to try using the “Recording Audio” troubleshooter. It checks for common problems with your volume settings, your sound card or driver, and your speakers
 or headphones. Refer to the following steps to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Follow the steps to run the troubleshooter:</span></p>

            <p>HI Shivam</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not made any hardware changes to the computer recently (all internal hardware has never been changed), and have verified that the headset is plugged in correctly and has not been muted via the in-line switch.</p>
<p>I have checked in another computer and it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When running the audio troubleshooter it come us with the message;</p>
<p>"The peripheral does not appear to be plugged in. Check the connection. Proceed to next step to finish."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had a look for the correct chipset driver, but am unsure quite what I'm looking for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Considering I have a NVIDIA sound card and the only chipset drivers available for windows 8 are for AMD, ATI or INTEL.<br />
<br />
There are NVIDIA drivers but they only support windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Lawrence,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the steps.</p>
<p>As you mentioned the drivers are available for Windows 7, I suggest you to download and install the Windows 7 drivers available on the website in compatibility mode and check if it helps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the link given below.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>I suggest you to make sure that the Microphone is not disabled and is set as default.</p>
<p>Make sure that the microphone that you are using is not disabled and is set as default in the computer. Follow these steps to check this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click on the volume icon and select <strong>“Recording devices”.</strong></li><li>Now, right click on an empty space and select, <strong>“Show disconnected devices”</strong> and
<strong>“Show disabled devices”.</strong></li><li>Select “Microphone” and click on <strong>“Properties”</strong> and make sure that the microphone is enabled.</li><li>You may also check if the microphone that you are using is set as default.</li></ol>
<p>Now, check the issue. If it is already enabled, then try the next method and check the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> I suggest you to update the Sound Card Drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <strong>Check the Windows updates for any latest driver updates.</strong></p>
<p>Check in Windows updates if any driver updates are available. If so, install the same and check if it helps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>“Windows Logo” + “W” </strong>keys from the keyboard.</li><li>Type <strong>“Updates” in </strong>the search bar and click on<strong> “Install optional updates”
</strong>from the left pane.</li><li>From the “Windows Update” window, click on <strong>“Check for Updates” </strong>
on the top left corner to receive a fresh list of updates and install all the updates listed there.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Try updating the drivers from the Device Manager.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>“Windows Logo” + “X”</strong> keys on the keyboard.</li><li>Click on <strong>“Device Manager”.</strong></li><li>Search for the Sound Card from the device list and right click on it and select
<strong>“Update Driver Software”.</strong></li><li>Follow the on-screen instructions and complete the installation of the latest driver.</li><li>If no driver updates are available, you may also search for the updated sound card drivers in the
<strong>“Drivers”</strong> and <strong>“DriverStore”</strong> folders in the location “C:/Windows/System32” by selecting the option
<strong>“Browse my computer for Driver Software”.</strong></li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps. Please let us know the results. We will be glad to assist you further.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There might be a chance that some system files got corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the methods.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1:<br />
I would suggest you to perform a SFC Scan and check if it helps.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Note: While performing SFC Scan I would recommend you to make sure that there are no applications or programs running on the back ground.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2:<br />
I would suggest you to create a new user account and check if it helps.</p>

<strong>- </strong>how could the entire space, in an unformatted disk, be fully used up?
<br />
</li><li>Partition <strong>4 - </strong><strong>(C:) </strong><strong>- </strong>has operating system installed on it which is fine.<br />

<h2>            nvidia gtx 580 crashing&#63; bccode 116</h2>
                    have had several crashes in the last few days. updated video drivers to 310.90 crashed again twice. generally after a while of use. GPU idle temp is averaging 45-48C. On load its reaching 85-90C, thinking this is a bit high would just like to know if anyone
 can pinpoint the problem. system has been stable for several months and is now having problems.&nbsp;

            Try re-doing your link. It's not working for me. Use the chain icon in the tool bar.<br />
- You may do better re-posting in the Hardware and Drivers forum. The people with the most
<br />
experience with crash dmp interpretation hang out there and in the Performance &amp; Maintenance forum.<br />
Also upload a <span style="font-style: italic">system information</span> file ( msinfo32 ) .<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes it is a bit too high . You should not go over 70+C even with ambient air temps of around 35C.<br />
[EDIT: As suggested below 60-65 is more desirable.]<br />
-Are the temps good on the cpu ?<br />
-If you remove the side panel does it run cooler (direct a room fan into it if you can) ?<br />
<br />
Is the machine dusty ?<br />
Check intake fan filters for dust. If they are clogged cleaning them may do. It the fans don't have<br />
filters you may want to swithch off the machine and disconnect the power. Then remove the card an clean the dust off the cooling fins as best you can, using a brush or can of compressed air (don't use vacuum cleaner as they create static electricity). Do the
 cpu cooler fins as well.<br />

            Ambient temperature of most GPU's shouldn't exceed 60-64C<br />
That being said, your GPU and CPU fans may need to be replaced.&nbsp;<br />
Check your reliability monitor (you can find it by searching the start menu) and check for the increased frequency, if it is linear then that points generally to fan degradation.<br />
If it happens under stress, your PSU could be starting to fail also.<br />
Those would be the primary Hardware factors concerning BSOD in your situation

<h2>            Windows Update keeps restarting with unable to complete configuration and shows error code 800700C1</h2>
                    <p>About 2 weeks ago my Windows 7 professional system stopped being able to install updates.&nbsp; I had 45 updates to install and the system completed installing and first configuration, rebooted, started configuring at 30 percent, went to 85 percent and then gave
 error message that it could not complete configuration, reverting back.&nbsp; Then went back to trying to install updates and repeated reboot and configuration failure.&nbsp; Did this 3 times and then I got my desktop back. I tried the automatic update troubleshooter
 which said it fixed 2 problems.&nbsp; I went to Windows Update window and it said there were no updates to be installed and I had never checked for updates and none were ever installed.&nbsp; I told it to search for updates and it found 45.&nbsp; I unchecked all updates
 and then checked only the first one to install.&nbsp; Told it to install that update and it had the same result, trying to install 3 times and then stopped.&nbsp; I went to the Windows Update window and clicked on View Updates.&nbsp; It listed the one update as Failed and
 gave an error code of 800700C1.</p>
<p>The system is a Dell XPS 8700.&nbsp; How can I get out of this predicament?&nbsp; Should I try the Repair and Fix Windows Updates with the Fix WU Utility?</p>

<h2>            Is there any way to remove the suspension history on my account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey there, <br />
<br />
What happened: I was playing gta v the other day on 360 as i don't own it on Xbox one. Anyways i was just playing online when all of a sudden a player turned into an orange ball and started bouncing around trying to squish other players and i freaked out running away putting my car back in my garage and left the silly hacked lobby. I went to get on Xbox the next/day or so after this had happened and my account had been banned for 24 hours.
<br />
<br />
My theory on the ban: Due to it being a hacked lobby someone else (including myself) didn't like what was happening and because you couldn't tell who the orange ball was. I'm guessing another player has just reported everyone in the lobby hoping to get the hacker banned and has gotten other people like myself banned that haven't even done anything wrong and had never asked to be in a modded lobby.<br />
<br />
My question: Due to it being only a 24 hour ban and already being lifted I'm unable to start a case review on it. I'm wondering if there is any possible way to get the offense from my suspension history removed please? As i don't want something there that isn't my fault nor do i want a bad history to look back on.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>So if anyone reads this, this is why my account got banned... So one day i was on my xbox minding my own business just playing a small game of gears of war 4 of team deathmatch and my team was winning and when the game ended ok... this what happened i was the top player in my teamand got 29 kills i got reported by being the top player in my team. And I GOT 2 reports saying communication and harrasment and abuse. HOW AM I GETTING REPORTED FOR COMMUNICATION WHEN I DIDN'T HAVE MY MIC PLUGGED OR I DIDN'T EVEN SEND MESSAGE TO ANYONE IN THE GAME... and then how do harass or abuse someone (ON XBOX) when im minding my own business. Xbox enforcement team i hope you fix my problem because it says the i have a permanent suspension for doing nothing so. the enforcement team i hope you fix my problem because im trying to communicate to my friends because I HAVEN'T TALKED OR HEARD THEM FOR OVER 2 MONTHS. So thank you very much and have a wonderful day.😃🙂</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br

            <p>Unfortunately, a free product key cannot be provided, but you can purchase one:</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>--------------------------</p>
<p>Question, have you left Namibia, any plans to return in the near future? Because what you could do is extend the grace period up to 120 days which should give you about 3 months to work without activated until you can obtain your product key.</p>
<p>When you are at the end of the 30 days, do the following:</p>
<p>Click Start, type: CMD</p>
<p>Right click CMD </p>
<p>Then click Run as administrator</p>
<p>At the command prompt, type:</p>
<p>slmgr.vbs -rearm</p>
<p>Hit Enter on your keyboard</p>
<p>Exit the command prompt</p>
<p>Restart your computer</p>
<p>This will extend the activation period up to another 30 days.</p>

            <p>Well Unicorn6 ,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can sympathize with ya. Its called "a work in progress". The techs find a loophole in the code and try to fix it.</p>
<p>MS is probably the most attacked OS around. Plus any Gov't users want the Corp. to keep it up to date... most probably by "contract" ...... then the fixes get passed along to us. I remember XP was a very stable OS , and we kept getting upgrades, patches
 and hot patches (Not so often on the Hot Patches). </p>
<p>I was looking for an answer to another question and happened to come across your entry. My answer is based only upon my experiences.</p>
<p>Hope you know now, "you are not alone".</p>

            Nice answer to&nbsp;bad it is not even close. You say it is a work in progress. When does it stop being a work in progress? You talk about XP, well upgrades are not update fixes. It is not like they are just starting out. This system has been around for about
 two years now and&nbsp;they are&nbsp;still trying to get it right.&nbsp;&nbsp;All I want to know is when? Like I said, maybe&nbsp;just in time for next one to come along?&nbsp;

            <p>It will never be "all fixed." Here's an article on that subject I wrote a while back:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you ever heard someone say “I won’t install that program. It has bugs in it”? How about “I’ll wait until they get all the bugs out”?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you think people are justified in saying that, I have a secret to share with you. All software has bugs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is worth repeating an extra time, a little louder: All software has bugs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Please don’t write and send me a counter example snippet of a few lines of code that does something like displaying a single line on the screen. Yes, I know it’s possible to do that. But the fact remains, that except for the trivial, there’s no such thing
 as bug-free software.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For some reason, most people don’t understand this. They think they’re entitled to get bug-free software, and they often dismiss a good product because they, or someone they know, had a problem with it. In a perfect world, of course, they would be right—bug-free
 software should exist, and everyone should expect and demand it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Why is it that all software has bugs? Why can’t we ever have truly flawless programs?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are really two answers to those questions. One is the theoretical one; the other is the mundane, practical one of economic realities.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The theoretical one is easy to understand: one can prove the presence of bugs, but never their absence. You find a bug by testing the software. If it doesn’t work the way it’s supposed to, you’ve found a bug.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But suppose you run a test and everything works correctly. Does that show there are no bugs? Highly unlikely. It’s far more likely that your test just wasn’t thorough enough. Run more and better test cases, exercise the program more thoroughly, and you
 can always find more bugs. Today’s programs are far more than sufficiently complex that more bugs can always be found if you test long enough, hard enough, and smart enough. Even if a program had no remaining bugs, one could never prove it; it is always possible
 that still another test will find still another bug. And in practice, it always does, if the testers are clever enough.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What about the practical necessities of how software is tested? Bear in mind, first of all, that there are three groups of players in this game: the developers, the quality assurance team (the testers), and the marketing people.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The developers are usually endowed with supreme confidence. When they write code, according to them it will work first time out. It’s hardly even necessary to test, and it only should be done just to give everyone a little extra confidence in the product.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The quality assurance people have been in this business for a while. QA knows there are bugs in the product, and delights in showing their superior skill and ever finding more bugs to prove to the developers that they don’t know how to develop software.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And the marketing people. The marketing people are concerned that the company is losing market share every day that the product doesn’t ship. “Guys, we have to get this product out the door. It doesn’t matter if it’s not perfect. Few people will use that
 buggy feature anyway.”<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So we have a triangle—each side with a different point of view, and a different axe to grind. Who wins out? Well, the strength of the sides clearly differs from company to company, product to product, situation to situation, and individual to individual.
 But in the long run, it’s clear who eventually wins—it’s always marketing. They win because they have to win, because ultimately they’re right—you have to get the product out the door sooner or later, or the company can’t survive. You simply can’t wait forever.
 QA can always find more bugs, and if you give them their head, they will test forever and the product will never ship.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So what happens in practice? How are products tested, bugs found, and bugs fixed? The details of the procedure certainly varies from company to company, but most companies do something like the following. The software, once completed, goes through a round
 of testing. QA identifies a bunch of bugs, and those bugs are classified with respect to things like severity, user impact, frequency of occurrence, and difficulty of correction.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The defect reports (description of the bugs) go back to the developers for correction. Some (for example, errors in spelling a message on the screen) are easy to correct, and can quickly be fixed even if their impact is slight. Others may take longer, some
 much longer. In some cases, the correction of an error may be so difficult, perhaps even requiring a major rewrite of a large portion of the software, that the developers rebel against fixing it at all. They may argue that the error occurs only in an exceedingly
 unlikely and infrequent situation.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Folks, like it or not, that argument is sometimes accepted. The exigencies of getting the product out the door sometimes demand that it be accepted. Nobody is particularly happy with that decision, but it is seen as the only practical thing to do. Sometimes
 it’s the right decision; sometimes it’s the wrong one.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So some of the errors get fixed, some of the fixes are still being worked on, and other errors may be accepted as not worth the effort of fixing. The partially-corrected software now goes back to QA, and the whole process is repeated once more.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Test, identify bugs, fix some of them, resubmit for testing, test, identify bugs, fix some of them, resubmit for testing... This sequence is repeated again and again until management decides that the product is good enough. It does not wait until there
 are no more bugs; it waits until that “good enough” stage has been reached. There is no alternative—it will never be perfect; QA can always find another bug if you let them run another test.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So what is “good enough”? How do you know when that stage has been reached? Different companies, different people will answer that question differently, and even the same people will answer it differently at different times, in different situations.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What goes into the determination? Questions like these: How many bugs still remain? What is their severity?. How frequently do they occur? What is the rate of finding new bugs—is QA still finding bugs at the same rate as they started to, or have they slowed
 down? Then there are the marketing questions. How late is the product? What is the competition doing? Is their product out yet.? Is the competition’s product stable or buggy?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So sooner or later, rightly or wrongly, the product is released—and it always still has bugs. Some of those bugs are there because they haven’t been found by the testers, others are known, and a conscious decision was made to ship the product with them
 remaining in it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What does this all mean? That all software is terrible and equally bad? Not at all. I began by saying that all software had bugs, not that all software is equally bad. One product has many bugs—another may have far fewer. Some programs have severe problems,
 perhaps completely crashing whenever an important feature is used—another may have mostly minor problems. Some software has problems are hard to recover from—others have simple workarounds.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Differences between software stability certainly exist, and those differences can often be dramatic. But perfection—the absence of all bugs—does not exist, can not exist, and will never exist.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;OK, once more. All together now, “All software has bugs.”</p>

            True but my post was not for help to fix my windows 10.&nbsp;It was to see how many people also found it funny that a system program that Microsoft put through so many tests still doesn't run at even at 80%.

            Have HP 6500 printer that worked fine on the Win 7 PC near it or via in house network from other PC both before and after it was changed to Win 10.&nbsp; After the other PC was changed to Win 10 the printer can not be used by either.&nbsp; Have used the suggestion

    <title>MORE Windows SPYWARE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dont askdont tell  say:</h3>
<h2>            MORE Windows SPYWARE</h2>
                    <p>When is ENOUGH ENOUGH ?? NOW Microsoft is installing SPYWARE with updates once more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What seemed to start with the LegitCheckControll.dll in Windows XP, continued into Vista, and then onto Win 7, Win 8, Win 8.1 and Win 9..... NOW it's back in Windows 10 too, just to ensure Microsoft rob everyone of every cent possible.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a LEGAL WIndows 10 install, with a PAID FOR Product key, and yet, I get this pop up 10 -20 times a day. And NOT ONE of the so called "fixes" online do anything to stop it. This is SPYWARE plain and simple, it SOLE purpose is to MAKE USERS BUY ANOTHER
 SOFTWARE LICENCE they do not need and SHOULD NOT be getting messages about. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Even the SPYWARE cannot see a REAL Windows vs a FAKE. DAMN GOOD bit of SPYWARE this one.......it comes down in KB4457128 or if your PC doesn't require that update, it installs it via KB4456655 or if that one fails it installs it via KB4343909. Point being,
 you get it one or another no matter what you do to try to prevent it. All of these are under the auspices of a " Windows Roll-Up" fix.
</p>
<p>All are unstoppable even by deferring updates. </p>
<p>
</p><p>IMHO The SOLE reason Windows 10 is unable to turn updates OFF completely is so Microsoft can access the built in backdoors in their software and fill your screen with product placement and security breach warnings that do nothing but sell MICROSOFT product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the SPYWARE running itself after install, and there is NO WAY to remove it I have found that actually works.</p>

<p>No, your wrong in this case. The TYPE of licence is irrelevent. I HAVE a legitimate licence for BOTH my Pro and Ent. versions. I have about 50 VLK licences I can use aswell, the licences are ALL valid. I have PAID for the one's I own already.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The POINT is this is BLATANT SPYWARE installed without permission by Microsoft. This is NOT ONLY an infringement of my privacy, but it also a BLATANT attempt at swindling money out of customers for licence fee's they DO NOT HAVE TO PAY TWICE.
</p>
<p>Posting an output to let you see my version is also irrelevent, as the version I run HAS NOTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH SPYWARE. I have run the SAME version of Windows 10 since it's BETA releases were uncompiled and binaries had to be installed in 250 seperate
 pieces to make each part work. It took DAYS to install it to run at all, now, it's in release form, it SHOULD NOT be having advertising spyware installed as a SO CALLED update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the version was at 17134.284 this wasn't an issue, however, the monthly roll up is now version 17134.285 and has installed this SPYWARE for no reason. MY licence has been activated AND valid for over 2 years on this machine. But one **** little bit
 of code from Microcrap and I have to see the damn pop up each time I boot. At least it doesn't do anything, just annoy's the HELL out me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to my version of Windows I'm running, this is it....BITE ME BILL !!!</p>

<p>Now it seems the cycle is complete. My Windows is now DEACTIVATED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I BOUGHT MY WINDOWS 10 keys AND MY WINDOWS 10 PRE-INSTALLED LAPTOP from LEGITIMATE Resellers of MS product. BOTH came from a PC Sales Shop with licencing arrangements for resale in place. BOTH HAVE LEGITIMATE LICENCES ACCORDING TO THE PAYMENT I MADE TO MICROSOFT
 via this reseller, who is now defunct and cannot be contacted about this issue.</p>
<p>NOW BOTH are deactivated and have a watermark saying they are illegal on the desktop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>THIS IS NO JOKE NOW. I have now 2 unusable FULLY LEGAL copies and BOTH have been deactivated by Microsoft AFTER PAYMENTS have been made for licences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have no access to my files and no other recourse but to switch to another OS and TRY to make all my software work again. Even REAL and LEGAL copies of Microsoft Software are being turned into illegal copies to scam more money from consumers. This is
 BLATANT THEFT.</p>

<p>Why YES, I can......I can also say F*** that. I am a pensioner looking after a disabled person, TRYING to make an honest dollar via some small business operations. Now, due to MS greed and theft tactics, I have to either find another OS or send another $385AUD
 to MS for yet another Windows 10 key they will block, blacklist and lockout in 3 months anyway.</p>
<p>I AM NOT ABOUT to take on the millionaires club of lawyers they have for this kind of thing either, the reason no-one sues MS now is they cannot win against a judiciary and legal system in the USA that is solely there to decide in the MONEY MAKERS favour....normal
 people get the shaft in favour of the fat cats all the time. A NO WIN situation for most.</p>

<p>I agree, but this is clearly the worst F*&amp;K up in MS's history.&nbsp; The "cash value" of lost data is unimaginably high, especially when a whole bunch of grandparents start talking about how they had all of their family photos deleted.&nbsp; I wonder how many 10s
 of millions of pissed off customers they have right now.&nbsp; I don't believe that anyone has filed a class action suit against MS, but I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to find a lawyer who lost all of his or her family photos and other documents to take it on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One good thing to come of this is that now people will be more aware of how important is to back up all of your personal files to at least one removable HDD.</p>

            Hi Taffy
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />If you are on Windows 10 1903, this seems to be an effect of the new lock screen where it makes the image dynamic by zooming it in to give the appearance of movement. 
<br />
<br />Can you try removing the photos from the Lock Screen then add them again to see if resolves this issue?
        </p>

            Hello Andre. I'm on Windows 10 v1809 17763.529 (That WU was installed on the 29th May, around the time when this problem started but I'm pretty sure that that is just a co-incidence.)

            If you can, try performing a system restore before this problem started to see if it corrects the problem or try upgrading to the newer Windows 10 1903 release.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: rstrui.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />This will start the system restore wizard. Choose a restore point before the problem started. 
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Upgrade this PC now if you want to upgrade right away,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don’t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Anniversary Update on a system with limited space:
<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />If you want to perform a new install or just keep your files click Change what to keep. Once you have chosen the desired options, click Install to begin.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />That’s it, the Windows 10 Feature Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />How to prepare your computer before upgrading?
<br />
<br />Although updating to Windows 10 version 1903 is a relatively simple process, similar to a repair upgrade; users should perform some basic pre-requisites before initiating the upgrade.
<br />
<br />If you are finding it difficult to carry out some of the steps described below, please review detailed instructions how to perform them:
