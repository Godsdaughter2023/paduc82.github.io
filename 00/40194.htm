</p><p>I have an Acer Aspire and all the problems that everyone else has with Windows Update. I went through all the suggestions listed in this website and other websites and it boils down to this. You need at least 4GB Ram and more than a 32 GB Disk drive --<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>period
 --</strong></span> to operate&nbsp;Windows 10 at a decent speed and get the updates. That makes the Acer Aspire a piece of junk and should be illegal. It has an attractive price for a low end user and should be advertised as such. If you need a real computer, save
 your nickels and buy one. Otherwise the frustration will drive you crazy !</p>

<p>Thanks Casey.&nbsp; I split this out of the Clean Install comments because I think it's an important point.&nbsp; It is ridiculous that someone should have to juggle app installs on a PC like it's a starter phone.&nbsp; Maybe these PC's should be deemed starters, too?</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing to keep an eye on is the cache that builds up with Windows and Version Updates. Run Disk Cleanup and after it scans select System Files so it scans again, clean up everything found.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>When running Windows 10 on low capacity devices such as those with 32 GBs, you need to augment it with at least a larger SSD and cloud storage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, you could connect a 64 GB SD Card and offload apps from the Windows Store to the SD Card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Feature&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select the app downloaded from the Windows Store then click Move</p>
<p>Choose the SSD</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next option is to use OneDrive to keep files in the cloud and only sync those you need. A feature coming to OneDrive in the next version of Windows 10, 1709 called Files on Demand lets you do that:</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Having an external drive can help to offload and archive large files such as videos and images.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>A feature in Windows 10 1703 called Storage Sense can help you manage files over a period of time, so you should enable: Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should also keep in mind low capacity devices should be used specifically for what they are intended for, which more consumption than a work horse traditional larger capacity device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Cloud, External Backup should really be your assets when using these devices.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>When upgrading to newer versions, you can using the tools available as part of the upgrade wizard:</p>

 and are a good 2nd PC.&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, these devices require a higher level of TLC for major upgrades (sometimes requiring clean installs instead of an update, to upgrade), as well as proper utilization of SDcards for local storage of user data (and/or OneDrive data).</p>

<h3> austinrenshaw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows DVD app plays choppy videos on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows DVD player being choppy</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't seem to find any help for this anywhere else, but with my update to Windows 10, I of course received Windows DVD player as an app. Which is lovely, save that I can't play a single DVD on it without the frames being choppy and skipping back and forth
 all the time.</p>
<p>I want to know if there is a fix and/or I can re-setup Windows Media Player to play DVD's again, cause for some dumb reason it simply wont let me play a DVD from media player anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I am not in a good mood about this... If a change in app is made that functions poorer than what was available previously I don't think anyone should be happy about it. This is coming from someone that openly likes everything else about Windows 10 and
 the other changes that were made.</p>

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>Tenure are counted of how long have you been a GOLD member.</p>
<p>Here are some info/FAQ from Major Nelson's Blogs:</p>
<p>[quote user="Xbox Live Tenure FAQ:"]</p>
<p><strong>Q. My tenure is not displaying at all!<br />
</strong><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">A. &nbsp;The Gold Tenure is being rolled out to all Xbox LIVE users over the next few days. By next week, everyone who has at least 1 full year in Xbox LIVE Gold status will see their tenure.</span><br />
<strong>Q. My tenure is exactly one year off. Why is that?<br />
</strong><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">A. If you were a member of the Summer Update Preview and created your Gold Account on an Original Xbox console while living in Canada, your tenure won’t update to the proper number of years until your account’s next “birthday”.
 For example; if you created your account on October 19th of 2003, your Gold Tenure will display properly on October 19th of 2009.</span><br />
<strong>Q. I changed my gamertag 2 years ago because I didn’t like it. Will that reset my tenure?<br />
</strong><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">A. Changing your gamertag won’t change your tenure, just like it doesn’t change your gamerscore. &nbsp;</span><br />
<strong>Q. I’ve been a member of Xbox LIVE since it began! I should have 7 years because it’s 2009.<br />
</strong><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">A. The very first gamertag,&nbsp;</span><a href="http://live.xbox.com/profile/profile.aspx?pp=0&amp;GamerTag=e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">e</a><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">, was created on 8/13/2002.&nbsp;</span><a href="http://live.xbox.com/profile/profile.aspx?pp=0&amp;GamerTag=e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">e</a><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">,
 as he is known both online and in real life, will turn 7 on 8/13/2009.</span><br />
<strong>Q. My account was in Silver status for awhile, how does that affect my tenure?&nbsp;</strong><br />
 Tenure would be 1 year because the account spent 6 months of it’s first year in Silver status.</span><br />
<strong>Q. The article online says that if I had a 14 day break in my Gold account status, my tenure would reset! Is that true?&nbsp;</strong><br />
<strong>Q. I’ve been a member since 2006, why does my tenure only show a 2 when 2006 was 3 years ago?</strong><br />
<strong>Q. The date in on the account details page on xbox.com says I’ve only been a Gold member for a couple months. When is that going to be updated?</strong><br />
 or you applied a subscription code).</span><br />
<strong>Q. Where can I go to see exactly when I paid for my Gold account?</strong><br />
 when you were Gold vs. Silver. You’ll need to login with the Windows Live ID associated with the GamerTag. (Click on your payment type and you’ll be able to see your payment history).&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            USB headset &#40;headphones and microphone&#41; - This device cannot start - Code 10</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've just bought a USB headset today and tried to use it.&nbsp; I got a driver error message when first plugged in.&nbsp; The help system proved useless.</p>
<p>After doing some searches on this forum I checked the device manager and found that the USB audio device properties indicatses that 'This device cannot start. (Code 10)'.&nbsp; The forum entries suggests that many people are having similar problems.</p>
<p>Mine is a new Windows 7 64 bit install on a new hard drive, but on an older PC hardware - Asus A8N SLI Premium.&nbsp; Anyone got any suggestions as to resolving the problem.&nbsp; Note that a normal&nbsp;headset worked fine yesterday (but I broke it) plugged into the jack
 sockets but I wanted to use a USB headset so as to avoid having to keep going around the back of the PC to change to my 2.1 speaker system.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Code 10 error code is generated when Device Manager has insufficient information or the error that is bubbled up by the device
 drivers is not recognized by Device Manager. Additionally, this error may occur when one of the drivers that the device needs does not start. If many drivers are being used by a particular device, it can be difficult to determine the one that failed.</span></span></p>

<br />
Essentially - it's not likely to work the way you want and the makers of the game are not going to likely fix it so it will.&nbsp; It's probably trying to make calls expecting a different DirectX or a whole host of other possibilities.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
And based off those specs - they only supported this game THROUGH Windows XP.&nbsp; After that - yeah...<br />

<div><font>So I recently got back into monopoly and wanted to play it, however the version that a site called &nbsp;pogo.com has to offer was sub-par and I wanted something better. Then I remembered I had a monopoly disc that I purchased back in like 2008 (Monopoly
 3) but realized that this computer has no cd-rom drive so I had to use a program to convert it to an iso just so I could install it (Sigh sleekbooks)&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font><br />
</font></div>
<div><font>when I did install it I had 1 error message it told me that this game by (Hasbro) was&nbsp;incompatible but I installed it anyhow, it ran flawlessly for giving me an error message saying it was&nbsp;incompatible&nbsp;or so I thought. At this moment it hit me, I
 knew someone who wanted to play a better version of monopoly too and pressed ALT+TAB to tab out of the program and check skype to see if they were online, they were not. When I came back to the game all of the graphics became messed up and was&nbsp;completely unplayable,
 I had to keep alt+tabbing just so I could see the options correctly (still oddly colored but able to make them out)<br />
<br />
This is what the game looks like if I don't use alt+tab:&nbsp;</font><a href="http://prntscr.com/1p1ssj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://prntscr.com/1p1ssj</a><br />
<span><br />
This is what the game looks after I have Alt+tabbed out and then come back:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://prntscr.com/1p1suq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://prntscr.com/1p1suq</a><br />
<br />
<b>Here are what the specifications the game requires you to run it on:</b><br />
<br />
<div>8MB video memory</div>
<div>Min processor speed: 333 MHz</div>
<div>OS type: Windows</div>
<div>Operating system: Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition,</div>
<div>Microsoft Windows XP,</div>
<div>Microsoft Windows 98</div>
<div>Software requirements: DirectX 8.1 or later</div>
<div>System Requirements Details</div>
<div>Min RAM size 32 MB</div>
<div>Min hard drive space 140 MB</div>
<div>Min operating system Microsoft Windows 98/ME,</div>
<div>Microsoft Windows XP</div>
<div>Min processor type Pentium II</div>

<a href="http://prntscr.com/1p1owx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://prntscr.com/1p1owx</a><br />
<br />
<br />
<font>Based on those specifications I should not be having any issues ( Aside from not having,&nbsp;</font>Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition,</div>
<div>Microsoft Windows XP, or Microsoft Windows 98<font>, but in fact WINDOWS 8.) and I do have the latest Gfx drivers<br />
<br />
I&nbsp;</font>have tried the Compatibility Troubleshooter, and manually setting it to win xp sp3 and to no avail still get that GFX issue.</div>
</blockquote>
<br />
Essentially - it's not likely to work the way you want and the makers of the game are not going to likely fix it so it will.&nbsp; It's probably trying to make calls expecting a different DirectX or a whole host of other possibilities.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
And based off those specs - they only supported this game THROUGH Windows XP.&nbsp; After that - yeah...<br />
</blockquote>
Ahaha, and here I was hoping to break the 4th wall and make an incompatible game compatible.<br />
<br />
as you said, "It's probably trying to make calls expecting a different DirectX" well it is supposed to use 8.1 and that was the only issue I encountered with the game too

            You are trying to play a game that was released to play on an operating system that is over 12 years old. There&nbsp;has been way to many hardware and software improvements in that time for this game to ever work correctly. It is time to give up the ghost and
 buy a new game that is compatible with Windows 8 and stop wasting your time. Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we will be glad to assist you.

This is monopoly 3, it is currently the only version with online play that I know of. I have purchased newer games that work with windows 8 and they are lots of fun, however monopoly is one of "Those" games that you just cannot replace with something else.</div>

            This may well be the case but you have already tried just about everything you can do but contact&nbsp; Hasbro. You could also post in any forms Hasbro has and see if anyone has come up with a solution or work around. Bur it might bee time to admit that this
 Version is just not going to work correctly on Windows 8.&nbsp; Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we will be glad to assist you.

            Remember it is the Manufacturer of the Game responsibility to make sure it runs on Windows, not Microsoft. The bottom line is if you got a gripe it is with Hasbro! Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we will be glad to assist you.

<p>If anyone knows how to setup the classic view in windows ten please let me know. If I am forced to use what feels like a MAC OS knock off instead of the classic view I would prefer then I'm just going to sell my PC and buy a MAC.</p>

Install Autoruns and then run it.&nbsp; Wait until the scan is complete (as shown in the lower left corner) and then click on the "Logon" tab.&nbsp; Search through the entries in the right-hand column ("Image Path") for an entry that includes "system3_.exe".&nbsp; When you
 find it, UNcheck the box at the left end of the line and reboot your computer.&nbsp; The error should no longer appear.<br />

If you can't find "system3_.exe" in the Logon tab, click the "Everything" tab.&nbsp; Then click File &gt; Find to search for "system3_.exe".<br />

            When its this severe, you likely need to perform a direct clean install of Windows 10. But before you do that, try installing under the built in Administrator account:
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator/active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Try running the file again. 
<br />

<h2>            Unwanted account</h2>
                    I never signed up for a skype account and do not know why one popped up already set up when turned my computer on. I do not do social media I cannot find any contact info to speak to a person to get rid of skype. When followed instructions to delete skype
 all together the system told me I would be deleting my entire Microsoft account including email.&nbsp; I am being forced to have an account I don't want. How do you speak to a person?????

            Hi aprilcash
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Having a Microsoft account means that you would get a Skype account as well. Anyway, you should not log into your Skype so that nobody can contact you. Also, you can protect your privacy so that nobody can search for you and can contact you also.
<br />
<br />Login to your Skype account @ <a href="https://secure.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com</a>
<br />Scroll down and click Edit Profile &gt; On next page also, click Edit Profile
<br />Scroll down and uncheck the options given in the picture
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ff0421db-9be6-4f84-bad6-f3f4d8e05eaa?upload=true" />

<h3> garykeller15  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where is the display option in the control panel&#63;</h2>
                    <p>i recently today just downloaded and install this what I have to say the worst update ever windows 10 creator. where the hell is the display, in the control panel. How in the hell do when change menu color&nbsp;, border line color, font size and font type and
 font color or make font bold. This should have never been removed. I bet its to push people toward these crap cloud only computers where you have to give and trust these agencies with all your personal data. Listen to the consumers Microsoft and you would
 be better off. also sorry but you nor any other business such as facebook, etc. don't have the right to peoples personal information. And you can not refuse them service if they don't give you permission to use it or give it to you. It is time for the government
 to stand up for peoples privacy and tell these companies they can not use a persons information with out their sole permission for each time they use, Nor can they sell it. Nor refuse service to people who will not give their personal information. Not getting
 a job with a company that's different but if you lets say buy a computer with Microsoft on it and register it. Microsoft does not have any legal constitutional rights to secretly obtain or sell or use your information in anyway without your sole permission.
 Hopefully Microsoft will fix what was not broken but they broke it and put the display back so we can adjust the fonts, menu colors, etc. like it was in windows 7. it was perfect in windows 7.&nbsp; take that part do what you need to do to it to add it to the next
 update so we can change fonts, font size and color, menu color, border colors, etc.&nbsp; Me windows 7 like works 8 suite was the best of those products except with windows 7 IE needed fixing The edge is only good for opening&nbsp; PDF files. and Works 8 Suite which
 I still use cause it is simple and better than office. Needs some update and added features but it is way better than office.&nbsp; So is there something or program&nbsp;or app that will change the font size and make the font bold in windows 10 creator or do we have
 to wait for Windows 11 to come out.</p>

    <title>Mass Effect 1 - Compatibility Mode greyed out, but able to do it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ironballs16  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mass Effect 1 - Compatibility Mode greyed out, but able to do it before &#40;Windows 7&#41;</h2>
                    So, at the advice of an EA tech in regards to downloading the "Bring Down the Sky" DLC content for the original Mass Effect, I uninstalled it from my Windows 7 computer (after having played about 3 hours into it, if not more). When I tried reinstalling
 it from the CD (I have a physical copy of this game), I received the "safedisc.exe could not be found" error that others on the site have encountered - so, taking the advice from there, I tried running the Setup.exe in Windows XP (Service Pack 3) compatibility.
<br />
Since then, when I try to install it, the setup goes from the CD key input directly to "The installation has been cancelled. Please run the installation to try again." screen, and it's now trying to run setup.exe in
<span style="font-style: italic">Windows Vista</span> compatibility!&nbsp; That part I'm completely baffled over, since I never selected that option.<br />
And on top of that, I'm unable (even as Admin) to alter the compatibility mode on this program, regardless of whether I slide the UAC down to the lowest point, and I'm playing a bit of phone-tag with a guy from EA Tech Support, who is equally flummoxed by my
 problem. So how do I change the compatibility mode now that it's greyed itself out and, more baffling yet,
<span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">why</span></span> did it happen to begin with?&nbsp; I've tried doing "Troubleshoot Compatibility" with no success for either version of Windows XP.<br />
<br />
And just to reiterate - I had the game installed twice now on Windows 7 (game installed to an external HD, save files and such to the internal one).&nbsp; The first time was prior to reinstalling the Windows 7 OS due to a rootkit virus, and the second was
<span style="font-style: italic">after</span> the reinstallation - so why on earth I'm having these issues now is just baffling me.<br />

<h2>            Access &#34;run-time error&#34; while exporting &#38; importing</h2>
                    <p>I installed Access 2013 with apparent success into Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Am using the program with highly customized .accdr "Run-time" files</p>
<p>designed by a certain large customer who does not support contractors.</p>
<p>It accepts manual data entries OK. But crashes when I attempt to either</p>
<p>use the M/S Excel import or export features that are built in to the tool.</p>
<p>It gets further with the import, but eventually fails with the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My supervisor is apparently able to export, but gets some missing data.</p>
<p>I just installed the free Windows 10 upgrade without uninstalling</p>
<p>Access. The import/export commands still produce the identical error.</p>
<p>Can you please comment?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t install some programs- Can&#39;t create output file in user account AppData&#92;Local&#92;Temp</h2>
                    When I try to install a program (.exe) it runs winzip self-extractor which tries to create a file in Users\(myusername)\AppData\Local\Temp\setup.exe
<br />
<br />
I just installed windows 7 and had this happen once or twice before this i think but i re-downloaded the file and tried again and it ended up working. Now when i try to install this program (Hava) it says it can't create the output file.
<br />
<br />
When i try to go to this location it doesn't even have the AppData Folder do i need to create this path first or is it a problem with the program? Any help is appreciated.

            Well, that could happen. Since WinZip SFX does have a small option for Overwrite without confirmation checkbox.<br />
<br />
You can go ahead with deleting the existing setup.exe file from Temp folder as its no longer used by any program (hence its in the Temp folder)<br />
<br />
What you can also try now is, since its opens a WinZIP Self Extracting Archive, you can manually try and manually specify where to extract the files before clicking on ok.<br />
<br />
Once you do that, simply run setup.exe from the specified location.<br />
