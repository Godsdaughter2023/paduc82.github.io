<h2>            Sci-Fi Secret Organizations</h2>
                    
<p>CIA, KGB, Section 31, Tal'Shiar, Obsidian Order, Cerberus, Special Tasks Group... every race has a secret shadow organization working behind the scenes to further the agendas of that race.&nbsp; Well, except maybe the Krogan.&nbsp; They're pretty straightforward about
 everything.<br />
<br />
It's like Grunt said when you woke him up: "Offer one hand, but arm the other".&nbsp; We know that Humans have Cerberus.&nbsp; We know that the Salarians have the Special Tasks Group.&nbsp; Do the Turians have one?&nbsp; Most certainly.&nbsp; Asari?&nbsp; You bet your quantum singularity.<br />
<br />
It's the Asari organization that worries me the most.&nbsp; The Asari are literally 5 times more evolved and advanced than their peers.&nbsp; Asari have:<br />
<br />
-Very long lifespans<br />
-Extreme biotic control<br />
-The ability to take genetic material FROM ANY RACE, and assimilate it into their own<br />
<br />
The Asari would seemingly be the primary interest of Collectors and Reapers.&nbsp; Yet we're to believe that they would disregard their mission goal and focus on Humanity, simply because the team that destroyed one of them happened to be lead by a Human?&nbsp; (A team
 that included an Asari, incidentally).<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the Asari shadow organization has some sort of connection to the Collectors and the Reapers.&nbsp; Nor would I be surprised to learn that the Asari have been carried over from at least one previous cycle.&nbsp; They could very well
 have been around at the time of the Protheans.&nbsp; And they were supposedly the first race to discover the Citadel.<br />
<br />
Just as most Humans are unaware of what Cerberus does, most Asari are unaware of what their own shadow group does.&nbsp; But don't be fooled for a minute into believing that they do not have one.&nbsp; If Liara discovers something like this, it would shatter her world
 forever, and even change the face of the galaxy.<br />
<br />
(Obviously groups like the Tal'Shiar don't exist in the Mass Effect universe, they were used as an example.&nbsp; All races will have one, even, and especially, if you don't hear about them.)</p>

<p>I have one question relating to your theory and one which is kind of off topic. First question - Don't you think Liara would already know about her race's secret organizations and also know their main agenda's with her being The Shadow Broker? My second
 question - It may have already been explained in the games and I just missed it, but how did the Asari know that pro-creating with other alien races was better for their own species???</p>
<p>I thought the Reapers mentioned why they are so interested in humanity.....I can't remember the full details, but wasn't it because we are far more genetically diverse then the other alien races? I'm not too sure.</p>

<p>Liara only recently became the Shadow Broker, and she mentioned something that it would take a very long time for her to dig through the vast databases in search of something useful to Shepard. &nbsp;Mass Effect 3, I think, begins very shortly after the end of
 Mass Effect 2. &nbsp;Like a week or two. &nbsp;Not a 2 year span like from ME1-&gt;ME2.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Mordin mentioned that experimenting on Humans was nice because of genetic diversity. &nbsp;Surely the Collectors are experimenting on them also, but that doesn't necessarily mean that Humans are of any particular use for a specific purpose.&nbsp; A Reaper could have
 been constructed from any species, and Humans don't seem to be particularly impressive otherwise.&nbsp; The Human Reaper could simply have been a byproduct of the experiments.&nbsp; As in, hey guys we've got all this leftover genetic crap laying around, let's make like
 Indians and find a use for it.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>As for Asari knowing that they could reproduce with other species, it was bound to happen eventually.</p>

<p>Edit timer ran out booooooo</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If the Asari shadow org is in league with the Collectors/Reapers, Human genetic diversity could be something they would be interested in.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>ALSO: Asari have established an immense economic network.&nbsp; They probably control more Space Wealth than any other race.</p>

<p>Its abit of an iffy subject when it comes to what date and time it is at the beginning of Mass Effect 3, because on one hand - Shepard said he would come straight back to Earth to face the courts when he had finished his mission and then on the other hand
 - The Reapers are attacking Earth and I thought Shepard had delayed the Reapers from invading the Galaxy for a time when he destroyed the Batarian relay??? But I agree with you Purps, it does seem like its only a few weeks after ME2.</p>
<p>As for the Asari being around when the Protheans were and being able to travel the stars, I think you could be onto something there. The Asari do seem far more advanced and evolved than they are letting on.</p>

<p>Common people will deny it's existence, because they want to believe in foolish ideals. &nbsp;Governments will publicly denounce it, and its actions, yet ultimately do nothing, as the governments themselves appreciate the need of such an organization.</p>

<p>The problem with huge conspiracy theories is that they always collapse under their own weight.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>However that being said I could completely see the Asari being at least aware of the existence of the Reapers before Sovereign even showed its tentacles, perhaps the look of their heads are something to do with it. [View:http://forums.xbox.com/emoticons/emotion-4.gif]</p>

<p>It'd be interesting if that is why Liara's "Dad" left as a kid.</p>

<p>Isn't Liara's 'Dad' the bartender at Illium?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>When you think about it, the Asari are a relatively young race. Only fifty generations from the last Reaper Invasion. I say young because if they had been space faring 50 generations ago the Protheans would know, and the Reapers would know. So they were
 either stuck on their planet or Space Faring, yet not very good at it. It makes you wonder though...</p>

    <title>Changing the default save location for Windows Store apps breaks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david lombard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing the default save location for Windows Store apps breaks Symbolic Links in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>I use Symbolic Links heavily for moving games to my SSD for the faster reading speed but still having them appear to be on my hard drive where Origin or Steam or whatever game client is trying to read them from, this is much simpler than actually completely
 moving them to the SSD. An example of the commands I use to do this for a specific game can be found below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>xcopy /E /V /I /F /Y "D:\Steam Games\Alan Wake" "C:\Games\Steam Links\Alan Wake"<br />
cmd /C rd /S /Q "D:\Steam Games\Alan Wake"<br />
cmd /C mklink /J "D:\Steam Games\Alan Wake" "C:\Games\Steam Links\Alan Wake"<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above copies the game from my HDD called D: to my SSD called C: and then creates a link in the original location on the D: drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked perfectly up until yesterday when I clicked on the Start Button, clicked on Settings, Clicked on System, Clicked on Storage and then under the Save Locations section changed the default drive New apps will save to from the default (which is C:)
 to the D: drive. After doing this all my Symbolic links no longer work. Now when I try to open the above game through the shortcut on the D: drive for example it gives the following error:&nbsp; "D:\Steam Games\Alan Wake is not accessible. The system cannot move
 the file to a different disk drive." However if I go to my C: drive where it was now copied to and then linked back, I am able to open the game perfectly so the files themselves are not corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried troubleshooting by going through all services to see if something changed and even ran SFC scans and CHKDSKs and all are coming back as clear. I did however discover that the links will work if I boot into safe mode but further than that I have
 made no progress in fixing it. I have confirmed that the error lies with Windows though as I was able to replicate the error on my brother's laptop quite easily. I symlinked a couple games from his one drive to the other a few moments ago, tested all the shortcut
 links and everything was working fine, went to the Storage settings and changed the default save location of New Windows store apps from his C:drive to his D:drive, the moment I clicked Apply I immediately checked the symlinks again and they were then giving
 the exact same error as above. Changing the default New Apps save location back to C:drive does not fix the problem either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can a Microsoft Representative pass this information along to the development team so this can be fixed?</p>

<p>Hi Sujata</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have copied the above information and sent it using the feedback app for Windows 10 as suggested. How will I know if Microsoft even receives the information sent? Will there be any kind of acknowledgement that this issue is being worked on? Is there nothing
 else to do but wait for this to hopefully be resolved someday?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Cortana does not work and Windows cannot play any media</h2>
                    After starting up my laptop I am able to use Cortana and also view videos and play music. Sometimes Cortana seems to crash. If I click on Cortana's microphone I get the egg timer for a short while, the location privacy settings icon is displayed but nothing
 else happens. After this point I am not able to use Cortana through speech or play any video files (mp4, mkv etc). When attempting to play a video, the TV &amp; Films app opens but it does not display anything. Cortana continues to work except through speech.
 Usually a reboot fixes this issue but not all the time.<br />

<br />
<br />Right click Start button to open Task Manager, choose Show More, then Details tab, scroll down to find an Chrome processes to End Process. 
<br />
<br />Now go into Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Google Chrome &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Uninstall to uninstall Chrome.  
<br />
<br />If that fails see these additional steps:  <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/l3t67Fsq56A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/...</a>

            It seems like they may have given you a code for the wrong platform.&nbsp; I would contact Gamestop and see what they can do for you.&nbsp; Any download code for Mortal Kombat will be redeemed through the Xbox redemption input, and you rightly identified that the
 code isn't long enough.

 When I attempt to drop the icon onto the page, I get this error message:&nbsp; "The subject is not trusted for the specified action."&nbsp; Also, in another attempt to get an embedded Excel object into my form (using the Insert menu), I can only get this to work on
 the "General" page of the form. How can I insert a file or item into one of the custom pages that I have added to my form?&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks in advance for the solution.&nbsp; Amangio<br />

I'm not sure, but it sounds like you expect the&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">PrtScn</span>&nbsp;key to print the screen. It doesn't..<br />
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">Back in the days of DOS, the PrtScn key used to print the screen. But in all versions of Windows, this works differently, and the name of the key
 is now an anachronism. </span><span style="font-style: italic">The key does *not* print the screen.
</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">PrtScrn captures the whole screen, and Alt-PrtScrn captures the active window.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">Either one captures the image to the Windows clipboard. Once it's in the clipboard you can paste (Ctrl-V) it into any application that supports graphics
 (Windows Paint, other graphics programs, even your favorite word processor). You can edit or add to the image as you wish, then print it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">This ability to manipulate the image in a program before printing it is an improvement over the original DOS method of just printing it. But if you'd
 like that old facility back, there are several third-party freeware/shareware programs that can do this, such as PrintKey2000 at

            <p>If all your other keyboard functions work correctly then it would seem to be a system problem.</p>
<p>Try System File Checker to fix any corrupt files in Win7<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if there are also other keyboard problems then go to Control panel, Device manager, Keyboard, look for any warning icons&nbsp;then&nbsp;right-click, Update the driver&nbsp;or if you are not logged in as admin&nbsp;right-click, Properties, enable changes, enter admin password&nbsp;then
 Driver tab &amp; update driver.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Copied the content from previous thread</strong> : On 8/26 I posted "Can't see my account page in Windows 10"&nbsp; which was answered by a Microsoft Support Engineer, who suggested corrective action and assured more help if&nbsp;the suggestion did not work.&nbsp;
 I reported that&nbsp;the suggestion did not help, but I have yet to hear from the engineer about any follow-up advise as to what I should do.&nbsp; Sadly this has been the pattern with all the questions I have posted.&nbsp; An engineer answers promptly with a suggestion.&nbsp;
 The advice offered fails to solve the problem.&nbsp; I never hear from the engineer again.

</p><p><span>I understand that the account page is missing on the computer. We will help you to resolve the issue.</span></p>

<strong>System File Checker (SFC)</strong> is a utility in Microsoft Windows that allows users to scan for and restore corruptions in Windows system files. Perform System File Check (SFC), and then check if this fixes the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.&nbsp;Press the <strong><span>Windows button + X</span></strong> on your keyboard, a mini dialogue box will appear.<br />
2.&nbsp;Choose Command Prompt (Admin). You must run the command prompt in Administrator level.<br />
3.&nbsp;On the command prompt type <strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong> and hit enter.<br />
4.&nbsp;If everything went okay and no errors were found, restart your computer and see if the issue re-occurs.</span></span></p>

            <p>Dear Mr. Prasobh V,</p>
<p>I followed your instructions.&nbsp; The sfc /scannow ran without finding errors.&nbsp; I restarted the computer and now the situation is worse than before.&nbsp; Now when I left click on Start I get a blue box with the message: Critical Error, your start menu is not working.&nbsp;
 This is an error I got for many days, but recently it had stopped appearing, and for a while I even saw a few tiles of the Start menu.&nbsp; All that is gone now.</p>
<p>It seems clear that my Windows 10 is very sick and needs extensive interactive repair by an expert Technician.&nbsp; How can I get that sort of help?</p>

<h2>            Outer Wilds Mixpot</h2>
                    <p>Last year I watched the E3 Conference on Mixer. I immediately recieved all Mixpot rewards except the Outer Wilds Pre-order. A couple days later on June 18th, I recieved a message from Xbox Live saying the Pre-order was granted to my account. It never showed
 up in Ready to Install or My Games and Apps, and it doesn't show up in my Order History.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that the game is out, when I checked the store it says I can install through Game Pass or Buy to Own. It says I don't own the Game.
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>The game was suppose to be released last year but then it was canceled.&nbsp; The game was then released yesterday and people who recieve that code were able to be installed the game today.&nbsp; You really couldnt report the missing item because Xbox did announce
 the game was unavailable.&nbsp; However, when the game became available people who did recieve the code would still be able to redeem it.</p>

<h2>            Windows Shutdown Button Has Exclamation Point &#40;Installs Updates and Shuts Down Your Computer Rollover&#41; Everytime PC Boot Up.</h2>
                    <p>After about five minutes, after booting up, my Windows 7 Home Premium PC obtains a 'exclamation point (Installs Update and Shuts Down Your Computer rollover)' on the Shut Down button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This started happening, for the first time last week.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>'View Windows Update History' shows 'Status = Failed' for many 'Upgrade to Windows 10 Home' updates.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last failure is dated&nbsp;9/8/15, which I believe is when this problem started.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues with Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might have occurred due to some corruptions in Windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the methods.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to refer to the link given below and check.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ph/windows7/open-the-windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Open the Windows Update troubleshooter</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to <strong>reset Windows updates components</strong> and check if that helps.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971058</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: </strong>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>
<p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program
 in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality
 when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network,
 network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method 4: </strong>I would suggest you to perform a
<strong>SFC Scan</strong> and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Refer to the following link given below.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> While performing SFC Scan I would recommend you to make sure that there are no applications or programs running on the back ground.
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.

            <p>Hi Mayank,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I performed all four (4) of the 15-Sep suggested methods, and still I&nbsp;have the 'Explanation Point' on the Shutdown Button:</p>
<p>

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/52995064-2bec-4ce6-94bf-59093104f287" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot worked ok.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>SFC Scan showed 'no integrity violations'.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it you or anyone could provide assistance that would be great.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure why Windows thinks there are 'updates to load' per the Shutdown Button, and 'No Important Updates' via Windows Update.&nbsp;

            Perhaps this will solve the problem?<br />
If “Update for Microsoft Windows (KB3035583)” is in the list with the status message “successful” then GWX is installed on your PC.<br />
Remove the KB3035583, check whether or not both the folder /Windows/System32/GWX and the file GWX.exe in folder /Windows/SysWOW64 has disappeared.<br />
If not: delete these.<br />
In order to make sure Windows doesn’t install KB3035583 again with the next round of updates, uncheck “Give me recommended updates the same way I receive important updates” at "Choose how Windows can install updates".

<h2>            Music files that were deleted still show up in Windows Media Center</h2>
                    I deleted music from my laptop via the Zune program.&nbsp; The same music had migrated to Windows Media Player before deletion--no problem there.&nbsp; But, now the deleted songs show up when I open Media Player.&nbsp; File size indicates they're still there, but I can't
 play the songs if I wanted to.&nbsp; How do I delete these files from Windows Media Player.&nbsp; The right click-then-delete option does nothing.

<h2>            Skype to Go stopped working</h2>
                    I was using my Skype to go number for several years. Starting 2-3 weeks ago it is stopped working. Starting dial then in 1-2 seconds says call failed.&nbsp; I tried to find contact information for support&nbsp; but unfortunately I was unsuccessful. Is there any
 way to get support? Thank you.

<h2>            Scanning and Repairing Drive &#40;D&#58;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently when I turned on my desktop PC, it said "Scanning and Repairing Drive (D:). It's been running for
<strong>2 hours</strong> and is only at <strong>9%</strong>. It has done this before, but I let it pass, now I'm tired of it doing this. I have two hard drives, their both the same thing, same capacity, same brand. The weird thing is that I don't have
<strong>anything</strong> on that drive, so I would think if any hard drives need repairs, it would be the C drive. I have no idea why it could be doing this. My desktop is an HP Pavilion with the Windows 10 1709 update. Thanks!</p>

            There could be corrupted partition information on the drive.&nbsp; If you don't have anything of value on the drive, I'd recommend doing a full format (right-click the drive, choose format, and turn off the quick option).

<p>I had the same problem and found a fix which works for me... no more scanning and repairing at bootup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It involves a minor registry edit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open regedit and go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager and on the right side click on BootExecute and change autocheck autochk /k:c* to just autocheck autochk and then reboot and no more scanning and repairing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps you like it did me.</p>

<h2>            Video and Music Playback Issues After Windows 8.1 Upgrade - &#34;video could not be decoded&#34; &#38; &#34;an error has occurred&#34;.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Video and Music Playback Issues After Windows 8.1 Upgrade</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since installing the Windows 8.1 Upgrade, no video or audio files will play in any of the Start menu apps. &nbsp;Music files will just not play with a generic "an error has occurred" message, whereas video files of all types including those on websites will give
 me the error "video could not be decoded." &nbsp;This only occurs on Start menu apps, and online videos play fine on desktop web browsers. &nbsp;In what may be a related issue, Windows Media Player 12 is displaying the same errors when playing music or videos of all
 types. &nbsp;I'm not sure what software the Start menu apps use the decode audio and video, but this makes me think that the entire issue is Media Player. &nbsp;I was going to try to reinstall it, but I see no option either online or in the MS store app to redownload
 it. &nbsp;I have tried running the troubleshooter in Windows to fix the settings, but it does not work and actually gives me another "settings may not be correct" error. &nbsp;I haven't tried downloading a codec pack, since I don't know where to find a safe and reliable
 one. &nbsp;I'm running Windows 8.1 64 bit standard edition on a Dell desktop computer.</p>

<h2>            The ram was eaten away by the Windows upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Okay so, my mom has a Samsung Net book with the following specs&nbsp;</p>
<p>CPU: Intel Atom N550 1.50Ghz&nbsp;</p>
<p>GPU: Intel Graphics Media Accelerator</p>
<p>Ram: 2GB DDR2&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know stuff about PC's but the problem that happened was a thing i didn't have a clue of whats going on.</p>
<p>So! My mom had Windows 7 32 Bit, in the first place when she got her Net Book.After a year or so the Windows 10 Free upgrade thing started to swarm, and my mom upgraded to Windows 10 32 Bit, everything was alright (The system still had 1GB free ram).I used
 to play Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas on it without any problems.After 2 months on being on the very basic upgrade of Windows 10, the Windows got an update and the PC started working slower and slower with time, (GTA started going on 2 Frames per second) and
 when i opened up to check the performance of the Pc in the Task Manager, i saw that the system has only 400 Mega Bytes of free ram space.I know that a 32Bit system takes 1 Gigabyte of Ram space, and in my situation the ram is eated up and where did those 500
 Megabytes go?! &nbsp;I know i checked the PC back when it had the first version of Windows 10 and it had 1 Gigabyte of free RAM space, but now???</p>

<p>Hi Christian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The frame rate and performance of the game will depend on the specs of the computer. With the details that you provided to us, it seems that you need to update the graphic driver, and add more RAM on your computer in order for you to enjoy the game without
 experiencing any performance issue. In addition to this, the game that you're playing requires a minimum of 256MB of RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can refer to this article on how to improve the performance of your computer:

<p>Hi Marque!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying, but specs are not the problem here.GTA San Andreas ran at 30Fps on lowest settings, and no Gta SA requires 384 Megabytes (not 2 GB) to run. Here take a look&nbsp;https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/requirements/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/10289).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My graphics driver is updated to the max<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like you didn't quite understand my question, this is not the case of the game running on Windows 7 and then stopping to work on Windows 10, i played the game on Windows 10 and after an update install, the game stopped working properly.The computer
 had 1 Gigabyte occupied by the OS itself, (With Windows 7). After it upgraded to Windows 10 it stayed that way, (Only 1GB is occupied). And after an update that got installed,The pc totally broke, it started working slowly,programes stopped working properly
 and Additional 500 Mega Bytes went missing.</p>

<h3> jaikula_freedom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype and the Australian GST changes.</h2>
                    <p>I just received the email from Skype that from July 1st GST will be charged to Australian users of Skype. I would like to know just how something that is a digital platform is classed as importing such.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Australian Tax Office has stated the tax is just being extended to low value imports of
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">physical</span></strong> goods imported by consumers from 1st July 2018. Link is below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.ato.gov.au/General/New-legislation/In-detail/Indirect-taxes/GST/GST-on-low-value-imported-goods/&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to that there is no need to be charging any additional amounts to Australians for product that arent physically being imported in, such as a digital service such as Skype. We already pay enough in Australia for products from overseas in a digital
 medium, but now are going to be ripped off more with a tax that isnt applying to online digital mediums.<br />

<p>What I don't understand though is why do I have to pay 10% GST and also 3% to St George VISA to convert Euros to AUD. If I am going to pay an extra 13%, I might as well dump Skype and look for alternatives.</p>

    <title>Is there a way to disable automatic update in Windows 10 Home - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doppiabeo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a way to disable automatic update in Windows 10 Home edition&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm facing many troubles every time Microsoft releases an update.</p>
<p>Sometime happens that I leave my computer running for some days and, the most frequent problem is that they shut down my working environment with many virtual machines running, over night, without asking me first if I want to save my job and quit, or just
 wait for me to come back to check.</p>
<p>Other problems are related with the glitches and bugs shipped with the forced updates.</p>
<p>This last one, 1709, for example, is packed with kernel panics and video cards issues (nevere experienced this before).</p>
<p>I'm quite good keeping up to date with security by myself, I just like to decide if I should risk or not.</p>
<p>I looked for solutions and I just found many different theories, but everything seems to me just an ugly workaround.</p>
<p>I cannot&nbsp;believe there's no official way to achieve this, that's why I'm asking here.</p>
<p>Please I don't want to kill this definitively from my internet AP.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>

            Hi doppiabeo, there are 3 steps required to stop Windows 10 Automatic Updates:
<br />
<br />1.
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />Go to Accounts - Sign-in Options
<br />Choose to sign in with a Local Account rather than a Microsoft Account.
<br />
<br />2.
<br />In the Settings App
<br />Go to Network and Internet
<br />Set your WiFi connection as Metered
<br />
<br />3.
<br />Click your Start Button, type services and hit ENTER 
<br />Scroll down the list of services to find Windows Update 
<br />Double click the service 
<br />If it has started, click 'Stop' 
<br />Then you must set its startup type to 'Disabled' - 'Manual' will not do! 
<br />Restart your PC 
<br />
<br />That's It!       
        </p>

            I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can set your connection as Metered and it will stop WIndows Updates and all background services.  <a href="http://www.windowscentral.com/how-set-ethernet-connection-metered-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowscentral.com/how-set-ethernet-...</a>

<br />
<br />Then what I'd do is whenever the latest version Update is released twice a year wait until it is determined to be stable (you can ask here), go to a PC with an unlimited connection and create bootable media for your version using the Media Creation Tool, bring it back and plug it in, open to run it from the desktop to bring you fully up to date with the latest version and all updates.    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Otherwise you can periodically plug in the PC to an unlimited connection to turn off Metered connection and run Updates, hiding any you dont' want using the Hide Updates tool here:   <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Option 1:
<br />
<br />Set your Internet connection as metered:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows-10-data-usage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Use Active Hours and Restart options:

<br />
<br />Option 3: 
<br />
<br />Use Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update:
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />Option 4:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Windows Update
<br />Select it then right click it
<br />Click Properties
<br />Under the General tab, choose Startup type to DIsabled
<br />Click Stop
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Option 5: upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which lets you block updates for up to 8 months and pause Windows Update for up to 35 days.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation
<br />Click the link ‘Go to the store to upgrade or enter a product key’
<br />Click the $99 button to make your purchase (the price might vary by region or depending on the edition you are upgrading from or upgrading to).
<br />Follow the on screen instructions to make your purchase.
<br />Within 5 to 10 minutes, your system will be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro, your personal files, apps and settings preserved. 
<br />You won’t get a product key, you get a digital license, which is attached to your Microsoft Account used to make the purchase.

<p>There would be several problems I could foresee:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Licensing. This could be a problem, especially if group within the party were in several different counties.</p>
<p>2. Not everyone has the same taste in music. Imagine someone getting on and starts blaring "Baby Shark" in a group of metal heads.</p>
<p>3. Not a great idea for games where communication is key.</p>

            <p>Hello Alec,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the game doesn't run even after trying in compatibility mode. Then you need to contact the&nbsp;Game support&nbsp;or check online for the latest version of the game so that it can run on Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need more information let us know. We are always happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
