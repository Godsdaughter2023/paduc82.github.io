<h2>            Microsoft Office 2013 Install, Word not working, Uninstall, Reinstall Not working</h2>
                    This has to be the the most frustrating thing I've ever encountered. Initially, the installation process for Office 2013 was easy, easier than most other forms of Office. Then, my Word wasn't working. I would type several letters and it would say that
 the program was being installed still, which I thought was already taken care of while Office was installed...which led me to go here, and see that other people encountered the SAME issue, and the response was to install the FixIt app to uninstall the program.
 This, like the installation, was very simple and quick, and now I want to reinstall it. So, in order to do that, I went back to the MyOffice website, selected install under my account, and tried to do it. Unfortunately, I keep getting an error screen saying
 something went wrong, "Sorry we ran into a problem," without ANY sort of reason explained.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I really hope this can be fixed back to normal, since I would like to start doing some work with the excellent interface that I have. Please let me know how to fix this. Thanks.<br />

            Welcome to the world of MS "click to run", aka "Office 365 ..."<br />
<br />
Point 1: with a CTR installation there are 2 things a user can do to "fix" problems, do an Office Repair or uninstall/reinstall.<br />
<br />
Point 2: you've already learned that the Fix It tool in <span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</a></span>&nbsp;&nbsp; provides a better / cleaner uninstall than the default uninstall<br />
<br />
Point 3: that "sorry we ran into ...." message is something that a LOT of people are getting. I have not seen a definitive fix from MS.<br />
<br />
Point 4: the CRT "installation" is actually partial.&nbsp; The initial install only gives you stub programs quickly that are enough to start the program while more code is downloaded to your machine.&nbsp; Advanced features only get downloaded as you use them.&nbsp; So, unlike
 a local install, with a CTR you are almost never finished "downloading and installing".
<br />
<br />
Bottom line, you have 2 options. Keep on trying to install until it works, or try phoning MS for help (which they don't seem to be able to give right now ... &lt;sigh&gt; )<br />
<br />
Sorry.<br />

<h2>            How to copy paste Skype conversation neatly into word document like the old Skype or export the latest conversation history&#63;</h2>
                    <div>In the old Skype 7.41, we used to be able to copy paste the conversation nicely and paste them in a word document, they would look like this: "[timestamp/date] username: message". However, in the new Skype, the copy pasted text from the conversation will
 just show as "username", [timestamp]PMmessage or [timestamp]message (my own message), I don't really like how it works (the new Skype method).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone know if there's any way to copy paste conversation from the conversation window nicely and neatly into a word document in a more organized and neat looking format, just like the old version of Skype? Or any neat way to export our conversation
 history to a word document/file? Unfortunately, the current export feature only exports conversation history up to the date the old Skype was discontinued.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The new format of copy/pasting them in a word document looks quite messy and undesirable. I hope Skype does something about this as it's important for me to be able to export/copy paste/backup our conversation history so that it won't get lost.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I understand that this seems to be like a duplicate of my another thread but I'm reposting since no action has been taken by Skype after many months and my thread had been locked for some reason.</div>

            Hi JEFFREY_987,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Latest Skype doesn't provide the Chat Export facility. This is one of the highest demanding features. 
<br />
<br />As a workaround, Click on that contact on left side to display all conversations on right side. Do CTRL+A to select all messages in the conversation. CTRL+C to copy and CTRL+V to paste in Word.
<br />
<br />You will not get good formatting but you will have chats.
<br />
<br />But if messages are limited in number in your conversation, below is the process to get excellent formatting. 
<br />
<br />On right side in conversation, right click on any message and click Select Messages.
<br />Now you will notice circles against all messages on right side.
<br />You will need to select all circles or limited circles to export. This is where my point of message is limited in number as there is no option to select all circles. You will have to select circle one by one.
<br />Now at the bottom, you have Copy enabled. Click that and now paste into Word.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.       
        </p>

            I appreciate your reply and it's a bit helpful. I think it is quite bothersome/difficult to select each message individually for copy pasting/exporting into word document, and Ctrl+A copy paste method formating is too messy. I hope Skype makes it feasible
 to copy/paste/export Skype conversation history into a word document easily and neatly just like the old Skype in the future.

            I am not really very satisfied even if we are able to export/copy paste our Skype conversation history through the "Select messages" option because it doesn't include the date of the conversations, which is missing information and inconvenient. I would
 appreciate it if Skype can take this feedback/suggestion too. The formatting needs to be neat and complete, including details such as the date, just like the old Skype.

    <title>Connect a Nokia N73 to a PC in the year 2013&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Connect a Nokia N73 to a PC in the year 2013&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi!<br />
<br />
I have a Nokia N73 on my desk which keeps rebooting at random intervals. This used to be my phone but I gave it away to my brother. He has been using it for about a year without any problems. He did drop it once on the pavemen and the plastic screen protector
 got a crack. But the screen itself was not broken and it still worked. This was a long time ago. So I don't think it's anyhow related. But I'm letting you know anyway. It was only lately that it started rebooting itself, as if it has a mind of its own.<br />
<br />
Now, given that I am the previous owner of this phone I know its history. I know that the "power on power off" issue has been plaguing N73 users as early as 2007/2008, when this was only a 1 year old model. So this is not a new issue. But I have never experienced
 this issue with mine. I guess it was just a matter of time, a ticking bomb if you will, before the error manifests. Now I know what that looks like.<br />
<br />
So I'm thinking this is most probably a software/firmware issue. So I want to try to reset this thing and watch what happens, which brings me to the main problem here. Since this is an old model it's hard to do anything with this thing due to Nokias continued
 lack of support for old models.<br />
<br />
I installed Nokia Suite 3.8.48 on Windows 8.1. I then connected the phone with a USB cable. I chose "PC Suite" option on the phone. Then I got this stupid error.<br />
<br />
<strong>USB device not recognized</strong></p>
<p><br />
So I thought that it was missing some drivers and that the Nokia Suite did not install it for me, for whatever the reason. So I googled it and found the Nokia Connectivity Cable Driver (7.1.182.0). I disconnected the phone, installed the driver, connected the
 phone again, and still the same error came up. I tried repairing the driver installation and it did not help.<br />
<br />
<strong>So what do I do now? Can I expect any help from Nokia with this issue?</strong> I am not asking for much. All I ask for is some bits of software so I can help myself. The least Nokia can do in my opinion is to host their previous software releases on
 their website. Yes, I mean the old PC Suite, Ovi Suite, Nokia Suite, etc. I don't ask them to continue supporting it and updating it if it's discontinued or deprecated software. And of course, since it's closed source it's impossible for other folks to continue
 the development. But the least they can do is host previous releases. I much rather download an EXE from Nokia than from some funny place like Banana Island or whatever...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And what about those software updates? When you google "nokia software update" the first thing you find is the main page for the various flavors of Nokia software suites where you click on the type of device you have (Symbian, Windows, et. al.) and it takes
 you to the download link for the EXE for Nokia Suite (in case of Symbian). But there are never any download links for the actual phone firmware/software/OS upgrades. The software suite grabs the appropriate file or files and installs it automatically. But
 what if you need to do this sh** manually? Or what if you want to keep a deposit of previously released phone software/firmware? Obviously Nokia won't host old phone software indefinitely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it's not like they do their best to make the new "PC SUITE, aka. OVI SUITE, aka NOKIA SUITE, aka "SOMETHING" SUITE, fully compatible with old phone models. So users with old Nokia products would have to use some of the old software tools, tools that
 Nokai no longer supports, nor hosts or links to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What if you want to downgrade from a current version to a previous version? I'm not sure the automatic software update even still works on these old handsets (e.g. Nokia N73, et. al.) and what do you do in that case? What if you just need to reflash the
 phone with the same firmware that's already onboard? The answer is: you won't be able to! The software suite will only check for new versions, and if no new versions are found (obviously, since it's an old product for which there is no more development) it
 won't present any firmware/software at all to be flashed to the phone. Great!... just f****** brilliant! Or not...<br />
<br />
The main reason why I need the Nokia Suite is obviously because I don't want to loose any data. I would have used it to create a full backup of the phone. So much for plan A, and I don't have a plan B. This totally sucks...<br />
<br />
So what's with the "Nokia Suite" anyway? What happened to the "Ovi Suite"? Last time I held a Nokia phone in my hands it was called Ovi Suite and it had replaced the "PC Suite". I'm guessing you guys are having trouble deciding on how to name your software?...
 The Nokia Suite looks a lot like the Ovi Suite to me...<br />
<br />
Can this thing do a full blown backup of the phone? The Nokia Suite? If not, I wont' waste my time with it. It doesn't allow me to click anywhere. I can't click on the View, Sync or Tools menus. So I can't explore its functionality. Not until I manage to connect
 a phone to it. This sucks... it reminds me of why I moved away from Nokia in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>Nokia Suite&nbsp;3.8.48 is not compatible with Windows 8.1</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I installed Nokia Suite 3.8.48 on my old Windows Vista PC and it worked! So I conclude that the damn thing is not compatible with the latest re-incarnation of the Windows 8 system, namely 8.1. For whatever the reason it just didn't like my Windows 8.1 computer
 very much. It's clearly a compatibility issue on some level. It's a brand new computer by the way, it's a desktop PC, custom built, with a clean genuine install of WIndows 8.1. I installed it myself from the retail box (full version). No issues with it whatsoever,
 no software issues, BSOD issues... nothing... up until now. Installing the Nokia Suite software from the same installer file worked very well on my old Windows Vista computer. No need to install any additional drivers! It just worked! All device drivers installed
 properly when I connected the phone. <em>And Microsoft wants to discontinue Vista in favor of Windows 8.1... I hate those muppets.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know I've read that Nokia Suite 3.8.48 is Windows 8 compatible, I think I read it in the FAQ, but there were no specifics about whether that means 8.0 only or 8.0 AND 8.1. So it's a guesswork! And my guess is that it's compatible with Windows 8.0 but not
 with Windows 8.1. Even though I know that the changes between them are slim, if any. But don't blame me for that, blame Microsoft! I'm sure Microsoft wishes that Windows 8.0 never had happened! Just like they are wishing that Windows Vista never had happened!
 It shows, by their decision to drop Windows Vista support on most recent Microsoft software products. Windows 7 will follow the same fate. I'm sure they just wish they could pull the switch on every previous OS version, starting from XP, through Vista, 7 and
 Windows 8, and make everyone upgrade to the retarded Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The worst thing is... Nokia has partnered with Microsoft... what good can possibly come out of that?... There's a rumor that Nokia is working on an Android phone, known as Normandy project, or AoL (Asha on Linux). Yeah right! That will probably happen in...
 oh well... maybe in 100 years or so. You're way too late to the Android party. Nokia shot itself in the head when they decided to push forward with the Symbian OS and later the MeeGo. Then they started flirting with Microsoft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would hate to work at a company that has no clear vision of the future and no strong leadership. I pity you Nokia. What happened to you?... you used to be cool. I guess it's what happens to every company that refuses to adapt to changes and doesn't do
 it quick enough. You either swim or you sink. Nokia decided to sink. Not only did they sink, they sunk to Microsofts level of incompetence... I guess in a way... you guys deserve each other.</p>

            Hi Jeremy,<br />
<br />
No, we can’t access others’ analytics in Delve. From the article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Microsoft-MyAnalytics-personal-dashboard-c52d090c-a4fc-478c-b027-757ed86d5993?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft MyAnalytics personal dashboard</a>, we can see that only you have access to your MyAnalytics dashboard. MyAnalytics does not include any settings that provide your manager or anyone else in your organization access to your dashboard.
<br />
<br />
In addition, some of your data is used to calculate aggregate statistics, which are shown to other MyAnalytics users. Examples are the average time people in your organization spend reading and writing email, or how much time they spend in meetings. You can
 choose to opt out of your data being used to calculate these aggregate statistics. To opt out of MyAnalytics, we can go to Settings &gt; Feature settings &gt; Off for MyAnalytics &gt; OK.
<br />
<br />
Your understanding is highly appreciated. <br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t register a Microsoft account on a Windows phone 7.5</h2>
                    Hi, I had to hard reset my LG e900 (Windows phone 7.5) and now it seems that there is no way to register my previous or a new Microsoft account, so that several existing features are no longer possible (for example onedrive). I understand that WP 7.5 is
 no longer supported, but at least Microsoft should allow existing users to reset their phones without losing the existing features (for what they have already paid!). Do you have some solution for registering my Microsoft account (or at least a new one) on
 my phone? Or did Microsoft completely shut off their servers? Thank you

<h2>            Problems with File Explorer hanging intermittently</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hi everyone, I have been experiencing a hanging in my file explorer windows
 and file explorer only. This is very notable seeing as it happens every couple seconds and makes for a very frustrating game of navigating my files. I am using the Windows 10 Technical Preview right now but I'm not sure if this is the issue. If I remember
 correctly, this was happening before I installed 10 from 8.1. Also, I have a small hunch it may be due to the hard drive but obviously I am not sure. Thanks so much! Any feedback is appreciated.</span>

                    <p>I have had ongoing issues with connecting Outlook.com to Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For everything from Outlook.com to connect (email AND calendar), I have to use an @outlook.com account.&nbsp; I don't use @outlook.com and have an Alias.&nbsp; But, when I try to use the Alias to connect the two, it doesn't want to connect the calendar.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I can not use the auto setup feature and have to set it up through IMAP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something here?&nbsp; Why is it between two MS products is this not easy to set up?&nbsp; I'm losing my mind with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>
In order to add Outlook.com to Outlook (Desktop), I have to use @outlook.com account and I can not use my Alias.&nbsp; If I use my alias, the email comes over but the calendar does not.&nbsp; I have to use IMAP account settings only.&nbsp; Nothing else works for me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I've had to do, but again I don't use @outlook.com and I do not want to start.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To connect Outlook.com to 2016, I am currently using @outlook.com but every email I send I then have to adjust to my Alias account (and signature) before sending, which if I further want to do an email merge then I can not do this and every merged email
 will be sent using @outlook.com.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook.com, I have two accounts featured.&nbsp; The Alias, which is the email I want to use, and @Outlook.comm which is the one I never want to use.&nbsp;

<h2>            How to copy&#47;move an item to a shared folder in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I deleted a contact from a shared folder by mistake. It's in my deleted folder and now I want to move it back to the original shared folder. When I try the move to folder option it only shows local folders. For some reason outlook hates the idea of sharing
 stuff.&nbsp;I've already had issues with not being able to add shared contacts folder to the address book.</p>
<p>Can someone please tell me how to move it to the shared folder?</p>

            Can you drag it to the shared folder?  Or move it to your folder, then drag to the shared if that is easier.

            check the condition of your SIM card, and also if you are able to connect to the Nokia Store using WiFi, and that your data access point settings for your network carrier are defined correctly.

</p><p>I have installed the SDP but nothing.&nbsp; It says that "Windows Store configuration might be damaged" but I am still unable to effectively uninstall the apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, I am logged in with a local administrator account, not with the Microsoft one.</p>

            If you switch from using the start menu to the start screen and uninstall the apps you don't want&nbsp;from there it should work fine.<br />
<br />
Edit: It also looks like uninstalling and then restarting works to remove ghost Start Menu entries. (&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_tp-winapps/app-uninstall/f91f5711-d4ba-4415-9378-2ff47fa44935" title="Answer from MC-3">Link</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;)<br />

It is an inconvenience, but it's something they are working on. This is an early preview not everything is going to work at this very moment.

            <p>It is an Option setting. There are actually 3 ways of changing this setting. They are all described in this article:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://tduhameau.wordpress.com/2012/09/27/the-beauty-of-the-r1c1-reference-style/</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>Three Options in Excel 2010:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to File \ Options \ Formula \ Working with Formulas, Check R1C1 reference style (this is the long way)</li><li>Open Visual Basic Editor (Alt + F11), open an Immediate window (Ctrl+G), type application.ReferenceStyle=xlR1C1, Enter. This is the quick, easy fix. To reverse, type application.ReferenceStyle=xla1 and Enter</li><li>Put the following macro in your workbook, and add a button for it in your Quick Access toolbar, it’s well worth it.</li></ol>
<p>Sub Shift_R1C1_A1()<br />
If application.ReferenceStyle = xlR1C1 Then<br />
application.ReferenceStyle = xlA1<br />
Else<br />
application.ReferenceStyle = xlR1C1<br />
End If<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ignore that it is for 2010, they still apply to 2013. </p>

            <p>When you start Excel and open the first file, every file opened after the first file will have the same reference style as of first file. Hence, if you have opened R1C1 reference style file first, all subsequent files opened will be R1C1 only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ways to revert to A1 has already been described by <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/65cbbc40-d6eb-4868-91d3-ff696c7e5d35" title="Rohn007">
Rohn007</a>. Only thing is that Macro can be reduced to one line only for toggling between reference styles -</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 for mac - unable to sync Gmail</h2>
                    <p>I'm having trouble syncing gmail with outlook 2016 for mac. Since I use 2-factor authentication, I've used the Gmail App password to Add an account in Outlook. After initially syncing and downloading messages, I'm unable to get new messages (primary as well
 as labels). I've tried removing and adding the account multiple times (with new app passwords) but that hasn't helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of note, at the bottom of my outlook pane, I see "INBOX: Determining changes..." and the blue bar doesn't seem to finish. It's "Connected to: Gmail" during this time. Maybe that's linked to the problem.</p>

            <span>Hi Vengeance_41,<br />
<br />
As you said the initial syncing is well, that could mean the configurations you have entered are correct. After that, the syncing of new emails stopped. So please firstly let us know if the size of Gmail mailbox is too large.<br />
<br />
Then I’d like to confirm the following details to further investigate this issue:<br />
1. How did you add the account into Outlook for Mac, via IMAP mode?<br />
2. If you click to check sync status and sync failures, does that contain some detailed error message? If so, please send the error message to us for further analysis.
<br />
3. The detailed Outlook for Mac version. You can check this by clicking Outlook-&gt;About Outlook on the top tool bar.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yang</span>

            <span>Hi Vengeance_41,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply. I noticed that you have about 50000 emails in your mailbox. That means your mailbox size is too large. The Inbox syncs more frequently than any other and should be kept as clean as possible. So if you have many emails in the inbox folder
 or have many subfolders under the inbox folder, the syncing of new emails will be slow. So I would suggest you try to reduce the size the mailbox and
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-profiles-in-Outlook-2016-for-Mac-fed2a955-74df-4a24-bef6-78a426958c4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
rebuild a new profile</a> in Outlook for Mac to see if the issue can be resolved.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, I would collect the Outlook for Mac log for further troubleshooting. You can refer to the article below to turn on logging and find the location of the log file;<br />

<p>Just below Rule 3, you'll see a calendar of the future monthly giveaways. Notice April winner will not be drawn until May 10, 2017.</p>

If it is supposed to be a plug and play device, I would unplug it, reboot the computer and then try plugging it in again, possibly in a different port.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>It is is not plug and play, you may need to contact the manufacturer/visit the manufacturer's website to obtain a driver for it.</p>

<p>Hi Trudy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For us to identify if this is an issue with the file, we need to confirm some information. Please answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did you first encounter this issue?</li><li>Are you receiving any error messages when you tried to open files in Excel?</li><li>Are you encountering this issue only with Excel or does it happen to other Office application such as Word, PowerPoint?</li><li><span>Have you made any recent changes to the computer prior to the issue?</span></li></ul>
<p><br />
Meanwhile, we suggest that you disable all add-ins. Many security programs includes "ad-blocking" protection. Go through your security programs currently running and check &amp; disable any ad-blocking feature, web blocking, antivirus etc. feature.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't work, try to save the files to the local drive and then in the File Explorer. Right-click on it and then click on Properties and check the Unblock box. After that, use File &gt; Open in Excel and see if you can open the file.
</p>
<p>

<p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first encountered this problem yesterday, the 9th November.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No error message received - excel opens up but nothing happens.&nbsp; I have had this problem through my dropbox as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems to be on Excel at present, as this is the only program I am using - I will try with word</p>
<p>
</p><p>No changes have been made to computer recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try the unblocking option in the meantime until I hear back from someone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for the reply.</p>

    <title>N95 Software upgrade problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> naap19  say:</h3>
<h2>            N95 Software upgrade problem</h2>
                    I was doing a software update for my N95 connected to a PC through USB. The download was complete &amp; when it was installing the software, the phone got switched off. Since the instruction in the beginning said that the phone will restart during the installation,
 I did not bother. But after sometime the software up grader gave a message that my phone is not responding. When I tried to switch on the phone manually its not responding. Then I disconnected the USB, removed the battery &amp; tried starting again. But the power
 gets on without any display. Can you please guide me on this ?
