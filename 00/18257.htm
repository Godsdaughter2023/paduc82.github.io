<p>Hi vivekhappy8,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How often do you experience this problem? Does it happen randomly? Can you try to press and hold the power button and volume down key for 10 seconds and see if it will improves. Also, check if you have software updates by going to the phone's Settings then
 go to Phone updates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I also bought a brand new Lumia 520 in last month. In the beginning day onwards I'm facing the same problem with my Lumia phone. I fed up with this phone. I've&nbsp;called several times to the Nokia customer care. They suggested&nbsp;me to press and hold
 the Volume down key, Power key and Camera key for a while, The same reply only I could receive from the customer care for all my queries. I tried the same many times, but it couldn't rectified the problem. At last I directly went to Nokia care, after a long
 time of two hours waiting I reached to an executive and handed over my lumia to him with a slip which they provided for mention my address and the complaint of mobile. They told me to wait 2 more hours time at their sight. after the time they've instructed
 I met the same executive. Then they told me that the phone is showing problem hence will be returned back after one working day. The next working day I collected the phone from them but the surprise that the problem was not rectified by them. The problem still
 persisting in my phone. Exactly I dont know what to do. could anyone help me to solve the issue.</p>

<h2>            Invalid MIME content with outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>I am using a MAC with Outlook 2011 against the new outlook.com (preview) version that is like an exchange server.&nbsp; I have two MAC computers that starting failing to send a message to my outlook.com account. Both are fully upgraded and patched as of 9/13/2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error is "Invalid MIME content." and the message is moved to my drafts folder with Error Code - 19789</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again this is on two systems. I deleted all contacts from the outlook account. And I still the same error on both systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is something on the server side and most likely because of the migration from the old "outlook.com" to the new (preview) version of "outlook.com".</p>

    <title>Contacts in Hotmail won&#39;t sync down to Lumia 900 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kiril rachev  say:</h3>
<h2>            Contacts in Hotmail won&#39;t sync down to Lumia 900</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I deleted / re-added a Gmail account and with that lost all gmail contacts... The new email+accounts interface for gmail doesn't have the check-box to sync calendar, contacts, etc. which I understand is a consequence from Google no longer supporting
 certain protocols. So based on the MS on-line articles for contact migration I have moved the gmail contacts into my primary windows live account (using app called gSync even though this can be done directly from the People browser window when logged to outlook.com)
 and with that expected these contacts to automatically be pushed down to my phone. However, this doesn't happen and when I open the windows live account I see that it has only one check box for syncing emails.. no Contacts check box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea as to why contrary to all recommendations adding the contacts to the outlook.com and connecting that account to the phone, doesn't sync the contacts? Is it because they are 'sourced' from a 'linked' account? If so, it truly defeats
 the purpose of 'importing' contacts into Windows Live.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some additional testing:</p>
<p>1) added a new Windows live contact on my phone. after saving it immediately appeared on outlook.com. so it looks like connection from phone to the cloud operates.</p>
<p>2) created a new windows live account and loaded to it the gmail contacts. Then added this account to the phone and this time during setup I had the contacts check box available. So I checked it and let the phone sync. Again, nothing happened and contacts
 were not pushed to the phone. I tried checking all other check boxes (email, calendar) hit sync, and again no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When doing the setup I'd occasionally reboot the phone in the hopes that this fluke will go away.. Didn't help either. The only thing I haven't tried yet is to do phone reset and the reason being is that I don't want to lose my apps since I don't see any
 options to back them up in the Lumia 900, either through zune or from the phone directly (even oneDrive doesn't have this option). Unlike this is easily done with iPhone..</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Lumia has the latest version of the OS, win phone 7.8. Got about 8GB of free storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help and ideas are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>- Kiril</p>

            <p>Hello Kiril:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the follow up.&nbsp; It is indeed interesting that these contacts are not appearing in the .csv file you export.&nbsp; I am not sure about things on the back end that might cause this.&nbsp; Surely seems as if there is some sort of formatting or compatibility
 issue.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is something I have not seen before with Gmail contacts.&nbsp; At this point the only thing I can suggest is to take a closer look at the contacts on the Gmail side of things and see if you can find what may be causing this disconnect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally do not use Gmail so excuse my ignorance in the following thoughts and suggestions.&nbsp; The next thing I would consider doing is trying to export the contacts to a .csv file through the gmail account.&nbsp; I would then review the contacts in this file.&nbsp;
 Compare this to the .csv file you exported from the Outlook account.&nbsp; Are you able to spot any differences?&nbsp; Look for different columns being used, different formatting, etc...&nbsp; If you can find something, see if you can edit one of the contacts, import and
 then re-export from Outlook to see if anything has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this time I am afraid the only other thought I would have would be to manually add the contacts to the Outlook account.&nbsp; I know that is not a great suggestion and I will certainly continue to try and find other options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark W.</p>

<h2>            Build 9926&#58;  Photos App Allows No Organization Customization</h2>
                    <p>The Photos App in Build 9926 gives us no way to customize how our photos are organized. &nbsp;Just like I don't want "All Apps" on the Start Button Menu to be organized alphabetically, I don't want all my photos organized chronologically. &nbsp;My photos are nicely
 organized by subject in my file hierarchy. &nbsp;That's how I want to see them in the app. &nbsp;Yet, I'm given no option to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, we need full access to our photos' metadata. &nbsp;Specific to this report, we should be able to organize our photo by any of that metadata (I'm looking at people and place tags).</p>

<h2>            Hotmail junk out of control - invalid senders able to send mail&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wondering if anyone knows why Microsoft is not improving the junk filter to reduce spam that is received, such as by blocking invalid email headers. For example, I get so many emails that have an email header like this:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&lt;"&lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;"&gt;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This is not a valid header, and Hotmail could prevent so much spam by filtering out these
 kinds of headers. Any way to get Microsoft to be take notice of the amount of spam and improve the spam filtering?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thanks and regards,</span></p>

<p>I am having the same problem.&nbsp; Just this last week I started getting over 100 junk mails a day and it takes awhile to go through them to make sure I don't delete emails that I need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have added email addresses to me "safe" lists, but they still appear in my junk mail folder.&nbsp; I have continuously either attempted to block unsolicited emails or sweep them is they appear in my inbox, but it sure doesn't seem to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There also needs to be some easier method to add addresses to your safe list.&nbsp; Why can't we just highlight the address using the right mouse key click on it and have a list of acceptable actions, like "add to safe list" or "add to blocked list" etc.?&nbsp; It
 would be so much nicer and easier to use Outlook.&nbsp; I have tried other email services, but I like Outlook the best, but if I keep going the way I am, I will be forced to find another provider and get use to their way of doing things.</p>

 mails, I keep getting them every day.&nbsp; Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions to help me out?</p>

<p>Hi Acelyn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How does your suggestion address the issue of junk that I've reported? It would seem there is a misunderstanding of the issue I've raised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding recipients to the Safe Senders list does not address the number of junk emails that are being delivered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is what I've received overnight. This is out of control! Surely, Microsoft has better junk mail control...</p>

<p>That is not my problem.&nbsp; My problem is having up to 50 junk email daily.&nbsp; Most are usually the same message three or more times.&nbsp; I have entered them into the "block" choice, but still get them.&nbsp; I am adding 30 or more each day to the "block" but it doesn't
 seem to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another note, I have added email addresses to my "safe sender" lists but they keep showing up in my junk email.&nbsp; I try to add them again and I'm told they are already on my safe sender list.&nbsp; It is getting very frustrating, not alone irritating and time
 consuming for me each day.&nbsp; Today seemed to be a short day, only 45 emails in my "junk mail" file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There needs to be a better way to attack these junk mail senders.&nbsp; I have done everything that I can think of accept make myself a new email account and delete my current one.&nbsp; This will be painful as many of my creditors rely on having my correct email
 address on file and I'm afraid that if I try a new account I will miss notifying some of them without realizing it.&nbsp; I am in the proverbial rock and a hard place and need some help.&nbsp; Can you do that for me?</p>

<p>We completely understand you Max. If you have already performed all the steps provided above and you're still receiving bulk of Junk emails and already out of control, we suggest that you send an email and forward an attachment on what's happening on your
 Junk email to <strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong>. Include any relevant info, such as the number of times you've received messages from the account and the relationship, if any, between you and the sender.

<p>
</p><p>It reminds me of the old saying about throwing the baby out with the bath water ... one is supposed to take care that the baby is not only cared for during the bath, but safely removed from the bath and provided for before the bath water is thrown out.

</p><p>After each preview build (or other OS, for that matter) is installed, cleaned up, and arranged the way you want it, you should make a disk image type backup (it takes 10 minutes, or less), to be saved on another hard drive (not just another partition on
 the same hard drive). You should keep on hand the the disk image of that build as well as the most recent prior two, and one of the last build released to the public, and the rescue disk made by the disk imaging program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, when your hard drive suddenly fails (they all fail, eventually, and sometimes, suddenly), or your current OS build is destroyed by whatever, you can restore either that build, or a recent previous one in 10 minutes or less, and be back in operation.
 It's also good practice to occasionally restore to the last publicly released build and update it with all the cumulative updates, as well as updating all your installed programs, then return to your latest build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At my place, when a hard drive fails, we lose a total of about 30 minutes, and no data.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows Defender wants me to send a file to &#34;help&#34; determine if it&#39;s malicious -- But it&#39;s a personal letter&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I'm new to Windows Defender, having given up on McAfee because of issues it has with Windows 8. Every hour or so, WD tells me that it wants to send a file to MS to analyze it to "help" it determine if it's malicious.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The file is usually a pdf file I created long ago, among the records of my business correspondence. I'm not about to start sending MS copies of my personal or business correspondence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What gives with this, and how do I address this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>If this is a personal file with private information, then it's completely appropriate to say no and that's why it asks rather than just sending it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you read the privacy Policy found at the link in the Settings, MAPS configuration screen in Windows Defender, it explains exactly what is sent to MAPS automatically and what is instead requested as optional as in this case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this were some unknown or system file I'd just send it off without any concern, but even I would choose not to send something&nbsp;containing important personal information.&nbsp; Just realize that the more information Microsoft receives about real malware, the
 better they can determine how to respond in the future in a more automated way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if the file is just a copy of something you can download off the internet anyway, I'd personally always allow this to upload if requested.</p>

            <p>If it looks like there is nothing happening you could cancel the uninstall. When it is working correctly uninstalling any Office package should take less than 5 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to download and run the relevant "Fix It" tools from the link that Sagnik provided. It will do a more thorough job of deleting everything related with the older Office versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you finish doing all of your Office uninstalls you should do an Office Repair of your remaining Office installation, to fix up any registry references that were still pointing to the old versions.</p>

            Have you ckecked how much memory is devoted to your Messages? If you have recently received anything sent to you by bluetooth it iss very likely it is sitting there eating up your aavailable phone memory. I had this issue (15 Mb of pdf files) that I finally
 found and deleted. Now I am back to 89 Mb unused memory.

            What I mean is RAM not phone memory. I always delete all massages from bluetooth after be opened or saved. RAM BOOSTER from emobi?? I've tried it but it's not too much helping to free up my RAM. Is it any hiden apps or process that save to be closed or
 killed to make ram more better.

<p>Hey use the mobile guard netqin, it is available in ovi store. Its a good handy tool. After running a OS scan from the menu, it'll u give u information about all the start-up items and programs that use much memory. Using this application, you can also clear
 cache and temp file which is difficult to do manually. U can kill unwanted processes.</p>

<p>I don't see what the problem is. You seem to have plenty of RAM available..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course running multiple applications will make everything slower, but this is (at least in your case) more to do with the CPU than with the amount of RAM.</p>

<h2>            Samsung Omnia 7 screen turned blue&#47;grey</h2>
                    <p>The screen of my Samsung Omnia 7 has suddenly stopped working.</p>
<p>SUddenly, while using it yesterday, the screen stopped working as I was using the phone, and showed "a million" thin horizontal lines with different colors.</p>
<p>Now, 12 hours laer, the symptoms have slightly changed. All colors and contrasts have gone, and the entire screen is a blueish grey (except for the ftop ~5 millimeters of the screen, which look normal). When tilting the phone to the right angle, I am just
 able to make out the contours of the letters/icons, so that I can enter the correct pin code. But it is impossible to read text messages, emails etc., so for all practical purposes, the phone is useless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am able to turn the phone on and off, but on some of the attempts on turning it on, it simply shuts itself right down again before I am prompted to enter the SIM PIN.</p>

            <p>Sounds like a hardware failure with the screen.</p>
<p>You could try pulling the battery out for a few minutes, then putting it back in. The might reset the electronics to sort it out. Otherwise my guess is it's a call to your local Samsung service centre.</p>

            Well your phone can't send messages itself so I'd contact your network about it. You may need to get the firmware on your phone updated depending why the network is sending these messages.

<p>As an "advisor", it would seem to me that, you, would be in touch with Microsoft , and had given to them, this issue. Had you done that , or extended the problem to Micro blop , those of us who are having that issue, wouldn't be here, asking this question
 and the level of frustration wouldn't be where it is now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done the same thing. Rename the folder and call it a day. But somehow, someone at Micro puke, can't or won't remove their head from dark spaces and figure it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now, since you are the advisor, your task, might be one in which to discuss this little problem with the supposed experts and get it figured out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I'll say it straight up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't do that little part then you can stand and step aside and allow someone else, from Microsoft get on here and explain the fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's an either or situation, sir, and so far, your suggestion , didn't do a thing for anyone.</p>

</p><p>Hi, this was the headache from hell.&nbsp; I did get it fixed.&nbsp; What I did was look for a folder that had an arrow pointing down.&nbsp; The cursed folder had gotten in there (duplicated itself? ) after I found it i deleted it from there too and FINALLY got it removed
 and didn't have the message pop up every flipping minute.&nbsp; I hope this helps.&nbsp; I just hovered over each folder and made sure there weren't any sub folders that would cause the problem again.&nbsp; I hope this helps I know how annoying it is.</p>
<p>Thanks to my friend for helping me solve this problem.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">Under folders, click on "Deleted Items" and you should find the deleted folder in question.&nbsp; Don't just delete it, change the title first and later you can finally delete it after you sure the problem has finally been resolved.&nbsp;
 Worked for me.&nbsp; Hope this helps everyone else.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

            Hi Durjoy,<br />
<br />
To give you information, the Clutter folder only appears if you are accessing an email issued by your company which is accessible by logging in to
<em>https://<strong>portal.office.com</strong></em>. <br />
<br />
If you are using a personal email and accessing through <cite>https://<strong>www.outlook.com</strong></cite>, the Clutter folder will not appear.

<h2>            How to promote page to section, or move section to page in Onenote&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Notes and thoughts are a pure hierarchy, which change structure as they grow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you have too many sections, you may need to group the sections under a new section - i.e. the old sections become pages unser a new section.&nbsp; And visa versa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have wanted and tried to use onedrive for many years, but without the ability to reorganise, it is worse than useless - you are stuck with the organisational (i.e. hierarchy) choices you made when you start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Omnioutliner is absolutely perfect, but there is nothing like it for note taking and note organising on the PC which I can find. I would pay a lot of money for a solid version of omnioutliner for windows.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Onenote could be this, but is crippled by the fixed nature of sections and pages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would gladly give up all the WYSIWYG features of onenote, and live with ASCII text only, if it meant I could reorganise the sections and pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please add this feature MS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another feature which is strangely missing is the ability to add tags to pages.&nbsp; &nbsp;After this would be the ability to create heirachies of tags, thus allowing us to re-organise the structure outside of the MS fixed section / page limitation.</p>

<p>I have seen links to https://onenote.uservoice.com/ but assumed it was some 3rd party or phishing site as:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>it doesnt have microsoft in the URL</li><li>You cant login with your microsoft account</li><li>It is inconceivable that MS would use a third party for something so core as product feedback.</li><li>The icon is wrong</li><li>The certificate is wrong - it is not Microsoft.</li><li>it looks like it is pretending to be MS with some bad skinning.</li><li>In 30 years in IT I have never heard of uservoice.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Because this site has all the markers of a phishing site or site pretending to be MS, I would not touch it.</p>
<p>I am quite surprised that someone who appears to be MS employee would recommend using a 3rd party site.</p>

<h2>            Sofware Updater Setup can not find msi</h2>
                    I want to upgrade my N80's software. I have downloaded NokiaSofwareUpdaterSetup_en.exe. The connectivity cable driver loads fine and there after Widows installer brins up a dialog box: The feature you are trying to use is on a network source that is unavaileble.
 Click OK to try again or enter a alternate path to a folder containing the installation package 'Nokia Software Updater.msi' in the box below. I have done a search and can not locate that 'msi' file. What is going wrong? I have downloaded the .exe file from
 a different location aswell and still get the same error.

<p>Hi AliciaDearn,</p>
<p>I’d like to confirm whether you want to set a retention policy for the shared mailboxes so that the old emails in the “Inbox folder” are automatically and permanently delated. If so, you can follow up the following steps:<br />
1.&nbsp;Sign in to the <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Exchange Admin Center (EAC)</a> with
<strong>an admin account</strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp;Click “compliance management”&gt; “retention tags”&gt; “+” (create a new retention tag)&gt; “applied automatically to a default folder”&gt; assign a name for the tag&gt; “Permanently Delete”&gt; set the days to delete&gt; “Save”.<br />
3.&nbsp;Click “compliance management”&gt; “retention policy”&gt; “Default”&gt; “Edit”&gt; “+” (add a retention tag)&gt; choose the newly created retention tag&gt; “OK”.</p>
<p><strong>Please note</strong>: make sure the emails in the inbox folder without personal retention tags. Also, if I misunderstood your situation, please correct me and provide more details for your requirement so that we can assist you accordingly.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Alan</p>

I bought a Lumia 925 but couldn't update the phone's firmware from Amber to Black because it always returns an error message reading, Error 80070002. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The Microsoft employee who previously replied to this same query seems to have copied and pasted a link directing us to read a troubleshooting guide for Windows Desktop.

We get that you are upset with the phone, but being rude to those who are trying to help is, well, not cool. Although, why you would assume that we forum&nbsp;participants will somehow assume/imagine that you have 'already did the phone reset step' is beyond me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;If the update is not happening, there are a few things you can try. You have already done a phone reset and the issue is not fixed. If a phone reset does not fix the issue, it boils down to a carrier/phone equipment problem which has to be fixed by your
 phone provider. </p>

<div>I suggested the hard reset because other people who did report that problem were able to resolve the problem by doing the reset and your post did not say that you had already tried the reset.</div>

<div>Nokia is just starting to the roll out the Black update to the 925 in the last few days. &nbsp;I would wait a week, and if you are still getting the 80070002 error, just take the phone back to your cellular operator and have them reset it or replace it.</div>

            <p>Yes this error code is specific to the app Package Tracker (ITECTURE.consulting).&nbsp; I have no trouble installing other apps at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had the app installed since Windows 8.1, and when I upgraded to 10 TP, I noticed the app would fail to start (some sort of error message and an 'x' on the live tile) every few days, requiring a reinstall from the store.&nbsp; Most recently, however, the
 app just cannot be installed, leading me to believe it may have something to do with leftover corrupt files that need to be removed from my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried going through all your methods, nothing was changed.&nbsp; I did notice when I was going through Method 3, that my Windows Time service was not running automatically (and hence Internet time sync was not working).&nbsp; I restarted it in Services and rebooted
 but this did not help with the problem.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Weikang,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry to know that the issue could not be resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One of the potential causes for this your Windows Store cache. The cache is a small data storage memory area accessed by Windows store to</span></p>
<p><span>re access Web page data that is stored on your computer vs. having to re download the data again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Try to Reset Windows Store Cache then try installing the app.</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press the <strong>
Windows</strong>+<strong>R </strong>keys on your keyboard to open the Run dialog.
</span></li><li><span>Type <strong>
WSReset</strong>.<strong>exe</strong>, and click/tap on <strong>OK</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Store will now open, and state the following: The cache for the store was cleared. You can now browse the store for apps.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Once this is done , try installing the app.</span></p>
<p>

            <p>I tried running WSReset.exe and also as an Administrator.&nbsp; The Store didn't seem to have reset its cache (no message was displayed), and attempting to install the app in question returns the same error.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now I'm also occasionally getting the error 0x80004005 which I think is network connectivity related.&nbsp; However, I am connected to both Ethernet and Wireless, and I have tried a combination of both connections.&nbsp; Usually I only get this error once before the
 0xc03f421c error code appears again.</p>
