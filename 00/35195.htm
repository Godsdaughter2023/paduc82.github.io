<h2>            BAd pool Header</h2>
                    <p>Hi there! my laptop got this error (blue screen) and with the system checked for errors automatically and it restarted. Then to find th eoslution I came across "bluescreenview utility" which I downloaded and checked. As i was using this app, another blue
 screen appeared and it showed "IRQL NOT less or equal". Again the system restarted. I also uninstalled the bluescreenview app.

            Hi Baron.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> I'll give you everything possible to try for sign-in failure so that at least something will work:
<br />
<br />First see the various troubleshooting steps here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-10-account-password-from-login-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/troubleshooting-log-in-issues-in-windows-10/e7f397aa-417c-4479-80cb-d69d20ef18cc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-windows-password/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-w...</a>
<br />
<br />This could also be due to account corruption so see the fixes here:
<br /><a href="https://www.techbout.com/fix-corrupt-user-profile-windows-10-9139/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techbout.com/fix-corrupt-user-profi...</a>
<br /> 
<br />To access another account to try to fix corruption, or create a new Admin account to replace a corrupted account, see these steps enable the hidden Built-in Administrator used for emergencies like this. First try whichever method works here: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable</a>...
<br />
<br />If it blocks these by requiring a password, then see this tutorial for enabling Built-in Admin from Log-in Screen.  <a href="https://www.isumsoft.com/it/enable-hidden-administrator-account-in-windows-10-without-login/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isumsoft.com/it/enable-hidden-admin...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m</a>.... Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only.
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor</a>...
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, or on second screen choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then Command Prompt.
<br />
<br />Restart PC, Sign into new Admin account, elevate the desired account by typing netplwiz in Start Search, opening the wizard, highlight desired account (tick box if necessary first), then under Properties &gt; Group Membership, change to Administrator. Save that and then if desired highlight and remove the old Admin account.
<br />
<br />If these fail then create a new Admin Account: <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a</a>...
<br />
<br />If that fails go back to Troubleshoot Options to try a Reset.
<br />
<br />If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki</a>.... It is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Your Tab Pro came with the localized Mexican version of Windows. You can change some elements of the interface to English, but it's still a Mexican computer. If you want an English computer you'll need to do a clean install of a localized English version
 of Windows (and pay for a new license.) Even then, you might have trouble obtaining warranty service outside Mexico, should you need it. (Hopefully not.)

            Thank you for your help...thats what i figured....bit of a rip off from my point of view. A computer is a computer....the rest is just data and does not have a nationality. Microsoft should just write a fix for free and samsung should know better. Im just
 going to buy an I PAD and give this peice of junk away to a nefew next time im in mexico. Thanks for your help.cheers.

            <p>Hi Jessen P,</p>
<p>Thank you for your prompt reply. I performed a clean boot, and although it didn't fix the problem I contacted you about, it did fix another problem I was having.
</p>
<p>I contacted Husqvarna software support and they emailed back to me that I was receiving this error message because
the 821B Embroidery patch was already installed on my system and I was trying to install over top of it.</p>
<p>I uninstalled the entire program and updates and reinstalled them and everything is working ok now.</p>
<p>I also found that Adobe Acrobat Reader 10 would not work very well with my embroidery programs, it would open and close the files straight away. I have reinstalled Adobe 8.</p>
<p>Thank you for your prompt reply and help</p>
<p>Lynda Wall</p>

<p>thank you...it appears that the router and modem are one machine here,,,i believe you meant&nbsp; " Then turn Wi-Fi "on" through your phone,",,,,i tried this but it didn't work...my phone says it is connected to the Wi-Fi but when I call using skype it says "
 No internet connection",,,,?&nbsp; also it seems to flash first "connecting" and then "connected to Wlan 300......"&nbsp; back and forth...?</p>

            solved my problem alone,,,,with Samsung there is a smart network switch...(found by going to settings- Wi-Fi - more - and then&nbsp;"&nbsp;smart network switch",,,,,(this switches between mobile data and the hotspots )&nbsp; for some reason when it was turned off, the
 phone swithched back and forth from wlan connection to not connected, ,,don't know why but when it is on the problem is solved, and the phone works with skype, WhatsApp, and cloud phone with no problem even when mobile data is turned off......ddon't understand
 it , but it works this way now with the smart network switch turned on,,,,

            Hi,<br />
Welcome to Microsoft answers forum.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You can click windows key from keyboard&nbsp; and check if that helps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
you can try checking whether the task bar is hidden, follow these teps and check.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Look for a thin line on one edge of the screen. <br />
2. Click on it. The Taskbar should open up.<br />
3. Right click on the Taskbar, and select Properties.<br />
4. Uncheck the Auto-Hide the Taskbar checkbox.<br />
5. Check the Keep the Taskbar On top Of Other Windows checkbox.<br />
6. Click OK.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You can try changing the size of task bar.<br />
1. Right click on task bar,uncheck lock the taskbar.<br />
2. Click on task bar and drag to increase the size.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hope this works<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks and Regards,<br />

    <title>Skype Kicks Me Out Of Group Calls - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype Kicks Me Out Of Group Calls</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I'm having this issue where skype automatically kicks me out of group calls after 10 or 17 seconds. This happens when I try to join an
 already existing group call. However, if someone manually calls me and I pick up the call, everything works perfectly fine. Does anyone know how to fix this? I'm using Windows 8 and my skype is completely updated.</span>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In order for us to assist you further, you may provide us more information on the issue you are having.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Make sure that the group call is not yet full, as it only allows to have a 25 people (24 plus the host).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Is it happening to other participants when they try to join the group call?
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Have you tried initiating the group call?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also, the computer or device that’s hosting the group call needs to have enough processing power and network bandwidth for the call. Having a large number
 of people on the call can sometimes put too much strain on the host device and cause call quality problems. To improve group call quality, make sure the host has a strong network and powerful processor, or reduce the number of people on the call.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information helps. I look forward to your reply.</span></span></p>

            This issue occurs regardless of how many people are in the call. Even when there are only 2 other people in the call. It does not happen to other participants in the call and when I try initiating the call, others can join the call fine but I will still
 get kicked out after 10 or 17 seconds.

<h2>            Wacom Tablet Cursor changed to a dot after 1903 update</h2>
                    <p>Updated Win 10 to 1903 yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Laptop is a 3 month old Dell Precision 7530</p>
<p>I use an Intuos 5 Wacom Tablet with a Pro Pen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the update to 1903 the cursor has changed to a dot when using the Wacom Pro Pen and the Wacom tablet regardless of the application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When using a mouse or internal laptop touchpad the correct cursor is shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I process digital images using Adobe Lightroom Classic CC and Adobe Photoshop CC.&nbsp; If I select a tool in either of these applications the correct tool cursor appears only when I hover over the image.&nbsp; Changes back to a dot when I move off of the image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone through the Wacom troubleshooting steps which did not solve the problem.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 installing Anniversary update fails &#40;UEFI Boot layout&#41; 0xC1900200 &#47; 0xC1900201</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I was just trying to install the 1607 (anniversary update) and it instantly fails with the error (roughly translated): Windows cannot be installed because this pc has a non-supported disk layout for uefi-firmware.<br />
<br />
Windows error log states the following: Installation error: the following update cannot be installed, errorcode
<strong>0xC1900200</strong>: Onderdelenupdate naar Windows 10, versie 1607.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>While searching for this problem i got a hint somewhere that the 100MB EFI Partition might be to small; so i increased that to 300MB. The error now however is:&nbsp;Installation error: the following update cannot be installed, foutcode
<strong>0xC1900201</strong>: Onderdelenupdate naar Windows 10, versie 1607.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When trying to lookup any information regarding these errors, i mostly see errors while installing windows 10. Difference here however is that windows 10 is already installed and now it complains about a disk layout??</p>

            <p>In my case the fix was simple:&nbsp; disconnect all extra drives, internal and external,other than the C operating system one.&nbsp; In my case the C drive was an SSD but I additionally had a 2TB Hard Disk inside and a USB pen drive externally.&nbsp; Once the HDD and Pen
 drive were disconnected the anniversary update went perfectly.&nbsp; Afterwards I reconnected these without problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Before this I spent hours trying unsuccessfully to get the update installed.&nbsp; So, the update process doesn't seem to like extra drives.

<h2>            Issues connecting HP color Laserjet Printer CM1312nfi MFP Printer</h2>
                    <p>*Original Title: Printer</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having trouble with connecting to my HP Color LaserJet CM1312nfi MFP Printer. I could not get it to connect with the laptop after install Windows 10. The printer would show as offline.&nbsp; I followed the instructions to remove and re-install. During the
 re-install process I would receive an error message indicating I need to follow the same process as I was doing? I tried to use the troubleshoot on the printer but it would fail giving me this code before completing (0x803C010B).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or guidance on this matter would be appreciated! Thanks!</p>

<p>Mira yo mas que inclinarme por paypal me parecio mucho mejor en gamestop porque ahi te venden codigos virtuales, pero me detuve cuando lei comentarios de que los codigos que compras en usa son para usa pero aun sigo teniendo mis dudas; ya que yo he cambiado
 codigos de juegos que me mandan de usa y me funcionaron incluyendo un codigo xbox live de 48 hrs.. no quise meter una tarjeta de credito por temor a lo que le paso a ps y ahora no me queda mas de otra que comprar todo en blockbuster.. ni idea tampoco de como
 funcione el paypal..</p>

<p>Depende de la tarjeta de debito que uses , pero tambien puedes tratar de buscar en Mercado libre , ahi te venden los codigos de 1 mes , 3 meses , etc.</p>
<p>solo revisa bien la reputacion del que le vas a comprar.</p>

<p>Paypal no es un servicio de xbox es un servicio externo al que microsoft recurrio por comodidad de algunos usuarios, la pagina de Paypal la puedes encontrar facilmente en tu navegador y de ahi seguir los pasos para crear tu cuenta, eso si es practicamente
 lo mismo que usar tu tarjeta de credito solo que con este puedes pagar no solo en xbox live si no en varios servicios mas.</p>

<h2>            Connecting Surface Pro 3 to TV</h2>
                    I have a Surface Pro 3 and I am trying to use my Samsung Smart TV as a monitor. I have an Insignia Mini DisplayPort to HDMI cable. The TV shows the PC connected, but basically says nothing is coming from the source. I have tried to extend/duplicate monitor
 and it flickered showing 2 displays 2 times, but it will not stay up? I have tried to change resolution etc, nothing works. Any help would be appreciated..

            Hello Michael,<br /><br />It sounds like it could be the adapter that is the issue. Have you tried using it with another display? Like a monitor?<br /><br />Let me know.<br /><br />Cristhian

            Hi Michael, <br />You may need to change the resolution on the surface to what ever resolution is on TV. Turn off TV reboot Surface  turn TV back on. <br />The other way I connect is Via Miracast <br />To set up your wireless display go to Settings-&gt;Display and select Connect to a wireless display.<br />You should be able to then see the Samsung Smart LED TV as [TV] and the TV's model number as one of the displays to connect to.<br />Once you select the TV, you need to use the TV's remote control to select Allow, and start the display mirroring connection.<br />You can then choose different ways to extend, duplicate, or use the Surface screen or TV screen only<br /><br />I hope this helps. Please feel free to ask questions and let us know how it goes. I will work with you until problem is resolved. <br /><br />Linnell

            Great suggestion.&nbsp; If they made the game BC I would be surprised if the DLC's weren't also.&nbsp; That's usually the case.&nbsp; As this is a Microsoft title I'm also surprised they haven't already done so to be fair.

            It's a great idea and would be a nice addition to the Backwards Compatibility list. Best way to help that happen is to get talking about it on social media and getting others involved. Let the developer and the publisher know, if they see a swell of support,
 it might sway them to add it to the list.<br />

            They are always adding new titles to the list so it could happen one day. I'm not sure though since they basically removed all the multiplayer features from Forza 2. I just find it hard to believe that they would revamp that game now&nbsp;

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am experiencing a problem that is well documented under Server 2008R2 (there's even a hotfix for it) but, I cannot find the appropriate hotfix or work around information for Server 2012R2. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Environment:</p>
<p>ALL Server 2012R2 VM's on VMware with HP hardware</p>
<p>Server List:</p>
<p>&nbsp; MS120 - Gateway, Licensing server and Connection broker. &nbsp;Location of user profile vmdk's.</p>
<p>&nbsp; MS121-123 - RD session hosts</p>
<p>Patched and generally working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue:</p>
<p>Every once in awhile, a user will receive the message&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"</span><strong>The task you are trying to do can't
 be completed because Remote Desktop Services is currently busy. Please try again in a few minutes. Other users should still be able to logon</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"
 &nbsp;when trying to log in through the RDGateway. &nbsp;Yes, this is a well documented issue in 2008R2 and YES there are hotfixes available. &nbsp;Please don't reply with those articles as I have already read them. &nbsp;My issue is that the hotfixes are not for 2012R2. &nbsp;I have
 found that restarting the Remote Desktop Connection Broker service on the Gateway server allows the user to log in correctly. &nbsp;However, I need to fix this issue permanently. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>If you haven’t already heard, there is a glitch occurring where people are having their rank reset to level 1 and all of their ribbons and medal progress wiped. I have personally been rank reset, but had a backup of my player data and so was able to
 get everything back. It can be devastating to lose all your medals and rank that you worked hard for, so I highly recommend that EVERYONE makes a backup of their data following the instructions in this thread. I have compiled all the information that I have
 about this issue in this post. So apologies in advance, but this is going to be a LONG post (China will want their wall back). I don't work for Epic, so this isn't official in any way. It's just my personal research on the subject. I know that this a really

<span>It has now been confirmed by several people that have been rank reset that their cloud backups were effective in restoring their data (HUGE thanks to Hell, You're Back Kim, xN A R U T Ox I, and now Jill for confirming this for me!). If you are not already
 aware, cloud storage is an online storage system that is available to everyone with an xbox live gold subscription. I would therefore recommend that everyone without a USB or memory card backup to make one on cloud storage. (If you have not used cloud storage
 before and don't know how, all the instructions you will need are in the cloud storage backup video later in this post.) Even if you have a USB or memory card to use for a backup, it never hurts to have a second backup on the cloud as well. There have been
 a couple of posts made recently which claimed that cloud storage backups didn't work, however the people who made those posts had failed to follow the backup and recovery instructions properly. When all the instructions are followed exactly then ALL backups,
 whether they are on a USB memory card or the cloud, WILL restore your data in the event of a reset.</span><br />

 your corrupted player data file will also wipe your server data when you press start at the main menu. Once this has happened, there is NO way to recover your data unless you made a backup beforehand.</span><br />

<span>There is a slightly less common type of reset which can occur that involves the loss of your collectibles, campaign progress, and achievement progress. I assume this involves the corruption of the "campaign saves" file instead of the player data file

<br />
<b><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">1.</span></b><span>&nbsp;Once you have followed the instructions in the video to make your backup files, do not continue playing from your backup drive. This is because player data files become corrupted while you are USING them. So
 if you continue to play after making your backup, your backup files could become corrupted without you knowing. Then when you need them to recover your rank they won't work, and your data will be lost. This has already happened to a couple of people, so you
 should only use your backup drive when you are updating your backup or recovering your rank. The key is to use the backup file as little as possible to prevent any data loss.</span><br />

 the backup data in the cloud would sync and be corrupted too. This is&nbsp;</span><b>incorrect</b><span>&nbsp;however. The cloud ONLY syncs with the local cache that it uses on your hard drive, and not with any of your game saves. They are completely independent. Cloud

 usb/memory card as well. It contains your rank, unlocks, medals etc. And keeping them together should prevent any kind of data loss. Usually if the game does not detect a player data file for you, it will download your data from the Microsoft servers. However,
 I think sometimes this does not happen when you are split-screening and this leads to rank resets. Since you can now use the cloud to access your player data remotely, I would recommend this for split screeners. Then this problem should not occur.</span><br />

<span>A lot of people seems to be having this problem when they turn their Xbox off without backing out of whatever they are playing. In particular, people are turning their Xbox off or dashboarding in-between quick matches. NEVER turn your Xbox off straight
 after a versus match, as this is when it is saving your stats, and can mess up your player data. This also seems to be happening to people who are playing horde/beast/campaign and just turn their Xbox off without backing out of the match. I would strongly
 recommend you ALWAYS BACK OUT TO THE PARTY LOBBY BEFORE SWITCHING YOUR XBOX OFF OR DASHBOARDING. There are a few people who say they waited for the next map to load in a quick match, then backed out before turning their Xbox off and they were still reset.</span><br />

 some offline campaign, or horde. Your internet/Xbox comes back online so you sign back in, THEN you are reset. I’m not exactly sure what the best way to avoid this is, but I definitely recommend NOT SIGNING BACK IN WHILE PLAYING SOMETHING. For example, don’t
 be IN a horde match, or be doing campaign then sign in. I would probably say going back to the dashboard would be safest. Or maybe even turn your Xbox all the way off and then back on. Unfortunately I’m not really sure, but signing in while playing is definitely
 a bad idea.&nbsp;</span><br />

<span>I am certainly no expert (at all), but it seems like the game in certain situations seems to fail to recognise the “player data” file that is stored in your memory, which contains all of your rank/ribbons/medals information. When this happens it seems
 to start a brand new one that is blank, i.e level 1. This new file then starts to overwrite the old file when you go through any loading screens. You might be thinking “but all your rank information is meant to be stored on the Microsoft servers”, and it IS.
 However, it is only BACKED UP to the Microsoft servers. The actual information is contained in your player data file. This means, if the player data file on your hard drive is glitched and resets to rank 1 and then you gain xp, or pass through certain loading
 screens, it overwrites your old file AND sends this new information to be stored on the severs AND WIPES OVER THE OLD INFORMATION THERE AS WELL. However, if you delete the glitched file straight away it reads the information directly from the servers and recreates
 the player data file for you on your drive containing all of your actual rank/unlocks. Similarly, if your data on the servers gets wiped but you have a backup of your player data file, your data on the servers will be restored once you start the game up using
 your backup data.</span><br />

<p>i got reset once.... but never missed a beat... i save every other time to the cloud then my HDD (switch them up each time i play). worst thing that can happen if you switch up your save location, is lose a few levels since the other backup was done... better
 than losing it all. &nbsp;:))</p>

<div>How about this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Go to the folder your files are located in. &nbsp;Create a new Text file...then open it (Windows should use notepad, that just fine).</div>
<div><br />
<div>in the file type:</div>
<div>ren dsc*.jpg rome*.jpg</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now save the file as:</div>
<div>renamethem.bat</div>
<div><br />
<div>(make sure you call it ".bat" and save it as a txt document, that will make a simpel file and not add any strange formatting)</div>
<div><br />
<div>From there, just double click that file and it will rename all your pictures accordingly.</div>
<div><br />
<div>:)</div>

<p>&nbsp; I'm having Windows Vista 32 bit, and now would like to upgrade to Windows 10. However, the recommended path is to Upgrade to Windows 7 first - i'm struggling to find the installation kit for Windows 7. Where can i find the official version of Windows 7
 on the microsoft site? I dont want to download the .iso file from any other site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming i have to upgrade from Windoes Vista-&gt;Windows 7-&gt;Windows 8.1-&gt;Windows 10, i'll face the same problem with other versions of Windows also - if possible, i would like to know the downlod links for 32-bit and 64-bit for Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows
 10.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Thanks Bill. If this is the case, why was there a link on my computer, asking me to check for an Upgrade to Windows 7? The Windows 7 upgrade advisor mentioned that upgrade to Windows 7 was possible - so i downloaded the iso file, and upgraded to Windows
 7, now its not accepting my Windows Vista Product Key, even though i selected the Upgrade option. Do i need to revert to Windows Vista, as I don't want to keep buying the OS - I'd rather go for Mac.</p>
<p>
