<p>Hi Buracho,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are ways on how you can add the missing registry on the Security folder. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In Registry Editor, click the registry key under which you would like to add a new key.</li><li>Click <strong>New </strong>on the <strong>Edit </strong>menu and then click <strong>
Key</strong>.</li><li>Type a name for the new key and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>The method to fix the issue will have Registry modification. Before you modify the Registry, make sure to back it up and understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. Please refer to this link:

</p><p>Hi.....I am having a similar problem but with Microsoft Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still using Word 2003 and all of a sudden, I get this error message when attempting to open a Word document:</p>
<p><span>"You are attempting to open a file that was created in an earlier version of Microsoft Office. This
 file type is blocked from opening in this version by your registry policy setting."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So I've investigated and found the steps to update the registry:</span></p>
<span>To enable Word 2003 to open files in earlier Word file types, follow these steps:&nbsp;</span><br />
<ol>
<li>Exit Word 2003.</li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>, click&nbsp;<strong>Run</strong>, type&nbsp;<span>regedit</span>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<strong>Open</strong>&nbsp;box,
 and then click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Locate and then click the following registry subkey:
<div><strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Word\Security</strong></div>
</li><li>After you select the subkey that is specified in step 3, point to&nbsp;<strong>New</strong>&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<strong>Edit</strong>&nbsp;menu, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Key</strong>.</li><li>Type&nbsp;<span>FileOpenBlock</span>, and then press ENTER.</li><li>With the&nbsp;<strong>FileOpenBlock</strong>&nbsp;subkey selected, point to&nbsp;<strong>New</strong>&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<strong>Edit</strong>&nbsp;menu, and then click&nbsp;<strong>DWORD
 Value</strong>.</li><li>Type&nbsp;<span>FilesBeforeVersion</span>, and then press ENTER.</li><li>Right-click&nbsp;<strong>FilesBeforeVersion</strong>, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Modify</strong>.</li><li>In the&nbsp;<strong>Value data</strong>&nbsp;box, type the value that corresponds to one of the values in the&nbsp;<span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/#1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Word
 file version table</a></span>, and then click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>The problem is there is NO SECURITY FOLDER when I get there!!!!</p>

    <title>Cannot load some web pages correctly following Windows update August - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot load some web pages correctly following Windows update August 2017</h2>
                    <p>Hello, unfortunately I can't load some websites correctly following the Windows update last week (August 2017). I have tried accessing these websites using Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome and Firefox. However, the result is still the same
 and it is only loading some pages with content appearing on the left hand side of the page from top to bottom and overlapping.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wondering how to resolve this issue as it has never been a problem until this update. I can also access these sites without any problem using a MacBook.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Damian,<br />
<br />
There may be several reasons why some websites are not loading after an update. One of which can be because your firewall. Sometimes firewall software might prevent you from getting connected. To better assist you, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What version of Windows are you using? To check, type <strong>winver</strong> on
<strong>Cortana's</strong> search field.</li><li>Do you see an error message whenever the web page won't load?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you may also refer to this article for more troubleshooting steps:

<p>"Windows cannot verify the digital signature for the drivers required for this device. A recent hardware or software change might have installed a file that is signed incorrectly or damaged, or that might be malicious software from an unknown source. (Code

<p>

<p>Further, I ran the Fixit tool which sorted the problem, but then I started having major BSODs.</p>
<p>I even had to disable secure boot to make the problem go away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please suggest something ?</p>

            <p>Hi Winston,</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time out to solve my problem.</p>
<p>I did have a few issues with regards to restoring the PC to an earlier point, since I just upgraded my hard drive and because of this I didn't have any previous restore points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I did create one manually and ran the FixIt tool downloaded from here, again:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://support.microsoft.com/mats/cd_dvd_drive_problems</p>
<p>
</p><p>this just cleared the lower filters from the windows registry.</p>
<p>I did not have any upper filters set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After restarting my PC, the drive is now visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, I also upgraded the firmware of the drive from here:</p>
<p>http://www.tsstodd.com/eng/Firmware/FWDownload/?functionvalue=view&amp;no=769&amp;parent_idx=&amp;level_idx=&amp;model=SN-406AB&amp;product=SBC&amp;productName=BD-COMBO%20Slim</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would just have to wait and see now if the crashes recur.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Mat1926, yes that is way too big . . .
<br />
<br />Since you have 32GB of RAM you will rarely if ever need to use the page file - the page file in modern systems with lots of RAM is not really required . . 
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - System
<br />
<br />Click 'Advanced System Settings'
<br />
<br />Under Performance, click Settings
<br />
<br />Click on the Advanced Tab and under 'Virtual Memory, click 'Change'
<br />
<br />Uncheck 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'
<br />
<br />Click 'Custom Size'
<br />
<br />Set Initial and Maximum to 4096MB
<br />
<br />Save those settings

<p>Well, I think I found the issue! I did what you said, and after reboot...I opened 8 instances of chrome and each with at least 12-15 tabs! Then I checked again and it seems some of the tabs did not open and gave a message out of memory, so I refreshed and
 they are now all open....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have Chrome and HandBrake running and the total memory usage is ~76-80%!! ....Shall I re-adjust the pagefile size again?! Something like 8192 MB maybe?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thnx</p>
<p>
</p><p>*edit*</p>
<p>I have to say that I do need all the tabs open...</p>

            Hi Mat, yes Chrome can be very memory heavy when multiple tabs are open and with handbrake encoding video, that would put pressure on your system. So yes, move to 8192MB and see how your system responds . . .

    <title>Opening multiple windows from Taskbar on Sony Vaio EB series laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lsmintexas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Opening multiple windows from Taskbar on Sony Vaio EB series laptop</h2>
                    
<p>I hope&nbsp;this makes sense, but&nbsp;every time I have multiple items open, when I click on&nbsp;another item in the Taskbar, the item will not be visible unless I minimize the other item on the screen first, i.e., Control Panel, Appearance and Personalization, Change
 Theme - I have to minimize Control Panel and Appearance and Personalization first to view Change Theme. It doesn't matter which program is open, it does the same thing. My other computer would allow me to simply click on the other item in the Taskbar and it
 would open over the other item. Now, it's very frustrating because everything else has to be minimized first. If I click on the thumbnail in the Taskbar, nothing happens until everything else is minimized. I have tried everything I can think of, including
 going through the settings in Control Panel&nbsp;and can't seem to find a solution.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<strong>Method 4:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Also try uninstalling Object dock and see if the issue gets fixed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Refer:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Uninstall or change a program in windows.<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<strong>Method 5:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
I would recommend you to perform clean boot.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</strong>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:<br />

Note: After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.<br />

    <title>How to edit picture properties&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> suzanne s. barnhill  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to edit picture properties&#63;</h2>
                    Under Windows XP, I was able to open the Properties of a photo in Windows Explorer and add comments, which then became visible as the Description in Microsoft Office Picture Manager or in the popup when mousing over the file in Windows Explorer. In Windows
 7 I can't figure out how to do this. I can see the (empty)&nbsp;Title, Subject, and Comments fields on the Details tab of the picture Properties but can't figure out how to edit them. Is this even possible? Can it be done in some other application? I have Corel
 PhotoPaint and Adobe Photoshop Elements.

            Hi Suzanne, As far as I know in the details tab of properties you should just be able to mouse click to the right of the desired field that you wish to edit and it should automatically allow you to start editing your information. There wouldn't be any
 edit option or anything you would just simply click to the right of which ever field you wish to modify.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps. I'll be checking back and try to help the best I can.&nbsp;</div>

<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Select the Processes tab
<br />Scroll down to Windows Explorer then select it

            Hi CynthiaKnight...
<br />
<br />Well its very simple, first of all right click on the empty space on Taskbar.
<br />You will see a pop up, here take your Mouse cursor to Cortana.
<br />Now you will see Three option.
<br />1:-Hidden :- This will completely Hide/Remove Cortana Search Box From Windows 10 Taskbar .
<br />2:-Show Cortana Icon :- It will hide/remove up the Search Box and you will be left with just Cortana Circle Icon.
<br />3:-Show Search Box :- This is set as default which means you will see both Search Box as well Cortana.
<br />use Option 1 and click on Hidden  the cortana will appear  on your display.
<br />
<br />surely it helps if not reply for further help.
        </p>

            Hi Patrick.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Did you try Resetting the app at Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Movies &amp; TV &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Reset?
<br />
<br />If that isn't enough then try reinstalling the app from Option two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

the replies i had were from Greg Carmack and Ugo (only one name provided)&nbsp; -(I presume that Ugo is a given name and not a surname)<br />

            I had this same problem with "cast to device" to my Samsung TV also until I read somewhere to search for streaming on toolbar using Cortana and enable streaming to device. It was disabled on my settings and I haven't had any problems since but I still
 can't fast forward on the play window or with remote. Hope this helps

<p>
</p><p>1) ¿puedo establecer una tercera cuenta segunda cuenta como mi xbox principal?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Israel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every account can have only one Xbox as a home console, but one Xbox can have multiple accounts using it as a home console. When a new account is created and added to an Xbox One, the Xbox One becomes the home console by default. If you have all 3 accounts
 on the same Xbox and have all three accounts set up so that console is the Home console, then the content should at that point be shared with everyone and you wouldn't need to sign into the account that owns the content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the home console information found on our support website: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Ctrl+Click to follow link https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox">

<p>Whether Messenger starts when Windows&nbsp;logs you in&nbsp;is controlled by options in Messenger which need to be set by you via Tools/ Options/ Sign In.</p>
<p>Windows Messenger can be installed on its' own but it does need other hidden&nbsp;programs which are part of the installation.&nbsp; There is no need for you to worry about those hidden process, just don't select any of the other Windows Live programs offered at Install
 time, things like Live Mail, Live Movie Maker, Live Photo Gallery, and "Live" anything else, are not needed for Messenger.</p>
<p>Windows Live 2011 when installing any "Live" program does install a Service in Services called "Windows Live ID Sign-in Assistant".&nbsp;</p>
<p>To uninstall Messenger select "Windows Live 2011" from Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Programs and Features.&nbsp; Just follow the Wizard.</p>
<p>Don't just delete programs, use the proper uninstallers.</p>
<p>Have a look around the designated Messenger Forums.</p>

<p><br />
The correct way to get rid of a program is to uninstall it, not by deleting icons or files. Simply deleting program files/folders only causes problems in the long run.&nbsp;Use the Windows Live Essentials&nbsp;uninstaller in Programs and Features (in Control Panel) to
 remove Messenger and or other Windows Live programs.</p>
<p>Messenger's automatic start, logon and other functions are enabled or disabled using the Messenger program options. Some options only become accessible after you log in to the Messenger account.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Then I tried using the media creation tool but I get this error code:&nbsp;0x80070005 - 0xA001A. I only found one topic on it and it was never resolved, but I tried the suggestions by first turning off all anti-w/e programs, and then even just uninstalling them
 when that didn't work, and still I get this error.</p>

<p>2-26-2018<br />
For Windows 10 owners there are a few things you need to know about the digital<br />
box sitting in front of you:<br />
<br />
If the system is "older" and was created with an <strong>MBR</strong> (Master Boot Record)<br />
partition, then the downloads you need to 'repair' it if ever something<br />
stops work must also be made on a similarly configured computer ALSO using<br />
MBR! <em>(this was suggested elsewhere online today and so far, I find it to be true.)</em><br />
<br />
So if you have a new computer with Windows 10 and modern, up-to-date hardware,<br />
it was likely designed and manufactured to use the <strong>GPT</strong> (GUID Partition Table)<br />
partition, and the only way to 'repair' this type of computer [at the present<br />
time] is to download the Windows Media Creation Tool, save the file on a USB<br />
drive formatted with "<strong>exFAT</strong>" (as opposed to NTFS) and run the Media Creation<br />
Tool from the USB drive.<br />
<br />
Any attempt to do otherwise will result in some error at some point.<br />
Forget it!<br />
<br />
Several Community users have commented on being instructed to contact the<br />
computer's manufacturer and get the BIOS "fixed" and this is a misleading<br />
instruction! ... To the novice computer user, being told to get something "fixed"<br />
implies it it "broken", but what is actually meant by these previous comments<br />
is TO HAVE THE BIOS SETTINGS changed from "UEFI" to "Legacy" (enabled) and</p>
<p>this also is misleading!<br />
<br />
It is not recommended to "flip-flop" a computer back and forth between UEFI and<br />
Legacy BIOS configurations unless the Operating System is going to be re-<br />
installed entirely.<br />
<br />
A computer system with Microsoft Windows installed while the BIOS is configured<br />
UEFI, should be maintained (or maintainable) under the UEFI scheme!&nbsp; Similarly,<br />
a computer system with Microsoft Windows installed with the BIOS configured as<br />
"Legacy", should be maintained (or maintainable) under the Legacy scheme!<br />
<em>(there is a special command to convert UEFI GPT partitioning to MBR, but this is</em></p>
<p><em>the only mention I will make of that here because it is a complex choice! Don't do it.)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, my suggestion to Microsoft after a good day of troubleshooting is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If</strong> the following commands are available for use from a "Repair your computer"<br />
and "Command Prompt" window:<br />
<br />
<strong>bootrec /fixmbr</strong><br />
<strong>bootrec /fixboot</strong>&nbsp; <em>(I got, </em>"Access is denied."<em> on this one today! So, dead end.)</em><br />
<strong>bootrec /scanos</strong><br />
<strong>bootrec /rebuildbcd</strong><br />
<br />
...and these are specific to either the GPT or MBR installed systems, there<br />
really needs to be a detection mechanism built into the commands to prevent<br />
users from heading down an incorrect troubleshooting path!&nbsp; If this means an<br />
entire separate 'Suite' of commands for GPT (GUID Partition Table) based<br />
systems is necessary, so be it!&nbsp; Perhaps something like this would work:<br />
<br />
<em>bootrec /fixgpt</em><br />
<em>bootrec /fixboot-gpt</em><br />
<em>bootrec /scanos-gpt</em><br />
<em>bootrec /rebuildbcd-gpt</em><br />
<br />
(<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> The "fixgpt" and "fixboot-gpt" series of commands are
ONLY</span><br />
&nbsp;and <strong>do not literally exist</strong> at this point in time!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>* * * *</p>
<p>Finally, it is fantastic to have resources such as the Microsoft Community of<br />
Users-helping-Users and some highly experienced "Guides" among them, but if<br />
the contributors are only going to provide half-way complete explanations of<br />
the technology involved and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NOT</span> take the time to explain the misdirections<br />
provided to people seeking help, then maybe it would be MUCH better to only<br />
allow 'Moderated' questions where the issue is CAREFULLY, thoughtfully and<br />
completely screened by a Microsoft Windows expert before it is released to<br />
the audience at large.&nbsp; Many of the questions AND the answers accompanying<br />
them are, to say the least, confusing and while I understand this may have<br />
deflected attention away from <strong>Microsoft</strong> in the past, it seems this practice truly</p>
<p>needs to end.<br />
<br />
If I brought a car and had some difficulty with it and was told buy the<br />

    <title>Windows Search won&#39;t finish. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> curebeat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Search won&#39;t finish.</h2>
                    <p>Recently, whenever I try to perform a Search in a folder on my laptop the search simply won't finish. It makes progress (without showing any found files) then the progress bar just hangs just before it reaches the end. This is very annoying because I have
 a lot of files and need to search through them, which has never been a problem up until now. Normally when I search it shows me files it's found during the search but it doesn't do that anymore either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried indexing and checking that out but every time I open that window it just stays stuck on "Waiting to receive indexing status" and I can't do anything with that and troubleshooting has given me no help at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if anyone knew what might be wrong and what I can do to fix it; I'm no tech-head so please go easy on me! Thanks for any help.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>/EDIT/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay I have solved this problem, sorry, I went into search options and ticked the "Do not use index" button and now my searches work. The question I have now is, is there something wrong with my index? For it to essentially just hang and not let me do anything
 when it opens and having to not use it while I search to get any results indicates to me there might be something wrong with it, but I've no idea what.

<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I changed cases today and while at it delided my i7-7700k CPU. I than plugged everything in again, gtx 1070, SSD and HDD, heatsink and fans and my power supply. My SSD is running win10. I start the computer,
 and it first loads for a second showing me the MSI logo and shutsdown, starts up again on its self seconds later but this time shows me the same MSI logo but with "Preparing automatic repair.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">First of all, its weird that it shut down the first time and than shows me "preparing automatic repair". So what I did is i unplugged everything off, and left the CPU with fan, SSD and powersupply. Same
 thing, restarts first time and than after 2nd restart it shows the preparing automatic repair.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I downloaded the win10 media from microsoft, installed it on my usb of 8gb, plugged it into the PC, booted into the USB, go the microsoft logo loading screen, loads a violet color right before shutting down.
 If i want to boot into that USB again, I have to unplug it out of the pc and in again. After the shutdown, the USB doesnt show in boot meny as an option.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I tried hard resetting the PC 3 times to force the advanced startup options, didnt work. I tried a different SSD with no windows on to see if the USB win10 install could work, but didnt work.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I can run stable inside the OBS for hours it seems, and the temperatures of the CPU are at 30 degrees. The SSD of which i have my win on is displayed there.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">From all the testing, seems like the master boot record has been messed up. Or what do you think?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">Ive opened the CPU again to double check if anything went wrong, everything is fine. Only thing that happened was that seperating the thermal and metal liquid to check the cpu increased my temps with 8 degrees.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">Anyone have any idea what to do from here? Did i fry this?</span></p>

Added a quick video to what happens when i try to boot with CD win 10. Same thing with USB btw.<br />

<p>Hi ItsBill88,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are some possibilities that could cause the boot loop that you experience like a possible intrusion on your computer's security, a corrupted program, or an incompatible program causing the boot loop, or in this case hardware changes that might need
 to be configured. Thank you for sharing the steps that you performed as this would be added factor in narrowing down your concern. Before we perform any troubleshooting or refer you to the correct channel, I would like to clarify a few information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you able to boot to safe mode?</li><li>Were you able to boot to the desktop after the hardware changes done on your computer?</li><li>Have you tried reinstalling or updating the firmware of your hardware?</li><li>Do you encounter any error code or error message when trying to boot to the desktop?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please don't hesitate to keep in touch for me to assist you.</p>

                    <p>I have a Gateway MS2274 laptop. When I turn it on, the desktop opens but there is zero functionality with mouse and keyboard. The only thing that works is the on/off button. When I incorrectly shutdown and it offers 'safe mode' on startup, the arrow keys
 work.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Do you remember making any changes prior to the issue?</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b> I would suggest you to boot into safe mode and check if issue persists:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a>
</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b> If issue does not persist in safe mode then place the computer in clean boot and check which third party application or driver is causing the issue:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><b>Note</b>: After troubleshooting, make sure to set the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</p>
<p><b>If issue persists in safe mode then I would suggest you to contact the manufacturer and get the hardware tested.</b></p>

<h2>            New Windows 10 update took away Control Panel from Start Menu right click , how do i get it back &#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This new update that i did not have a choice in installing , took away the control panel from right clicking on the start menu , now i have to go thru several steps to get to it&nbsp; , how do i get it back on the start menu (not the APP box , but on the menu
 itself like it was before&nbsp; (Start,Right Click , it should say Task Manager, CONTROL PANEL ,Settings , File Explorer&nbsp; , etc , etc) i want it back there</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does Microsoft insist on changing things that we don't want , but all the bugs and crashes are never fixed&nbsp; ?? , Windows 10 constantly crashes my games (Far Cry 3-4 and many other NEWER games , and just randomly crashes on its own for no reason several
 times a week ,&nbsp; but they waste my limited bandwidth with this crappy update that took away things i use&nbsp; .... and fixed NOTHING that was actually wrong with Windows 10&nbsp; ...why ????)</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do i un-fix the things this update messed up , like getting my Control Panel back where it was ???</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:</p>
<p>I also just noticed a pop-up on the right side info thing , that says&nbsp; "Windows Insider Program ....Another Administrator has set up this device to successfully receive builds ,if you want , you can take control of which builds this device receives" , .....What
 is this and why is it wanting to change things , and what do i do ??&nbsp; , do i say "Take Control" ?? , or "Stop Insider Preview Builds" ??? i don't want anything more changed ....&nbsp; , why does Microsoft insist on changing things without me deciding how i want
 things , or ASKING me if i want anything changed ?? , i need a global NO button to not change my PC so it will just FIX things that don't work&nbsp; , if it was up to me i would end ALL Microsoft updates from changing anything , unless its a actual FIX for the
 real issues , not adding garbage i don't want or need&nbsp; , it was a total waste of my limited bandwidth for this mess i now have .....HELP !!!!!!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply , but you did not answer my questions &nbsp;, i have things minimized on my Taskbar , so i can fix/change them back , but i need answers first</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes i am the only user/admin &nbsp;, so that is what i don't get , why is it saying "Another Administrator " ?? , i am the ONLY administrator</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the "change" &nbsp;, i don't want the change &nbsp;, i want my Control Panel easily accessed like it was , the other "Settings" thing is a pain and takes 20 steps to find what was right there with the Control Panel &nbsp;, again , why does Microsoft insist on
 changing things that don't need changing , but fail to fix the things actually wrong with Windows 10 ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do i get the Control Panel back to my start menu , or how do i revert back to the Windows 10 before this crappy update that did nothing but screw everything up that i wanted to keep , and stop it from doing this update again ...ever .. ???</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not want these changes !!! &nbsp;PERIOD !! &nbsp;...EVER !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Also , now i have to search thru everything to get to "Screen Saver" , i used to be able to right click on the desktop and go to "Personalize" and it was there &nbsp;, now i have to do a actual SEARCH for it, which is STUPID &nbsp;, why change this with this idiotic
 update &nbsp;, why move something and make it harder to find &nbsp;, how is that a improvement ?????
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not happy with the way Microsoft is going &nbsp;, i may have to go back to Windows 7 and get rid of Windows 10 before it becomes completely useless &nbsp;, ............... again , now what took 1 step now takes 3 or more &nbsp;, how is this a update ?? &nbsp;, or improvement
 ??? &nbsp;, its a downgrade &nbsp;, is a 12 year old controlling Microsoft ?? , it sure seems like a kid with his face buried in his phone is deciding what the rest of the world needs on their PC &nbsp;, my PC is not a Tablet or Phone , its a PC and i want it to work like
 my PC did with XP or 7 &nbsp;, this APP garbage is ruining Windows , &nbsp;and is ruining my PC experience &nbsp;, it takes several more steps to do what once took 1 &nbsp; , i don't like being forced to change things that i WANT left alone ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do i get my Screen saver back to where i could access it easily ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do i get my Control Panel back where it was , easily accessed</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it keeps popping up that Windows Insider Requires Attention , so what do i do , &nbsp;to NOT allow it to change anything ???&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>There quite a few things gone in the Creators Upgrade, Control Panel and Command Prompt are missing from the right click on your Start Button as Microsoft say they are phasing these apps out -
<em><strong>they are still available by searching in Cortana, then if you want them on your Start Menu</strong></em>,<em><strong>right click the result in Cortana Search and choose 'Pin to Start'</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Lots of options like Display in Control Panel are gone, some have been moved to the Settings app like Screensaver is now on the Personalization - Lock Screen Setting - try figuring that one out !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screen Time out is also on the <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Personalization -&nbsp;</span>Lock Screen settings page instead of the Power options Settings Page ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft in their wisdom have removed the option to change text sizes on menu bard, icons . . . etc. totally, they are nowhere to be found . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>All you can do is scale everything, by right clicking your desktop, choose Display Settings and choose an option in 'Scale and Layout' or click Custom Scaling</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is not ideal as everything scales and that is not what a lot of users want . . .</p>

 also go to recovery and go back to previous build.&nbsp;

 seems the Command Prompt (as Admin) is missing now as well , i want that back as well please !</p>

            You can find the build by entering &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>winver &nbsp;</strong> in the start search bar, also can be found under
<em>about</em> in <strong>settings &nbsp;system</strong>&nbsp; you also can type control panel in search and &nbsp;you can select a desktop icon for control panel

<p>&nbsp;OK the Version/Build # is 1703 &nbsp; &nbsp;.... (Build 15063.13) &nbsp;, does that help any ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the "Insider" thing , i have never seen it before till this update , so i assume the Update chose this , as i sure did not &nbsp;, the Update , messed all this other stuff up , so why would you think it didn't choose this as well , i certainly did not
 want ANY of these changes , nor do i approve of ANY of them ...not happy about any of this mess Microsoft caused , and did not fix any of the issues that actually needed fixing , they just created more issues that now need to be fixed &nbsp;, and took away things
 i constantly use , &nbsp;because of a unnecessary update that just ruined the very few things i enjoy about Windows 10 &nbsp;.... , now its almost as useless and crappy as Windows 8/8.1 &nbsp;, big step backwards Microsoft &nbsp;, big step backwards &nbsp;...how about we just bring
 back support for XP and let everyone be trouble free again ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>So again , i did not Authorize anything , or sign up for anything , so i just want it to be left as it was &nbsp;, so how do i stop it from keeping asking me for Insider confirmation ??</p>

            I believe MS is moving things to make it harder for people to mess up things. but I do like the new search/start bar it finds a lot of missing things

            Thats a understatement , they are taking away control from my own PC &nbsp;, why ??? &nbsp;, i want MORE control and for Microsoft to STOP telling me what files i can access and when i CHOOSE to do Updates without having to make several command lines to do what
 used to be simple &nbsp;, or to do 3 actions to get to something that used to be at my fingertips , just so Microsoft can pat themselves on the back and say , "We are really ruining this OS for everyone , Good Job Everyone , were doing our best to drive away customers
 by ruining their experience using Windows from now on , everyone give yourselves a significant raise and praise yourself for the mess you are creating for your customers that are , with our help , completely miserable now ,... Yay !!"
