                    <p>Thanks. I will post there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I 'd like to ask&nbsp;how do I&nbsp;add in my Outlook.com email signature an image with a link&nbsp;like I can do in my&nbsp;Outlook desktop version?</p>

            <p>The image has to have public access.&nbsp; Do you login to wordpress to see the logo?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My signature image has a blue link line outlining it.</p>
<p>A few tricks were used.</p>
<p>Add your image to your signature.</p>
<p>Type&nbsp;an X&nbsp;before the image.</p>
<p>Highlight the X and make it into the wordpress link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Switch to Edit in HTML.</p>
<p>Put a space before and after X&lt;/a&gt; .</p>
<p>Delete the X.</p>
<p>Cut &lt;/a&gt; and paste it after the image code.</p>
<p>Save,</p>
<p>The image is now a link.&nbsp; </p>

            You cannot upgrade to Windows Phone 8, you can't even upgrade to 7.&nbsp; I'm not familiar with 6.5, so I'm not certain how you will need to sync it, if it is a Surface RT then you may not be able to at all.

            <p>Since the Windows Mobile OS has been discontinued for several years, you won't find much support for it. Your phone cannot be upgraded to a newer, more modern OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might be able to install Windows Mobile Device Center (WMDC) to your computer. This is the desktop software that is used to sync a Windows Mobile device to a Vista or Windows 7 computer. WMDC was not updated to make it work with Windows 8.1 so it might
 install to your computer and some things may sync, but I don't think it will sync your Outlook data. If you are hoping to sync your Outlook data to the phone, you might check out some third party syncing software, like CompanionLink.</p>

<p>What iPAQ do you have?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just created tasks on an iPAQ 1910, 5555 and 4700, Palm 700W, 750 and a JasJar with WM6.&nbsp; In each case I was able to create a Task with just a title.&nbsp; No Start or End was required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe I'm missing something so a little clarification would be helpful.</p>

<h2>            list Box Wizard options</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>According to the textbook I'm reading List/Combo box wizard whould I have 3 options when we add them on a form.</p>
<p>I use Access 2007 and the wizard only shows 2 options the last one which is "Find a Record on my form based on the value I selected in my combo" is missing.</p>
<p>This option is used to search for a specififc record based on the selected value.</p>
<p>First Q : what am I missing here? how can get this option on the wizard?</p>
<p>Second Q If this option is removed from 07 then how can I add a combo/listbox on a fom that&nbsp;has the same search functionality?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>hi jc7517,</p>
<p>to clarify the situation, i’d like to collect the following information:</p>
<p>1. a screenshot of the error message.</p>
<p>to upload screenshots, please click <b>use rich formatting</b> in this thread and select the
<b>insert/edit media</b> icon.</p>
<p>2. try inter explorer and check the result.</p>
<p>3. check if this issue occurs with all the excel files or a specific file.</p>
<p>4. go to internet explorer &gt; <b>tools</b> &gt; <b>safety</b> &gt; uncheck <b>active x filtering</b> to see the outcome.</p>
<p>5. go to internet explorer &gt; <b>tools</b> &gt; <b>programs </b>&gt; <b>manage add-ons</b>. make sure all the sharepoint add-ons are enabled.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=9f14ce64-c446-4cf8-bc02-e394e60f8224" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d9f14ce64-c446-4cf8-bc02-e394e60f8224" /></a></p>
<p>meanwhile, you can consider using the workaround to export the spread to a sharepoint list referring to this article:

                    I use Windows 7 and Office 2010.<br />
I wanted to locate my ,pst file so I found two.&nbsp; One under LOCAL and the second under ROAMING.&nbsp; They were the current date but not the same size.&nbsp; Evidently I'm using both, but that confounds me.<br />
Questions:<br />
1. What is the rationale for LOCAL vs. LOCAL LOW vs. ROAMING?<br />
2. Why does my Outlook use both LOCAL &amp; ROAMING?<br />
3. Do I need to backup both to have a reliable backup .pst?<br />

<p>Most likely, the pst-file in your ROAMING folder is the one that you need to back up. The pst-file that is located in the LOCAL folder is probably from an IMAP account that you have configured and is being used for local caching only.</p>
<p>The default location for non-caching pst-files in Outlook 2010 is your My Documents\Outlook Files folder.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The "somehow" part means that the same email account was configured twice which would not have happened on its own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're going to need to start from the beginning in terms of what all transpired in terms of retrieving your old emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It "sounds" like you configured Outlook on a new machine and what you wanted to do is
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - recreate the same account as you had before&nbsp;- in this case going to bet it was&nbsp;one using the POP3 protocol</p>
<p>2 - when the&nbsp;POP account was created - you opted to let Outlook create a new .pst file instead of using your old one</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the above sound right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In terms of your current configuration - what "types" (POP, IMAP etc) of accounts are currently configured? If you don't know, go to
</p>
<p>File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; email accounts listed under the &lt;Email Tab&gt; - 2nd column shows the "account type"</p>

            <p>
</p><blockquote>The old account was pop3, but Comcast wants you to use imap, so I changed it.&nbsp; What can I do?
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - You can simply delete the POP3 email account - that has no impact on any PST files that were or are currently associated with the email account itself. Outlook doesn't delete .pst files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Just for clarity - what you see in the Outlook NAV pane are the data files associated with your email account(s) and not the email accounts themselves (i.e. if you had 5 POP3 accounts using the same PST file - there would only be one folder tree for
 all 5 accounts). There will &lt;always&gt; be a separate folder tree in the Nav pane for every IMAP/Exchange ActiveSync/Exchange&nbsp;email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - Now to your "missing data". The only reason/way that would happen is if you set the POP3 account to use a new Outlook data file instead of pay attention to the options on the right hand side which would have allowed you to select an existing PST file.
 You're going to have to locate your original PST file --&gt; add it back to your Outlook profile --&gt; and remove the new PST file that was created. Your old PST file will also likely have been the default data file which means that's where you're going to find
 your contacts/calendar data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#4 - One thing about IMAP Accounts using OL'2013/OL'2016 is that you really want to pay attention to which data file is set as the "default" for the Outlook profile. If the IMAP account was/is &lt;either&gt; the first account configured or is the &lt;only&gt; account
 configured (which by definition means it was also the first) - contacts will be stored in the IMAP .ost file and will have the words "This Computer Only" in the folder description. In a nutshell, if you're OST file ever gets separated from the Imap account
 that created it - you will lose all the data in any folder marked with "This Computer Only".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going to stop here - you first need to locate your old PST file and can then go through your various options once that's done.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Looked how - via Windows file explorer or via Outlook --&gt; File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Data Files tab?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't start bouncing around identifying lists of files without indicating where you're looking and what you're using (as in Outlook vs File Explorer) because if you do - this is going to become seriously counter-productive in a hurry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So............................</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - How many email accounts are configured in your Outlook profile and what type are they (POP, IMAP etc)?</p>
<p>File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; list of accounts under &lt;email tab&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - How many data files do you have configured?</p>
<p>File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; list of files and their location under &lt;Data Files&gt; tab</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - Which data file is configured as the default for the profile?</p>
<p>one of the files in the list for item #2 will be the default for the profile</p>
<p>
</p><p>#4 - There will be one entry in the Outlook &lt;Nav&gt; Pane for every data file in item #2. Do any of those contain all your old emails/contacts etc and if yes - take note of which one
</p>
<p>
</p><p>#5 - The files with a size of 265kb are empty and be ignored - the rest of them contain data with what appears to be multiple copies of the same data but before any time is spent with files showing via &lt;File Explorer&gt; - first step is to take inventory of
 what is actually showing/in use within Outlook.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short - you need to check where your data is located via the &lt;Nav Pane&gt; - which is shown in the screenshot<br />
- item#1 in the screenshot is the &lt;NavPane&gt; area </p>
<p>-&nbsp;item#2 is how to manage what appears in the &lt;NavPane</p>
<p>- item#3 - if the &lt;NavPane&gt; doesn't appear when you open Outlook - look for a small arrow pointing in the other direction then what you see in the screenshot on the right hand side.</p>

<h2>            Unable to restore Lumia 950, no backups found during factory reset</h2>
                    <p>I've new Lumia 950 and old Lumia 640 (Windows Phone 8.1). I can see backup of my Lumia 640 on OneDrive. During Lumia 950 setup no backup is offered. I'm connected to wifi, I've&nbsp;connected to my Microsoft account successfully. I've&nbsp;tried to backup Lumia 950
 and I did factory reset again. I've two backups on OneDrive now (Lumia 640, Lumia 950)&nbsp;and no backup is offered during factory reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I restore phone from backup? Where is the problem? I've tried factory reset already 5 times. Is backup just some "fake" feature that doesn't work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi, yes, I would like to restore SMS, MMS etc. from Lumia 640 to Lumia 950. Problem is, that no backup is offered
</p>
<p>during factory reset. So I've setup Lumia 950 without restore, created backup from 950 to test backup funcionality and performed factory reset again. No backup&nbsp;was offered during factory reset.</p>
<p>You can see my backups here:</p>

            <p>SMS/MMS are not included in the system restore offered during the first setup.<br />
They sync in the background along with mail, contacts and calendars, when the phone is set up with the same primary Microsoft account as the other phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 'Transfer my data' app on the WP8.1 phone can backup contacts, SMS and MMS locally, but I don't know for sure if that backup can be restored to a W10M phone.<br />
I don't have a W10M to test, but would expect it to work.<br />
Please take care not to create multiple copies of the contacts in the cloud if you try this.<br />
<strong>EDIT:</strong> A local backup of contacts in .CSV format can be created after login at<br />
<a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/people</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>All 'Live' features and Outlook Mail is currently work-in-progress, and upgrades roll out in batches. What works on my account may not work for others and vice/versa, but I certainly expect one Microsoft account to work with multiple phones and other devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you get it sorted out.</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't won't to change my primary account - it's nonsense in my opinion, all my apps and everything else is&nbsp;bound to my account. I don't need to transfer mail, contacts and calendars, because it's synchronized with my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can backup Windows 10 Mobile (Lumia 950)&nbsp;but I cannot restore it. If it's because I have Windows Phone 8.1&nbsp;(Lumia 640)&nbsp;with the same account, I don't know, but it seems be strange that you can backup but you cannot restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I've decided to transfer just SMS and MMS. Windows Phone 8.1&nbsp;has application
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-cy/store/p/contacts-message-backup/9nblgggz57gm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
contacts+message backup</a>. It works and I'm able to backup my messages to SD. But it's not possible to install this application to Windows 10 Mobile! Error code is 0x80240024 (trying already 24 hours with the same result). Windows 10 Mobile is just after
 factory reset and fully updated and "contacts+message backup" is the first application I'm trying to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only wish is to transfer SMS and MMS from Windows Phone 8.1 do Windows 10 Mobile. How&nbsp;can&nbsp;I&nbsp;do it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Issue with activating benefit</h2>
                    
<p>i've been trying to activate my msdn office 365 benefit for quite a while. the problem is in the office 365 system - can anyone help me?</p>
<p><br />
i get the dreaded error message, </p>
<p><span><span>the service you’re subscribing to isn’t available for one of the following reasons:<br />
</span></span></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>it’s no longer offered by microsoft. </li><li>you’ve already tried this service. you can sign up for a trial only once. </li><li>the beta or trial you’re requesting has expired. </li><li>the promotion code has already been used. </li></ul>
<p>the path i took was: </p>

<p>then</p>

<div>
<div>
<p><br />
when i click on the portal link, the error message comes up immediately. i spend 6+ hours this week bouncing through all departments at msdn and office 365. the conclusion was that the office 365 portal doesn't like something about me and no one can tell me
 what it is. msdn has confirmed that i have the benefit and the problem isn't on their end. would someone please help?<br />
<br />
thanks, rick</p>

<p>Daisy, I'm sorry to say that the answer you provided is incorrect. I spent 6 hours going back and forth between the Office 365 and MSDN support. The Office 365 portal refuses to process information for some MSDN, subscribers, especially those in the Bizspark
 program like me. Office 365 support refuses to open a case and the MSDN support staff is certain the problem lies within the Office 365 system, as am I.</p>
<p>Please put me in contact with senior management. This is a continuing issue that reflects poorly on Microsoft and is so exasperating that people have given up trying. As you can see, I've been contacted by others with the same issue.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Rick Hansen</p>

<p>It was the same with the old partner benefits - like pulling teeth. Good idea in theory but the execution is deplorable. I don't know why Msft continues to offer things they can't follow up on.</p>

    <title>Removed IE and now Hyperlinks won&#39;t work in Outlook 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> moondoggy_451  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removed IE and now Hyperlinks won&#39;t work in Outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>I was reading an article today that stated there was a vulnerability that, even though IE was not your default browser, access could be gained by clicking on a file of a particular file type associate with IE.&nbsp; Since Microsoft has been encouraging people
 to not use IE I thought the sensible thing to do was to remove IE from my Windows 10 PC.&nbsp; After doing this I now have a problem where clicking on any hyperlink in Outlook 2010 fails with the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this computer. Please contact your system administrator.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I searched the internet and the solutions said to change the HTM and HTML default classes in HKCU to be htmlfile in both default settings.&nbsp; The only problem there is that the defaults are already set to htmlfile.&nbsp; I
 thought it might be the default browser settings or the default browser settings for the file types were messed up but they were both indicated that my default browser is BRAVE.&nbsp; I even tried to change my default browser to EDGE but that didn't work either.&nbsp;
 Short of reinstalling IE is there a fix or a registry hack or hacks that I can deploy to restore the ability to click on a hyperlink and launch my default browser whatever that browser might be?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Any help would be deeply appreciated.</span></p>

            Hi  Moondoggy_451
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />I would reinstall Internet Explorer, Microsoft is not gonna leave an open vulnerability in IE on a modern supported version of Windows. 
<br />
<br />Also, Outlook 2010 predates Windows 10 by 5 years, so, its gonna have dependencies on IE 11 not available in modern web browsers such as Edge. Otherwise, your best option is to upgrade to a modern version of Outlook such as Outlook 2016 or 2019 since support for Outlook 2010 is ending next year.

    <title>Missing updates&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angel del norte  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing updates&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Evening folks. I hope you're all well? <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now, both builds of Win 10 so far have left me with this blasted power-off/ sleep etc issue; I've left detailed feedback elsewhere.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But I found, in among all the searches, mention of a couple of updates for Win 10, specifically including one called KB 3010668, reputed to fix the very issues I'm having. This has, according to my update history, not been installed, nor does it show up
 when I check for updates (neither does the other one). <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">The update history is strangely truncated, actually (is it stored anywhere else?); I know that a few dozen have gone in since Saturday, when I installed the 9841 build on this machine and then upgraded, but only
 seven are showing. So I've no way of knowing if it's already been installed; in any case, the badness is still in evidence. I tried resetting the Windows Update components today, and rechecking, but no luck.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So, all I wanted to ask is this: is there anywhere I can simply download the update in question to install it? Or any way of persuading the update to have a
<em>proper</em> look? It's really maddening if something exists which might solve the problem, but I cannot get to it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The lack of Sleep is wearing me down... </p>
<p>
</p><p>Rob </p>

            <p>Not&nbsp; sure why your computer should be keeping you awake. If it is updating or attempting to update during the night change the time to update to during the daytime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows updates are recorded in two spots on the update screen under control panel &nbsp;- to the left of the update spot which on mine shows the updates to windows defender and&nbsp;near the bottom left corner under installed updates it shows windows updates which
 mine shows four.</p>
<p>

                    <p>Office 2016 app installed (Windows 10) a few weeks ago and was working fine but now Outlook has message about IMap and previous downloaded e-mails in search facility once passed this it does not respond and message saying "Outlook has topped working" appears
 as the programme shuts down.</p>
<p>Tried using online repair tools but this appeared to delete all of Office apps.&nbsp; Reinstall appears to have reinstated all programmes, but Outlook still keeps same problem.</p>

            Below are general troubleshooting options for Outlook. Try one by one and and check after each step
<br />
<br />1. Create new Outlook profile to rule out corruption in Outlook profile. - <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/create-an-outlook-profile-ha102749460.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Repair your Outlook data files - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-Outlook-Data-Files-pst-and-ost-64842a0a-658a-4324-acc6-ef0a6e3567cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />3. Run SCANPST.exe. Open your Outlook &gt; Press CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to open Task Manager &gt; Under processes tab, right click on Outlook.exe &gt; Open File Location &gt; This location contains SCANPST.exe which you should double clikc to run
<br />
<br />4. Disable Anti-virus temporarily. 
<br />
<br />5. There is a possibility that some Add-in is causing the problem. To rule this out, start Outlook in safe mode. Hold CTRL key and click on Outlook icon. Don't leave CTRL key, till it asks for the confirmation about safe mode. 
<br />
<br />6. Login to Windows with a new profile to rule out problem in Windows profile. 
<br />
<br />7. Right click on Outlook icon and run as Administrator.

            It’s just search that isn’t working? It looks like there might be a problem with an update that affected search. I’ve seen other complaints but don’t know if rebuilding the index helped them.

<p>Disabled all add ins exempt Microsoft VBA, as there does not appear to be away to do this.&nbsp; No change when trying to open normally.</p>
<p>NB opening in Safe Mode only works with the new profile I created, when trying with the original the programme freezes and then the original dialogue&nbsp; "outlook has stopped working" appears, programme shuts down.</p>

<h2>            Contacts not listing in Smartphone &#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've a HP IPAQ 514 Smartphone. It was working pretty well but its acting strange now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past if I wanted to dial someone's number from the home screen I'd just start spelling out their name, first or last, and all the names that matched those would list........now it seems its deciding to not
 list all the name matching...example..I have 14 people with the surname "Ryan" in my contacts.....from the home screen if I type ryan (ie press 7926) it only lists 9 of the contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are no special filters turned on......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem just seems to have "appeared" in the last 2 days...dont know why</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems as if there is a disconnect between the contact app and the smartphone app.....strange !!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions ? I'm avoiding a hard reset as I have other apps installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Eric.</p>

            <p>The first question you need to ask yourself is whether the form contains legacy form fields, which is the only reason to restrict text "for filling in forms". If there are no legacy form fields -- for example, if the form uses only content controls to accept
 input -- then don't use that type of restriction. Instead, you can use one of two other kinds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the "No changes (Read only)" type of restriction. Then select the areas (such as content controls and the places where the hyperlinks will be inserted) and check the Everyone box in the Exceptions section of the pane.</li><li>If you are using content controls, insert a Rich Text control at the place where the hyperlink will be added. Then select the whole document and click Developer &gt; Group &gt; Group. That protects all the text outside the content controls to prevent editing
 and formatting.</li></ul>
<p>If you must use legacy form fields (because some users will have Word 2003 or earlier, or Word for Mac), you can insert a continuous section break before the hyperlink entry point and another break after the hyperlink. (This will force the hyperlink entry
 point to be in its own paragraph.) In the Restrict pane, after selecting "Filling in Forms", click the "Select sections" link that appears below the dropdown. In the dialog that opens, uncheck the section between the two section breaks, and click OK. Start
 enforcing protection. The user will be able to insert a hyperlink in the space between the section breaks.</p>

    <title>&#34;Unable to display the folder. Microsoft Office Outlook could not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andylofgren  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Unable to display the folder. Microsoft Office Outlook could not access the specified folder location&#34; in Outlook 2003 with Hotmail accounts and Outlook Connector.</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I have been experiencing repeated, ongoing problems with Outlook functionality in relation to my Hotmail accounts. It had seemed that everything was perfectly fine, until a few years ago someone at Microsoft came up with the brilliant(?) idea of deciding
 to disallow Hotmail access with Outlook via HTTP, which had allowed for a very simple, user-friendly and straightforward configuration process. One day, someone at Microsoft decided that it might be wise to shut down the functionality associated with this
 existing HTTP, Hotmail Outlook configuration in favor of requiring Hotmail Outlook users to download and install the so called "Outlook Connector," simply to be able to use Outlook in connection with a Hotmail account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Ever since this supposedly bright(?) idea was implemented, I have encountered serious Outlook functionality impairments with my Hotmail accounts, which are thereby now required to operate via the new “Outlook Connector,” just to be able to send and
 receive email. Not long after this policy change was implemented (which by the way caused additional, unnecessary time expenditure on the part of impacted users) all Hotmail accounts within my Outlook 2003 application were failing to successfully send and
 receive. It had furthermore seemed that this supposed “improvement,” on the part of Microsoft was so relatively “fool proof” that this deficiency (of the send/receive failure) continued to remain, despite all attempts of my part to resolve it. I of course,
 afforded some relatively basic (but nonetheless, potentially time consuming) efforts in addressing the matter, which included uninstalling / reinstalling “Outlook Connector,” and removing / re-adding the affected Hotmail accounts. Unfortunately however, no
 basic measures such as these turned out to be sufficient, in order to resolve this service failure which was afforded me, courtesy of Microsoft. Upon concluding that I had already wasted enough time attempting to resolve this misfortunate deficiency (which
 was) presented me, on the part of Microsoft I finally decided to simply discard the proposition of using Hotmail as a primary means of email communication.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>…</span></p>
<p><span>Now, two or more years later I have found myself in the position of restoring my system to an Acronis image which I created way back in 2008. I decided, that I might wish to re-attempt attaining a successful Hotmail, Outlook configuration... and perhaps
 in the process afford Microsoft the “benefit of the doubt,” as for any prospect that it might not yet have sufficiently resolved these associated, created deficiencies of their part: Upon installing the otherwise worthless “Outlook Connector” (which of course,
 is now required for Outlook Hotmail access) it had seemed that my Hotmail accounts were working okay… That is, until a situation arose which allowed the (evil,) “Outlook Connector” to strike once again:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>My Hotmail accounts were successfully downloading in Outlook, which happens to be a several hour process due to the size of my mailboxes. Considering that maybe a couple hours or so (at least,) were needed for the process to complete I left my laptop
 unattended, and headed out. I returned home sometime after about an hour and a half or so. My computer, for whatever reason had become powered off while I was gone. It didn’t even bother to hibernate, it just “shut down,” without saving the current desktop
 state. Although the mailbox download in Outlook had made some considerable progress while I was gone, it was not entirely complete. Upon restarting, I allowed the process to complete.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Unfortunately however, as a result of this non-anticipated shutdown (the cause of which, I still am not aware) all Hotmail accounts in my Outlook application began displaying the error "Unable to display the folder. Microsoft Office Outlook could not
 access the specified folder location” upon selecting them. As was recommended by one or more posts I was able to locate in an online search regarding this error, I ran the “scanpst.exe Inbox Repair Tool” on each Outlook data file. Supposedly, the tool found
 errors in each of these data files, and although I chose the “repair” option in each case, this did not provide for a different end result of any kind. It took over three hours to run this tool on all of my Outlook data files, and it did not appear that any
 benefit at all, ultimately resulted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This is the current state of affairs… All Hotmail accounts in my Outlook 2003 application are encountering this failure, whereas the one account which is not a Hotmail account (and which therefore doesn’t need to rely upon the highly problematic “Outlook
 Connector,” just to send and receive email) still works just fine. It seems as though any little mishap, although be it extremely minor seems to have a potential to cause this lousy “Outlook Connector” to forever fail in its operation on your personal machine.
 Is it even worth pursuing a resolution to this failure, or might I be more wise to simply just discard entirely this lousy proposition of using Hotmail with Outlook, thanks to this supposed “improvement” which has been so bestowed upon us, courtesy of Microsoft?
 Let’s say I spend five or ten hours trying to resolve this failure… Even if I am to be successful, it does nevertheless in any case still seem quite probable that a repeat of this scenario, might again be encountered at some time in the future?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Question #1: What is the solution to this extremely lousy (and in a way, perhaps artificial) user-experience deficiency, which has been so provided for us in this respect courtesy of Microsoft, via their “Outlook Connector” requirement? Question #2:
 Is achieving this solution even worth the time that must be invested in order to accomplish such, considering the extremely problematic nature of “Outlook Connector,” Hotmail accounts and Outlook 2003?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you,</span></p>
<p><span>-Andy Lofgren</span></p>

            <p>I am for the most part otherwise happy with Office 2003, as it seems to be adequately providing for all of my existing needs. I do not feel however, that I deserve to pay an extra $120, simply due to this required downgrade on the part of Microsoft, being
 their problematic "Outlook Connector.” (I do know however, that it may be in Microsoft’s interest for me to do so.) Microsoft could have continued to allow Outlook to communicate with Hotmail in the same, ordinary (and otherwise, problem free) manner by which
 it did previously... And which also happens to be, the same means by which all other email services work in connection with Outlook (whether it be by POP, IMAP or HTTP,) being by means of an ordinary user configuration as opposed to the necessitated installation
 of an additional, specialized plug in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is deeply unfortunate from a consumer standpoint, when all is working just fine with a particular service until some mandatory, unnecessary change is needlessly forced upon them, as was done in this instance here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps, it might have been because Microsoft owns Hotmail that it for some reason felt some need, to try to make its own email offering "special," in relation to its operation with Outlook? Perhaps Hotmail, being a service operated by Microsoft, deserved
 to enjoy some special status, or form of observance in the Outlook application, which ordinary users would be able to notice? Based on this action of Microsoft, here is what a consumer might reasonably attribute to their possible line of reasoning, in the
 course of making this decision:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>"To&nbsp;h*ll with the prospect of any undesirable consequences or problems some users might encounter, in the course of their (now) required utilization of our so called, latest "improvement": Let's just force everyone with Outlook and Hotmail to use our new
 "Outlook Connector" in any case, just so we (Microsoft) can feel special knowing that our little change we have implemented here, will resultingly be experienced by all Outlook Hotmail users, who will then all surely understand our unique position which we
 happen to be in, of being both the maker of Outlook and the owner of Hotmail. In fact, we believe this relationship (of us owning both) is in fact so special that we have decided to permanently disallow access to Hotmail by ordinary means and thereby force
 everyone to use our all new "Outlook Connector," such that they might forcibly be caused to pay some observance for this "special," unique position we enjoy. Oh and by the way, for those who subsequently encounter serious problems as a result of our implemented
 "improvement..." We didn't care at all for the prospect of providing for any further degree of operational redundancy, which we could so easily have afforded our users simply by not shutting off existing HTTP access and still allowing new configurations to
 take place via this route... For, in such case if we were to leave this on, most people would prefer not to be needlessly inconvenienced by changing their existing setup in the first place, and therefore would not experience (and thereby pay their respects
 to,) our new "Outlook Connector" because their email would still be working just fine (we’ll have to change this.) As a result, many would not get to see this latest invention of our part, consisting of our highly prized "Outlook Connector," and thus might
 not appreciate much this unique position we enjoy of owning and controlling both services.
</li><li>So, here's our conspiracy: To make ourselves feel important, let's just decide to shut off access for everyone right now, and just force everyone using Outlook with Hotmail to download, install and subsequently (forever) use, our prized "Outlook Connector?"
 That way, no one in this situation will fail to appreciate our new "Outlook Connector" application, or fail to observe Hotmail's unique status of being owned by Microsoft, the maker of Outlook."</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some rationale of this sort may very well illustrate how the conspiracy went, in the minds of those perpetrating it at Microsoft. And I definitely don't feel this artificial, unnecessary, and negligently perpetrated "improvement" of their part, deserves
 to cost me $120 for an upgrade in order to correct. Rather, I think Microsoft should take some reasonable responsibility here, and perhaps also recognize that it has already successfully perpetrated this "mass migration" which it desired, in forcing all Outlook
 Hotmail users to pay their observance to the new "Outlook Connector." Considering that this objective has since been accomplished, and whoever at Microsoft who made this decision has subsequently, presumably by now gotten their desired recognition which they
 had sought (in forcing the widespread use of their otherwise worthless "Outlook Connector,") perhaps it might now be time for someone else at Microsoft to clean up after this shenanigan, by throwing this useless invention “in the trash," where it belongs?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no legitimate reason for Microsoft to continue requiring Hotmail access, whether it be by Outlook or another client, to be any more difficult, complicated, problematic, inconvenient, incompatible or otherwise restricted than it really needs to be.
 An email service that has unnecessary restrictions relating to how (or in some cases, whether or not it even can) be configured with any otherwise capable email client, is most definitely not “top of the line.” Unnecessary restrictions and needless inconveniences
 in this respect, only contribute to the service’s “low end” perception, especially among IT professionals who are then less likely to recommend the service to other people they know. Rather, the objective should be to make the service the most “top of the
 line,” widely used, most capable, and universally accessible email service in existence. Microsoft may already have an edge with its generous allowance of a 7GB file storage capacity, which might be beyond the ability of many other email services to offer
 their users, at the “free” level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Requiring this," or "requiring that," or needlessly, further limiting the functionality options available for consumers (especially within a capacity that is entirely unnecessary,) really is not in anyone's interest at all... However there is one, rather
 notable exception here (in relation to this,) and having some considerable degree of applicability, in the matter of this current deficiency which I have herein identified: I would speculate that some benefit may very well have been realized on the part of
 whoever it was at Microsoft who created this "Outlook Connector" application, for purposes relating to their quest to command additional (and also, highly undeserved) recognition, which they might perceive to be associated with the subsequent, widespread use
 of their created application… although be it achieved, through forcible means. I am afraid, that at the end of the day they may be the only ones who might actually have benefited from the creation and the subsequent, forced (consumer) use of this “Outlook
 Connector” application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My proposition is this... This is a Microsoft forum, so presumably Microsoft should soon be aware of my presented inquiry:</p>
<p>How about simply allowing those users who prefer, to discard their problematic "Outlook Connector" and access Hotmail through Outlook by means of an ordinary configuration, of the type used by all other email services, which are not owned by Microsoft? This
 might alleviate Microsoft of some direct blame in the case of scenarios such as this, or at least make the situation a little less outrageous by allowing users to bypass the apparent source of the problem. I personally perceive this requirement to use this
 "Outlook Connector" for Outlook Hotmail access to be a little arrogant, short-sighted and perhaps even selfish on the part of Microsoft.</p>

            Some additional information, regarding the failure encountered:<br />
<br />
I have discovered that I can re-add the Hotmail account in Outlook Connector (whether or not the existing .OST hotmail file is renamed,) and Outlook will create a new associated .OST file, and begin the mailbox download process anew (starting of course, from
 the beginning.) Although the .OST file will grow in size in accordance with the corresponding Hotmail mailbox, and beside “Inbox” (in Outlook) for this Hotmail account, there is a number in parentheses (indicating the number of new mail messages,) unfortunately
 the exact same error as before is still encountered, “Unable to display the folder. Microsoft Office Outlook could not access the specified folder location.” This was after another uninstallation / reinstallation of the “Outlook Connector,” and renaming or
 moving all .OST files associated with the connector. Upon completion of the mailbox download process it appears that I am able to send mail utilizing this Hotmail account with Outlook, however these sent messages cannot be viewed in the “Sent” category of
 any mail folder in Outlook. This is the exact same extent of operation that I experienced a few days ago, upon recently encountering the failure (in other words, absolutely nothing changed in terms of functionality, as a result of these measures.)
<br />
<br />
It seems that this “Outlook Connector” truly is quite hopeless… After it fails just once, it never again wishes to work, seemingly ever. I recall a few years ago, not long after this “Outlook Connector” requirement was initially implemented I had encountered
 this same failure, and was unable to resolve it then just as I am unable to resolve it now. Again I had previously given up on Hotmail, and only now recently reattempted on the same machine, after loading a 2008 image which allowed me the opportunity to start
 anew, and it was this exact same (seemingly) unresolvable failure that I again encountered in very short order thanks to our pal, the friendly “Outlook Connector.” Thank you “Outlook Connector,” for your contribution to the Outlook, Hotmail experience of many
 users; Outlook 2003 most certainly could not be the same, without your contribution.<br />
<br />
So, does anyone at Microsoft have anything to say about this?<br />

            For comments from MS, you would surely be better off talking to them over phone.<br />
As with any ms software, even the older HTTP protocol had a lot of issues, and in keeping with the requests from users for a better platform, the MAPI protocol was released.<br />
You can still configure most hotmail / msn accounts as POP 3, which does indeed provide a more stable platform, so you may think of moving to that as well.<br />

<br />
Is this suggestion of your part, actually true? For some reason, I (for whatever reason,) am not currently aware of this possibility... However, if it is in fact legitimate I shall wish to request of you now, that you please provide the applicable POP 3 settings
 which shall successfully allow for this desirable Hotmail, Outlook configuration of my part. Perhaps I might also comment that if this possibility (as you suggest) does in fact exist, I am afraid this may portray Microsoft within an even dimmer context, for
 their part in failing to make this significant fact known or to even bother informing me of such possibility, after the extent of my present time expenditure (and subsequent postings) in relation to this matter, herein described.<br />

            So that you know, I tried adding an MSN account in my Outlook 2003 utilizing the POP3 settings found at
 Outlook, it still does not appear. However, it does continue to remain listed in the list found at Tools / E-mail Accounts / View or change existing email accounts.<br />
<br />
I do by the way, still have this (extremely) problematic 'Outlook Connector' application installed, only so that I might at least be able to send mail with one of my Hotmail accounts, although be it with all the deficiencies previously mentioned, to include
 being unable to view received or sent messages.<br />
<br />
Might it be necessary, for me to perhaps uninstall this (highly) problematic 'Outlook Connector,' in order to be able to successfully take advantage of these settings? ...Or, might Outlook 2003, perhaps (in this instance,) decide to inform me... That such a
 measure of attempted configuration, is not allowed?<br />

            I appreciate the information, provided of your part... However, I have now uninstalled the (highly) problematic 'Outlook Connector' and subsequently tested the supposed Hotmail, POP3 settings which had been provided at the previously indicated website,
 and which consist of the following:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>POP server: pop3.live.com</li><li>POP server port: 995</li><li>POP SSL required? Yes</li><li>User name: Your Windows Live ID, for example *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</li><li>Password: The password you usually use to sign in to Hotmail or Windows Live</li><li>SMTP server: smtp.live.com<br />
</li><li>SMTP server port: 25 or 587</li><li>SMTP Authentication required? Yes (same as POP3 username and password)</li><li>SMTP SSL required? Yes<br />
</li></ul>
<br />
Although a successful result was supposedly achieved upon selecting the "<span style="font-style: italic">Test Account Settings ...</span>" option during the configuration process, I am afraid this isn't quite how the real functionality in Outlook 2003, turned
 out to be. First of all the same, initially experienced failure (as before) was again encountered, consisting of the account not appearing with the other email accounts in the left hand pane of Outlook 2003, and this furthermore did not change upon closing
 and reopening the application.<br />
<br />
The account did however, still remain listed in the list at <span style="font-style: italic">
Tools / E-mail Accounts / View or change existing email accounts</span>, and also appeared in the "<span style="font-style: italic">Accounts</span>" drop down box which appears in the message composition window, after the "<span style="font-style: italic">New</span>"
 option is selected to compose a new message. Upon sending a test message, the first error encountered was as follows:<br />
<br />
 service provider (ISP).'</span><br />
<br />
Although the previously mentioned website indicates that supposedly "SMTP SSL" is required, this error was encountered in any case. Upon deselecting the "<span style="font-style: italic">This server requires a secure connection (SSL)</span>" check box under
 "<span style="font-style: italic">Outgoing Server (SMTP)</span>" in <span style="font-style: italic">
Tools / Email Accounts / Change / More Settings / Advanced tab</span>, the selected port changed itself from
 which was then shortly followed by the next one:<br />
<br />
 service provider (ISP).'</span><br />
<br />
<br />
In these preceding posts, I have provided a very detailed description of the problem encountered, and my subsequent attempts to resolve it.<br />
<br />
I am afraid, that this Hotmail / Outlook 2003 combination truly seems to be a "service from h*ll," thanks to our "wise" folks at Microsoft who, in their infinite wisdom decided to intentionally implement entirely unnecessary, needless restrictive measures which
 have effectively all but eliminated any potential fall back options to which one could otherwise, potentially have resorted in the event of experiencing such problematic disturbances as these, with Microsoft's prized 'Outlook Connector.' It is important to
 remember that these errors, and consumer-preventative measures that were implemented (on the part of Microsoft) were entirely intentional, and together comprise the sole cause of the consumer's inability to resolve (by means of any apparently available workaround,)
 the explicit deficiency which I have herein described and experienced myself, first hand.<br />
<br />
Perhaps we shall see whether or not anyone at Microsoft might demonstrate any concern at all, for the prospect of assisting those who have fallen victim to its (highly) problematic 'Outlook Connector,' and associated requirements. (Note that these responses
 of my part just today have consumed another 2 or so hours of my time, and this is in addition to the other numerous hours of my time already consumed by this matter, which likely is greater than this value by a factor of 10 or more.)

<p>
</p><p>Programs &amp; Features -&gt; Microsoft Office (your version) 2016 -&gt; Change -&gt; Quick Repair</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note the problem with Office 2016 is not fixed as I have to repeat this every 2-3 months to get the jump lists back.</p>

<p>It's time to do the happy dance....<strong>I FOUND A SOLUTION!!!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, since receiving a new PC at work (Windows 10 Pro) a couple of months ago, I've wrestled with the problem of not being able to see a list of my pinned or recent items in Excel when I right clicked on my Excel shortcut on the Windows task bar like I used
 to do with my old system. It's been driving me crazy reading and trying all the tips and tricks found in these online blogs and never finding a solution to my problem. That is until today.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started thinking about the problem, as I do most work days, and why it is that my jump list and recent items worked with the MS Word task bar shortcut but not Excel. Then I started to count the number of items I had pinned in Word and counted 8 items.
 Remembering back to the excel jump list I used to use on my old system, I realized I most likely had more than 8 items. Which meant, maybe I wasn't seeing these items because I had more than 8. So I did a quick internet search and did as others suggested and
 opened up Excel and went to File, Options, Advanced and under the Display section increased the number of recent files listed from 10 to 20. That increased the number of items in the quick launch section of Excel, but not for the task bar as I had hoped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>That's when it finally hit me, since this isn't a problem with MS Office like I thought it must be a problem with Windows 10. So I searched for how to increase the number of jump list items in Windows and discovered this amazing article that fixed my problem.
 Now, not only can I see all my pinned items, but I can see a list of recent items as well. FINALLY!!!! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check out the article. I hope this helps you as it did me.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/windows-10-hack-how-to-beef-up-your-jump-lists-to-show-more-pinned-items/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Jump List Workaround</a></p>
