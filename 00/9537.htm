<h2>            slides distorted</h2>
                    <div>I made PP on my old W10 computer with 365 (I think). On my new computer I have PP Home and Student. When I opened my old PP's, the format was messed up. Arrows were shifted, dialogue went off the page.
 How do I fix this? What do I Save As to?</div>

            <p>Is it that the arrows where shifted or that text the arrows pointed to has moved?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not at all unusual for text to change when you move a presentation from the computer it was created on to a different computer that doesn't have the same fonts installed.&nbsp; Since it can't use the font it should, PPT substitutes another font from the
 ones that are available.&nbsp; Sometimes this is all but unnoticeable, sometimes it completely messes things up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check to see what font's used for your text, then go to Control Panel | Fonts to verify that the same font is actually installed.&nbsp;

<h2>            Anyone successfully deleted&#47;cleared WebcacheV01.dat file&#63;</h2>
                    <p>IE 10 no longer utilizes index.dat files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead it stores all browsing information (cookies/history/visited URL's)&nbsp;in a database located at&nbsp; C:\user\username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\WebCache\WebcacheV01.dat</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This file accumulates all activities the way the index.dat files did on earlier IE versions and presents the same privacy issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone successfully deleted/cleared this file?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thx</p>

            <p>Thanks, but we are all taking this IE change regarding privacy too generally and too lightly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There has been a lot written over the years on how to delete/clear the index.dat files utilized with all IE browsers up until IE10.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting with IE10 Microsoft switched to utilizing a database to hold all your browsing information - history/cookies/url sites visited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Delete Browsing history option does not delete this cache of information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to start a dialogue/thread on how users can manage this potential privacy issue when utilizing the new generation of IE browsers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone of organization worked on how to clear or delete this new database which accumulates your ongoing browser information?&nbsp;

<h2>            How to lock an image to the front of a PowerPoint template&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've got a transparent PNG image of a hand holding a phone. (The interior is transparent and the fingers come over the rectangular face of the phone. ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I lock this image to the front of the slide template so that people using the template can simply insert a second image of a phone screen and it goes behind the fingers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible to put the second image behind the first in the template - but only on the slide master. When I go out of slide master, and select this slide, the second image stays on top of the first image (erasing the fingers that cover part of the screen).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas?</p>

<p>No, this is not possible unless all elements are in placeholders, which means the hand holding the phone would have to be placed by the user, or you would have to supply a sample slide that already has the phone photo placed in a placeholder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was a stupid design decision by Microsoft, but it was made a long time ago. So that makes it VERY difficult to change, in spite of how obviously necessary it is. Please add you vote to this User Voice suggestion, even though it doesn't have the best

            <p>Here's a way without using macros:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Select all text and set it to a monospaced font, like Courier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Count 32 characters and set your right paragraph margin right there. As a checking guide, I added a string of numbers:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c4d7fcf4-8c39-46c1-96dc-2455a659c4ea" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></span></p>
<p>3) Now do <em>Save As</em>&nbsp;into Plain Text format. After clicking the <em>Save</em>&nbsp;button, you'll see a dialog where you need to enable "Insert line breaks." This option will add a ¶ mark at the end of every line.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/618a9a2c-e02c-4a40-9a99-653e76947072" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Here's the result:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f9efd5d-f1dd-4404-87d9-255e4e677249" /></p>
<p>Note the extra spaces before the ¶s. You can get rid of them by doing <em>Cmd A</em>&nbsp;(Select All)<em>,
</em>then centering the text (and back to left-alignment, if required).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, as the dialog box says, Saving As into plain text gets rid of all the formatting, so you'll have to fix that after breaking the lines.</p>

    <title>MENU BUTTON SHOULD BE PLAIN AND SIMPLE, JUST LIKE XP. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MENU BUTTON SHOULD BE PLAIN AND SIMPLE, JUST LIKE XP.</h2>
                    <p>What do you guys think about the re-introduction of the menu button? </p>
<p>I enjoyed having my most frequent and preferred programs on the left and the programs being opened on the right.&nbsp; Simple.
</p>
<p>Now Im not too happy with it, this start menu isn't simple and I feel its a bit clustered and letters are tiny, and cant get bigger because don't want start menu to take over all the screen.
</p>
<p>Apps are for tablets , theres plenty of software for pc's. If Apps are introduced in the button menu , its ok; however, I believe apps are good just the way they were in the previous Windows 8, separate, they could and should stay in the basic start menu
 as an option though. </p>
<p>But because the start menu was reintroduced, the other start window doesn't need to be taken away, customers are already used to it, and it was quick to find things and access them faster.</p>
<p>Start menu in the main screen should remain simple since it is for daily, often use.</p>
<p>The other Start menu like Windows 8 is more of a personalized screen where apps can also be found and all my personal things fixtures are, just like a phone or a tablet are. deisgned</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also would like to see the main buttons on the left side again such as ,</p>
<p>MY PC</p>
<p>Recycle bin</p>
<p>TURN OFF , SLEEP, LOG OFF Button</p>
<p>Control Panel</p>

            <p>I don't know exactly what you're suggesting. If you hate the pinned apps, you can just get rid of all of them and have a start menu that's just a slightly jazzier version of the win7 one.</p>

            <p>I like the menu its the button to open it that lacks color its too dull and server looking. I say give users a choice of a few start button styles during the initial setup. This kind of&nbsp;reminds me of windows NT I don't know it has the flat pasted on look
 to it.</p>

            <p>I agree. I like the new start menu but it would be nice to have a more updated look. That should be a simple fix. After setting mine up I have no problems. &nbsp;Just saying give us a different look for tiles like, custom edging and&nbsp;different backgrounds for
 the tiles as an example. </p>

            <p>First a little about myself.&nbsp; I studied industrial design, technical writing and architecture and have studied human design, interface design,&nbsp;and ergonomics and wanted to give you and many of the readers of this forum some of my thoughts.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To those not liking the current&nbsp;style of the start menu, just wait a bit.&nbsp; The overall style of the start menu will be more polished in the final version.&nbsp; Especially as the time comes when all of the icons match the smooth flat style of the rest of Windows..&nbsp;
 Only then will&nbsp;the interface not look so disjointed.&nbsp; In addition, I would like to see all of the icons from within Control Panel as well as all Explorer icons that are currently styled the Windows 7 and Vista way, to be restyled to match the rest of&nbsp;Windows
 10.&nbsp; The Continuum feature which is coming&nbsp;will fix the problem of mode switching for those with convertible devices such as Surface Pro's, Lenovo Yoga's, as well as other Laptop Tablet hybrids.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Quick Rant - Skip Over if You Like Apple and Android</span></strong></p>
<p>After reading a few messages, it seems like too many people reviewing this technical preview release prefer&nbsp;the archaic ideas of&nbsp;skeuomorphism and transparency (window glass), but this isn't 2005, it's almost 2015!&nbsp; Vista is dead and gone&nbsp;(for 10 years now!)&nbsp;and
 so is the original design of&nbsp;OS X with its glossy reflections, and its faux leatherette shadow of the past...&nbsp; Good riddance!!!!.... and long live Windows 10!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sidenote: Of course if Microsoft is inclined, they could add these old bygone design studies into Windows 10&nbsp;as an option to appease those users and give me and other minimalistic users&nbsp;an option to turn it off and we won't mind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To both Techies and novices!&nbsp; I implore you to learn to embrace the crisp simple modern styles of today!&nbsp; I, for one, prefer this smooth flat style, because it is simple, uses less system resources, and matches all of my Windows devices including my Lumia
 1520 running Windows Phone 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To those naysayers of the Metro style:&nbsp;Microsoft knew what it was doing all along, because look who is copying their style????&nbsp; None other than the competitors!&nbsp; iOS 7 was a huge departure from the Skeuomorphism that Apple was pushing for all those years.&nbsp;
 Android Jellybean and later look like a cut and paste from the Metro style manual Microsoft published all those years ago when they released Windows Phone 7 to the public.&nbsp; Microsoft did set the trend this time around.&nbsp; The media and fanboys alike both pretend
 that they didn't, but both are ignorant, suckling at the teat of the Apple ecosystem which pays them and praises them for their ignorance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, please&nbsp;don't forget that the flat apps were brought to Windows in order to create a cohesive yet ground breaking&nbsp;ecosystem that works across devices unlike Microsoft's main competitors' ways of doing things (highly disjointed experiences that change
 greatly across devices, i.e. Chromebook OS vs Android or iOS vs OSX)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And also to those ranting for Microsoft to bring back&nbsp;Windows Media Center; that&nbsp;has been a &nbsp;dying,&nbsp;sucking on the end of an exhaust pipe&nbsp;product that doesn't fulfill most people's needs anymore.&nbsp; I remember trying to get everything working across my PC's
 allowing one to&nbsp;stream to the other.&nbsp; What a difficult mess!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quick Poll....How many novice users even knew what Windows Media Center is or that it even existed?&nbsp; With Plex and Kodi (Xbox Media Center), the need for WMC has faded into oblivion.&nbsp; But even the afore-mentioned third-party&nbsp;apps don't revolutionize the
 way we use media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A new idea needs to emerge and evolve&nbsp;starting with the media consumption hubs of Xbox Video, Photos, and Xbox Music.&nbsp; These have so much potential and really should be basis for the new media center of the decade.&nbsp; I wouldn't combine these hubs into one
 app though as each needs its own separate feature set.&nbsp; My vision extends to each type of&nbsp;screen mentioned in the keynote&nbsp;and allows the end user to enjoy his / her own content on any device, anywhere, at anytime whether his computer at home is off or not,
 as all of his / her content will be stored on OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now this utopia of digital streaming relies on broadband companies and mobile carriers to allow greater end user&nbsp;data allowances or data allowance exceptions for streaming data from a certified partner's services (Microsoft - who could then offer finances
 for&nbsp;infrastructure expansion to the mobile carrier or broadband company in exchange for a greater push for Microsoft device promotions in mobile carrier stores&nbsp;in a "you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours" kind of deal).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read on to learn more of my vision for the future of Microsoft's proposed always on, always ready, free cloud-based streaming&nbsp;service&nbsp;of pre-owned, as well as allowing for the purchasing of un-owned, as well as rented content.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Media and the Cloud</span></strong></p>
<p>No one has created the ideal cloud experience yet, but I think Microsoft is very close!</p>
<p>
</p><p>All that&nbsp;I ask for is the ability to stream all of my pre-owned music and videos through the cloud to all of my devices including Windows Phone,&nbsp;XBOX One and Xbox 360 without an XBOX Music subscription, i.e. OneDrive Music Locker - a future proposed feature
 of OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once internet connections on a mainstream basis allow smooth 4k quality streaming video whether it is&nbsp;rented or purchased through an online store, no one will need or want&nbsp;cable television packages&nbsp;anymore.&nbsp; Furthermore, if people could get the same streaming
 services they get on their Xbox One on their laptop, they would have true unparalleled freedom to enjoy their content anytime and anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Mobile and Stationary Seamless Experiences</span></strong></p>
<p>Modern Windows is not just about legacy x86 apps anymore.&nbsp; It is about creating a seamless environment that travels across all of your devices, not a disjointed OS that looks one way on a tablet, another way on a laptop, another way on an Xbox,&nbsp;and yet another
 way on a phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Universal Windows apps with a centralized cloud storage for app data is where the utopia of software design is at.&nbsp; If close minded people keep proposing regressive ideas, no progress will ever be made!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a Windows Phone User, I am looking forward to seeing Cortana (Microsoft's answer to Apple's Siri)&nbsp;on the desktop, laptop, tablet,&nbsp;and on the Xbox.&nbsp; I am looking forward to the opportunity to make appointments with my voice that will automatically
 sync with&nbsp;the cloud across all of my devices in case I need to leave the office for a meeting.&nbsp; I want to set geo-fencing reminders from the desktop (Within Outlook and Windows Calendar) that follow my Lumia 1520 when I leave the office syncing through the
 cloud yet again.&nbsp; To those who do not know what geo-fencing is, it is the ability to set a reminder depending on how close you physically are to a given destination when mobile&nbsp;(i.e. remind me to pick up a gallon of milk when I get close to Kroger).&nbsp; Cortana
 would then remind me as soon as I got within a block of the grocery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I know the following idea is a&nbsp;feature that&nbsp;the next version of OSX (Yosemite) will have, but I also want to be able to&nbsp;pick up my text messages on my desktop, laptop, and tablet where I left off in a grand return of the Messaging app from the first version
 of Windows 8.&nbsp; This app needs to be extensible allowing the user to add notifications and messages incoming from Skype, Microsoft Lync, Viber, Facebook, AIM, Google Talk, and ICQ.&nbsp; In fact, the Skype app really doesn't need to exist as all of one's Skype contacts
 could be incorporated into the People App.&nbsp; All that one needs is the backend service.&nbsp; If I were Microsoft, I would incorporate it into a global messaging app with video capabilities.&nbsp; I want to type responses to those text messages from my full sized keyboard
 on my desktop and laptop&nbsp;as well as receiving incoming voice calls from my Lumia 1520 over Wifi using my stellar Samson USB microphone for crisp and clear phone calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The Xbox Video app should be extensible as well allowing plug-ins from Youtube, LiveLeak, Wimp.com, Daily Motion,&nbsp;9GAG, Vimeo, and other services as needed and approved by Microsoft.&nbsp; These extensions and / or media hubs&nbsp;should be allowed to be turned off
 in an enterprise environment on a case by case basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Microsoft, I'm once again asking you to think of each consumption service as a Media Hub, much like what once was in Windows Phone 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if a user has any video needs, he / she would go to the video hub and be able to access 90% of anything he / she could think of from 90% of the most popular media consumption networks.&nbsp; This would prove the same for music and photos (focusing
 on&nbsp;viewing services only, i.e. Flickr, OneDrive &amp; Facebook).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now editing programs need to remain separate from&nbsp;the media hubs unless one wants to provide basic editing functions, (i.e. trimming music / sounds&nbsp;for ringtones or&nbsp;notifications, cropping photographs, quick fix settings&nbsp;for photos, printing photos, burning
 DVD's of video,&nbsp;trimming&nbsp;video's and so on).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So many different apps exist just for editing photos alone, that adding them all as extensions or even the popular ones as extensions would prove difficult to manage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But all of these media hubs should all be searchable from the start menu / search app which will save the user the time of entering the app and then querying their search.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Revise Touch Interfaces for Desktop and Laptop Scalability</span></strong></p>
<p>Like others have mentioned before, I also dislike the PC Settings modern interface.&nbsp; If Control Panel could be reworked into a similar style, but&nbsp;without the large wasteful expanse of space&nbsp;used currently in Windows 8.1, on laptops and desktops, that would
 be ideal.&nbsp; The idea is to get the Windows experience to scale properly across touch and non-touch devices giving the proper experience on each device (i.e. large and simple works on tablets with small tolerances for accuracy, but the same touch-friendly design
 creates far too much mouse travel on a non-touch laptop or desktop)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">CASE IN POINT</span></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>To summarize, I don't agree with the way Microsoft currently uses the store as it creates a lot of confusion for the consumer because most apps simply copy another apps functionality.&nbsp; It is all about developers, developers, developers, but it's
 even more about the users, users, users.&nbsp; Microsoft needs to educate its developers to create something truly unique instead of rehashing the same old tired ideas that the developers are used to creating on other platforms.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>This system was procured from</strong></em><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em><em><strong>the way that&nbsp;Microsoft's competitors are doing things.&nbsp; It is apparent that these app ecosystems (Stores) are creating the implied need for a large amount of diverse
 apps (all with vastly disjointed experiences) which can be unmanageable because it is highly difficult to find the one app the user is looking for once he / she owns over 50 different apps, many of which&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;similar&nbsp;tasks even to the point of exactly
 the same tasks as another app but re-boxing it and calling it different (because it's Adobe Photoshop Express&nbsp;instead of Instagram).&nbsp; As one of those users, I typically remember that one of my programs has a such and such function, but I can't remember which
 one it is and I cannot remember where to find that function because it's buried within one of my many photo apps that seem to share some functions and differ on other functions.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>I know that this app ecosystem&nbsp;is a software company's most profitable revenue stream and that's commendable, but&nbsp;the way it's currently executed&nbsp;creates a large amount of digital noise that people must sift through to find what they really need
 in that moment.&nbsp; In fact it becomes such a large amount of noise, that I don't even mess with the apps much anymore in Windows 8.1.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>If one could incorporate the basis behind all of those media consumption apps as a plugin extension for the hubs I proposed earlier, you will create the pinnacle of simplification which people need in their busy lives today.&nbsp; And whatever is
 left in the store after the media consumption hubs are properly implemented,&nbsp;needs to be sifted through.&nbsp; All apps that duplicate another app's functions&nbsp;along with scam apps that use another app's name as its own need to go in the circular file in the sky
 and those developers need to be notified that what they are submitting is not unique enough from another developer's offering.</strong></em></p>

            <p>I don't want to get into an argument regarding liking apple or android (I started on android, migrated to iphone, and am now on winpho), but I don't think the lessons we can learn from the other ecosystems should be ignored. It's true that MS has been setting
 some trends (for all the people complaining about the flat design in win8 and 10, check out OSX Yosemite... apple is flattening their desktop OS). It's also true that Apple does a better job of supporting the developers and enforcing a strict design language.
 For all the complaints about Apple yoinking some design philosophy from winpho, it's clear that they implement it better and are delivering a more cohesive experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You touched on this in&nbsp; your closing comments, but it's clear that MS's app ecosystem is way behind. I don't know what it'll take to standardize their design language and communicate it to developers effectively, but MS needs to start exerting some serious
 quality control on the market. As far as the users go? We need to understand that there's a good chance we'll need to pay for quality apps. The iOS appstore is full of good apps because it is awash with money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also don't know what determines what can be installed on PC versus phone, but there are a few apps I have on my Lumia that I would love to be able to pin to the winten start menu. I'm assuming developers have to explicitly choose to publish for whatever
 platform, but it's going to be crucial for MS to encourage cross-platform publishing to achieve their "one" vision.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[as far as your streaming comments go, I agree. I do already have a bunch of music in the cloud via xbox music that I can stream on my PCs, hypothetically I should be able to stream it on my phone, but it doesn't work for me]</p>

            I agree, some options for different start buttons would be nice.&nbsp; I use Start8 currently and I like how one can choose their own image to use.&nbsp; Be nice to have this option native.&nbsp; The other thing is I prefer the smaller task bar&nbsp;buttons and it cuts the
 size of the Windows logo in half, it doesn't look right IMO- Should remain the same size.

            Hi Debra
<br />
<br />The built-in Movies and TV App in Windows 10 natively supports both AVI and MKV files
<br />
<br />Are you having difficulty playing those files, if so, what error(s) are you getting when trying to play those files in that App?

    <title>How do I insert a picture in a comment in Excel 2016 for Mac&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rion187  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I insert a picture in a comment in Excel 2016 for Mac&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to insert a comment and then insert a picture to display inside that comment. I am finding many explanations online (YouTube, forums, etc.) for how to do so in previous versions of Office, but I cannot find any explanation for how to do so in 2016
 Excel for Mac. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My hang-up is editing the format of the comment in order to allow me to insert the picture. There is no "Comment Format &gt; Colors and Lines &gt; Color Drop-down &gt; Fill Effects &gt; Picture" option on my end (which is the solution I found for Office 2011 Mac). The
 "comment format" for me is limited to "Font, Protection, Alignment, Properties" none of which has the solution, at least to my knowledge. I also, couldn't find anything under preferences that may have been turned off...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please walk me through this, or let me know if it's been removed from this update? I'm losing my mind. :)</p>

            This is so strange! I would think that an "update" would maintain ALL previously available functions ALONG WITH new and improved options. WHY would any logical programmer REMOVE an option such as the ability to insert a JPEG into a comment box? &nbsp;This was
 a very useful function for teachers who would enter a student ID photo into a class roster so that the teacher can learn the name and face of students by simply hovering over the student's name. I used it for my courses at the collegiate level for many years....and
 NOW I will need to find another program that allows me to do what I need to do. &nbsp;If this options is not reinstated, then EXCEL 2016 will not be that program. Hopefully the omission was an oversight that will be quickly addressed.&nbsp;

            <p>I figured it out. You have to right click on the border of the comment box, not just the center of it. Look at the instructions here, especially step 2. Notice where they right clicked at.</p>

            It would be helpful if u could explain the steps in detail and what these lines of the codes mean because by the looks of it, the code seem to be fixed to a certain name of a picture so u basically have to make a new macro for every damn picture?&nbsp;

<p>Hi farby</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry I missed to mention phone model: Lumia 1320</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About your question "Is the application installed on the Memory Card ?" I had set all aaplications to be installed on SD card to same phone memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before reading your reply I was searching on internet I found on this forum <a href="http://forums.windowscentral.com/windows-phone-8-1/320738-2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://forums.windowscentral.com/windows-phone-8-1/320738-2.htm</a> someone said "Guys, if you want MSN apps to work perfect, you must install them to phone memory, not SD card. Uninstall them and install directly to the phone memory!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I removed app, change settings so apps will be installed on phone memory, reinstall app (change again settings so apps will be installed on SD) and now MSN Weather app seems to be working well, at least it shows information on screen as background applicationa
 and it is shown information for current location. I will check when I move to another location to ensure app is updating to new location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What calls my attention is that before I uninstalled yesterday, Wed.May 7, it was installed on SD card and it used to update to new location... This is something that still bothers me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply and ideas!</p>

    <title>Problem with Date formatting in Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bh_987  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Date formatting in Excel</h2>
                    I have pasted a column of dates into Excel. Here is a sample of how they appear when the column is formatted as "Date".
<div>
<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>17/08/2009</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1/4/2013</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br />
</div>
<div>When the column is formatted as "General", the dates appear like this:</div>
<div>
<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>17/08/2009</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>39816</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I try to do an A-Z sort on the dates, it only sorts by the day, not the year or month</div>
<div>When I try to pull out the year into a separate column by "=right(G3,4), it gives me 2009 for the first date, but 9816 for the second, regardless of whether the date is formatted in "Date" or "General". How do I address this issue?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>Bryce</div>
                </div>

            Neither of these dates is correct. Well, the second one <i>might</i>&nbsp;be correct, but it is more likely that the
<i>dd</i>&nbsp;and the <i>mm</i>&nbsp;are swapped.<br />
<br />
Excel takes the <i>dd/mm/yy</i>&nbsp;vs <i>mm/dd/yy</i>&nbsp;format from the system's regional settings. It would appear that your system is set for
<i>mm/dd/yy</i>&nbsp;and you pasted in a number of dates from an external (web...?) source that come in the
<i>dd/mm/yy</i>&nbsp;format. This has reduced the first date to a textual representation of a date and made the second a true date of
<i>04-Jan-2013</i>&nbsp;when it should be&nbsp;<i>01-Apr-2013</i>.<br />
<br />
You could try changing your system settings in the <i>Control Panel</i>&nbsp;then re-pasting the dates or pasting them into a TXT file and importing them into Excel with
<i>Data, Get External Data, From Text</i>&nbsp;where you can specify the&nbsp;<i>dd/mm/yy</i>&nbsp;format.<br />
<br />
BTW,&nbsp;<i>39816</i> is actually <i>03-Jan-2009</i> so I'm guessing that you made some substitution&nbsp;errors&nbsp;in the sample data you typed...?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this process on a copy of your actual dataset</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Select the data range (including the header row) and sort on the Date column in ascending order</p>
<p>2. Select the data range (including the header row) and in the auto filter drop down of the date column, uncheck the Years so that only individual dates are&nbsp;visible</p>
<p>3. Select the resultant data entries in the date column and go to Data &gt; Text to columns &gt; Delimited &gt; Next &gt; Next &gt; Date &gt; DMY &gt; Finish</p>
<p>4. Clear the Filter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process above should convert the "text Dates" to "actual dates".&nbsp; The filter drop down for the date column should now only show all dates grouped by years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

Welcome to Nokia Discussions!<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>First, <span>you need Nokia Suite software on your computer. Download it <a href="http://nds1.nokia.com/files/support/global/phones/software/Nokia_Suite_webinstaller_ALL.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Second, connect your phone to your computer with a compatible USB cable. Then start Nokia Suite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be advised that the Nokia Asha 206 is not supported to do backups or software updates via Nokia Suite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

<h2>            Lasso not working on Android</h2>
                    I am trying to select an area of handwritten text on my phone with the Lasso tool and move it, but it doesn't seem to work properly. I am able to select an area of the screen, but nothing happens when I try to drag it. I've tried pressing the selection
 area with the stylus and I've also tried touching it, but I'm never able to move it. It works fine on my PC, where I can drag the selection area with the mouse. The version of OneNote on my phone is 16.0.10827.20081.&nbsp; My phone is a Samsung Galaxy Note 9, model
 SM-N960U, Android version 8.1.0. Am I doing something wrong? Can someone please provide step-by-step instructions for moving handwritten text?

<p>Hi RColeman52,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recreated your concern here on my end, I was able to Lasso and move the words that I've typed but not words/parts coming from an inserted PDF file or image. I'd like to know if the issue happens on all notebooks. This way we can isolate if the issue
 only occurs on a corrupted notebook. In the meantime, I suggest that you logout in OneNote; then sign back in, and see if the issue still occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know the status of the issue.</p>

            Thanks for the reply. I figured out what I was doing wrong. If I lightly touch the icon inside the selection area, I can drag it to a new location. It's working on all of my devices now.

<h2>            Office 365 Word 16.14.1 changes Zapf Dingbats font in Office Mac 2011 doc to Segoe UI Symbol</h2>
                    <p>Recently upgraded to Office 365 Mac from Office Mac 2011. Current version of Word is 16.14.1 -- latest Office updates. Running on macOS 10.12.6 Sierra.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened a doc made in Office 2011 Mac, that has a Zapf Dingbat character in it, in Word 16.14.1. The Zapf Dingbats character has the font changed to "Segoe UI Symbol" and looks different.&nbsp;"Segoe UI Symbol" is buried in the Word Mac app resources area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can NOT change back to Zapf Dingbat as the font does NOT appear on Word's font menu. Zapf Dingbats appears in all other apps, including "Font Book".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used Onyx to remove Font caches for system and Microsoft, then restarted. This had no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found these two threads which seems to indicate that Microsoft knows there is a problem. But the problem still seems to exist.</p>

<p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience. I download and install Zapf Dingbats font on Mac device. It works well with Word for Mac 16.14.1 from my side. In this situation, it seems it's an separate issue with the installation of your Mac. You could try the following
 options to check the outcome:</p>
<p>Option 1. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Access Mac safe mode</a>. Open Word, see if you are able to find that third-party font.
</p>
<p>Option 2. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Reinstall the font</a>. </p>

<p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded a ttf file for that font from a third-party source and then installed it with Font Book. At first my Word for Mac was 16.14. I updated it to 16.14.1 and the font still appears in the Word for Mac.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you mentioned the default Zapf Dingbats font in Mac OS, I checked with another device and found the Font can be find in Word 2011 for Mac but cannot be found in Word 2016 for Mac 15.41 (an old version) or 16.14.1 (the latest version). This should be the
 reason why the document created with Office 2011 for Mac now shows other fonts instead of Zapf Dingbats font. We cannot remove the default Zapf Dingbats font. You could try
<a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25796?locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
creating a new Mac account</a> to check the outcome. If it doesn't work, I suggest you click the smile button at right top of the Word window. Directly submit the feedback to our related team. This is the best way to let the related team hear your voice.

<p>Hello Kaila,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message that you've received typically signals a permission issue in the online storage that you're using when saving or uploading your Excel files. Another thing to verify here is a possible software update that can block uploading or saving the
 changes made in your documents. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As such, we highly advise that you check any pending updates available on the specific online storage mentioned in your post. It is also best to try saving or uploading online using a browser if the standalone application does not work. If it still won't
 yield a positive outcome, we suggest that you reach out to their specialists for an advanced troubleshooting so you can be assisted accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're anytime you need help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h3> bob65vv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving outlook mail history, folders and calendar to new pc PROBLEMS&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Mega frustration, any help most appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new PC running Windows 10 and Outlook 2016. My old PC was Win7 and Outlook 2007.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used the Export feature to export the .pst file to a remote hard drive (inc subfolders and from the top, not just inbox). I installed Outlook 2016 onto the new PC and then used the import feature to full the history from the remote drive onto the new pc.</p>
<p>When it finished there was nothing in the calendar, no appointments, current or historic, totally blank days. Plus, there are now over 31,000 me-mails in my inbox (only about 14 on the old PC, and many of my folders are missing. There are mails that should
 be in folders but are now in the trash, and mails that are completely missing! Nightmare! Any suggestions welcome. I currently have the old PC running in the hall and the new one on my desk! Not ideal!</p>
<p>PS My contacts have not come across either but i have now found some of the old calendar, still checking.</p>

            <p>Hi Orlando90, thanks for the links. </p>
<p>Your 2nd link is exactly what I did (3 times now!), unless i'm missing something the 3rd doesn't apply as I don't use a Mircrosoft exchange server account&nbsp;(I don't think!) and the first link looks seriously complicated but will look at it but there is now
 an update to my situation!</p>
<p>The e-mail history is still a mess. I "think" the mails are all there though when I search for a specific mail only my reply comes up. But there a some folders missing, totally random, ie I have many folders and sub folders, in some situations, a sub folder
 may on the old pc contained 8 sub/sub folders, but now there's only 2!</p>
<p>With the Calendar I have now found my old calendar, on the new outlook there were 2 calendars, the default called
<strong><em>Calendar (this computer only)</em></strong> which contained nothing but another below it called
<strong><em>"Calendar"</em></strong> which does contain my diary but all the colour coding has gone and there's no option to restore it or use colours on new entries! Weird. The contacts is the same as the calendar, they're there but none of them are complete,
 no e-mail address. After lots of googling the only thing that has cropped up a couple of times is this business of Pop3 or Imap, neither of which I understand, so...........still frustrated! Does that help at all?</p>

            I've also had an error message come up on the 3rd try "The items in the inbox folder cannot be imported or exported. Your chosen folder name is invalid. This is most likely because you included your IMAP server's hierarchy delimiter in the name of the
 folder" This means nothing to me but does it make sense to anyone else?

            <p>On the new PC in MS Outlook you setup or added your mail account as an IMAP mail account hence you see folders labeled 'This PC only'</p>
<p>From this point it depends what you want to do; you can start from scratch with a new Profile and add you mail account in as an IMAP account, and if that is your need/wish</p>
<p>Then on the old PC simply copy the pst file to your external, (<strong>With OL Closed</strong>) then copy from your external to the new PC \My Documents\Outlook Files\ then in MS Outlook open that data file......you can view/handle&nbsp; its contents as required</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>When you set up OL under the new Profile you add your mail account manually as pop, you will need the settings, then in the data file section you add the pst data file you previously copied, and set it as the dafault</p>
<p>All data will be as it was before</p>

            Thanks for your reply, it's all starting to make sense. I guess leaving it as IMAP isn't a major problem, I can remake the folders. Is this also the reason for me loosing the colour category function in the calendar? Cheers.

            I solved this issue by opening the .PST file and removing the / within all the Subfolders contained.

<div>It is cell D6 times 2 plus cell E6 times 2 minus 14. The answer (3 decimal places) rounded to the nearest quarter (.000, .025, .075)&nbsp;</div>

            Thanks very much.
<div><br />
<div>I am sorry for my error, I meant to round down to .000 .250, .500, .750</div>

<div>Your answer still works with a simple modification:</div>

<div>=ROUNDDOWN((D6*2+E6*2-14)/0.25,0)*0.25</div>

<p><span>Welcome to the forum. :)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We'd love to help. Are you encountering the "hanging" issue even when there's no memory card inserted on the phone? Is the device's behavior the same when using a different memory card? By the way, are you getting the "conflicting apps" error with
 a specific application only or does this error message appear on all the applications that are installed on the phone? What are the troubleshooting steps that you've tried so far? Since recovering the software requires a PC connection, you can just try the
 following steps to further isolate the issue:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>• Turn your phone off/on. If that doesn't help,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>• Reset the phone by going to&nbsp;Settings &gt; Restore factory sett. &gt; Settings only. The default security code is 12345 unless changed.</span></p>
<p><span>• If you're getting the "conflicting app" error on a specific application only, you can try to un-install/re-install it to check if there's a difference.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>• Also, please make sure that the device's software us fully updated. You can update the phone wirelessly by going to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Settings &gt; Phone &gt; Device updates.</span><br />
<span>2. To check if there is an update available and to download it, select Downl. phone software.</span></p>
<p><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: You can only update your software when using the SIM in the internal SIM holder (SIM 1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If all the troubleshooting steps did not work, you can restore the device's software using the Nokia Software Recovery tool. See:&nbsp;</p>
