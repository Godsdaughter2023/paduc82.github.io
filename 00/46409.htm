<h2>            Windows 8 Pro - Blue Screen with DPC Watchdog Violation keeps coming up</h2>
                    <p>I have just installed Windows 8 Pro four days ago, on my new PC (two months old) which came with Windows 7.&nbsp; I randomly keep getting the blue screen with DPC Watchdog Violation, and the PC re-starts.&nbsp; It is very frustrating, and never had this issue with
 Windows 7.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Also, on my desktop, get Ezupdt warning window, and wondering if it is related?</p>

            <p>Hi Everyone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem Solved.&nbsp; My free version of AVG 2012 was the root cause of the problem.&nbsp; I was able to get free consultation through Microsoft as my Windows 8 warranty period was still valid (under 90 days).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once AVG was removed,&nbsp; the problem went away.</p>

<h2>            I cannot add a new user windows 7 64 bit Home Premium</h2>
                    When I try to add a new user in user accounts, I can type in the new name, but nothing happens from there. Also: when I try to manage accounts, no accounts appear.<br />
<br />
I've tried many of the fixes found on this and other forums; none work.&nbsp; For example, I've tried going into safe mode, logging in as the hidden admin, and trying to add the account there - same behavior.&nbsp; I can type in a name, but the account is not actually
 added and I see no accounts at all in the <span style="font-style: italic">Manage Accounts</span> windows - not even the admin or default login accounts!<br />
<br />
This is a brand new computer, OEM operating system. Not good.<br />

            OK - I found a workaround. It took me about 15 steps, but I think it could be reduced to the following, very easy sequence.<br />
<br />
1) Right click on the Command Prompt (under Accessories in the Programs via the Start Menu)
<br />
2) Choose "Run as administrator"<br />
3) Type the following (replacing Newusername with the user name you want to add):<br />
<br />
&gt;net user <span style="font-style: italic">Newusername</span> /add<br />
<br />
That's it! If you want to check if it worked, type:<br />
&gt;net users<br />
<br />
You should see a list of all users.<br />
<br />
I still don't see <span style="font-style: italic">any</span> user names in the User Accounts under Manage Accounts. There's something wrong with Windows 7 64 bit Home Premium, I suspect, as many other users have reported similar issues on various forums.<br />

            The issue seems to have been caused by a migration via PCMover from another computer, running XP - the account registry information was probably corrupted.<br />

            I am faced with the choice of undoing the migration, adding the user accounts before the migration, and then remigrating,<br />
<br />
Or living with having to add and remove user accounts via the command line, and possibly being unable to control permissions.<br />
<br />
I hate to think of all the work I've done setting up the new computer post-migration going to waste...<br />
<br />
I'd love to find a way to fix whatever in the registry has gotten corrupted. I wonder if there's user account management software out there?<br />

                    <p>In the last five days I have had a window appear on my computer that displays the Microsoft logo and the following message "PC Problems Detected!" &nbsp;" Immediately Call: 866-904-8935 Neglect could lead to:</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I called the 866-904-8935 phone number and a man answered, I asked if this was Microsoft, and he said no, the man started asking me if my computer was experiencing a lot of pop ups recently, and I answered yes, and then stopped myself from answering his
 questions, I told him if he was not with Microsoft so I did not want to talk with him, he said something about being Microsoft certified, I had no way to know if this this was actually a legitimate business or not..</p>
<p>Is there somewhere online I could go &nbsp;to and have computer tested to verify if my computer really does have some &nbsp;problem, as I do have a security suite &nbsp;software running on my computer and I am surprised that it was not caught and corrected by it.</p>
<p>i question if there is a problem or if it is just a way to get computer users to spend money for something that does not exist.</p>
<p>Is it possible that security software could be manipulated to not see a problem that exists on my computer?<br />
</p>

            <p>Hello ckelly3294,</p>
<p>
</p><p>there is nothing in the Windows operating system that would bring up this message. It is simply a Scam to gain access to your PC and steal your personal data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As ZigZag has suggested download the latest version of Malwarebytes and run it. Hopefully it will find the culprit and you can delete the scam application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least you didn't allow the culprits access to your PC.</p>

            <p>Hello ezzpringels,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft will never cold call you regarding a PC problem. The only way you will get a Microsoft support engineer to telephone you is if you have arranged a pre-paid contact agreement with the company. If you don't have that pre-paid support contract and
 someone telephones you and says 'Hi, this is Microsoft, the chances are that it is a scam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for being a Microsoft Partner, any technology company can become a Microsoft Partner provided they are prepared to pass a Microsoft Partner exam and pay a yearly subscription for the privilege.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never allow someone you do not know to have remote access to your PC. Never ever, give your user name and password to anyone over the telephone.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 clean install on upgraded Dell D620 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 clean install on upgraded Dell D620</h2>
                    <p>I'm upgrading an old Dell D620 laptop and curious as to whether Windows 10 will run smoothly and efficiently.&nbsp; I've updated the BIOS to the latest version and it will be getting an Intel T7600 CPU, 4GB of RAM, and a 525 GB SSD.&nbsp; Also adding a DVD R/RW optical
 drive.&nbsp; According to the specs required for the Windows 10 install, my onboard graphics isn't up to snuff.&nbsp; What exactly is going to be the problem with an inferior graphics spec operating Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I instead be looking at Windows 7 or 8.1 instead of 10?&nbsp; I've read good things about 7 but am concerned since Microsoft no longer supports it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any advice, I am really just beginning to get my feet wet with upgrading old versus buying new.</p>

            Glad to hear it, Patrick.  Windows 7 is still the best Windows ever IMO.  You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  
<br />
<br />Let us know how it goes and enjoy the experience.

<h2>            Display Issue Bootcamp Mac Pro - LG 31MU97</h2>
                    I'm having headache inducing issues with Windows 10 on my mac right now. It seems that it wont recognize the thunderbolt/mini displayports on the newest mac pro (AMD FirePro D700)&nbsp;when trying to connect my 4k monitor via displayport to it. The device manager
 says that the display adapters have an issue and shuts them down, and searching for the latest drivers doesn't seem to work. Hooking the monitor up via HDMI works but 4k can only do 30hz via HDMI so there is a lot of ghosting. What am I missing? Is it just
 because Apple doesn't technically support Windows 10 yet? I should mention it was completely fine on 8.1.

<h2>            Windows 10 Creator Update - Wifi disconnects when internet access Ethernet is connected</h2>
                    <p>This is a nice feature, but I can't find it documented anywhere nor how to disable it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario 1: Connected to WiFi with Internet access.&nbsp; Connect Ethernet with Internet access (this can a totally different network/subnet) and in about 15 seconds, the WiFi will disconnect. Event log says that the WiFi was disconnected by user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario 1: Connected to WiFi with Internet access.&nbsp; Connect Ethernet without Internet access/gateway address, the WiFi will stay connected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seen on multiple systems, both upgrade and fresh installs. In general, I consider this a neat feature, but in some cases I need both networks connected, so looking for a way to disable this.</p>

</p><p>Mine me won't install on boot nor will windows update install it, it fails, the only way I can install it is within windows. I tried to make a windows 10 ISO disk didn't install that way even using isobuster and virtual drive, &nbsp;so I tried just burning the
 files on disc and it won't boot from the disk it goes right into windows 7 start up, I have also put the files on a flash drive and attempted to boot from that with no luck. And if I start setup within windows 7 it wants a product key which windows 7 key will
 not work either, what other options do I got I can't get the discs to boot, nor the flash drive. But setup works great within windows Til it gets to the product key part. What can I do now?</p>

            the trick lies with windows updates. Try to do the recommended and hidden updates and then reserve the copy. Automatically windows 10 will be downloaded and get installed. but the previous downloaded ISO file might not work. in my case&nbsp;the windows 10 dvd
 was asking for product key but the automatic update resolved the issue. cheers guys I am using a genuine windows 10 copy now.&nbsp;

            <p>I see your point. But this is not a solution of the problem. MS gives you ISO to upgrade several Windows7 systems. Once you build and start the upgrade on second step it asks for the KEY. I entered COA key&nbsp;from back of my system but it fails. I have option
 to skip the key but I do not know what will happen next. </p>
<p>Did MS ever think about this step? I am sure MS hires genuine Windows programmers, system builders and pays them more than minimum wage to test their new Windows 10 upgrade process before they jump from the sky!!!!</p>

            <p>Ditto BarretPytle.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can do the "automated" upgrade by re-downloading the OS on the machine I'm upgrading. So what was the point of MS providing ISO's and USB images for "upgrading multiple machines"? Without a key, those images are worthless. My BS meter is pegging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BarrettPytle, where do you find an option to "skip" the key? I'm using the USB stick, running from inside my REGISTERED Windows 8.1 installation. I get to the product key window and I can go "BACK" or put in a key. Those are the only options I see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, MS manages to screw over end-users.</p>

            <p>I made an ISO from the Media Creation Tool, then ran Setup from within my Windows 8.1 install. &nbsp;After it copied files to the disk and rebooted, I was asked for a product key. &nbsp;My 8.1 OEM key would not work. &nbsp;Sounds like what you're describing above, though
 you used a USB drive instead of a DVD. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this a couple times with no joy. &nbsp;Then I realized that my machine was booting from the installation DVD. &nbsp;So I ejected the DVD, rebooted again, and then the 'upgrade' Windows 10 Setup ran from the disk instead of my install media. &nbsp;The installation
 then resumed without asking me for a key.</p>

<p>Hey Agent Kiddo2222, You need to contact your financial services to make them aware about your Credit card ASAP &nbsp;so they can cancel the card... Assumeing he knows your account details, I suggest changing your password ASAP, you can chat to an Microsoft employee
 support.xbox.com/en-US/Contact-us#3:1:1 and use the chat with Microsoft Support or request a call (Depending on your location and what is available) But first thing first contact your financial services

    <title>Display problem with external monitor HP L1750 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lisa_321  say:</h3>
<h2>            Display problem with external monitor HP L1750</h2>
                    My previous system was a Thinkpad T42 with Windows XP, and an HP L1750 monitor.&nbsp; Everything was just fine, but I was running out of hard disk space and so forth, so I got a Thinkpad T400 that had Windows 7 on it.
<br />
<br />
There are things I like about Windows 7, but my HP monitor, which looked splendid with XP and the previous laptop, looks HORRIBLE now. The colors are washed out and just don't look right, the fonts are either too faint, or too thick and blurry, and there is
 a lot of inconsistency even between different webpages - one webpage will look pretty decent, while another one will look terrible. NO fonts are crisp and sharp like they were on the previous system. They're all a bit muddy or blurry. And as I said, colors
 just don't look right.<br />
<br />
I never had ANY of these problems in the previous system!<br />
<br />
I have calibrated the monitor using both the calibration tool in Windows 7, and some tools online. I've tried fiddling with the contrast and brightness and color temperature and gamma - none of these things help very much. I've tried different themes - Aero
 themes, classic themes - NONE of them look as nice now as similar themes looked in XP, on the same monitor.<br />
<br />
I've tried turning ClearType on and off, font smoothing on and off, and so forth. Various things will make fonts in one place look better, but to the detriment of fonts in a different place. For example, turning off ClearType helped the fonts in MS Office,
 but then when I went to my email website I could barely read it.<br />
<br />
None of this makes sense to me - and again, I had NONE of these problems with Windows XP on the T42! I have NEVER had display problems with ANY system like I am now.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what is going on and how to fix it? I can't stand looking at it and I'm at my wit's end!<br />
<br />

            I have 32-bit Windows.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the very comprehensive answer...I haven't forgotten about this, but in hindsight I should have waited to post this question, as I've gotten waylaid by Christmas and haven't had enough time to devote to your suggestions (my apologies).<br />
<br />
I did check to make sure drivers were up to date (they are), but didn't consider that they may be corrupted.<br />
<br />
Again, thank you...I'll pick away at trying these things. Surely something in this nice long list will work!<br />

<p>my kid got a £10 gift card off his friend for his birthday. him and his sister took to removing the silver strip to reveal the code so we could add this to his account and properly butchered this card, the silver strip was really difficult to remove and
 they didn't ask me for help, about 8 digits of this code are actually visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>have we ruined this or is there a way of getting help with this. I appreciate it is only a tenner, but its from his best mate and he is 10, so, you know.</p>

            Hello Mhl03,<br />
<br />
One other helpful insight.&nbsp; Only very recent games support widescreen resolutions.&nbsp; I've had to learn this the hard way myself.&nbsp; A good number of games by EA do not support widescreen.&nbsp; You might want to check the Game's support sight to see if it supports
 widescreen or if a patch has been released that will.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you

            Hi Srihari.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The error normally means that someone has activated Windows with a Volume License Key meant only for business or organizations that activate a large number of PC's, which need to check in with the organization's server regularly to reactivate.
<br />
<br />Sometimes this is done by shops reinstalling Windows, unnecessarily because the PC either came with a Windows Product Key embedded in the BIOS/UEFI firmware, or it was already activated for free Upgrade and would have reactivated after a reinstall had they given it the chance and not interrupted this by installing the illegal key.
<br />
<br />If you know Windows was originally activated legitimately by one of these methods then to fix the problem what I would do is go offline to remove the Volume License key and then restore the Generic Product Key that is used to activate with the Digital License issued by Upgrade or Factory install. Then we'll see if it activates:
<br />
<br />1) Go offline by opening Action center at the right end of Task Bar, then clicking on Airplane mode to turn off internet.
<br />
<br />2) Next type CMD in Start Search, right click to Run as Administrator, then right click to copy and paste this command in and press Enter: slmgr -upk
<br />
<br />3) Restart PC and then insert Generic Product Key for WIndows 10 Pro from here: <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-</a>...
<br />
<br />If the PC originally came with Windows 10 from factory, then you can also install ProducKey:  <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip</a> to look for an OEM-BIOS key (only!) and copy/paste it into Activation Settings.  But be aware that these embedded keys often will convert to Digital Licenses using only Generic Version key, as can a retail license.
<br />
<br />This sets everything back to default so that if there is a Digital License issued during a proper Upgrade it should reactivate within a few days. If not we will need to try something else:
<br />
<br />What Windows Operating System came on that exact model PC originally - you can google it's make and model to read the specs to find out? If it says Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 Home version then that is a clue you need to reinstall Home instead of Pro to try to activate. We might even be able to still activate it fresh with a Windows 8/8.1 Product Key read from the BIOS or on the Windows 7 COA sticker on the PC, or any of those retail keys.
<br />
<br />If nothing else works you may need to reinstall the licensed Windows edition that came with that PC, or buy a copy of retail Windows 10 to reinstall (if necessary) and activate it. I would buy only from a major retailer who backs their sales or Microsoft here: <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US</a>...
<br />
<br />If you were sold a Volume license product key or the PC came from seller activated with one, then It is piracy when someone resells Windows with no way to legally activate it.  You can report this to Microsoft here:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/cfr/report.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/cfr/r...</a>.  In the past when victims cooperated with an investigation they would sometimes give them a free copy as thanks.  
<br />
<br />You can also contact the seller and let him/her know you are taking these actions and that to avoid prosecution for felony theft and piracy they need to make the activation good.
<br />
<br />I hope having all possible options helps.
<br />
<br />  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

            You must open it up and check for corrosion and broken wires, same as you would for any other battery powered device.

            Hi Sudhir, 
<br />
<br />My name is Douglas and I am an Independent Advisor. I would like to help you. Let's try the followings suggestions:
<br />
<br />"Turn around the keyboard.
<br />Remove the batteries.
<br />Remove the rubber feet and unscrew the five phillips screws below. Note the position of the three longer screws.
<br />Turn the keyboard back up and remove the wrist pad. Besides three screws, it's also held in place with a couple of clips. Gently apply force.
<br />There's about a dozen screws now accessible below the wrist pad. Unscrew these too.
<br />The keyboard top and bottom case are now held together with a dozen or so clips. You can take it apart with a broad screwdriver and some gentle force in the correct direction. Be careful however: the bottom case contains the battery holder, and it's connected to the top case.
<br />Gently remove the battery connector from the 5 x 5 cm printed circuit board (PCB) below the top case.
<br />Now remove the flat cable from the PCB by pulling back the black lock thus loosening the flat cable.
<br />Unscrew the PCB and put it aside. Since these screws have a different length, it might be best to screw them back in after removing the PCB"

<p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using a hotspot might not work due to certain ports must be open on routers ect for the best connection on the xbox it is suggested using the router/modem style of set up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is how to do it <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/connect-live-using-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Connect without a router</a>&nbsp;setting it up that way and using hotspot to pc and connecting to the xbox that way is the only method I can think of but the Nat type will be strict.&nbsp;</p>

 o jogo), alguém tem alguma dica de como abrí-lo ? . 2 - Dentro das masmorras ( onde estão aprisionados alguns trolls ) existe uma salão com caldeirões, ao acertar estes caldeirões ouve-se o som das trombetas que é o sinal de que alguma coisa especial aconteceu,
 só que não percebo nada de diferente, alguém desvendou esse mistério ? . 3 - A feiticeira lagartixa que o ajuda no decorrer do jogo, mas que depois se revela uma traidora, e desaparece no final do jogo. Já tentei procurá-la em todos os cantos mas não a encontro
 em lugar algum, tenho uma leve suspeita de que ela disfarçou-se numa daquelas criaturas com forma de plantas em um vilarejo, mas enfim, alguém tem alguma dica sobre isso ? . Caso alguém precise de u

<p>The image utility included with Windows 10 - System Image Builder - was deprecated with the Fall Creators Update. That means it's not being developed anymore, and might be removed in a future update. Microsoft recommends instead that we use a third-party
 backup image application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A third-party application will let you store your image pretty much wherever you want. In fact, a third-party application can easily do what System Image Builder can only dream about:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>creating and storing different backup jobs for different purposes;</li><li>scheduling backup jobs to run automatically, on a schedule that you choose;</li><li>maintaining a rotating history of backups, e.g., the 10 most recent backups;</li><li>being notified when a backup succeeds (or fails)</li><li>verifying the integrity of a backup before you restore it</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>and that's only the beginning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While you can certainly store a backup on a thumb drive, it's not the best idea for two reasons:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- they aren't as robust as, say, an external hard drive, or a network drive, so constant writes will shorten their life; and</p>
<p>2- there's really not enough space to maintain a decent history of backups. Ideally, you want to backup every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are lots of great third-party image backup applications. Search for reviews on the internet, take advantage of the free trials, and pick one that you like. I use Macrium Reflect, but you might find another that you like better.</p>

            <pre>USB thumb drives are not recommended for system images. You really should use a mechanical external USB drive. 
Besides that...
File History, System Image, Backup and Restore in Windows 10 are partially broken and they are not being actively maintained or developed. Microsoft is planning to remove them in a future release. You are seeing the effects of this. You should switch to a third party solution such as Macrium Reflect (Free).
Learn more: https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-windows-10-system-image-best-free-alternatives/
Details:
Let’s start off with Macrium Reflect (Free) (https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree). Macrium provides a small click to run the installer, but I chose the offline installer, which required finding the download agent (http://updates.macrium.com/reflect/v5.0/reflectdl.exe); this downloads the full installer at around 800 MBs. Included are a collection of preinstallation environment tools based on Microsoft’s Windows Image deployment solutions.
Setup was quick and easy but needed a restart to complete changes made to the system.
The Macrium Reflect interface is a bit more jam-packed than what you would normally find in Windows 10. But this a powerful alternative offering a range of options for creating and managing backups. Macrium integrates heavily with Windows—examples include support for attaching and browsing backups; boot image backups in Hyper-V; generating PowerShell scripts to automate backups; creating batch files and of course, scheduling backups. You can also find handy options such as cloning and standard file and folder backup.
For these instructions, we are going to focus on image backups. Similar to the System Image backup (https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-windows-10-system-image-backup/) feature in Windows 10 and previous versions, this lets you create a replica of your current installation state. You can be granular with your backups by choosing only the partitions you want to save as part of your image.
To create your first image, click the menu Create an image of the partition(s) required to backup and restore Windows.
Under Destination, click the Browse button, then point to your external drive where you want to store the backup, create a new folder, select it then click OK. Click Next to Continue.
 
This phase of the wizard lets you create a Backup plan if you want. It’s optional, but lets you choose different methods of backups which include full, incremental and differential. For now, I am going to choose a schedule just to make things simple. I recommend you review the retention rules to save on disk space. Users can retain a number of backups using any method; this can quickly eat up disk space over time, so I will reduce the amount for each to about two. Click Next to Continue.
What are Incremental and Differential Backups and which should you choose?
A full backup gives you one backup file that restores your entire system up to that point. Full backups are a comprehensive way to go, but they take a long time to create and if you have multiple backup images, you end up duplicating a lot of the same data. Incremental and differential backups are two ways to address this inefficiency.
Incremental Backup – This maintains a regular backup in addition to changes that have been made since the last full or incremental backup. Incremental backups are often preferred because they use less disk space; not to mention, they are faster, too. So, if you created new Word documents since your last backup, those are added to the backup.
So, let’s say Backup A is a full backup you made on Monday. On Wednesday, you can make an incremental Backup B which only includes the new data since Backup A. On Friday, you can make Backup C, which only includes the new data since Backup B. In this way, you are storing no duplicate data. The downside is that if you want to restore your image, you have to use all three backup files: Backup A, Backup B, and Backup C.
Differential Backup – This creates a backup of the differences made since the last full backup. So, if you made changes to a few Microsoft Word documents, those changes are applied to the backup. A disadvantage is that differential backups use more space, since you need to maintain a full backup in addition to changes since you created your last backup.
How is that different than an incremental backup? Let’s say you make a full Backup A on Monday. On Wednesday, Backup B contains the differences since Backup A was made. On Friday, Backup C contains the differences since Backup A.  In this way, if you want to do a restoration, you just need two files: the last full backup and the last differential backup. This means you only ever need two files, compared to the incremental backup method. The downside is that, as you can imagine, your differential backup image file gets bigger and bigger as the time since your last full backup increases. And after awhile, you end up with a quite a bit of duplicated data across your various differential backups.
So, which should you use? Either one is fine. It all depends on how much storage space and time you have. Incremental backups are faster and take less space during the backup phase. Differential backups take more time and space during the backup phase but are easier during the restoration phase.
Review the image summary to ensure you chose the right options. If you maintain a dual boot configuration, make sure each partition is checked as part of your backup. Click Finish to begin the backup.
Click OK to start the backup immediately.
As with all image backups, it will take some time, so, sit back and relax as your image is saved. Click Close after your image is created.
Restoring Your Macrium Image
There are multiple ways to restore a backup. You can start the restore process from within a running installation of Windows 10 with Macrium already installed. But in most cases, restoring an image would take place after booting into a recovery environment similar to System Image in Windows 10.
Create Rescue Media
One important task you should complete after creating your image is to create rescue media, which will facilitate restoration of the image. This is perfect for scenarios where your computer won’t boot or you installed a new empty hard disk. Click the Other Tasks menu then click Create Rescue Media.
This will start the create bootable rescue media wizard. Remember, as we mentioned earlier, Macrium downloads a full installer at around 800 MBs. This is where the preinstallation environment tools based on Microsoft’s Windows Image deployment solutions are used. Macrium adds its own recovery tools to facilitate restoration of the image when you boot from it. Click Next.
You can add drivers in advance for hardware that might not be supported by the restored image. Click the Update Driver button to do so then point to the source. This can minimize the chances of Windows 10 not booting on new hardware; especially if you are changing motherboards.
Depending on the architecture of your Windows 10 image, you can choose either a 32 or 64-bit (https://www.groovypost.com/howto/windows-10-edition-architecture-build-your-install/) recovery image. For this particular case, I am restoring a 64 bit Windows 10 installation, so I will choose that. Click Next to begin the creation.
Bootable media can be prepared using a blank DVD or USB drive or you can create a bootable ISO image instead. Choose your desired method, then click Finish.
Restore Image – Macrium Reflect
Configure your computer to boot from the installation media (https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/) on the target computer. Attach your external drive where the image is stored, then power it on.
Under the Restore tab in Macrium, click the menu, Browse for an image or backup file to restore.
Browse to the image file, select it then click Open.
Click Select a disk to restore to… then click the selected image that appears. Click Next to begin the restoration.
After the image is successfully restored, click File &gt; Exit to reboot.
That’s pretty much all that’s involved in preparing a system image of your Windows 10 installation using Macrium Reflect. Macrium feels a little complex and overwhelming at first, but once you familiarize yourself with it, you should feel comfortable using it in no time. If you still want something a bit more user-friendly, then check out EaseUS Todo Backup Free.

<h2>            Skype Gallery</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp; I'm running the latest version of SKYPE (I think) on Windows 10.&nbsp; I can see galleries belonging to my contacts, but can't figure out how to see my own gallery.&nbsp; Do I have one? and if so, can you tell me how to find it.&nbsp; Thanks, Chris

    <title>__How to convert to open a WPS WORKS files into a Word format&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            __How to convert to open a WPS WORKS files into a Word format&#63;</h2>
                    <strong>
<p>With my new computer, I'm having trouble opening any of my written WORKS documents using Open Office.org.</p>
<p>All Documents now appear as "WPS Files". I think I need some sort of patch or the like to open them with Open Office?</p>
<p>Someone suggested I install a free trial program of Microsoft Word 2010. I was able to open WPS Documents -----</p>
<p>but, upon expiration of the trial program, the Documents again became WPS Files!</p>
<p>Can you suggest a Patch or some alternative? Your help will be so very much appreciated!<br />
Thanks in advance for your kind reply.</p>

Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven't tried Stellarium on Windows 8 yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might want to try installing using the <strong>Windows 7 Compatibility Mode</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the installation file to the Desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Right click</strong> the file and select <strong>Properties</strong> /
<strong>Compatibility</strong> Tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Place Check Mark</strong> in the <strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for:</strong> option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the drop down menu, select <strong>Windows 7</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click <strong>Apply/OK</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Run the installation file</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Let us know the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Regards</p>
        </p>

            I had the same problem using windows 8.1&nbsp;but It is working&nbsp;smoothly after running the compatibility tab.
