            <p>Hello Victor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A blue screen error (also called a stop error) can occur if a problem causes your PC to shut down or restart unexpectedly. When you experience this type of error, you won’t be able to see things like the Start menu or the taskbar on the screen when your
 PC is turned on. Instead you might see a blue screen with a message that your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to use steps provided in the following article and check if it helps.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Troubleshoot blue screen errors</strong><br />

<p>
</p><p>Note: Restoring your PC to an earlier point will remove updates and drivers installed after the restore point was made. It won’t affect your personal files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>

            I had a similar issue with another device and it finally successfully connected after I rebooted the router (pulled the electric plug from the wall and plugged it back in).&nbsp; Also, I've had good results with Panasonic telephone support in the past:&nbsp;

<h2>            Failed to install Security Update for Windows 8 for x64-based Systems &#40;KB2920189&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I had to reinstall Windows 8 for work purposes as I work from home. Soon after I reinstalled Windows 8, I quickly started installing Windows Updates. The first batch I installed were successful but the second batch failed. I manually and painstakingly installed
 the failed updates through the Download Center. However, the one update that's holding me back is the KB2920189 for Windows 8 for x64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I have nothing installed on my computer other than the pre-installed programs from Microsoft and Gateway.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insights in getting this resolved would be great.</p>

            <p>I'm not reinstalling Windows 8.1 at this moment. I'm currently back on Windows 8, since I had been asked to restart over with Windows. Right now I'm trying to install Windows updates, which are failing. As I said I managed to install all the failed updates
 manually through Microsoft Download Center. The one update that's preventing me from upgrading back to Windows 8.1 is Security Update for Windows 8 for x64-based Systems for KB2920189. Since this update appears to be a requirement for Windows 8.1 to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error I keep getting is below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Security Update for Windows 8 for x64-based Systems (KB2920189)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installation date: ‎6/‎6/‎2015 8:18 PM</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installation status: Failed</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error details: Code 800F0922</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update type: Important</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I try installing it through the Windows Update window and go to restart. It tells me it failed and it's reverting the changes. I've even tried manually installing this update through the Download Center but get the same error as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edited: That link you posted is from another computer I have and managed&nbsp;to resolve. I even followed&nbsp;those previous steps, but they did not work for me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>1d. When (exact date) did you "reinstall Windows 8?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>1e. What problems were you having that you thought "reinstalling Windows 8&nbsp;" might resolve?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your currently-installed <em>third-party</em> anti-virus application or security suite&nbsp;(i.e.,
<em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em>), if any, and <em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. What third-party anti-malware applications (i.e., <em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em>) are installed, if any? &nbsp;What third-party firewall, if any?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer<em>&nbsp;since you bought it?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer
<em>when you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>

<p>
</p><p>7b. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Is Adobe Flash Player <strong>v17.0.0.188 </strong>installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've had Windows 10 for nearly a year but this only just happened the other day. I don't believe I've made any hardware or software changes just before it happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also got all updates and tried running the troubleshooter before posting here but it could not find a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h3> josephcremona  say:</h3>
<h2>            Roxio Creator lost</h2>
                    Since I bought my HP Pavilion in 2015 it has upgraded to Windows 10 when it was first offered for free. Somewhere along the way Roxio Creator disappeared. I've tried using a few different programs and they just don't burn right or play right. Also nothing
 will play automatically like it use to. i have tried every possible solution. Will I have to do a complete Recovery of the factory settings to get Roxio back? I liked that program very much. It did every cd burn easily and correctly. I don't want to have to
 purchase Roxio to get back. Any help from anyone please? Help?

            Roxio was possibly removed when you upgraded to a later version of Windows 10, is so then the program was not compatible (probably due to age).
<br />Do you know which version of Roxio creator was on the PC?
<br />Do you have the previous Windows version install Disk or is it on a recovery partition? I’m thinking if a disk thenyou could open &amp; browse it to see if there’s a Roxio installer &amp; run it using compatibility mode.

<p>Thank you for responding Time Lady.&nbsp; Here's what I have that I can tell you. Hope it helps you to help me.</p>
<p>My computer I have came with Windows 7 Professional and I have all 4 Recovery Discs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have the next HP all 5 discs for Windows 8.1 software says 64 bit.</p>
<p>i don't know which discs to use to Recover factory, Win 7 or Win 8.1 discs?</p>
<p>Computer came with Roxio already installed in it when I bought it in 2015. I don't know what version?</p>
<p>I don't know what disc I would put in to find Roxio installer? and also will it install on my current Windows 10 or not?</p>
<p>If I have to totally recover factory settings to get Roxio back then I will.</p>
<p>Then I will not be able to reinstall Windows 10 again without having to pay for it this time. Upgrade was free at first.</p>
<p>Now I'm guessing that I will have to stay with the operating system that has Roxio and not do an upgrade again because it will take out the old version of Roxio again. What to do?</p>
<p>Thanks again if you can help!</p>

<br />If you have the driver/software cd/dvd that came with your HP Pavilion,

<br />You can find the Roxio software with key in the cd/dvd.

            The the extra software may be on the last disk, however it may be a case that you have to recover back to the version which contains Roxio.
<br />When you purchased the device can you remember whether it had 7 or 8 on it? Did you upgrade to Windows 8?
<br />If not then Roxio probably is on the Windows 8.1 set of discs.
<br />You can upgrade to Windows 10 for free if you have already done so during the free upgrade period.
<br />You can also use a third party imaging software to create an image of the current Windows 10 onto an external hard drive (remembering to create the boot media onto a USB so you can restore the image if needed).
<br />I use Macrium Reflect free:
<br /><a href="https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree</a>
<br />You may be able to copy the Roxio folder &amp; use it on Windows 10 by running the .exe under compatibility mode.
<br />I know Roxio NXT4 will work under Windows 10 as this was the version I was running when I upgraded to Windows 10.

<h3> blagzter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Customer Service Appalling&#33; </h2>
                    
<p>Very disappointed at the customer service I have received from xbox customer support. After 3 days and 5 phone calls (cut off twice after waiting 30 mins to get answered) &nbsp;I still have no resolution. 3 promises of call backs 1 from a manager and still nothing.
 I cannot comprehend what the issue is when all I want to do is have a faulty controller which is under warranty replaced. You have serial numbers and proof of purchase. Why is it an issue? You should try sending some staff to Sony for some training. It would
 help your failed procedures and incompetence no end.</p>
<p>I wait in anticipation for some help. Hope I live long enough!! &nbsp;</p>

<p>Just out of curiosity you say it is still under warrenty, if so have you taken the faulty controller back to the retailer where you bought the product, they are responsible for all product faults within the warrenty period, i know they try and wash their
 hands these days but they are the first people you should be dealing with when it comes to faulty products that are still under warrenty, if they say otherwise i suggest a phone call to your local trading standars office, but by consumer law they are responsible,
 and it is their job to take back and return any faulty products to the manufactor, it is not the consumers job to do this.</p>

<p>I purchased the unit whilst on holiday hundreds of miles away from where I live. Having said that, it is in fact a manufacturers warranty and should not make any difference if you decide to deal directly with the manufacturer. &nbsp;As long as you have adequate
 proof of purchase they should deal with it. It is their product and their product has failed and they are bound by their legal obligation to provide a minimum of 12 months warranty. &nbsp;Anyway I have contacted the Vice President with my complaint and it seems
 I have lots of people willing to help out now. </p>

<p>Tell me about it?</p>
<p>I had problems a few weeks ago, My Xbox one suddenly stopped displaying in 1080 and will only let me use 720, It's also slow as hell to start up and the screen goes fuzzy, So I send it off to be repaired after numerous phone calls, My console is 8 months
 old so I'm not happy, The woman I spoke to said I would be compensated with a free gift? That sounds good and I was happy, I get the console back 10 days later with a letter saying there is nothing wrong with it and no free gift?
</p>
<p>It still has the same issues, So after complaining again and being told to send it back off to be repaired, I have been told I'm getting a brand new console after I return mine, The customer service is hideous and I dread to think what comes back when I
 send it off again.</p>

<p>My problem still continue's. &nbsp;Strangely enough I have been treated very very well since my complaints to top level management. It's amazing the level of attention I'm receiving now. Having said that my problem still continues. They very quickly and efficiently
 sent me a new replacement controller for me to discover on delivery that it was the wrong type and not the PC compatible one I originally owned. So now Im waiting for a returns label to send it back before they will ship the correct controller. Again the attention
 I'm getting is great but they still got it wrong. The amount of time and effort it is taking to sort out something so small is still astonishing to me. Id hate to think how much it has cost me in time alone. At least they offered some kind of gift for your
 inconvenience. No sign of that here!! </p>

<h2>            So Xbox Live doesn&#39;t believe in Honoring their advertised deals</h2>
                    So I see this off on my dashboard for 33% off 12 month subscription but when I go to purchase it, the only this being offered is the usual $59.99 deal so I'm like WTF! I message customer service and politely ask what the deal was, after talking to three
 different Reps the I only answer I can get out of them is pay the full about then we'll see about getting you a refund because we don't see this offer even after I sent them the screenshot of my dashboard.... Normally I wouldn't care and would blow it off
 and and go to another vender, except I had already put the money on my Microsoft account like a
<strong>[Mod Removed - Profanity]</strong> which they won't refund either without doing through there refund dept and I bet that will take anywhere between 7-14 days if I'm lucky. Long and the short of it players triple check everything before you get my kind
 of headache!<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/023c0692-75df-42bb-9350-0af336006f9d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/023c0692-75df-42bb-9350-0af336006f9d?upload=true" /></a>

</p><p>&nbsp;I would totally agree with you, but this isn't stated anywhere in or around (even in that ultra small fine print they usually have) I see stuff like that on my second account all the time like when they gave free month when you joined XBL. But no mention
 of new account requirements...&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            I've been in a similar boat where I had purchased Black Ops 3 but wanted Infinite Warfare. Support agent mentioned that I'll get a refund if I purchase Infinite Ware, I guess to prove that I'm genuinely interested, I asked the agent to not to disconnect
 the chat, and I asked him that if I'll purchase right away will he process the refund, he agreed and&nbsp; purchased, and he processed my refund right away. Just told this story to prove that I normally find Xbox support agents very helpful :)

</p><p>You can still get in contact with a representative, it just requires you to sign into the
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support portal
</a>and follow the directions until you can request a callback to your desired number in your region.</p>
<p>

<p>thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:</p>
<p>the bar did move after 3 hours. and it worked&nbsp;just &nbsp;fine afterwards, although it took very long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>piece of advise: don't interrupt/stop the process of downloading cause it will start all over again. the whole process took about 7 hours to complete.</p>

            <p>It's not actually stuck. Observe closely and take intermittent screenshots, if it may help you. It progresses at a very slow rate. Probably due to a slow bandwidth, as it might be downloading required drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you find out that the progress is slow, you can also confirm that it is not stuck by checking if there is any network activity, using a network monitoring tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as long as there is a network activity and there is a progress, you don't have to worry.</p>

<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp; Favorites were gone. (online found tips to fix that)</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Favorites were not in same order and folders</p>
<p>-&nbsp; closed computer (sleep) takes much longer to start up after opening the lid and ONLY after pushing the power button. Before I just opened the lid and it came on to my desktop. Now takes 1-2 min sometimes and opens with a search bar with news boxes.</p>

<h2>            Installing srvany.exe in win 2008 r2 servers</h2>
                    <p>HI,</p>
<p>I'm migrating off of 2003 servers ( I inherited) and have some old VB apps I'd like to set up as a service on the new 2008rs servers.</p>
<p>Currently srvany.exe is used.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Can I use this on 2008r2?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any steps needed other than copying the srvany.exe?</p>
<p>Is there an alternative?&nbsp; SC.exe will create the service but I can't run it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            My account is basically on Lock over a promotion that MICROSOFT themselves had.</h2>
                    
<p><span>Few months back, Microsoft had a promotion of "One Month of Xbox Live Gold for $1". I caved in and purchased it (who wouldn't?) and clearly at the bottom page it said that only 5 months were allowed to be purchased.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
So, today I turn on my Xbox to purchase Bastion but I don't have any Microsoft Points. No problem. Account Management &gt; Add Points &gt; 800 points &gt; ERROR<br />
<br />
Won't allow me to purchase points period, so I call up Microsoft. Now my account is locked from purchasing anything due to "Suspicion of Fraudulent Activity"&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Support gave you an accurate explanation, and while the situation may seem frustrating, one should consider this a "good thing."</p>
<p>Allow me to elaborate a bit. &nbsp;I experienced the same issue several years ago after buying a 1400 MSP card on a Monday, then a 2800 MSP card on Wednesday and then after receiving my paycheck on the Thursday, another 1400 MSP card. &nbsp;This set off a "flag" somewhere
 that fraudulent activity may have been taking place on my account and my account was "locked" just as yours has been. &nbsp;While it was an inconvenience, as I was unable to purchase anything or have access to any of my DLC, it was, upon further reflection, something
 I ended up appreciating as it showed me that Microsoft is doing everything they can to protect me and my account from others that would do it harm.</p>
<p>My account was "locked" for approximately 10-14 days and returned to normal after it was determined that there was in fact nothing out of the ordinary and no fraudulent activity taking place.</p>
<p>So, if you're not doing anything that you shouldn't be doing, you have nothing to worry about and should get your account back soon.</p>

<h2>            Trouble signing in</h2>
                    <p>Anyone able to assist? </p>
<p>I set up a skype account whilst overseas with overseas mobile number. Now trying to log in and the password is wrong - thought i'd reset it, but that just uses my e-mail address and doesn't link to skype name and can't log in.</p>
<p>Tried to reset password with skype name, but only way to do that is for microsoft to send a code to the mobile number which is no longer used as not residing in that country anymore.
</p>
<p>Can't set up a new skype as my e-mail is already in use......</p>
<p>I originally had some money on that account too, so a bit frustrated that the only help i can get is to ask the community!</p>
<p>any help ery much appreciated :)&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            You don&#39;t have permission to save in this folder, would like to save in this folder instead of this error when trying to edit,save,create a folder</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to windows 10, it was great in the beginning until I started seeing errors like "You don't have permission to save in this folder, would like to save in this folder instead of this", I select other folder it still does not save and in the error
 message it shows the name of same folder. It became worse when I realized that I can no longer create a new folder in my own backup hard drive, pen drive etc. I just bought a new hard drive, it won't even back up in it, also then I tried to manually select
 the data and try to make a new folder, destination folder access denied, what on earth is wrong with windows 10, its real pain not to be able to save/modify data on your pen drives, hard drives etc. I have tried almost all the options that are there in the
 community forums, none of them work for me. Help me with this problem.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Santosh,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply, I have two accounts on this laptop. I will breakdown the whole situation below.</p>
<p>I have two accounts for name sake home and office, home was the administrator before I upgraded to W10, I upgraded while I was at office, and I think because of that the office account became administrator, it sounds weird, even I felt so but I realized
 it when I could use some features only from office account without getting this administrator permission thing. Then I went ahead and made both accounts administrator. The problems I am facing are as follows:</p>
<p>1) Whenever I try to download something, I prefer it to go to a specific drive, it was possible in windows7, as I had a separate drive for downloads, but now after upgrade, a defualt download folder was added, however, when I try to download something it
 will let me save sometimes on the drive, sometimes on the default folder, sometimes neither of them, only on desktop. It shows error saying would you like to save in the downloads folder, I click OK, it shows the same error. So i have to save it on desktop
 and then place it in my drive.</p>
<p>2) I cannot connect to VPN, the settings won't let me change few settings, I also realized there are about 40 ethernet connections, which I am sure I did not make, and I cannot delete them either.</p>
<p>3) I cannot delete the files from my pen drive, back up hard drive, also cannot create new folders either, I am way to annoyed buy this problem. I tried changing permission for the drives, but the special permission tab is not active, it shows my both accounts
 have full control, still I cannot modify the contents.</p>
<p>4) I am trying to back up my data, it won't do that either.</p>
<p>5) It updates and restarts, nightmare!!! the PC will take an hour to start once updated happened 2-3 times.</p>
<p>W10 feels great but all these problems overshadow it way too much.</p>

<h2>            Fuzzy image in Movie Maker</h2>
                    <p>I clicked "Preview Full Screen" in an wlmp file. The image (especially inserted caption and title) would be fuzzy at times. I would close the Movie Maker and re-open the file. Then, it works properly. I am interested in knowing why the images would be fuzzy
 at times. Thanks.</p>

            <p>There is apparently an issue with captions added to your movie causing the full screen preview to lose resolution.&nbsp; As a workaround, you can try making your preview window bigger before switching to full screen, or you can save/reopen the project.&nbsp; You can
 also switch the aspect ratio and it will reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More details are in this thread:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/moviemaker-av/full-screen-preview-window-problem/2be8d0c7-d452-4b31-ad4a-5ec9355c1e19">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/moviemaker-av/full-screen-preview-window-problem/2be8d0c7-d452-4b31-ad4a-5ec9355c1e19</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully the Movie Maker team will fix this issue.&nbsp; Fortunately, I don't think it affects the final movie.&nbsp; You can save that and it will be fine.</p>

<h2>            Not Informed By Skype, False Advertising, I Want Out</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I signed up for Skype because I saw that I didn't need to download their software on my computer. There was nothing stated about HAVING to download Chrome or a plugin or even their dashboard prior to signing up for phone service. Now, I find that I can't
 do anything until I take Chrome, which I don't want and shouldn't have to accept. This is crap and I resent the trickery of Skype and Microsoft.</p>

            Try this:<br />
<br />
<p><span>Restore Point:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try tapping F8 at startup, and from the&nbsp;list of startup selections, select Safe Mode by using UP Arrow Key to go there &gt; then&nbsp;hit Enter.<br />
<br />
Try a System Restore once there, to pick a Restore Point&nbsp;before your problem..<br />
<br />
Click Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; System Restore &gt; pick a different time &gt; Next &gt; etc<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
If you have not made the Recovery disk, and the above fails:<br />
<br />
<span>At the bottom of the splash Screen at startup/power on, there usually is a Key number, F10, or F11,&nbsp;to hit to start Recovery Process, to take it back to factory standards (out of the box).<br />
<br />
Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options&nbsp;, and start a factory standards recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair computer option.<br />
<br />
See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.<br />
<br />
Each manufacturer has their own way of doing a Recovery to factory standards.<br />
<br />
And save, if possible,&nbsp;all your Data before you do it, as a reinstall wipes everything from your Hard Drive..<br />
</span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Vista Burning software from the above link.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After installing above ISO burning software, right-click on Knoppix ISO file &gt; Copy Image to CD.</span></p>

<p><span>Knoppix does not install on your PC; just uses your PC's resources, RAM, Graphics, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Change the Boot Order in YOUR computer/laptop to make the CD/DVD Drive 1 in the Boot Order.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Plug in a Flash Drive/Memory Stick, BOOT with the Live CD, and you should be able to read your Hard Drive.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>When the desktop loads, you will see at least two hard drive icons on the desktop (one for your hard drive and
 one for the USB drive). </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Click on the hard drive icons to open them up and figure out which drive is which.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Right-click the USB drive icon and choose "Actions &gt; Change read/write mode" so you can write to the drive (it's
 read-only by default for security reasons).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Now find the files you want to back up and drag and drop them to the USB drive. When you are finished, shut down

<h2>            My wifi adapter suddenly disappeared</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until 3 days back i used wifi without any issues since i bought this laptop. 2 days back i usually switched on the laptop and saw that wifi not searching for available devices and opened network sharing window and found that wireless adapter is missing in
 the list of devices. I thought it's because of old version wifi driver software. So i downloaded a new updated driver directly from dell support page. I installed it 2 days back and then it's started to work perfectly. But yesterday i switched on my lap and
 again the wifi adapter is missing. So this time with the same setup file i tried installing and after the extracting the package it says an error saying "Hardware is missing. So the install is failed". I got shocked because i never did anything other than
 switching it off and on. And understood that my wifi adapter inside the lap is not working and i need to get it repaired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But today i just tried installing again to take the screenshot of the error to post in MS community but this time it installs perfectly without any errors. It's a double shock because it's getting back to work. So my wifi is working now. But don't know what
 will happen after the next boot. It's all like magic happening with my lap. Guys, please help me. I am posting my lap and wifi driver software details below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop - Dell Inspiron 1545, 4 GB RAM, 320 GB HDD, 512 MB Graphics, Intel Core 2 Duo, Win 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>Driver - Wireless WLAN 1397 Half MiniCard(4312bg). Application version: A01.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me to resolve this issue.</p>

            In the network sharing window the WIFI adapter is not showing and then i tried to install the latest driver software but now it says "No compatible hardware found. The software you are trying to install is not supported in this system". I can understand
 it sayd that my laptop is not having any WIFI. But the truth is i have internal wifi adapter and using it for more than 5 years. This same issue happened a lot of times.

<h3> imfancynancy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is my Touchpad not working since I did the windows 10 upgrade&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Inspiron 1525 that the touchpad isn't recognized.</p>
<p>I have followed the steps that were shared on this site.</p>
<p>They did not help and it only shows a PS/2 compatible mouse plugged into the mouse port.</p>
<p>It says it is working fine?</p>
<p>I have NEVER used a mouse with this computer!</p>
<p>There are no other devices showing (synoptics?) connected.</p>
<p>I searched for updates and it shows I have the most current update.</p>
<p>I can only use my pointer if I place it on the scroll bar and go down,&nbsp;</p>
<p>it will not go up. It will not shrink or expand anything.</p>
<p>I totally rely on my touchpad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>Okay, based on the message you said it gave you, I think that the driver for the touchpad might be incompatible with windows 10 due to the older programming of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might just not be able to use the drivers Dell designed for the laptop, but as a last resort, try downloading and running this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://drivers.synaptics.com/Synaptics_v19_0_19_1__C__x86-x64__Win10__Signed__MS_Win10_UXUI_PS2_SMbus.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That is the driver for Synaptics, which is the company who manufactures your trackpad.</p>

<h2>            Automatic Repair loop</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I turn on my laptop it goes to the Automatic Repair screen (your pc did not start correctly. Press restart to restart your PC, which can sometimes fix the problem. You can also press Advanced Options to try other options to repair your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click restart and it comes back to this screen over again. There are no boot options or ways to start in safe mode, regardless of how many times I restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click on Advanced Options and I get a blank blue screen with no options to select. I don't have a Windows 10 installation disk either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be grateful for any help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Try running StartUp Repair from a Windows 10 boot disk or USB drive. That</p>
<p>often will work when running from the recovery environment does not.<br />
<br />
You can make a Windows 10 Install disk and try to use it to repair the present<br />
installation. Do not try to do a clean install with it however because if the upgrade<br />
was not fully activated for a few days then the clean install will not activate.<br />
<br />
Make a Windows 10 Disk using the Media Creation Tool - select to install on<br />
another computer and the same version you have now. You can make a USB<br />
or DVD to boot with. Select Troubleshoot - Advanced Options&nbsp; - Automatic<br />
Repair.<br />
<br />
Installing Windows 10 using the media creation tool - create media then<br />
boot with it - use method I outlined above.<br />

                    <p>I have a Dell Optiplex 960 that was delivered as Windows 7, and I finally bit the bullet and installed Windows 10 when Microsoft started getting insistent about it last fall. Everything went pretty well, and I even like the changes.<br />
<br />
I started a Windows Update cycle Sunday before I left for an event, and came back to a doorstop. INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE was the error message. Nothing was working. The drive wouldn't boot. Bad news all around, but _most_ of my stuff was backed up or in the
 cloud anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got a new drive, installed a fresh copy of Windows 10, and now I'm wondering whether I have any chance of recovering the old drive.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions on just recovering the data?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>John</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There is a slim chance that you can still recover your files since you seem to have a faulty hard drive. However, you can still connect your old hard drive to your computer and check if it is still accessible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any other questions.</p>

</p><p>I strongly suspect the hard drive is just fine. The problem resulted with the MS upgrade for Windows 10 (it was just one of the automatic updates that I let execute) toasted my hard drive. Prior to the upgrade, it was just fine. I booted up under a live
 Puppy Linux DVD, and while I can see the drive and traverse directories, there is nothing of the Windows installation or any of my data remaining that I can find. Unfortunately I installed Windows 10 from the pressured update from Windows 7, so I had no installation
 media. I was able to build a new drive ($60 for a terabyte? Sign me up!) with an ISO image I found at the Microsoft site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my "other question" - how can I get an installation key for this installation? Since I originally installed Win10 as an upgrade, there was no key that I had to enter. Since the Microsoft upgrade destroyed the drive, I can't get any installation key
 from that drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            We appreciate you sharing with us those information, John.<br />
<br />
To answer your other query, you can still install Windows 10 on your PC by downloading an installation media without obtaining a product key. You may follow the steps under the "<strong>Using the tool to create installation media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO
 file) to install Windows 10 on a different PC</strong>" selection from this <strong>
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> if you have downloaded a different one or to make sure that you've downloaded the correct one.<br />
<br />
Let us know what happens next.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

<p>Wow! Really, it's as though you didn't bother to read my comment before replying. You have provided me the link to the steps I've already done, as stated in my first post as well as my second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm trying to do is recover information from the hard drive that the upgrade trashed. It's become close to moot, because I've had to do a lot of work to catch up to the point, program and data wise, that I was before the upgrade trashed my hard drive.
 At this point, I'd be happy (yes, happy - even after having to buy a new hard drive, install Windows, install umpteen applications, rebuild a number of scripts, and other stuff) just to recover my email trail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can help me recover data from my old hard drive, I'd be happy to listen.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
John</p>

            Just to clarify, we've answered your "other question" you've mentioned, as it seems that your original question has already been answered.<br />
<br />
A clean installation of Windows might really remove all the files, apps and customization applied on the PC. That is why, backing up all files is a must before doing a major or critical upgrade or changes on device.<br />
<br />
The error message "<strong>INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE</strong>" you've received is usually caused by faulty disk controller drivers or hard disk errors. This explains why your drive might be at fault.<br />
<br />
You may contact the nearest Microsoft Store or your local technician about recovering your files.<br />
<br />
We're just a post away should you have further queries.<br />
<br />
<br />
Best.
