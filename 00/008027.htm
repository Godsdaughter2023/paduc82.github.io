            <p>It would be helpful if you indicated what you have tried since the attempted update.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Without too much knowledge of what you have tried, I might suggest that you try the update on a different PC if that is possible.</p>
<p>Also, you might want to check the available space on your phone.&nbsp; You may have too much on it and it cannot complete the update.&nbsp; If you have a lot of pictures and music, sync them to your PC then remove from the device and try the update again Shane.</p>

    <title>Unable to keep source formatting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jitendra kumar verma  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to keep source formatting</h2>
                    Since I got Excel 2007 anytime I copy/cut data from a worksheet and pasted it into a different location within the same document the pasted data would keep source formatting. &nbsp;If I copied/cut an entire column and pasted it to a new location within the
 same document the pasted column would keep the source column's width and height properties.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Starting a few days ago whenever I do any of the actions described above Excel used destination formatting.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have not manually changed any settings on Excel. &nbsp;How do I fix my settings so I keep source formatting?</div>

    <title>Backup.arc - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lambriano  say:</h3>
<h2>            Backup.arc</h2>
                    Hey, everybody!<br />
I have made a backup copy of the N95 phone memory to the memory card and after that updated the phone software using the latest NSU and the latest PC Suite 6.85. After that I have tried to restore the Backup.arc to the phone and all the info was restored except
 of the contacts info (I have tried 4 times on my phone and several other Nokia phones N73, 6110, 5700) . So I wonder if somebody had the same problem or maybe even has a solution for it? I know that there is an .nbu Nokia_Contacts_Transfer application that
 miksu (Great guru!!! Respect!) has advised but in this case it doesn't work. Backup.arc is a phone-made backup copy and I think we need a converter that will make it a compatible .nbu file or maybe some other application that will allow us to transfer contacts
 from this .arc file to the phone in the PC. Anyways, if somebody has any ideas, please share! :) Peace!

            The backup.arc will probably only properly restore to another N95 (or the same N95 where it was made).<br />
<br />
A PC Suite backup should restore to other phones, too, but if you didn't use that to make the backup, then you may be out of luck (unless you have the N95 where to restore it, and then redo the backup using PC Suite).<br />
<br />
Also, if you have the N95, you can use the Transfer app on the phone for direct phone-to-phone sync.

            Yeah, I know all this stuff, but the problem is that I have tried to restore this copy to another N95 and the effect is the same. I have a feeling that there are no contacts in that file. But why? When we do that from the PC Suite we have all kinds of
 options to select what kinds of data we want to backup, but in the phone it is simple: backup the phone memory. So is the contacts are in the phone they MUST be backuped. So, thus, I don't really understand what to do. There is no way to my knowledge to find
 out if the contacts are indeed stored in that file. Only if I use programming...but I'm not that good at it :)

            Try deleting all the contacts from the phone before trying restoration from Backup.arc. It's just a guess, so it's up to you...

                    I have lost emails and attachments in Outlook. &nbsp;When searching for the "lost" documents I have found them saved as "olk". &nbsp;However, when i try to open the file I get "Outlook cannot open the file because it is not associated with the default identity."
<div>On further investigation it appears that whole folders have also disappeared. &nbsp;It seems that all work done in Outlook since Jan 2011 has been affected.</div>

This usually means you've deleted or renamed something somewhere along the line of folders leading up to&nbsp;<b>~/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Office 2011</b>&nbsp;<b>Identities</b> (where " ~ " is your home folder). Some folks do it trying to keep an orderly home
 folder without realizing they're affecting their Outlook data. If Outlook detects a change it will automatically create an empty set of these folders.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
If you haven't deleted or renamed anything then you can also try launching Outlook with the&nbsp;<b>Option</b>&nbsp;key held down to open the Database Utility application. Your current identity will be in bold. If you see another one there then this may be your missing
<div>
<br />
<div>
If you have a Time Machine or other backup then you can restore your&nbsp;<b>Office 2011 Identities</b>&nbsp;folder from a time when your data was present.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Hope this helps!</div>

                    Ok, so Skype is not letting me log in. When I try to make my account and it keeps going back to my name... like something is wrong with it. I have tried changing my last and first name, but NOTHING seems to work. Anyone know how to help? Oh, and yes...
 I have refreshed the page and I am on my iPad.

    <title>Why does my Nokia Lumia 635 device make me nauseated&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> littlelove1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does my Nokia Lumia 635 device make me nauseated&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I would be most grateful if someone could answer the question of, why does my&nbsp;Lumia 635 phone make me nauseated when I am looking at the screen for any length of time?</p>
<p>&nbsp; I want to be candid and tell you that I did get this phone through a government program for low income people and I am beyond glad to have qualified for the program. &nbsp;My issue is whenever I view the screen for more than a minute or so, I become terribly
 nauseated. This is quite a disturbing development as I am already prone to a disabling condition which renders a person quite ill with symptoms such as nausea, bitter taste, excessive watering of the mouth, that can last for as long as a month at a time.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I discovered this condition, referred to as, "Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome" or "Abdominal Migraines" approximately eight years ago when I began to suffer from intractable nausea and vomiting that none of the doctors I was referred to could diagnose. It wasn't
 until I read an article online out of the University of Minnesota that I discovered the probable cause. The doctor who discovered this condition told me in an email that by the symptoms I had described to her and the history of all the specialists I had seen
 and their inability to diagnose me, she said it seemed as though I was indeed suffering from this condition. After she and I communicated and I joined the support group, did the research, then with the help of my PCP, tried and found the best combination of
 both, supplements and prescription medications, did I finally find the perfect set of combinations to halt most of the worst symptoms of this insidious condition. &nbsp;I only say probable because I am not allowed to seek out an actual diagnosis locally. The only
 medical center in the Valley of the Sun who can diagnose me is at the Mayo clinic. I am medically disabled by multiple conditions and on Medicare and Medicaid and although most people believe that lawfully, a person cannot be denied medical access to diagnostics
 and treatment, due to their inability to pay, both myself and my PCP contacted the Mayo clinic and were denied access to medical care.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; It seems quite unbelievable and inappropriate for anyone to be denied medical care this day and age, but I can say I have seen it done, first hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Recently, I watched my best friend suffer from a very rare form of leukemia. Her citizenship papers had not been completed due to the increased demand for so many other people requesting the same type of legal change. We had been initially told that if
 she were to go to Maricopa Medical Center, where they are a teaching hospital, as well as a county funded, not for profit hospital with a very updated cancer treatment center, she would stand the best chance of treatment with a very high rate of survival in
 this rare and difficult to treat cancer. </p>
<p>&nbsp; Mari' was diagnosed in&nbsp;August of 2015 with this cancer and the only form of help she could receive through our government programs was emergent treatment only through AHCCCS. This meant that the only thing she was to be treated for was, if her red blood
 cell level were to drop too low and/or her platelet levels became too low, she would be admitted to the hospital in order to be given red blood cells, plasma or platelets. Once she was stabilized, she would be released. &nbsp;Each and every month following her
 diagnosis and after her regular female cycle, she would have to be readmitted and have more infusions with some or all of those elements, needing to be replenished. The problem with this process was the fact that each time she needed to receive any blood products
 from donation, more and more antibodies in her blood would react in order to fight off what the human body recognized as a foreign invader. I think she had a total of nine different infusions of blood products to stem off her loss of blood and other similar
 elements her body required. The biggest issue with all of this going on was the fact that as she received more donated products, it lessened her chances of being able to undergo the only option for attempting to save her life, which was a bone marrow transplant.
 If you never had received any type of donated blood products and received a donated bone marrow transplant, your body still recognizes those products as unwanted or invaders to your immune system. Unless you are excessively lucky enough to be able to find
 a complete match of your bone marrow, which I am told is near impossible in the first place, the person is always placed upon steroids and anti-rejection medications. None of the hospitals she went to or who treated her with any of those blood products, until
 the last hospital, which was Maricopa Medical Center, told her that she was decreasing any chances of finding a suitable, donor marrow without the antibodies already created by all the blood products received. Then, to top it all off, Maricopa Medical Center
 turned her down flat and told her that the costs for treatment to attempt to cure her would total a million dollars and they would not treat her. They referred her to San Jose Real Cancer Center in Mexico and this is all they would do for her. Maricopa Medical
 Center staff told her if they were able to find blood products for her that she did not already have the immunities for&nbsp;was&nbsp;next to zero. If they did treat her, it just increased the likelihood that if she were to try to do the bone marrow transplant in Mexico
 at the cancer center, it would be that much more unlikely they would be able to find any bone marrow donor without the antibodies she had already built up in her system. The situation of Mari' not having had her citizenship papers completed before her diagnosis
 and the utter lack of responsibility of all the people who treated her symptomatically, knew the odds of what she was up against and failed to warn her, combined, allowed this wonderful, smart, generous, loving and beautiful woman to die without a chance.
 Mari' left behind, her three children, the love of her life and his son, her nephew who she was raising to keep in a better situation, myself, her best friend, my son who loved her as well, more friends most people make in their extended lifetime, and hundreds
 of needy people from all around this earth whom she so often reached out to, when no one else would help!</p>
<p>&nbsp; I know this is the best country as far as freedom to live in but, the medical constabulary and the government's archaic sense of how important a single person is to so many other people and the value alone of her own life itself, is severely&nbsp;lacking in
 responsibility. &nbsp;I am now, severely disillusioned&nbsp;and disappointed in the way medical&nbsp;professionals view the&nbsp;way they treat patients. After all, if you read, swore to uphold and follow the Hippocratic oath, you cannot decide to fail to treat someone, just
 because of their national origin and/or their inability to pay for health care. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Sorry I got so long winded in my explanation, but unless people start to hear about some of these issues and on a broad scale, be able to communicate and share the message, none of this lack of concern for the well-being and the value of a person's life,
 will change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Back to my question: &nbsp;Is there anyone out there who is able to tell me why looking at the display on the Nokia Lumia 635, for any length of time beyond a glance, causes me such an assault on my visual and/or Neuro-motor controls. This problem is causing
 me nausea and sets me up for a very uncomfortable relationship with my new Windows based phone? I require an answer so that I may be able to offer this explanation to&nbsp;the telephone program which may allow me to swap out the new phone for a different phone
 with perhaps a larger or&nbsp;different resolution of the viewing screen. I am now so desperate that even if I am required&nbsp;to utilize a used device, as long as it will allow me to utilize the phone in the manner for which the programs was intended, I will be most
 grateful!</p>
<p>Thank you for any help!</p>
<p>Diana B.</p>

            <p>Dear Lynneth, Thank you for answering my question so quiickly. I really appreicate your efforts!</p>
<p>I am sorry to say that I had tried lowering brightness of the screen but this did not make a difference for me. As a matter of fact, I did not reply to your suggestion sooner because I have had a headache for close to a week now! The only way to determine
 if the headache was specific to the device was to not use it until I could determine if the headache was indigenous to the device or native to me!</p>
<p>It seems the headaches and dizziness are indigenous to the device! This is not what I call a good result. I am not certain what to do at this point, so I will have to think on it! This means to stay off the phone because my reasoning does not work well when
 I am experiencing a headache!</p>
<p>I appreciate the time you took to answer my question and I thank you for it!</p>
<p>Ll1<br />

<p>Hi C Demant,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you updating. Just to follow up with this concern, I would like to confirm if the .docx documents contain the same Excel graphs. If so, kindly try creating a new .docx document and insert a different Excel graph and check if the issue persists. This
 would help us identify if the problem is caused by the inserted Excel graphs.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To notify us and have us get back to you, simply reply to this post.

<p>Hi Jomel</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems random. We've experienced the problem with three separate Word files with different Excel graphs from different Excel files. On the other hand, I've tried to recreate the problem by filling hundreds of pages with different Excel graphs, which didn't
 lead to an error.</p>

<div>Hi Jerry Steiner,</div>
<div><br />
Google side bar is also an add-on and so you may want to disable it. It will not affect your Internet Explorer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may either disable it as I understood on the first instance, (Though you had mentioned uninstall) or uninstall it from "Programs and Features" as mentioned above.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you disable the Google tool bar and side bar, it will be easier for you to enable them when you want them rather than uninstalling them. So I'd suggest you to disable them.</div>

<h2>            Creating an automatic timestamp when you check a box &#40;VBA question&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am new to using VBA/writing script and could use some help. Please note I am using a Mac with Excel version 15.3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My goal is to create an automatic timestamp in column B when you check a checkbox I have inserted into column A. The timestamp in column B would be adjacent to the checkbox checked in Column A. See a screenshot of my spreadsheet set up below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aebdffad-95c9-4b4d-9683-ddcd0545cdc9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aebdffad-95c9-4b4d-9683-ddcd0545cdc9" /></a></p>
<p>Using some other forums, I found someone that used the below script for a similar purpose:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Sub</span> CheckBox_Date_Stamp()</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>Dim</span> cbx <span>As</span> CheckBox</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>'Application.Caller returns the name of the CheckBox that called this macro</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>Set</span> cbx = ActiveSheet.CheckBoxes(Application.Caller)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>'.TopLeftCell returns the cell address located at the top left corner of the cbx checkbox</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>With</span> cbx.TopLeftCell.Offset(0, 1)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>'Check the checkbox status (checked or unchecked)</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>If</span> cbx.Value = xlOn <span>Then</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>' Checkbox is Checked</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>.Value = Date</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>Else</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>' Checkbox is unchecked</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>.Value = ""</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>End</span> <span>If</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>End</span> <span>With</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>End<span> </span>Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried this, entered this exact code and said 'run program', I got this error message: &nbsp;"Run-time error '1004': Application-defined or object-defined error". Can someone point me in the right direction on this? Is this script correct for what I am
 trying to do, and if so, what's up with the error message? Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>Thank you, Gord!</p>
<p>
</p><p>That mostly worked, with a slight glitch. The date appeared, but not in the adjacent cell. It posted in the adjacent cell in the row above (for teacher lecturing, it posted over the 'timestamp' label). Do you know how I can fix that? Is it something in the
 code?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it stamped the date appropriate. Can I edit the code so that it posts the date and the current time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much.<br />

    <title>Inbox emails automatically moving to Junk - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kellyhuenink  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inbox emails automatically moving to Junk</h2>
                    Hello! Emails will reach the Inbox and then spontaneously move to the Junk box. Many are from contacts which Hotmail knows are not junk. The fact that they first appear in the inbox before moving is the mystery. I know how to handle them if they are in
 Junk, but with this new issue, when I mark them as NOT JUNK, they still move back to the Junk box if left in the Inbox for a while. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.&nbsp;

            <p>I have the same problem and your suggestions do not help at all.</p>
<p>The problem is that we have important emails ending in Junk folder, not that we have too much spam!</p>
<p>I have absolutely no issue deleting spam emails from my inbox, but I don´t want to find important emails in the Junk folder when it´s too late!
<br />
And these Safe Senders - how can I add someone to Safe senders list when I don´t know who is going to write me tomorrow?<br />
</p>
<p>From the other forums it´s obvious that the behaviour of the Outlook spam filter is a complete disaster so please don´t make the situation even worse with such misleading suggestions.</p>

<h2>            Showing only a &#34;group&#34; name in an email, not all names &#38; addresses within group</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently had to create a group for mass emails (total of 40 people within the group).&nbsp; What I'm wondering is if it is possible to somehow set it so that when I send this one monthly email to the group, it will only display the group name, not everyone's
 first &amp; last names and their email addresses?&nbsp; Yes, I can use the BCC and send it to myself, but in case I forget... ;)&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>

                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been working on making a VB script for a SCADA system, where the end user wants a button he can click and it will automatically create a new mail(Outlook 2013) with predefineded parameters.</p>
<p>So far I got it to work with the To, Subject and Body parameters, but when I implement the attachment parameter to my command line I get the Command line argument is not valid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Command line I'm sending to outlook:</p>
<p>mailto:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***?subject=my test&amp;body=see attachment&amp;attachment="C:\file.txt"</p>

            <p>Agreed</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure there are still problems, serious problems and the final release MUST have more flexibility and options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the best test is when I go back to daily personal Win 8.1 or work Win 7 computers they&nbsp;feel old and clunky.</p>

            If you have set a category when creating a task on your device or PC, it will remain with the task when you sync with MyPhone.&nbsp; You cannot edit the task from the web interface other than to edit the Name, Due Date, Status and Priority.<br />
<br />
Remember, MyPhone is a repository for your data.&nbsp; It is not intended to be a means to create items like you can with Outlook.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
As an aside, you can create appointments on the Calendar using the web interface.&nbsp; In time, we might see increased functionality.

<h2>            circular reference - how to default to always have iterations</h2>
                    Is there a way to set excel so that it always defaults to having it run iterations on every spreadsheet i open?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I keep checking the box, and then invariably i will open a spreadsheet and it will give me a circular reference error.&nbsp; i would just like
 it to always assume i want to calculate with iterations.&nbsp; thanks

<p>Hi Carissa:</p>
<p>I'm having the same problem, I went to my block list, I entered the followig addresses as blocked sender:</p>
<p>- <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">- </span>@capital.com.tw</p>
<p>- *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>but the blocked list showed only *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;and @capital.com.tw (whenever I tried to enter
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, hotmail said the address is already there).&nbsp;My understanding is&nbsp;that email address does not matter if it's capitalized, so why I'm still receiving emails send by *** Email address is removed for privacy ***?</p>
<p>
</p><p>ps: the other blocked list seems working fine, only this one is causing me trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Thanks Arvind for your reply, i checked my settings and I don't have Manage Rules, these are the steps that I did (hopefully only the wordings are different):</p>

<p>but unfortunately there's no rules in there. What else can I check for this strange behavior?</p>

<p>Hi Arvind:</p>
<p>Unfortunately your setup did not work, I still received the email from the user with capital A, the small cap one is blocked, but the capital A is not, and all other emails went to Junk folder (I guess it's expected, if the user is not in my safe list, will
 be send to the Junk, but why is capital A is still in my Inbox? I've checked my safe list, and this email is not there!!! What else can I try?</p>
<p>ps: I blocked the small cap user, its domain, but his email (with capital letter) is still coming through.</p>
