    <title>Bluetooth keyboard drivers problem on Managed Win7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bluetooth keyboard drivers problem on Managed Win7</h2>
                    I have a Logitech MX5500 bluetooth keyboard and I want to connect it to my laptop using internal bluetooth module. The laptop runs Managed Windows 7 Enterprise (auto driver update is disabled).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I take the usual steps: Add a bluetooth device, successfully enter pairing code. After entering the code Windows says to wait for additional driver loads and quits the device add master, but nothing happens (no driver load notifications appear). In Devices
 and Printers the keyboard is greyed out. I can't see the keyboard in devices manager and thus can't update its drivers from there. Also, Loading drivers from logitech website doesn't help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This keyboard worked fine on Win7 Starter, so I believe the problem's with the autoupdate being turned off - but I can' t see a way to do the update manually.</div>
                </div>

    <title>Default App problem in Windows 10&#58; Edge vs. Adobe Acrobat for pdf - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> josephus flavius  say:</h3>
<h2>            Default App problem in Windows 10&#58; Edge vs. Adobe Acrobat for pdf files</h2>
                    <p>I have been looking into this for a few months now, and I remain puzzled, and very disappointed, that MS has yet to fix this old problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I set the default app for pdf files to Adobe Acrobat -- and, yes, I did uncheck the Acrobat settings so it doesn't open in the browser -- the setting remains for a while and then it reverts back to Edge. This probably happens when Windows 10 gets auto-updated
 (a forced-update over which we no longer have any control, as best as I can tell)...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, each time Windows 10 is updated (or, possibly, another process changes the previous settings), the default app for pdf reverts back to Edge. This has happened several times in the past few months. To put it very kindly, it's an annoying punishment...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would someone at MS please jump to address this directly and tell us, I hope, that they are working to correct the problem with an idea about when to expect the fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>JF</p>

            <p>Hi Arun,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already re-set the default program for pdf to Acrobat. So, following your advice, I changed it back to Edge and then turned on Acrobat. Waiting a few minutes already, it did not prompt me to review/change the default settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT, this might be because I'm not using Acrobat DC. Rather, I'm using an old Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro (ver. 9.5.5) and, it seems, that version doesn't do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm going back to settings and will re-set the default program to Acrobat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must say, though, that having set this program already several times since installing Windows 10, I am puzzled and disappointed why I need to do it and do it again, and again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>JF</p>

            <p>Update: 29 AUG 2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>The changes I made 10 days ago did not last. Windows 10 was probably updated and the default program for pdf files was changed back, again, to MS Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a very annoying problem, and not one I remember from any Windows version -- and I go back to the very first...</p>

<p>This is STILL a problem at the END of 2017. It is clearly by MS DESIGN to force people to use Edge. The reset doesn't seem to happen for a good reason since the notifications appear when I am not using Acrobat or VLC or whatever default I have set. As the
 original poster said this is very annoying. My understanding is MS uses the information gathered from Edge in a similar way to Google as a source of revenue. I guess, therefore, that this is considered an anti-issue by the corporation. I will be interested
 to see if this message is ever published or responded to.</p>

    <title>Possible freezing bug found in Windows 8.1&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnnygui  say:</h3>
<h2>            Possible freezing bug found in Windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all I want to say that I was still able to reproduce this feezing bug after&nbsp;doing a reformat and reinstalling Windows 8 and upgrading it to Windows 8.1 with Update 1 along with all&nbsp;other latest Windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps: </p>
<p>1. Open the File association dialog where you can change the programs associated with specific filetypes (search for&nbsp;"association" in the Search Bar under Settings):</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3a0dbc0d-52e4-46f7-9f5e-6a4b1253bd91" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Select a random filetype and click "Another program" in the right upper corner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. A "Windows 8" style menu pops up in which you can choose a program. Click "More Options"&nbsp;in that menu and scroll down to click "Search another app on this PC" (mine is in Dutch):</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/72af2f1d-9f0d-4182-886d-592680e66f1b" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>4. A browsing dialog appears in which you can choose a program, don't select anything and immediately click on "Cancel"</p>
<p>

</p><p>For some reason the desktop File association dialog won't open in Safe mode and is giving me this error when I click on it via the Search bar:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/409cdb67-e6a4-4bfd-8ace-77030250af75" />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Niet nader omschreven fout = Unspecified&nbsp;error</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening the File association dialog via the Control Panel also doesn't work in Safe mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you try this out and see if this is normal?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I just did a reformat and the freezing bug is still there. The problem is that it's totally random and I'm not sure what actually triggers it other than immediately clicking "Cancel" in the browsing dialog.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I just checked the logs and there aren't any error logs coming up in 'System'. The only 2&nbsp;logs that&nbsp;come up when I try the freezing bug appear in 'Application' and says:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The Windows Location Provider has successfully started.</p>
<p>2. The Windows Location Provider has successfully shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are just information logs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I think that letting the PC on for a good 30 minutes on the Desktop without moving the mouse or doing anything increases the risk of the freezing bug. I'm not sure though.</p>

            <p>I'm having the same problem.&nbsp; In my case I have several versions of SQL Server Management Studio installed (2008 R2, 2012, 2014).&nbsp; I wanted to change the default program for .sql files from SSMS 2008 R2 to SSMS 2014.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for sharing this! The bug is very random and difficult to trigger in my case. One would have to try and reproduce this several times before discovering it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if this problem is still present in Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One controller bricked after using Xbox Accessories App on Windows 10</h2>
                    My controller was working fine but the bluetooth was being spotty. I looked up solutions and a number of people were saying to update the firmware via the Xbox Accessories app. An OFFICIAL Microsoft app, I may add. After doing this, my controller is now
 classified as "Xbox One controller DFU" and is considered simply a controller updater, not a controller itself. It will not turn on or function in any way. To say I'm pissed off would be an understatement, because the only solution I can find online is to
 plug it into an Xbox One console which I do not own. Is there a way to revert my controller's software and make it be recognised properly, or am I going to to just have to return it and buy a new one?&nbsp;

<h2>            Kurdish &#40;Kurmanji&#41; language package and keyboard support.</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>My question is about whether a language package and keyboard support for Kurdish (Kurmanji-Latin script) will be added to the mainstream of Windows.</p>
<p>I use both Ubuntu and Windows, and very satisfied with the support of Ubuntu for Kurdish while writing in Kurdish. However, I get difficulties while doing so on Windows. So my question: when would we be able get the same support from Windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your helps.</p>

<h2>            I want to system restore to original factory condition.</h2>
                    I want to system restore to original factory condition. I made a backup set of disc when I originally bought my hp pavillion dv6823us laptop, and doesnt matter if I try to use them or boot up and try F11 , neither work. Device manager tells that cd rom
 is working and has latest driver. When try F11 after reboot, nothing happens it goes on to desktop. I have tried games, music cds, and other disc and I hear it hum and light flashes but wont read nothing. Id appreciate any help. Running Windows Vista IE9

<p><span>if you are having problems with the manufacturers recovery process contact the manufacturer</span></p>

<p><b><u>These are the various ways to reinstall Vista if the Recovery disks you made do not work</u></b></p>
<p><span>contact the computer/laptop manufacturer and ask them to send you vista recovery disks to reinstall the operating system back the way it was when you bought it</span></p>
<p><span>they do that for a nominal $ cost</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>also ask them if you have a recovery partition on your hard drive to put it back to how you bought it</span></p>

<p><span>Hi Ftr461,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Is this happening when you try to pin a particular
 program or all the programs?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Were you able to pin the programs previously
 on this computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes to the computer before
 this issue started?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If this is happening with all the programs, you may follow the steps below and check if it helps you pin the program
 to the taskbar. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try to drag and drop the program to taskbar and check if the program gets pinned in the taskbar. Access the link
 below to know more about how to pin a program. </span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Pin-a-program-to-the-taskbar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Pin-a-program-to-the-taskbar</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the above step does not help to pin the program, you may try to run</span><span>System
 File Checker (SFC) scan and check if it can help you fix the issue of pinning the program.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To run SFC Scan, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>Click Start, and then type cmd in the Start Search box.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>Right-click cmd in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>At the command prompt, the following line, and then press ENTER: sfc /scannow&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below to know more about running System File Checker:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936212</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 3</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the above steps fail, I would suggest you to try creating a new user account and verifying if
 the you can pin the program in the new user account. </span></p>
<p><span>Create a new user account.</span></p>
<p><span>a.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Open User Accounts by clicking the
<span>Start</span> button, clicking<span>Control Panel</span>, clicking <span>User Accounts and Family Safety</span> (or clicking<span>User Accounts</span>, if you are connected to a network domain), and then clicking<span>User Accounts</span>.</span></p>
<p><span>b.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click
<span>Manage another account</span>.&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>c.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click on
<span>Create a new account</span>.</span></p>
<p><span>d.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Type the name you want to give the user account, click an account type, and then click<span>Create Account</span>.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are able to pin using the new profile, access the link below and follow the steps to fix the user profile.<br />

<h2>            cracking sound when i play music, videos, games.</h2>
                    <p>so here goes....</p>
<p>when i play music, videos in pc speaker on my hp oem laptop running windows 8.1, i hear a popping or cracking sound every after 20 to 40 seconds. not just that but also when am playing games like nfs mw 2005, the cracking sound disturbs the game by making
 it run slow for a few seconds maybe 10 seconds as maximum. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And i have noticed also that when i play other games like x men wolverine with headsets on, some parts in the game play in loud speaker.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>am thinking maybe its a virus issue but antivirus detects nothing. maybe reinstalling some drivers but i dont know how to do that and i dont which ones to reinstall.<br />

            What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: msinfo32
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.

<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - right click the Start button, click Control Panel &gt; Troubleshooting &gt; Hardware and Sound
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.

<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already

            Hi Mulenga.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update the sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers or install them as well.  
<br />
<br />Right click the volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound driver in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br /> 
<br />While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br />
<br />When did this behavior begin?  If you have an idea you might be able to System Restore back to a point before it began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            getting low on ssd drive.</h2>
                    i bought surface pro with 128 gb ssd one month back. During the month i have not installed a single application, app or anything but still with daily updates of windows 10 i am getting low on memory. Now it shows that only 35 gb is left. i wonder if i
 would be left with any memory in a month further or so. can anybody tell me what options do i have (cloud is ok but i am not storing anything in the pro)

            Hi Shobhit,
<br />
<br />Windows and its constant updates, should not be using up that much space on your SSD, typically it would be 20GB - 25GB for Windows 10
<br />
<br />128GB SSD is about 117GB usable, minus 35GB free space, is 82GB and approx. 25GB for Windows leaves 57GB and so on . . .
<br />
<br />I reckon you are missing quite a lot of hard drive space . . .
<br />
<br />Windows Explorer is useless when it comes to working out where your hard drive space is being used . . .
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility called Treesize. Using that tool, you will instantly see where this space is being used
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />
<br />Once you have worked out where this space is being used, please let me know so I can advise on what is safe to remove . . .

<p>hi Dave,</p>
<p>Actually, there was the backup folder for the older windows version(windows.old). i just bought the laptop so i didn't know about older/newer windows. Later i deleted it, now the available free space is about 70 GB.</p>
<p>Anyway thanks for the help</p>

    <title>Laptop shuts down when it should sleep Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> setermoen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop shuts down when it should sleep Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I have a relatively new (&lt;4 months old) Asus Zenbook UX302LA ultrabook. &nbsp;It was working great up until about 2 weeks ago. &nbsp;Now if I tell it to "sleep" from the power menu, press the power button, close the lid, or tell it to sleep via keyboard shortcut
 fn+f1 the laptop shuts down instead of sleeping. &nbsp;I have not changed any of the power settings or installed any new software. &nbsp;I updated various drivers after the fact to see if they had something to do with it, and I have made sure to do all of the necessary
 windows updates. &nbsp;I have tried changing power plans, disabling "fast reboot," turning of wireless communications, disabling my antivirus, but all to no avail. &nbsp;I don't know why this is happening, and it is frustrating as it means I must always back up things
 before closing my laptop, I lose any open windows in my browser, etc. added to the fact that instead of a quick start-up from sleep I have a long(er) start-up from shut down every time I turn on m

            <p>Hi Setermoen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, I would like to apologize for the delay in responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is usually caused due to not having updated chipset drivers or due to some power settings related issues. I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it works for you.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Run the Power Troubleshooter and check.</p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to run the troubleshooter:</span></p>
<p>a. Press <strong>Windows + W</strong> keys on your keyboard to get the search option.</p>
<p>b. Type <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> and click <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</p>
<p>c. Now type <strong>Power troubleshooter</strong> in the <strong>search</strong> option.</p>
<p>d. Click on <strong>Power troubleshooter</strong> and follow the prompts to run the troubleshooter.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Try creating a new power plan and check if the issue persists. This is to check if there are incorrect settings that is causing this issue.</span></p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>Refer to the section "<strong>Can I create a power plan?</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>Try installing the latest chipset drivers from the Asus website and check if it helps.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found information about the power troubleshooter on other forums before posting here, as well as messing with the power plans. &nbsp;They did not provide a solution to the problem. &nbsp;I also updated all the drivers after this began to happen, including the chipset
 drivers, which also did not help. &nbsp;When no one responded on my post here, I simply "gave up" as it were and did a factory reset on the laptop. &nbsp;While I am unhappy that I had to do something that was so inconvenient, it has since worked perfectly.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>So a little over 2 weeks later and I am back. &nbsp;The issue has returned. &nbsp;I used the computer in the morning and it worked perfectly. &nbsp;I closed the lid and didnt use it again until a day later. &nbsp;When I opened it to use it, I found it strange that it had shut
 down instead of gone to sleep (as it should have done). &nbsp;I shut the lid to see what would happen, and it has gone back to shutting down instead of sleeping. &nbsp;I have all the latest drivers (chipset or otherwise), I did absolutely nothing to the power plans
 between the day when it worked and the day that it didnt. &nbsp;Windows has downloaded updates since the problem occurred, but it did not the night in question when "everything changed." &nbsp;I am at wits end as to what to do. &nbsp;I do not want to factory reset the laptop
 again. &nbsp;I have been reading around again online and have tried just about everything, but nothing seems to work. &nbsp;I would appreciate some assistance. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to be clear: &nbsp;when I close the lid, it does a correct shut down. &nbsp;I do not get any error about windows shutting down incorrectly etc., the computer just does not sleep. &nbsp;Even if I choose "sleep" from the power menu options, it still shuts down. &nbsp;It

            <p>In that case I believe that your "go to sleep" is working, but the "wake from sleep" is where the problem happens, and since Windows automatically reboots when a problem happens, it might appear to you as if it is always doing a full boot.&nbsp; In reality, it
 tried to wake up, failed, and instantly restarted because of the failure.</p>

    <title>Windows automatically restarted while I was logged in even though - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> red sun setting  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows automatically restarted while I was logged in even though Group Policy disabled it</h2>
                    <p>I have the Group Policy "No auto-restart with logged on users for scheduled automatic updates installations" enabled. I had enabled this policy on Windows 8.1 and it shows that it is still enabled after the Windows 10 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running a VM that runs a service to collate power usage data from devices in my home. If the service stops, the data is lost permanently. I left everything running when I went to bed last night, but when I woke up my devices were disconnected from the
 server. I logged in and reviewed the event log and saw that the computer had rebooted at 3:30am, shutting down the VM and killing the log service. All of my data from between 3:30am and 8:30 am was lost.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>The reason for the restart was:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">The process C:\WINDOWS\system32\svchost.exe (COMPUTER) has initiated the restart of computer COMPUTER on behalf of user NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM for the following reason: Operating System: Service pack (Planned)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Why is Windows 10 not respecting the no-forced reboot policy?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a number of other settings that Windows 10 does not respect - the 15 minute inactivity minimum before displaying the login prompt is the most annoying one on my Surface.</p>

            <p>I am not certain how putting this in TechNet resolves anything. &nbsp;It is my computer and I should be able to decide when I want to reboot it and when I want to install updates. &nbsp;I suggest the OP start using Ubuntu which can run VirtualBox and doesn't assume
 that anytime is just fine to reboot your machine. &nbsp;I find being unable to control this completely unacceptable, there are an infinite number of programs that run as a service which this forced reboot hurts. &nbsp;I recently had it reboot at 3:30AM when I was 36
 *GIGABYTES* into a 42GB HTTP download I could not resume. &nbsp;Please add a setting back to Disable Automatic Upgrades in the interface without going in the GP editor. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, the "scheduler" is not any better, it seems to silently schedule reboots at 3:30am without telling me about them. &nbsp;It is not a solution.<br />

            My assumption was that it was a bug, since I had group policy configured. I'm ok with forced reboots as long as there is an effective way to disable or prevent or delay them.

            <p>For the time being I think I might purchase an inexpensive USB wifi adapter and set it to metered. &nbsp;Updates do not automatically download on metered connections. &nbsp;I will just disable my ethernet connection and only re-enable it if I have to copy stuff back
 and forth between my NAS. &nbsp;It's a stop-gap solution but I cannot have my work, thoughts and everything else being randomly wiped out at 3:30am whenever MS decides to push out another update. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are correct the Group Policy setting is not working. &nbsp;Unfortunately because it is hidden its hard to claim it isn't doing as intended. &nbsp;What needs to be done is to restore the ability to prevent forced reboots. &nbsp;The group policy fix would be a start
 but realistically it never should have been done this way. &nbsp;I respect what MS is trying to do, but there should be a better way that doing this - you are alienating your power users.</p>

 being disconnected without notice by support and leaving my computer in a seriously altered state, no call back even though a phone # was requested and provided, I have no resolution. The account calendar is operational on other devices but not on the primary

            Thank you for the response. Yes it is the Calendar app. The calendar in Outlook/Mail still functions and the&nbsp; Microsoft Account Calendar app is functional on another device.&nbsp; I have repeatedly tried each of the recommendations. Troubleshooter returns "couldn't
 identify the problem". No recent changes to computer preceded the problem. No new software added. All available updates have been installed. I have have created, several times, a new user profile and the problem persists for each new user. Thanks again for
 your help.

    <title>Windows 10 recovery failed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mesamark  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 recovery failed</h2>
                    My HP Pavilion &nbsp;a6750f was Vista &gt;Win 7&gt; Win10. All was ok till I decided to reset back to factory so as to donate a working computer to a church charity. After running the recovery it returned an error stating that the recovery processed failed. Upon
 restarting it said there was no operating system. I have run the Advanced options over and over and am stuck with no operating system. What do I do now? Please and thanks.

            <p>If you have another PC then download the Media Creation tool and create yourself the windows install media. You can use the media to clean install windows. You do not need a key so skip that if requested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just be sure you get the media that matches the version of Windows 10 you had. (32/64bit, Home/Pro)</p>

<p>I already had a copy of Win 10 on a disk for previous upgrades. It wants the system to be "running" in order to install the disk. The system won't run so I can't use the disk method.</p>

            If you created the media correctly then you should be able to boot from the media (DVD or USB, depending on what you made) and that is how you start your system. You don't need to have the operating system running.

            I used that media on several computers. When I tried to use it on this computer, it told me I had to restart my computer and and then insert the disc. There was no option to restart, just shut down. When I shut it down and restarted it, it said the same
 thing, no OS found. I re-insert the disc and the same thing happened again. Stuck in a loop of no success.

            <p>You need to select an option to boot from the media, whether it is DVD or USB. Some times you need to go to the bios to change the boot order and others there is a key you can press to select the boot device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like your system is set to boot from the first hard drive so it always tries the hard drive which at the moment will not boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check you PC documents to see how to change the boot order. I suspect if it is Vista vintage that it will not boot from USB and needs a DVD.</p>

<p>You probably can't retrieve it, but nobody can answer a question like this for sure unless you tell us what e-mail program you are using.</p>
