            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting the query in Microsoft community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good to hear that you are using Windows 8.</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you are facing issues playing&nbsp; minecraft on Windows 8:</p></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try installing the updated Video card drivers in Windows 7 compatibility mode and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>To install the driver in compatibility mode, right-click on the setup file and click on ‘Troubleshoot Compatibility’.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope the information is helpful.</span></p>
<p><span>Please keep us posted if you face Windows issue in future. We would be happy to help!</span></p>

            <p>Hi NoahRoma,</p>

<p>To update a video card try these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Hold <strong>Windows key + X </strong>on the keyboard and select <strong>device manager.</strong></p>
<p>b. Now locate <strong>video card drivers</strong>. It is under <strong>Display drivers</strong> in device manager Window.</p>
<p>c. Right click the same and click on <strong>update driver software.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps!</p>

<p>What kind of computer (make and model) are you using? </p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like the IDT drivers for Windows 10 aren't ready yet. You can try switching to the built-in Windows driver for now:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Could you also please post your audio hardware ID here?</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>1. Run Device Manager</p>
<p>2. Go to Sound, video and game controllers</p>
<p>3. Double-click your audio device</p>
<p>4. Go to the Details tab</p>
<p>5. Select Hardware IDs</p>

            Hi JordanFischerLD 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />I am assuming you are able to get into your computer. If not, do let me know.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem. 
<br />
<br />If you are uploading Memory.dmp also, please upload it separately as the size of memory dump is very large.
<br />
<br />If you don't get minidump files in above folder, you will need to enable minidump generation. If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<p>Hey, Vijay</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, after booting my computer up to the home screen, the blue screen of death mainly shows up 20 seconds later, and during the 20 seconds prior to that, my desktop is loading so I can't really do anything until everything is loaded.</p>

            Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<p>Okay, I have just followed the instructions above and was able to login into safe mode without needing a USB drive. I just restarted my computer to enter the normal mode right now as mentioned and the blue screen of death still shows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to still do the method provided in safe mode?</p>

<p>Whoops, seems like I misunderstood the instructions.&nbsp;Anyways, I was able to locate the .dmp file and compressed and uploaded it onto my onedrive. Just in case, I uploaded two more .dmp afterwards with the time of 2:40 which I believe to be the time I first
 turn on this computer and got this message, the probably most credible one of 6:33 where I unknowingly switched to the normal side and got the message again when I should have stayed on the safe mode, and the 6:44 one which happened afterwards but just in
 case I still wanted to share it anyways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just in case, the file name of the 2:40 one is called 052219-26375-01.rar. the file of 6:33 is called 052219-19015-01.rar, and finally the 6:44 one is called 052219-18841-01.dmp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are also others that happened today which I think also are dumps of the same BSOD reason as I left my computer on to boot up whilst I did other things in the mean time meaning my computer probably restarted many times before I became aware of this
 problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How should I share the files with you?</p>

            1. After uploading, right click the file and choose share.
<br />2. Optional but recommended - Uncheck the Allow Editing
<br />3. Click Get a Link.
<br />4. Copy the link and paste the link here.

<p>Thank you for the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, this type of behavior is being caused by a corrupted system file or user profile. As an initial troubleshooting, we recommend that you use the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-US/help/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
System File Checker (SFC)</a> tool. This tool will scan and repair any corrupted system files found on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, we would like to know if the issue occurs in other user accounts on your computer. If you only have a single user account, we suggest creating another one by following the instructions on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13951/windows-create-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. Please don't forget to choose Windows 7 on the drop-down menu to see the steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted and we'll be willing to assist you further.</p>

    <title>Time it takes to receive a replacement Surface - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> caraperu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Time it takes to receive a replacement Surface</h2>
                    <p>I have been working with Surface Support since December regarding my faulty Surface Pro 3. &nbsp;After working with technical support for a number of weeks Surface Support offered to replace my device. &nbsp;I was told I could NOT receive my replacement device until
 after my faulty Surface was received in Texas. &nbsp;I sent my Surface in January to Mcallen Texas. &nbsp;It was insured and tracked - I received confirmation from my carrier that it was delivered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It took weeks and many phone calls and Surface Support never confirmed receiving my faulty Surface; however 2 weeks ago I was told that my replacement device was in the mail. &nbsp;I was so relived and excited. &nbsp;I have been without my functioning Surface Pro
 3 for 3 months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today in the mail I received from Microsoft Surface Support in Mcallen Texas my non-functioning Surface Pro 3 and an empty shipping box to send the broken one back again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have NEVER had such poor customer service in my life. &nbsp;It has been more than 3 months and I am literally back where I started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I just want a full refund! &nbsp;Has anyone else had a similar experience or have advice for how I can get a full refund?</p>
<p />

            <p>I'm sorry you had to find out the hard way that Surface support is the worst in the industry. &nbsp;I fought to be refunded after four replacement devices and they wouldnt' &nbsp;the best I could get was to receive a new one from the store to sell as unopened but
 ultimately I couldn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the hardware is designed very poorly, especially the flagship model i7/512 &nbsp;**** i'm typing on it in here and it can't get into this web page without huge amount of lag on typing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a terrible machine but I'm afraid if you aren't willing to take a loss of 50% youre stuck with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for receiving a replacement - have you a store locally? they allocate replacements in those stores - but you have to ask to swap it locally. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also believe there's an advance replace option if you push for it but they put a very large hold on your credit card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft should be ashamed and it's very very clear the people running support at a management level arent doing their jobs remotely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best you can do is just keep going and going and going and asking for managers again and again and again. &nbsp;I'd also urge you to tweet your issues with a hashtag of #surfacePro so potential customers see the issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm gutted I spent over two grand on this flaming pile of garbage which clearly has huge design flaws. &nbsp;On top of that the non native language speaking support (in any country but india or phillipines) is poorly trained and behind an often difficult to understand
 accent. &nbsp;I'm an immigrant so don't take this as a slight, theyre doing gthe best they can, but the bottom line is highly technical support need to be native speakers of whatever language the customers speak. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole experience is literally the worst computer experience I've had in 25 years and I'll never again buy a piece of microsoft computing hardware.. I'd be hard pushed to buy another xbox..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft want to be apple, they don't realize good support is a major component to that as it massively refined engineering process.</p>

            <p>After months of dealing with a Surface Pro 3 that periodically would not start (each time taking it into the Geek Squad who said it was fine and rebooting it), I finally&nbsp;got the infamous DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE error message!</p>
<p>Much to my anger and dismay, I was told this means that the computer is done! toast! no longer works or repairable! AND, it curiously quit working 1 year and 7 days after I bought all the bells and whistles to the tune of $1,500! No, I did not get the extended
 warranty (made the gross assumption that it was just a scam for Best Buy to make free money).&nbsp;And, to make matters worse....it was only purchased because the Windows 10 upgrade lost all of my emails (never to be found again) and ruined my dependable ASUS&nbsp;and
 I stupidly, agreed to buy a&nbsp;Microsoft product!</p>
<p>I'm headed to Apple as soon as I sign off! Where the **** is Bill Gates??? We need him back. While the stockholders and techies are bringing home millions, we're spending thousands a year just to have a decent computer that works. Oh, and by the way, I noticed
 on the Surface Pro 3 box, MADE IN CHINA. This, folks, is why lots of Americans are rooting for Trump.... I'm disgusted by this whole experience!!!</p>

            <p>Well look. &nbsp;I'm is down on them as anyone but they're not engineering it to quit after a year if that happened it was completely coincidental. The issue with the surface largely is that the design is bad. the fundamental engineering you're doing behind the
 production of the machine is poor and they okayed it greenlight it and moved on without ever really testing it properly and that's quite apparent in the number of overheating and fan issues the machine has along with all the other niggling issues and failures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Where hey hey lost what little respect they had left is their "surface support team" and their unwillingness to step up and say ok. &nbsp;The machine design doesn't work for everyone. &nbsp;If you want to we will done buy back. &nbsp; The number of customersnwhomwouod
 have asked is quite low. Mum sure a ton of surface customers thinkers a fantastic machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>to me they pooped in their hand and sold it as gold. Then hired people who literally have never seen one. &nbsp;Don't speak English well. And run the "expert" team for fewer hours on their flagship machine than any other product&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is machine should be more than capable. &nbsp;The handwriting and sketching should be great. &nbsp;Windows should fly. To should be manageable to handle in tablet mode. But it's not. &nbsp;The iPad pro and a series of apps run rings around using a surface. &nbsp;Unless
 you literally only use it as a laptop. &nbsp;And even then with the engineering issues . Maybe there too</p>
<p>
</p><p>The failures here are engineering. Beta. &nbsp;And support. &nbsp;Most of not all of that falls from senior management and their obvious inability to do even the basic fundamentals of their job. If Microsoft ever hope to have the consumer mindshare someone like apple
 have they're going to need to fire most of their senior management. &nbsp;They've proven repeatedly to be completely useless.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>The surface is an extremely poorly designed hunk of overheating junk which was conceived by a copycat, engineered by incompetence , mostly supported by absolute dullards and hyped through the roof. &nbsp;I blame myself too for buying that Microsoft could build
 good hardware. &nbsp;It's never happened before and insupportable known. &nbsp;Lesson kewejrd though. &nbsp;None of my companies will ever buy Microsoft projects beyond a live 365 subscription again. Nir will I or my family. &nbsp; ,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest spot in the face is after four machine swaps and still holding idle temperatures of 125 degrees in the rear they won't just buy the bloody thing back. &nbsp;115F to hold is untenable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how these managers from middle to tip top can say they're running a department or company and not replicate user experience in the process. &nbsp;It's unbelievable. &nbsp;And a large cause of the issues. &nbsp;They don't think it's acceptable how hinge go.
 They don't have any idea how it goes to begin with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When was the last last time the head of surface project called surface support or checked the forums - maybe &nbsp;walked through a fake issue. When did the ceo or coo?My guess is never. &nbsp;It shows by the quality of the surface from design to support.&nbsp;<br />

 I'd call back or go to a Microsoft store if possible. &nbsp;A week last warranty most companies will honor the warranty within this sort of time frame.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
</p><p>1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>'What version of Windows have you upgraded to Windows 10 from?'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, that's an interesting question. &nbsp;I purchased &nbsp;the 'Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro' in the</p>
<p>Microsoft Store, so that I could upgrade from Windows 10 Home, which I have been using</p>
<p>for several months since the "free" upgrade from Win 7 to Windows 10 became available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After purchasing the "Upgrade" to Win 10 Pro in the "store", for $99 US, I received 2 emails, neither</p>
<p>of which explained what was going to happen after my purchase. &nbsp;Actually, nothing was</p>
<p>going to happen, or maybe Microsoft was going to push the upgrade remotely at some</p>
<p>future, unannounced, time of their choosing. &nbsp;As it was, when I returned to the "store"</p>
<p>some hours later, I noticed that the button that was previously labeled "Purchase Now",</p>
<p>under the 'Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro' paragraph had changed. &nbsp;The button</p>
<p>was now labeled "Start Upgrade". &nbsp; &nbsp;When I clicked it, the upgrade was indeed</p>
<p>pushed to my pc, which now reports its OE to be "Windows 10 Pro".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the interim, I wasted a bunch of time, dealing with some kind of Microsoft</p>
<p>"help agent" getting nonsensical answers to my rather simple, and certainly</p>
<p>straight forward, questions about how an upgrade from 10 Home to 10 Pro</p>
<p>was supposed to occur. &nbsp; Then I made the further mistake of clicking on the&nbsp;</p>
<p>"contact us" link, which allowed me to schedule a call back which would require</p>
<p>about 10 hours response time. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, now after wasting hours with all of this cloud inspired automation foolishness,</p>
<p>which no doubt MS thinks is indispensible and the wave of the future, I have the
</p>
<p>upgrade I paid for. &nbsp;(but no clear recovery or cold re-install capability, which</p>
<p>I certainly should have after spending 99 dollars.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I don't have? &nbsp;A product key, should Windows 10 Pro ever need to be</p>
<p>re-installed, nor any clear source of media, should Windows 10 Pro need to be</p>
<p>reinstalled, after, say, a disk failure? &nbsp; &nbsp;How is it that the Windows 10 Pro license
</p>
<p>was installed and activated on my pc? &nbsp;What if I had a disk failure and need</p>
<p>to do a cold re-install of Windows 10 Pro. &nbsp; What? &nbsp;My $99 fee does not</p>
<p>entitle me to be able to do this?? &nbsp; If I have to do a "disaster recovery" that will</p>
<p>just be my tough luck? &nbsp;And Microsoft will just charge me again as if I were</p>
<p>some newly minted Window's 10 user?? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, as I said a the beginning, I am FED UP with Microsoft wasting my time in this fashion. &nbsp; I feel sorry for the unsuspecting rep who is going to call me in the morning, &nbsp;but he, and his manager, are going to get an earful. &nbsp; After that, perhaps I'll proceed
 with lodging complaints with the Governor's office and the Attorney General's office in the state of Washington, along with those in my own state. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>What is your computer make and model? If not a branded computer what is your motherboard make and model?</span></span></p>
<p>Well, it happens to be an HP Pavilion dv6 model, not that I particularly care to have this information published to the "Microsoft Community" here. &nbsp; But, my delays and confusion with this confusing, and woefully incomplete upgrade process have nothing to
 do with the hardware in use here. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 Pro upgrade *has* occurred. &nbsp;But, in a completely UNSATISFATORY and I would say UNPROFESSIONAL manner. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next time I do an upgrade of the operating environment on this laptop, it will be to go straight to LINUX. &nbsp; I have truly had it with Microsoft's time wasting FOOLISHNESS. &nbsp;</p>

            If I understand it correctly you now have the Pro version installed, but never received the product key.&nbsp; If you want to get/see the product key for the installed Pro version there is a small utility called Produkey that you can run that will show you
 the key.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I can't remember where I found it, but I am sure if you Searched this board or Googled you could find it.&nbsp;

            <p>Dear Lexgreen,</p>
<p>Actually, it doesn't cost anything to upgrade from an activated version of Windows 7 or Windows 8 if you have upgraded to Windows 10 within the free upgrade period, i.e., before 26th July, 2016(unless I am mistaken). After that even if you downgrade or install
 another OS on that device, and you want to upgrade back to Windows 10 you don't have to pay, because the digital entitlement connected to your Microsoft Account will be linked to your device and the Windows 10 will definitely be activated. That's what happened
 in my case.</p>
<p>And I am not from Microsoft, but a 15 year old student.</p>
<p>Wishing you luck.</p>

    <title>Code 52 error for Imaging devices - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Code 52 error for Imaging devices</h2>
                    <p>Hi friends!<br />
I've got the error code 52 in device manager for all 3 imaging devices (an internal and an external web cameras and an HP scanner). I was using Windows 8.1 on my Toshiba Satellite laptop and upgraded to Windows 10 Home edition a few months ago. All the time
 the imaging devices worked normally and I seemingly some Windows update resulted in to code 52 (Windows cannot verify the digital signature for the drivers required for this device). Unfortunately returning to previous restore points did not help. I tried
 to remove the upper limit filter which I found in the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\Class\{6bdd1fc6-810f-11d0-bec7-08002be2092f}. As the result the yellow triangles and errors with code 52 disappeared and scanner could work,
 but both cameras still fail to work. So I restored the registry to the previous state. All the drivers are up to date.<br />
Can anybody help to restore the functionality of my cameras? Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Gasim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that the Imaging devices fails to work on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error <strong>'</strong><span><strong>Windows cannot verify the digital signature for the drivers required for this device'
</strong>might occur if any recent hardware or software change might have installed a file that is signed incorrectly or damaged, or that might be malicious software from an unknown source.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to install the drivers in <strong>Compatibility mode </strong>for the Imaging devices and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A compatibility mode is a software mechanism in which a software either emulates an older version of software in order to allow incompatible software or files to remain compatible with the computer's newer hardware or software. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. </strong>Go to your <strong>manufacturer’s website </strong>and download the
<strong>Driver’s setup </strong>file for your computer. <strong><br />
2.</strong> Press <strong>Windows Key + R </strong>on your desktop screen to go to run box.
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Type <strong>devmgmt.msc </strong>and hit Enter. <br />
<strong>4.</strong> Under Driver, expand, then right click on the Imaging devices and select
<strong>Uninstall</strong>. <br />
<strong>5. </strong>If you are prompted to Confirm then <strong>Confirm</strong>.
<br />
<strong>6.</strong> Go to the location where you had saved your downloaded setup files of the drivers and right click, then select
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Properties</strong>. <br />
<strong>7.</strong> Select <strong>Compatibility Tab</strong>. <br />
<strong>8.</strong> Place a check mark next to <strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode
</strong>and select the operating system </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<strong>Windows&nbsp;</strong><strong>8 or Windows 7</strong>) accordingly from the drop down list.
<br />
<strong>9.</strong> Let the driver to <strong>install</strong> and then check the functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</p>

<h3> christianvance  say:</h3>
<h2>            ERROR CODE 8015307F</h2>
                    <p>I get the Message "Sorry, there's a problem with the Xbox service. Try again later. For help with this problem, go to www.xbox.com/errorhelp." Status code: 8015307F</p>
<p>Also just yesterday and today my profile will ghost out every time I do an action and then ask me to sign back in. When trying to do so it states I have to sign in with my email and password, when I do attempt that it claims it is the wrong password though
 it is not. So I would sign out and sign back in using the home button hub. Also, my Xbox as of last week started to ding then shut off on its own without anyone touching it when I am in the middle of something.</p>
<p>How do I fix this?</p>

<p>Oh it's OK it's my fault too for assuming,&nbsp; anyway, if you're experiencing major issues. Reset your Xbox 360 to factory setting, This will delete everything on the Xbox 360, but it will not remove parental restrictions.</p>
<p>But BEFORE resetting you should <strong>back up anything you want to save,</strong>&nbsp; to do so:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Connect a USB hard drive to your Xbox 360</strong> so that it appears as a storage device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press the Guide button on your controller and <strong>select the "Settings" tab.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Choose "System Settings," select "Storage," and then select your Xbox 360 hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select "Transfer Content" and then select your external drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select what you want to transfer and then click "Start."</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have to wait a while for the transfer to complete</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>After you are done with that, do this:</p>
<p><strong>Go to "Settings" &gt; "System settings" &gt; "Console settings" &gt; "System info"
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Write down your "Console Serial Number."</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Next,&nbsp; you need to return to "system settings" and <strong>select the "storage" opinion.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Highlight your Xbox 360 hard drive and press the yellow "Y" button.</strong> This will open the Device Options menu for the hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now,&nbsp; <strong>Select "Format" from the Device Options menu.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Enter your serial number if prompted. You may be asked to enter your console serial number before you can begin the format. This is a safeguard to help prevent accidental formats.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Delete your user. </strong>After the format, you'll be taken back to the Home menu. You'll be logged out of Xbox Live, and all of your games will be gone. Go to Settings, System, Storage, then the location of your user, and delete it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;(Note: you can re-download it later)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Start the Initial Setup. </strong>Go to Settings, System, and press [Initial Setup.] Confirm your choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this solved your problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it did please mark it as helpful&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Updating Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 Error Code&#58; 0x8007001f</h2>
                    <p>I have reached the point where I give up. . . . Never since playing around with Windows 3.11 have I ever been so frustrated by something that should be so easy. . . .
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Toshiba Satellite P870.</p>
<p>It came with OEM windows 8 which I upgraded to windows pro.&nbsp; I tried upgrading to windows 8.1 about a month ago, it would download fine but during the next stage 'gathering information' each time it would fail giving the error code: 0x8007001f.&nbsp; After wasting
 the best part of a day trying to remedy the problem, clean boots, disconnecting all devices, disabling all anti-virus software etc, I gave it to our companies IT consultant who after wasting the best part of a day himself gave it away.&nbsp; I decided there was
 no point wasting anymore time on it as I rely heavily on my computer for work, so I&nbsp;waited till now, while I am on holidays, to give it another go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This morning I completed a complete system restore, back to the original 'out of the box' settings.&nbsp; I completed the upgrade to Pro, and have completed all windows updates and Toshiba updates.&nbsp; I have removed any unwanted software, I haven't so much as plugged
 a mouse or printer in, again completed a clean boot..........&nbsp; So the only thing on this computer is Window 8 Pro, the only thing attached to this computer is the powercord, there is nothing enabled in startup with all windows services disabled. . . . . and
 yet I am getting exactly the same result.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Toshiba there shouldn't be an issue, yet myself (I did complete 2 years of an IT degree before switching to Engineering) and our company's IT consultant have spent a total of 3 days trying to do get
 this update happening.&nbsp; We have trolled all the forums and tried all the suggestions, before I decided to strip this computer back to just windows and nothing else, and it still fails.&nbsp; Earlier I ran the Windows 8 to 8.1 upgrade assistant and it didn't find
 any driver that weren't compatible. . .&nbsp; I am at a complete loss.&nbsp; Even if this went well today I would still have another day re-installing my software and data.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there are any suggestions it would be greatly appreciated, I just don't see why it should be this difficult, I have never encountered something this baffling.&nbsp; Cheers.</p>

            <p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>I see that you have tried all the troubleshooting to try and install Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>The only thing we can try out now is check for updated chipset drivers and also update the BIOS before trying to install Windows 8.1.<br />

<p>I have reached the point where I give up. . . . Never since playing around with Windows 3.11 have I ever been so frustrated by something that should be so easy. . . .
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Toshiba Satellite P870.</p>
<p>It came with OEM windows 8 which I upgraded to windows pro.&nbsp; I tried upgrading to windows 8.1 about a month ago, it would download fine but during the next stage 'gathering information' each time it would fail giving the error code: 0x8007001f.&nbsp; After wasting
 the best part of a day trying to remedy the problem, clean boots, disconnecting all devices, disabling all anti-virus software etc, I gave it to our companies IT consultant who after wasting the best part of a day himself gave it away.&nbsp; I decided there was
 no point wasting anymore time on it as I rely heavily on my computer for work, so I&nbsp;waited till now, while I am on holidays, to give it another go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I completed a complete system restore, back to the original 'out of the box' settings.&nbsp; I completed the upgrade to Pro, and have completed all windows updates and Toshiba updates.&nbsp; I have removed any unwanted software, I haven't so much as plugged
 a mouse or printer in, again completed a clean boot..........&nbsp; So the only thing on this computer is Window 8 Pro, the only thing attached to this computer is the powercord, there is nothing enabled in startup with all windows services disabled. . . . . and
 yet I am getting exactly the same result.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Toshiba there shouldn't be an issue, yet myself (I did complete 2 years of an IT degree before switching to Engineering) and our company's IT consultant have spent a total of 3 days trying to do get
 this update happening.&nbsp; We have trolled all the forums and tried all the suggestions, before I decided to strip this computer back to just windows and nothing else, and it still fails.&nbsp; Earlier I ran the Windows 8 to 8.1 upgrade assistant and it didn't find
 any driver that weren't compatible. . .&nbsp; I am at a complete loss.&nbsp; Even if this went well today I would still have another day re-installing my software and data.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are any suggestions it would be greatly appreciated, I just don't see why it should be this difficult, I have never encountered something this baffling.&nbsp; Cheers.</p>

    <title>Cannot save user proporties of any administrator - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonaslundwall  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot save user proporties of any administrator</h2>
                    <p>I have made clean Windows 10 Pro installations several times during the last year, on different pc's.
</p>
<p>I would need to activate the setting "User cannot change password" in Local Users and Groups for the only existing user but the system wont let me. Why? The user belongs to the administrator group. The message I get is:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"The following error occured while attempting to save proporties for user XXXXX:</em></p>
<p><em>This operation is disallowed as it could result in an administration</em></p>
<p><em>account being disabled, deleted or unable to logon."</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
As a workaround I tried by activating the built-in administrator account and do the changes from there. But also this wasn't allowed. I also wasn't allowed to do the change to the built-in administrator from my local user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a bug in Windows 10? In Windows 7 it was perfectly alright to do this kind of change.</p>
<p>Thanks for you attention&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I realize that you are trying to change the user properties of an administrator account. Let me assist you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per the issue description, you are trying to activate
<strong>User cannot change password</strong> settings.</span></p>
<p><span>It is not possible to restrict, any settings that needs administrator privileges, for an administrator account. However, you can create a new
<strong>Standard Local Account (Without Administrator Privileges) </strong>and you can make changes to the newly created account from the administrator account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope the information helps. Kindly write back to us for further assistance on Windows. We will be glad to assist you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Thank you for the answer, Mohan BP</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately it's not practical for us to let the users be without &nbsp;administrator priviliges as this is needed for many of the programs he/she will need to run. The pc's are standalone pc's and there is really no need to protect the users environment except,
 of course, from malware. To deal with that, we use a very protective antivirus/internet security program. What we do need is to have a known user/password available so that our suppor guys remotely can log in to the same account as the user use. If the local
 user can change the password, we may not be able to support the user, if he/she has changed the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards<br />
Jonas<br />

            <p><span>Hi Jonas,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per the issue description, I suggest you to create a local account and set the
<strong>User cannot change password</strong> settings enabled.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once it is done, you can manage the privileges through Group Policy settings which can make several applications/features not to work. In other words, through Group Policy settings, you can enable
 or disable access to certain applications and features like Settings, Command Prompt, Run, and Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span>However, you can change the password of local user account (if needed) through the Administrator account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For further information on Group Policy settings, I suggest you to post your query in TechNet IT Pro forum and check if it helps.</span></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 3000 mail shortcut</h2>
                    I have&nbsp;Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 3000 with dedicated buttons on the top. I use Windows 8.1. I tried to assign mail button to mail app, but I can't find the command. I tried using command: "%windir%\explorer.exe ms-mail://", but it worked only sometimes.
 Does anyone have idea, how to assign it?

    <title>Input not supported&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sirmang  say:</h3>
<h2>            Input not supported&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I tried to upgrade to Windows 10 and as soon as it tries to boot up I get a floating box all over the screen that says "Input not supported."</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a while, my computer will go back and boot up into Windows 7 and everything will be fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is, how do I fix this issue to use Win10? &nbsp;Can I fix it? &nbsp;Is it a problem with the monitor? &nbsp;With my screen resolution? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I just not able to use Win10 at this time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>After installation of Windows 10 and two or three successful startups, I was confronted by the infamous black screen with the "Input not supported" floating around, seemingly sneering at me, about the time that the Windows Starting logo would normally appear.&nbsp;
 This condition, through repeated re- and cold starts, persisted, and no key or combination of keys or mouse clicks or keyboard tricks fazed it.&nbsp; It just kept on merrily floating around.&nbsp; Every bit of advice, every method of dealing with this problem found
 on the Microsoft site or with&nbsp;the usually helpful bloggers&nbsp;depended upon getting the stubborn thing booting up or using the F2 key and going into Advanced Options, which was impossible to achieve.&nbsp; The best I can say is, not waiting for the BSOD, I supplied
 all the blue Microsoft could ever wish for in the form of cursing a blue streak at my poor monitor, now liberally covered with my spittle from screaming in its general direction.&nbsp; I finally gave it up for a lost cause, dug the drive out and formatted it in
 a different computer and re-installed Windows 7.&nbsp; If things go as usual, I expect Ms will solve this little enigma just about the time the 'free' 10 giveaway expires.&nbsp; I hate computers.</p>

            I started having the same problems this weekend. I can send and receive messages, but calls keep trying to connect without ringing. I tried various solutions from other post (i.e.: quiet hours off, system and privacy setting all on, uninstalled/restarted
 pc/reinstalled).&nbsp;

<p>What you are experiencing is a known issue, wherein there is no notification when receiving a skype call. We are currently investigating on this. Rest assured a fix will be released soon. For the meantime, try resetting Skype for Windows 10 as a workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open the Start menu and click Settings.</li><li>Click Apps.</li><li>Locate and click Skype from the Applications list.</li><li>Click Advanced option.</li><li>Select Reset.​</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know of the result.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            I have worked on Skype for the last 3 hours with my sister - both off us online and using the telephone.&nbsp; We have not been able to connect.&nbsp; I think Microsoft wants people to pay so they are making it impossible to use the free version.&nbsp; We have tried
 all settings and everything that was suggested.&nbsp; Both of us have Microsoft edge and a new computer with Windows 10.&nbsp; No go.

<p><span>Thank you for using
<strong>Microsoft Answers </strong>Forums!</span></p>
<p><span>Is the issue only with Skype?
</span></p>
<p><span>Try these steps and check if it works:
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:
</span></strong><strong><span>Try to uninstall and reinstall the Sound drivers and check if it works.
</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</span></span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open Device Manager by clicking the
</span></span><span><span><strong>Start</strong></span></span><span><span> button, clicking
</span></span><span><span><strong>Control Panel</strong></span></span><span><span>, clicking
</span></span><span><span><strong>System and Maintenance</strong></span></span><span><span>, and then clicking
</span></span><span><span><strong>Device Manager</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>‌</span><span>
<span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In Device Manager, locate the device you want to uninstall/delete and then right-click<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>the device name and uninstall/delete it. </span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Now restart the system
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>And let Windows discover the device and install it automatically.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span>
<span><strong><span>We can try to update the Sound drivers to the most recent and check if it works.</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</span></span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open Device Manager by clicking the
</span></span><span><span><strong>Start</strong></span></span><span><span> button, clicking
</span></span><span><span><strong>Control Panel</strong></span></span><span><span>, clicking
</span></span><span><span><strong>System and Maintenance</strong></span></span><span><span>, and then clicking
</span></span><span><span><strong>Device Manager</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>‌</span><span>
<span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In Device Manager, locate the device you want to update, and then double-click the device name.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<span><strong>Driver</strong></span> tab, and then click <span><strong>Update Driver</strong></span> and follow the instructions.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span>Step 3:
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try to Uninstall and then Reinstall Skype.

<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click

 even connecting the printer directly to the laptop and the laptop does not even show a usb connection. &nbsp;I have completely rebooted (with the Help of HP Support) the brand new laptop operating system to factory settings and am still exp experiencing the same
 problems....... What do I do??
