    <title>MS Access 2010 Pass Through Query without prompt to data source - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> suezimmerman  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Access 2010 Pass Through Query without prompt to data source</h2>
                    <p>I have an SQL database with an MS Access front end.&nbsp; My goal is performance optimization.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my research I discovered pass-through queries in Access.&nbsp; Currently all my tables are DNS&nbsp;connected with code in a module&nbsp;- my connection string for my tables is something like:&nbsp;</p>
<p>ODBC;DRIVER=sql server;Server=<em>servername</em>;APP=Microsoft Office 2010;DATABASE=<em>databasename</em>;Trusted_Connection=Yes;TABLE=dbo.table</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I attempt to execute the pass-through query, I'm prompted to select a data source.&nbsp; Is there a way to avoid this (the end user actually has an exe file on their computer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should&nbsp;my queries be views on the server instead of using queries in Access?</p>
<p>Are all pass through queries non-updatable?</p>
<p />

<p>In Access, query, SQL view I edited&nbsp;the properties,&nbsp;ODBC Connected Str - to include my connection and it works now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several reports that have the record source as a&nbsp;query with sub queries&nbsp;in them and are filtering/grouping data, etc.&nbsp; Would you have advice on views vs. pass-through queries in Access?&nbsp; Which is a better/speedier way?</p>

            Re your performance question: that is impossible to answer for us, not knowing anything about your db and overall scenario. I would GUESS that passthrough is better performing. Try it both ways!

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I see&#47;change location for weather in Outlook 2016 calendar</h2>
                    <p>I can only see a single temperature displayed with no option to change location or see an extended forecast.</p>
<p>It's clearly not the correct temperature (it's winter here, but it's displaying summer temperatures, presumably somewhere in the US).</p>
<p>Office 2016 Professional, as part of O365. &nbsp;I can change b/w fahrenheit and celsius but that's it. Changing the timezone makes no difference. All the questions I found posted online showed pictures of a bar where you can select a location, but I see no such
 drop-down.</p>

    <title>How do I save an audio file sent via skype to my computer&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mdkirby  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I save an audio file sent via skype to my computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I run a company that works with a lot of voice actors, and I have previously used skype to communicate with them, and to send files back and forth, which some times then need using in software on my computer or sending to other people, such as to our audio
 engineer for post production. This used to work fine, but since the latest skype update I cannot at all work out how to save a file, or view any location to which it has been downloaded. It seems to be only playable and accessible inside the chat, which is
 completely useless to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only options when right clicking the file are 'forward' (which only lets me send the same file to other skype users), 'Select message' which does the same, but also lets me delete the message, 'unread from here', or 'report'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched around and have struggled to find a clear answer to this, but one post I read suggested that the feature to do so has been removed. Can someone confirm if this is the case so I can start switching everything over to an alternative platform
 such as Slack, as it would mean Skype is no longer suitable for my work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>

    <title>How do I print only an envelope&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I print only an envelope&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wondering if you can trouble shoot this one! I tried to print out an envelope (Word/Office for Mac) on my printer; I've printed fine when the envelope was part of a document but this time I created *only* an envelope; for some reason a blank page printed-no
 envelope. The settings I used in "printer" settings were as above (my presets) but I did choose "envelope" in "Tools". Is there something else I should be doing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.....</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>A few questions/thoughts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using Tools-&gt;Envelopes... ?<br />
<br />
If so, when you click Print..., Word should create an envelope-sized document, then display the print dialog in front of it. This can vary between OSX versions , but assuming you see the same dialog as I see on Mavericks...<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a look at the preview. If you check "Show Quick Preview," do you see any text on the preview?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you cancel the print dialog, can you see text on the envelope?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is text on the envelope, but not in the preview, you should at least ensure that Word-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Print-&gt;"Drawing objects" is checked - the address and return address are inserted using text boxes which will not print if this is unchecked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you cannot see any text on the envelope, it is possible (though unlikely) that you have chosen text box positions that mean the text is not actually within the boundaries of the page.</p>
<p><br />
Other things I would do as troubleshooting steps include<br />
&nbsp;a. verify the font isn't white</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. print/save as PDF and see what appears on the PDF<br />
&nbsp;c. in the Print dialog, check through the various options (here, they are on the dropdown under "Presets" and have names like "Copies and Pages", "Microsoft Word", "Layout" etc., looking for settings that may cause problems. For example, printing only even
 numbered-pages in the Microsoft Word settings causes blank output here, when arguably there should be no output.&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
<li>Open word create the address in the document.</li><li>Now select the entire entire address.</li><li>Next go to tools menu and to Envelopes</li><li>when window open click Page setup</li><li>Choose desired Envelop and set orientation of envelope as needed.

*If not then you need to set orientation and lay face up or face down according to your printer specifications. You will need to do this each time you change to different envelop styles. But if you settle on one envelope style and stay there you don't have

            <p>Hi Peter and Phil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a million for your replies but for the moment I've decided to use my old Windows Vista PC at work and use my Mac at home (no printer there:). I will however have a go and see if your recommenations work (Peter: I'm quite sure the font colour wasn't
 white but that's a great observation:); I'll experiment&nbsp;when I have a spare week-end day to come in to work and just play around with the printer and Mac; I just wanted to say thanks for the responses. I've given up on some things with my Mac-they just seem
 too complcated and not so user-friendly as compared to my Windows Vista.</p>

<p>
For about a year now, I have been receiving tons of JUNK mails from various gmail accounts to my hotmail inbox. &nbsp;This is particularly frustrating because the emails are not originating from the same exact email. &nbsp;But the vast majority if from Gmail. &nbsp;I change
 my password every 70 days or so.</p>
<p>
I need to understand how Gmail can allow such a creation of email accounts to be used to send SPAM emails. &nbsp;I always block these emails but they keep coming in various names with the similar SUBJECT title. &nbsp;How do I stop these emails from getting to my inbox?
 &nbsp;Sometimes, the language used is similar to Japanese.</p>

<p>Hi Rageshk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand the situation, I'd like to confirm the following things:</p>
<p>1. Did you create some specific permission level or configure some settings to SharePoint sites before encountering this issue?</p>
<p>2. Check if the issue is related to a specific library, site or site collection.
</p>
<p>3. You mentioned the format xlsx and pptx. Do other file types have the same issue? Especially for other Excel and PowerPoint file types.
</p>
<p>4. Is the issue related to specific user or all users in your tenant?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

    <title>Formula to count number of cells containing an entry - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephenleckie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Formula to count number of cells containing an entry</h2>
                    How do I get a formula that counts the number of entries in a column, for example if the column is 50 rows deep but only 20 contain peoples names and the other 30 cells are blank, I want the cell at the bottom of the column to record 20 as the total number
 of peoples names in that column.

            It depends on your definition of harm. One user recently had each upgrade render his Windows partition as RAW or unformatted, meaning everything on it was gone. He could do a clean install, but an OS upgrade essentially unformatted his C: drive. Sometimes
 there are issues that are unique to certain computer models or BIOS versions on that model.

<p>Sometimes there can be activation issues, but Microsoft registers each computer's Hardware ID as licensed (or not) for a particular Edition of Windows 10. So if you install Pro Edition and you are only licensed for Home Edition, it will not activate. Normally
 it does not matter if it is an Insider build or a public build, as long as you install the Edition that your device has a license for.</p>

<p>Alright, also I noticed under my account (which is the administrator account) it does not have a Windows Credential... Is that cause for concern? Because I just got it activated and nothing seems wrong.</p>

<p>With build 16299.19 you can exit the Insider Program and it will act like a usual Windows install. You need to be logged into Windows using a Microsoft Account if you want more insider builds. You can check in Settings - Accounts to see if you are using
 your MSA login or not, or to switch to using it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using a Microsoft Account login links the device's Digital License for Windows 10 to your Microsoft Account. That can be useful if you ever need a new motherboard and lose Windows activation because the hardware has changed so much.</p>

<p>@Don Culbert has given you sound advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To your basic question, for sure, W10 can render your PC non-functional.&nbsp; However, never saw a W10 that I could not bring back to life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your PC consists of 2 main parts - the hardware and the software.&nbsp; The PC can be treated like it never saw an Operating system in the first place.&nbsp; Just never saw it reported that W10 fried the hardware.&nbsp; If a PC dies running W10, what does that prove.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Insiders is meant for folk that like to test beta software and are expected to have some knowledge to find, get around&nbsp; and recover from a serious bug.&nbsp; Insiders offers no real rewards other than testing beta software and perhaps giving feedback to have
 a better product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Don has stated, we will be at a jumping off point tomorrow to leave Insiders and get back to Public Build without re-installing Public Build.&nbsp; For the faint at heart, tomorrow will be good for some folk while the rest&nbsp; will be back looking forward to
 letting the games continue.</p>

<h3> itsyoucef  say:</h3>
<h2>            Exporting a powerpoint video, stuttering between slides</h2>
                    <p>I have a presentation I am exporting as a mp4 file. The export goes on fine, but the finished video is stuttering between the slides.<br />
The stuttering is experienced as it transitions to the next slide, but with a 0.5/1s stutter where you see the previous slide, before it finally moves to the slide it is suppose to. With the next transition, same stutter.<br />
I thought it was my presentation causing this, so I made a new one just for testing - same issue.<br />
Also tested a presentation I created and exported just fine on another computer, but it causes the same stutter when exporting on this computer.<br />
<br />
What I have next to check to determine problems with my PP, is to export this presentation on another computer (but the odds tells me it will) :p</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did an repair, which didn't fix it, and an reinstall of Office 2016 without success. I am running Win10</p>
<p>Any ideas on how I can fix this?<br />
</p>

            Hi itsYoucef,
<br />
<br />The issue could be related with the Graphic Card or Video Card.
<br />
<br />Please update the driver directly from the manufacturer.
<br />
<br />If it is not resolved, I suggest you to install a new Graphic Card  on your desktop computer.
<br />
<br />For a Laptop, be sure the drivers are updated to date.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
<br />Angel.

<p>You can download it from that link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think this is the way I'd do it - of course making it look a bit nicer.&nbsp; The key being that you'd set up the "cart" so that the recipient can choose various items on it in one column and the rest of the information for it is provided automatically other
 than the quantity, which they simply type in.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can even really hide the catalog sheet itself so that it doesn't even show up in the list of available sheets to be unhidden.&nbsp; You have to do that in the VBA editor, but it's easy to do.&nbsp; If you decide to do something like that and want to really hide
 the catalog list sheet, then let us know and someone will talk you through how to "Make a Sheet VeryHidden".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could get really fancy with it and have color/size/material options if necessary although making those lists appropriate to the main selection is a bit of a trick.&nbsp; But Debra Dalgleish has some good instructions on how to create dependent lists on her
 contextures.com website.&nbsp; Again, we could help with that as separate questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of these things would work better/easier (for me at least) if we could have macros (VBA code) in the workbook also, but some of your recipients might not know how to enable them to run, or might be wary of a workbook with macros in it from a security
 standpoint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I think if you're going to try to do something where a person browses through several other worksheets and picks and chooses items to put into their cart, then you're almost going to be forced to include macros as part of the package.

            I am not sure what caused this problem. For me it only affected my outlook tab on my favorites. This was a simple fix for me... open a new browser and type https://mail.live.com and a new outlook sign-in will come up. You will have to sign in manually
 with your account username and password. After accessing my account, I deleted the old mail tab from my favorites and dragged and dropped my newly signed-in address to my favorites bar. Voila!

                    How do I limit text in a text box to 300 characters. &nbsp;It seemed you could do it in Word 2010 but not 2013? &nbsp;Seems strange any advice is appreciated.

            With a legacy form field, it is necessary to protect the document for forms. The limit is then certainly applied in Word 2010 and 2013. You have not done that or you wouldn't be able to write next to or over the field - only in it.

            As Graham said, you have to enforce "Filling in forms" protection. On the Developer tab, click Restrict Editing. Under "2. Editing restrictions," select "Filling in forms." When your form is complete, click the Yes, Start Enforcing Protection button (you
 may provide a password, if you wish).

<h2>            Possible scam</h2>
                    <p>Hi, yesterday I was sending an email to a relative I have emailed for years. Kept getting a delivery failure notice from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.
</p>
<p>Usually delivery failure notices come from a different address for hotmail, but I didn't question it.
</p>
<p>Message Pasted below:</p>
<p>

When Office 365 tried to send the message to the next email server outside of Office 365 the external email server returned the error below. This indicates the recipient's email server (or their email filtering service) suspected the sender's message is spam.
 If the sender isn't able to fix the problem by modifying their message then contact the recipient's email admin and ask them to add your domain name, or the sender's email address, to their list of allowed senders.</p>
<p>While the sender may be able to alter the message contents to fix this, it's likely that only the recipient's email admin can fix this problem. Unfortunately, Office 365 support is unlikely to be able to help fix these kinds of externally reported errors.</p>

</p><p>I clicked on the link and tried to change and resend my mail about 8 times - it didn't seem to have anything in it that could be seen as spam. Kept getting the same bounceback. So I looked further, others had been getting bounces from BT servers, cpcloud.co.uk
 was linked with spam, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** was not an official name - loads of stuff to look through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed my password on my email account and after that, my mail got through. SO I am worried I was hacked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is - is *** Email address is removed for privacy *** official?</p>
<p>If not, by clicking on the link - Emailing best practices for senders - have I compromised my computer?</p>

<p>Hi AdilFaleh,</p>
<p>There is no specific value to add. Based on my experience, the root cause is probably related to the uniqueness. No matter which attribute you choose as the source anchor, it must be unique. Since you are running a multi-forest environment, there may be
 some duplication. Please check and make sure that every user has a different value for the extensionAttribute1 attribute.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can also check the Event Viewer logs to see which error message is given when the synchronization fails.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Allen</p>

<p>Thanks for the info, I suggested that Windows 10 include playback capability for .wtv files at the link you provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Microsoft is irresponsible in not including this functionality in Windows 10. After all, I was encouraged to create these files in a proprietary Microsoft format, not&nbsp;knowing that Microsoft would abandon its own&nbsp;format. I have invested considerable
 amounts of&nbsp;my time&nbsp;in creating and storing these files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did Microsoft abandon Word or Excel users when these programs were updated? No, it provided built-in conversion capability for files in the old format [e.g. doc
<span>→ docx]</span>. I don't see why it can't do the same for wtv. files.</p>

<p>Since WMC is not going to be supported going forward you should check out XBMC/KODI (kodi.tv), a vastly superior (to WMC) free app or my favorite J. River Media Center.&nbsp; I use KODI mostly for my TV, HTPC&nbsp;and Video needs and JRMC (a paid solution) as a front
 end for my music collection/audiophile systems.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure both will recognize and play .wtv files, and I haven't heard of&nbsp;either of these apps causing any reliability&nbsp;or stability problems.&nbsp; I use them daily.&nbsp; I&nbsp;originally looked at them&nbsp;because MS
 didn't&nbsp;bundle DVD capabilities with W8/8.1.&nbsp; I bought the WMC upgrade for W8/8.1 but don't use it anymore.&nbsp; It was just as buggy (if not more) and not nearly as capable as either of these&nbsp;options.&nbsp;

</p><p>VLC is fine. &nbsp;I also use it but the .wtv codec creates obscenely large files. &nbsp;Since I'm not creating .wtv files going forward, I've used MCEBuddy to convert all my legacy .wtv files to .mp4. &nbsp;In addition to doing a decent job of stripping out the commercials,

"Open" means&nbsp;"play".&nbsp; &nbsp;I know from long personal experience.&nbsp; J. River Media Center is a paid solution but they have a trial period.&nbsp; It's now at Version 20 and I've used it since Version 16 which I believe goes back to 2005 or so..&nbsp; It always played .wtv files.&nbsp;
 I like it because I'm an audiophile and want bit perfect music playback that bypasses the Windows Mixer.&nbsp; The video capabilities were a bonus. &nbsp; KODI is open source (free) and the latest version features audio playback that is just as good as JRMC.&nbsp; If .wtv
 video is the deal maker/breaker then you're all set with VLC.

<p>NEXTpvr will give you TV viewing and recording functionality provided you have drivers for your TV tuner card. &nbsp;It also works inside of KODI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Converting .wtv files to anything else is a time and CPU/GPU intensive process, depending especially on the playback quality settings. &nbsp;I despise iTunes but i believe it will play .mp4 files. &nbsp;My preference for transcoding is MCEBuddy because it can be set
 yield high quality conversions while doing an adequate job of stripping out commercials.</p>

</p><p>There are undoubtedly other choices but i know these work.</p>

            <p>I should also add that you will need a source for updated TV schedule information. &nbsp;The source bundled with WMC is top notch but . . . &nbsp; I think there is a source bundled with JRMC bit i haven't tried it in a while. &nbsp;I much prefer KODI as a tv front end
 and i use schedules direct for show schedule info.</p>

<p>Hi Kenneth</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not allowing Skype to see all my contacts, at present trying to do a video call with a business in Belgium, which has tried to call me, and presumably would have accepted a contact request since they know, by email, that I am trying to reach them. &nbsp;The
 Skype for Web page says 'status unknown' for me and for the business. &nbsp;It shows about 20 missed calls, and about 20 messages saying 'contact request sent' with a link for 'resend contact request', also 20x. &nbsp;I am starting to think this application has gotten
 way more bloated and buggy than it was a few years ago when I last used it, when it just worked. &nbsp;I guess I will try FaceTime or Whats App. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Walter</p>

    <title>Combine Word docs WITHOUT doing a compare in Word 2010&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Combine Word docs WITHOUT doing a compare in Word 2010&#63;</h2>
                    I need to be able to combine Word documents <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
without</span> doing a compare.&nbsp; They are totally different documents that need to be combined into one.&nbsp; They have similar headings which need to be kept intact, but Word 2010&nbsp;keeps "merging" them.&nbsp; The result is an ugly document that looks nothing like a
 simple joining of the two - one after the other.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; My current "only" option that I'm aware of is to convert them to PDFs, combine them using Acrobat Pro, then convert them back to Word.&nbsp; Not liking that option - I'd rather do it within word
 AND without having to do a total copy/paste of a document.&nbsp; Thanks for any help anyone can provide!
