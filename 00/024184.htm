<h2>            Users are unable to turn off &#8220;Out of Office Assistant&#8221; through Outlook 2010</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We recently upgraded our Exchange and Office environment to 2010 and now users are complaining out of office replies are still being sent out. I've verified the settings are disabled and still the messages go out. I've also tried to disable the OOF attendant
 from OWA, but I'm not seeing any change.</p>
<p>Does anyone know what is going on here?</p>
<p>Thanks.<br />

    <title>Not receiving emails to shared email addresses - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not receiving emails to shared email addresses</h2>
                    
<p>I have set up several email aliases under the shared mailbox feature and haven't had any error messages, so assume these have been done correctly. However, I have sent several test emails and they are not coming through.</p>
<p>The email addresses are *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and *** Email address is removed for privacy *** - which should then be forwarded to certain recipients who have a mailbox license through O365.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Thanks for the replies. I have sorted this out by calling the telephone support team.</p>
<p>The issue was to do with my Outlook client not being configured correctly and therefore I couldn't activate the delegated mailboxes.</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player will not play .WMV from link in IE11</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click on a link to a .WMV file in IE11, Windows Media Player opens and gives me the following error:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3ac6bef-46c1-4923-8531-f09a24dd7b49" /></p>
<p>Web Help link is:</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/c00d1199</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I right click the link and "Save target as..." and open from my desktop, it plays fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on the link in Firefox, the "You have chosen to open:" dialogue displays, and the video plays fine if I select "Open with: Windows Media Player (default)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on the link in Chrome, the file downloads, and then plays fine from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Link properties:</p>
<p>Protocol:&nbsp;HyperText Transfer Protocol with Privacy</p>
<p>Type:&nbsp;Windows Media Audio/Video file</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've tried:</p>
<p>Installing codecs</p>
<p>Resetting IE11 to default</p>
<p>Resetting file associations</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question:</p>
<p>Is this an IE11 issue? Can it be fixed? Is there a plug-in, add-on, or similar workaround?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi,<br />
You should either re-install your current Windows media player or upgrade to the latest version. For some reason your file type association with your operation system was lost and re-installing the software should take care of it or alternatively, you may try
 to disable Windows Media Player and re-enable it again.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>How To Disable Windows Media Player:</div>
<div>1. Click the "Start" button, then click "Control Panel."</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. Click the "Add/Remove Programs" icon on the "Control Panel" page. Click the "Add/Remove Windows Components" icon in the shaded column on the left of the "Add/Remove Programs" page.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3. Use the scroll bar inside the box to find the Windows Media Player listing. Click the check box next to the listing to remove the check mark inside it. Click the "Next" button to initialize deactivation. A progress bar will show the process, and the
 dialog box will change appearance when it's completed. Click the "Finish" button to finalize the action.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If that doesn't work perhaps the network admins&nbsp;recently implemented a policy in your network where streaming is disabled which would explain why you can download the video and play it locally but not stream it.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            Hi Tammie
<br />
<br />I think your professor has put a link to a document up on Google drive into an Email - are you able to open that Email, if so just click the link in the Email to go to Google Drive and collaborate on that document
<br />
<br />If you need to create an Outlook Account, go to <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/inbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/inbox</a> then create an Email Account with your Microsoft Account Login details (if you have one)

            What do you mean by "deleted"? Deleted from the phone? You have to contact Nokia directly for that.<br />

If you used the "terminate" option, you can no longer retrieve the account.

<p>Hi, this is all guessing, but is it the wallpaper that was initially made for the Nokia N9? I think the wallpaper/artwork is called "tado". Here's a google search:&nbsp;<a href="http://jollan9story.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/tado.png?w=640" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Tado

                    Does anyone have any idea why using shift+l doesn't work in MS Word for Mac? &nbsp;Please note that I can type L here and in every other application installed on my Mac except for when I'm in MS Word. &nbsp;It doesn't work if the using CAPS LOCK or SHIFT+l. &nbsp;I can
 type a lower case l without issue and spell check will convert it so I know it's not a font issue. &nbsp;Since L works in other apps it's not a keyboard issue. &nbsp;I've downloaded the all the updates but still no success. &nbsp;Please, if you have any idea's for me to
 try please share them.

            Well, I'm about out of <i>stuff</i> :-) Based on what has been done it's looking like the problem is somehow related to your User Account:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Neither Word nor OS X will permit assigning Shift+L as a custom keyboard shortcut</li><li>The stroke works in a different Account, so it isn't system-wide or hardware related</li><li>The only aspects of Word that could be at fault are the Normal.dotm &amp; the preferences file -- both of which have been replaced</li><li>Shift-launching Word apparently bypasses the outside influence<br />
</li></ul>
<br />
Do you have any 3rd party utilities installed? Especially those that influence keyboard operation?<br />
<br />
Can you tell if <i>anything</i> happens when you type the keystroke?<br />
<br />
Does Shift+L work in other Office apps?<br />
<br />
Now that you have done what you have, see if repairing disk permissions &amp; restarting again have any effect.<br />
<br />
Also, hold Shift while you Log In, then launch Word normally &amp; see if you still have the problem.<br />

    <title>How to add second postal address to mailbox-account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> office365admin4214  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to add second postal address to mailbox-account</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
my mailbox users in the azure AD mostly have a oficial office address and a secondary home office address that I'd like to ad as the private address in the contact details. When I look into the created accounts with powershell commands
</p>
<p>Get-MsolUser -All | fl *</p>
<p>or </p>
<p>Get-Mailbox | fl *</p>
<p>I can only find a single street/zip/city/country field.</p>
<p>Creating a second entry (new-MailContact) in the directory with the second address is not an option as this contact then will show up as separeate contact in the global address list.</p>
<p>Any useful advice is highly appreciated.</p>

<p>Regards, Andreas Bosch</p>

<p>Hi Andreas,</p>
<p>I would like to confirm what Office 365 plan you are using at the moment.</p>
<p>If it is the pure Azure AD environment and no Office 365 environment, I suggest you post the question in our
<a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/azure/en-US/home?forum=WindowsAzureAD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Azure AD Forum</a> for professional assistance as our forum focuses on Office 365 online services.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>If you have a local AD and the mailboxes are synced through DirSync to Office 365, it is feasible to add a second postal address to the mailbox as there is only one postal address entry in Office 365.</p>
<p>I understand it would be nice if we can set a secondary postal address for the users in Office 365. Therefore, I suggest you submit feedback about the features via the link below:</p>

<p>Many features have been designed or upgraded based on our customers’ constructive comments.</p>
<p>Your understanding is much appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>I'm using Office365. The whole environment is in the cloud, nothing local, no syncs.</p>
<p>It's not important for me, that I can add the postal address in the Administrator portal. For me it would be also OK, to add it via powershell to the mailbox and get it available in contacts app and sharepoint lists e.g.</p>

<p>hi andreas,</p>
<p>thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>it is the situation with a pure office 365 environment that there is only one postal address entry.</p>
<p>given this situation, i suggest you <a href="http://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273493-office-365-admin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
submit feedback</a> about the features.</p>
<p>many features have been designed or upgraded based on our customers’ constructive comments.</p>
<p>thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>as a work around, you may consider adding the second postal address as notes to the office 365 users. here are the steps:</p>
<p>1. sign in to exchange admin center (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/ecp</a>) with your admin account, navigate to
<b>recipients</b>—<b>mailboxes</b>.</p>
<p>2. double click the mailbox, click <b>contact information</b> and <b>more options</b>, add the address under
<b>notes</b>, click <b>save</b> at last.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=c01e3393-c0ec-4d3b-9172-092dbc3d8d2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dc01e3393-c0ec-4d3b-9172-092dbc3d8d2e" /></a></p>

<p>What are trying to install from? As you are not giving any details very difficult to offer much help. Why are you copying files over, you may not be getting them all as some are hidden.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As suggested above, download the Media Creation Tool and either create a bootable flash card (8Gig) or just download the ISO image. You should just be able to mount the image file if you are already on win10 and then run setup.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can get the Media Creation Tool here:</p>

<p>Hi Paul，</p>
<p>Based on your description, I understand that you want to create a shared calendar to which all users in the domain get access with the Outlook client, OWA and mobile devices. If yes, I suggest you create a shared mailbox to achieve it. Below is an article
 about the steps.<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj150570(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj150570(v=exchg.150).aspx</a></p>
<p>Users with the Full Access permission can see and modify the calendar of the shared mailbox. Other users can see and add it to their own calendars once it is shared with them.</p>
<p>To share calendars, please refer to:<br />
<a href="http://help.outlook.com/en-us/140/ms.exch.owap.sharing.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://help.outlook.com/en-us/140/ms.exch.owap.sharing.aspx</a></p>
<p>If you want to see a shared calendar from the mobile device, you need to add a shared mailbox in Outlook Web App (OWA) first. Note that the shared mailbox is accessible in mobile devices only via OWA for iOS or OWA for Android. For more detailed information,
 see:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-sg/article/OWA-for-iPad-and-OWA-for-iPhone-7edbf8c6-1a0e-4be8-a374-2809e754eaaf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OWA for iPad and OWA for iPhone</a><br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/OWA-for-Android-B7EED4E7-BF5A-4B7E-9C76-74AADDA44FD5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OWA for Android</a></p>
<p>Note: Since OWA for Android is the pre-release version now, it is not supported in our forum. Your understanding is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>If I misunderstood anything or you need any further assistance when creating a shared mailbox, please feel free to contact us.</p>
<p>Thanks, <br />
Chris</p>

                    I check my net connection by loading another tab &amp; webpage, all working fine, all up to speed. Sometimes Outlook admits it has lost connection, at other times a series of tiny white dots at the top of the screen warn me that it's trying to connect...&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<span>It is possible that it might be your browser that is causing the issue.</span><span>
 Does the issue happen when using a different browser? To make sure that the browser is not causing the issue, please&nbsp;click&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/optimize-internet-explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>here</span></a></span><span>
 for detailed steps on how to optimize your browser. Please make sure that the browser you are using is up to date. To download the latest version of your browser. You can refer to this
</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/supported-browsers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>link</span></a></span><span>.<br />
</span><span><br />
As a workaround try to turn on HTTPS settings by following the steps below:
<br />
</span><span><br />
</span><span>1. Sign in through this link:
</span><span><a href="https://account.live.com/ManageSSL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://account.live.com/ManageSSL</span></a></span><u><span><br />
</span></u><span>2. Choose Use HTTPS automatically (please see the note above)<br />
3. Click on Save.<br />
<br />
Or<br />
<br />
Change the URL in the address bar of your browser to </span><span><span><u><span>https://</span></u></span></span><span>.
 They just need to add the ‘s’ onto the http and leave the rest of the URL as is. Press Enter to follow the updated URL.<br />
<br />
Note: If you're Outlook.com HTTPS is already turned on by default so you don’t need to turn this feature on.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</span><span><br />
</span><span><br />

            Sorry for the delay in replying but I wanted to wait for results... or for the definite lack of them. I tried all the above to no avail, and thought it's my lousy home broadband; but that whole "please wait while Outlook.com comes to its senses" carry-on
 (server 'issues' &amp;co) still happens here at work. It never happens to any other web page. Go figure, as they say.

            <p>Hi JulianZinovieff,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that you have already tried accessing your account using a different computer and the issue still persists. How about when you access
 your account using a different browser? Does the issue still persist? If yes, we would need your permission to access the account and a screenshot of the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more details, you can refer to the private message that I've provided. Please make sure that you're signed in to this forum to view the link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: You need to click the notification that states “You have a private reply to this message. Click here to read it on our secure

            <p>The browser I tend to use at home is Opera, and the one at work is Explorer 8, so I do use different browsers.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Maybe there are a mix of issues - at home my connection can feel very sluggish, which is why I'm plugged in rather than on wifi at the moment; and at work too, at times - contention, pc health etc.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>By all means access the account and get a screenshot of the issue... though of course now, as I write, everything is running smoothly...</p>

<p>Hope this helps</p>

            <p>Hello JulianZinovieff,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have mentioned that you are using Opera as your web browser when accessing your account, I would suggest that you visit the article below for a better browsing experience using the new Outlook.com interface.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After doing so, try accessing your account again to check if the issue persist or everything is working fine on your account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know about the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            I have tried everything - browsers, computers, internet connections - and I have to say nothing makes any difference and by now this is becoming disturbing. Logging on is difficult; then trying to view any folder or email is as difficult. Writing this
 reply/report has been delayed because of it. I'm having to think about another solution - reluctantly, as&nbsp;I rated hotmail until now, and above all because so many mails are deposited there. Of course MS would not dream of providing the tools to extract them
 painlessly as plain ASCII because the commercial, internet principle of any business is to hold consumers' data hostage, but as the need to communicate can be greater than the need to recall.....

<h2>            What happens when Microsoft repair loses your phone&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have (had) a L930(UK Variant)&nbsp;which I returned for servicing while still in warranty.<br />
<br />
I sent it to the repair centre in Hungary from the UK using the shipping label provided and despite the UPS website showing me a receipt of delivery last week. &nbsp;MS are stating that they&nbsp;have not received&nbsp;my phone. Any idea what happens when they lose a customer's
 device?<br />
<br />
Does it get replaced&nbsp; with a similar spec phone or do I&nbsp;get shafted and only offered a mid range device? and shop elsewhere for my next phone. Support say they would get back to me within 4 days&nbsp; but apart from escalating&nbsp; the case I've heard nothing other
 than a generic email stating as the device has not been received they have cancelled the repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried speaking with support but am being fobbed off with "I don't&nbsp;know" from everyone I've spoken to.&nbsp;I&nbsp;was wondering if anyone knows the procedure while I am waiting for the official response from MS.<br />

</p><p>In the UK <a href="http://www.royalmail.com/business/services/sending/parcels-uk/next-day-delivery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Special Delivery</a>&nbsp;so IF lost during transit i.e. in this case Royal Mail could not provide confirmation you would claim against Royal Mail</p>
<p>
</p><p>This afai Can Tell is NOT&nbsp; case of he said, they said nay,&nbsp;&nbsp; UPS using similar guidlines&nbsp;&nbsp;would have obtained a&nbsp; signature from&nbsp; NOT a stranger on the street but an authorised representative.</p>
<p>In essence you cannot claim against UPS as they have confirmation of delivery</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is imo temporarily lost at&nbsp; worst permanently loss, so instead of dealing with tis matter VERBALLY &nbsp;over the phone send a copy of delivery even cut and paste of the UPS details onto a word document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be entitled to another 930 (if still&nbsp;available) in the case of loss</p>
<p>
</p><p>However... as I don't like my but, Microsoft have in the ONE question I have seen replaced an&nbsp; item with a
<strong>superior </strong>model.... losing it may actually work in your favour... just writing</p>

            You might try to check DDE in Word
<br />
<br />Open Word &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Go down and under General section, Check Ignore other applications that use DDE
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work uncheck this and try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />

<p>As your&nbsp;post starts by&nbsp;answering a question <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NOT YET&nbsp;ASKED</span></strong>!</p>
<p>In fact&nbsp;<em>A None&nbsp;Valid Q</em><em>uestion!</em> may have been&nbsp;posed</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially this is just the&nbsp;<em>wrong&nbsp;procedure being</em>&nbsp;<em>used&nbsp;</em>(or MS is wrong) however this is similar to to question posted in 2015 which I&nbsp;happen to read...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>You start with the GIF and then you share&nbsp; </strong>(MS reversed it? IDK)
</p>
<p>E.g.&nbsp;jpeg&nbsp; &amp; video <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">MESSAGE /ATTACHMENT</span>&nbsp;
<strong>{route 1}&nbsp;</strong>vice versa&nbsp; ATTACHMENT /MESSAGE <strong>{route 2}&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>As GIFs&nbsp;are not included in the defaults to be attached you start with the GIF and then share
<strong>{route 2}&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>So presumably the more complicated GIF can't be <strong>{route 1}&nbsp; </strong>is what you are saying?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence line 2 of my post NO question asked as no parameter </p>
<p>Route 1 would be the natural choice for 99.99% of people</p>

            So I did a little digging around and found a gif that gave me some problems. I then went to EZ Gif and compressed it and found that anything below 1024 kb would send in a text without issue. As far as it being AT&amp;T, I'm skeptical. Only because my 5c never
 gave me any grief with any gifs. It wasn't until I switched to wp10 that I ran into this issue. So it looks to be any gif =1Mb is a no go in my situation. Thanks holm.

 blank</p>
<p>Also, if the workflow is pending with one of the approvers, the pending task is not appearing &nbsp;in users home page.</p>

<p>hi rene,</p>
<p>please find my answers:</p>
<p>1. what environment you are working with, sharepoint online or sharepoint 2013 server?</p>
<p>sharepoint online</p>
<p>2. who actually start the workflow? you can submit an item with your own admin account and further check with other internal users.</p>
<p>users who have required access can start the workflow.</p>
<p>we have tested with our account and initiator name is correctly displayed and workflow seems to be working fine</p>
<p>3. which workflow are you using, the default approval - sharepoint 2010 workflow or your self-created one? you may send us a screenshot of the configuration.</p>
<p>default approval - sharepoint 2010 workflow</p>
<p>4. regarding the 3rd situation, which "home page" are you referring to?</p>
<p>task pending with the particular user will be displayed on their respective home page.</p>
<p>i have attached the screen shot where the initiator is shown as anonymous, however the name of the user who started the workflow should be present</p>
<p>and also the task approval page where &nbsp;for requestor section, initiator name should be present, however it is blank.</p>
<p>moreover if there is a change request, the task is getting created for the user, however its not appearing on this home page where all the pending task should come up,</p>
<p>we are not facing this issue with the workflows that were created recently.</p>

<p>Hi S_Singh,</p>
<p>We may see the situation is related to some users only. Therefore, could you share more information of the users who triggered the workflow with us?</p>
<p>1. Are they internal users or external users?</p>
<p>2. Does the behavior happen both the user's uploading or editing the document?</p>
<p>As I noticed that the same does not happen to the newly-created workflow, you can work with the new workflow in the library.</p>

<p>There were no newly created workflows. Workflow is same. </p>
<p>What I meant was that the workflows which were started/initiated recently does not have any issues.

<p>Hi S_Singh,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>The 2nd point is based on the fact that, as you may have known, a workflow can be triggered by Creating a new item and Changing an item.</p>
<p>However, as the workflow is working properly now, it could be hard for us to look into situation without reproducing it, as the previous related configuration or logs are unavailable.</p>
<p>If you see this behavior again, please feel free to post a new thread to let us know.</p>
<p>We would appreciate your understanding.</p>
<p>Rene</p>

    <title>6120&#47;6121 Display Hibernation Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ph1em  say:</h3>
<h2>            6120&#47;6121 Display Hibernation Issue</h2>
                    Myself and many others have encountered an issue where the 6120/6121 models will sporadically fail to leave hibernation mode properly after varying periods of time. The phone's display will stay blank, but as far as we can tell, nothing else is affected.
 Until the phone has been powercycled or has been left for 3 minutes, which is the default length of time before the phone re-enters hibernation mode, will the display function again. The display's backlight still functions. This has been reported to occur
 on phones running all firmware versions, including the latest.<br />
<br />
If I haven't explained it clearly enough, I will provide an example. In the morning, when my alarm is sounding, the phone will vibrate, the display and key backlighting will function, but there will be nothing on the screen. I can successfully turn the alarm
 off and unlock the keypad, but still the screen will be blank. If I turn the phone off and then on again, or if I simply leave it for 3 minutes, the display will work again.<br />
<br />
Resetting the phone using the *#7370# code does not solve the problem.<br />
<br />
Below is a link to a thread where we have been discussing this issue.<br />

<br />
Is Nokia aware of this problem? If so, is there a solution?<br />
<br />
Edit: I have a 6121 running firmware 4.09.<br />

            I have this problem too.<br />
After idling for more than 3 or 4 hours, the screen didn't want to<br />
come back.<br />
The only solution is to restart the phone or waiting for some 5 minutes after unlock/ last keypress.<br />

            Has anyone had display issues?<br />
I've had on two occassions on my new 6121 in the last 4 days had a situation where you go to use the phone and the display wont show anything afer the phone hasn't been used for couple of hours in one instance, the other instance was inactivity during overnight.<br />
The keys beep, the phone is functional, I can get the keylock off and dial a number and ring my home number, even though I can't see what I am doing! Even the backlight seems to come on, but the screen displays what seems to be all black! The only way to resolve
 is to hold the power key to power off and power on or to leave the phone alone for a couple of minutes and everything seems to be working fine including the display being fully functional.<br />
<br />
Seems there is a delay in waking the display out of sleep mode.<br />

            I have had the Nokia 6120 for 3 weeks, worked fine up until late last week. Now whenever it is left idol for a long time I cannot get it to display. The only way I can get it to come back on is either plug it into a charger or try to turn it off. However
 it will sometimes not allow me to turn it off, so I take the battey off.<br />
<br />
I have updated the phone software and the problem still occurs<br />

            I bought a brand new Telstra branded 6120c about a month ago, and immediately updated it to v4.21 firmware.<br />
<br />
It has now done the same thing twice... ie a blank screen in the morning after being left idle for several hours, but it sounds like the keys are still working.<br />
<br />
Have to switch it off and back on again.

I know it's highly unlikely, but it would be nice if someone from Nokia would at least acknowledge this problem. I think the number of unique posts in this thread alone clearly establishes that it exists.

            Tried to call the helpline in NZ, guy more or less didn't believe me, said go get a replacement to which I tried to explain was very likely to also have the same problem.<br />
(perhaps I try anyway)<br />
<br />
A little disappointed, as I have always recommended Nokia's to friends and family, and would have expected better service.<br />
<br />
I have emailed the service enquiry link and called the Helpline, and I have not received any acknowledgement that this clearly obvious problem exists.<br />
<br />
If its a bad batch of hardware, replace the phones, if its software related which seems most likely update it or al least let us know its being worked on.

    <title>a formula with non sequential cell references. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timschandorff  say:</h3>
<h2>            a formula with non sequential cell references.</h2>
                    It seems like there should be an easy solution to this but I am not finding it so I'd appreciate any help I can get.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have a long list of products with prices for each item from 4 different merchants each.&nbsp; The way it is formatted is that each merchant has two columns.&nbsp; One column is for price and the other is for the quatntity that the given price represents. (i.e. 2.00
 for 1lb of beef from one merchant and 3.00 for 1lb of beef from another.)&nbsp; I have an old set of data and a new set of data on two separate worksheets and I am trying to see how the new average price for each product has change from the old average price of
 the same item.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
In some cases not all four merchants were found so there is an empty cell where the price and quantity of the 3rd or 4th merchant would be.&nbsp; For that reason I was thinking that an AVERAGEIF statement would work because I don't want to include a zero value in
 the average.&nbsp; the problem is that putting in the cell range like this G2:G9 doesn't work because that will also include the quantity cells which I don't want to average.&nbsp; If I hold control and select the cells that I want it puts a comma between them but then
 the formula thinks there are too many arguments because in the formula "," is what goes between the range and the condition.<br />
<br />
Is there some other character or method for using a non-sequential range for an equation like this?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help<br />

The idea behind&nbsp;AVERAGEIF is that your conditions select the cells to average, rather than you.
<div><br />
<div>=AVERAGEIF(A:A,"Beef",G:G)</div>
<div><br />
<div>will average those cells in G where the cell in the same row but in column A is "Beef"</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you have multiple condtions, then this will average G if G &gt; 0 and A has "Beef"</div>
<div><br />
<div>=AVERAGEIFS(G:G,A:A,"Beef",G:G,"&gt;0")</div>
<div><br />
<div>Note that for AVERAGIF, the third range is averaged, but for&nbsp;<span>AVERAGIFS, the first range is averaged.</span></div>

            Ok that helps my understanding a little.&nbsp; so I think what I am really looking for then is
<br />
=averageif(a3:A8,"&gt;0",a3,a5,a7)<br />
<br />
so that the non-sequential cells are averaged based on the sequential range having value.&nbsp; but I'm assuming that this will still see the "," between the cells as a new argument and not let me do it.&nbsp; Is there a different way to format the non-sequential cells
 portion of this?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also is this statement asking if the sum of that range is &gt;0 or if each cell in that range is &gt;0?&nbsp; my hope is that it is the later so that any cell with no value won't be averaged in and mess up my result.<br />
<br />
Thanks a ton for the quick response.<br />

<h2>            Excel User-defined Functions accross multiple users</h2>
                    <p>What is the best way to set-up user-defined functions to be shared accross users in a small working group.&nbsp; We have tries creating an identical XLA established as an "add-in" on each user profile.&nbsp; Excel files tend to save the user specific path in the file
 with the function name requiring massive search and replace operations before begining work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>What is the work around for this.&nbsp; Running Excel as part of Office 2007.</p>

            Here is one way to avoid "massive search and replace operations" in Excel 2007.<br />
<br />
If the XLA file has been opened, when you open a workbook containing references ("links") to the UDFs, Excel should show a dialog box with a warning to update links. Instead, if you see a security warning that "automatic update of links has been disabled,"
 choose to "enable this content," and click OK. Excel will show a dialog box where you should choose "Edit Links..." In the Edit Links dialog box, choose Change Source, and navigate to the location of the XLA file, select it, click Open, and Close the Edit
 Links dialog box.<br />
<br />
If the XLA file is not open, and you open a workbook containing references ("links") to the UDFs, proceed as above, but click "Continue" instead of clicking "Edit Links." After you open the XLA file, choose Office Button &gt; Prepare &gt; Edit Links to Files, and
 change the source.<br />
<br />
Another way to avoid search-and-replace is to save the XLA file in exactly the same folder (same path) on all computers.<br />
