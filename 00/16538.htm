<h2>            Installing additional software to Windows mobiole 2003</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me how to go about installing iPresenter to WM2003?</p>
<p>I purchased an iPAQ 4150 on eBay and need to know how to access other packages that come with this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<td>That's right, I can't find the software on the CD. Apparently WM2003 could be bundled with the iPresenter software plus others which I've read about while looking at reviews of the iPAQ 4150 when it was released.
 Can I download the software from a web site?<br />

<p>HP always offered a pretty good selection of software on the iPAQs.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The 4150 came with the usual suite of iPAQ custom applications: iTask task manager, iPAQ Backup (SpriteSoft), HP Mobile Printing, HP Certificate Enroller, LEAP, Bluetooth Manager and iPAQ Image Zone (HP's&nbsp;image viewer). The&nbsp;standard
 apps included were&nbsp;Pocket versions of Word, Excel and Outlook, MSN Messenger, Terminal Services, VPN client, Jawbreaker (a Bubblets game) and ClearType Tuner.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the companion CD you will find the 3rd party apps.</p>
<p>The apps that are on the CD&nbsp;include Westtek ClearVue Suite (for viewing MS Office docs), Resco File Explorer 2003, F-Secure FileCrypto Data Encryption, RealOne Player for Pocket PC and iPresenter PowerPoint converter.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need updates to the ROM, you can find them at the HP site.&nbsp; It is pretty easy to navigate to where they have all the available&nbsp;updates for your device.</p>

            Success! Thanks for your help. I realize I'm not as computer literate as I thought! The software was on the companion CD and I've managed to install iPresenter and Worldmate OK, so thanks for your patience. I looked in the wrong places.<br />
Re the ROM update on the HP site - is it worth installing it? <br />
I appreciate forums like this it's a great help.<br />
<br />
All the best,<br />

<h2>            Mobile photos vs SkyDrive Camera Roll, what&#39;s the difference&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>There is a tile within the pictures Hub that is called Mobile photos from Windows Live. Any clue what this is for? I assume it's similar to the SkyDrive Camera Roll feature but I'm not certain.</p>
<p>It has no photos and only appeared after my phone was configured with my MSN passport or whatever it's called these days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Thanks</p>

</span></li><li><span>Scroll all the way down to your last contact.

For Outlook 2010 and Outlook 2013, you must send the message to actually store these addresses in the AutoSuggest cache. However, by

<p>I found the answer myself. There was corruption in my account which had changed my Settings.</p>
<p>I was able to change them back to what they should be by going to my E-mail account settings, clicking on "More Settings" which opened "Internet E-mail settings" and then made changes on the two tabs "Sent items" and "Deleted items". The correct icon for
 the Inbox returned instantly.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> queryjm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Constantly Freezing Functionality on iPad Pro</h2>
                    <p>I have an IPad Pro 9.7 and use OneNote quite extensively. Recently I have encountered problems with the app: when I open it, it is fine in the page that it opens up into. However, as soon as move out of that page and into another one, the Draw, Insert &amp;
 Home functionality 'greys out' and I can't scroll the page at all, i.e. it is effectively frozen.&nbsp; But, interestingly, the View functionality is fine and I can navigate around my notebooks quite happily - I just can't do anything on existing pages! - so it
 is obviously not an overall app freeze (although that does happen periodically).&nbsp; When I close the app and re-open, it's fine again, but only the page it opens into.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also seem to be constantly sync'ing, which is a little annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried various shutdown options and even deleting and re-installing the app, but nothing works.&nbsp; I've searched online and others seem to be encountering a similar problem, but I can't find a solution that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help at all?</p>

            Generally text messages are limited to about 160 characters (or so) depending on the carrier. There is no way you can increase it but you might chat with your carrier and maybe they can do it&nbsp;

<h2>            sharepoint online invitations not working consistently for external users</h2>
                    When I send out the sharepoint online invites to external users I find that sometimes they accept the invitation but it doesn't then take them to the site. In some cases it says they are not in the directory while in others it just says access denied.
 however, when I check the site, they appear to be registered and if I subsequently send them a link to the site they can access it without an issue.&nbsp; Do you know why the invites can't always be used to access the site once registered or a way to get around
 this?

 for?</p>
<p>3. Are the affected users all new external users? If you share a site to an existing user that's already in your active users, does the issue occur?</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Does the issue occur to all the lists and libraries in a site collection, all the site collections? If you create a new site collection? Does the issue occur?</p>
<p>5. Does the share function work as expect before? Does the issue occur to other users in your organization when sharing?&nbsp; What actions have you performed before the issue occurred for the first time? For example, a setting&nbsp;<span>change</span> in the site
 or admin center.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I add notes to a power point file in Office for Mac 2011&#63;</h2>
                    I downloaded a powerpoint presentation for school and I want to add notes to it in class but for some reason when I click on the notes section, it does not allow me to type. I tried in both normal and notes view.

<h3> mg mills  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013&#58; How do I change appearance of e-mails&#63;</h2>
                    e-mail windows are hard to read.&nbsp; The "From" line uses excessively large fonts that waste space (and is not labeled as "from").&nbsp; The subject frame is small and requires constant scrolling.&nbsp; The colors lack contrast and are sometimes hard to distinguish,
 and this includes selected items.&nbsp; The picture frame is wasted space as few people include their picture. &nbsp; Cascaded windows are not easily distinguished as the title bars are the same shade of white.&nbsp;
<br />
I could continue with more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, I can say that I was quite happy with the appearance of Outlook 2007.&nbsp;
<br />
There should be a means to change and customize the appearance. &nbsp;

<h2>            Outlook 2016 - Cannot start Microsoft Outlook. Cannot open Outlook window. The set of folders cannot be opened.</h2>
                    <p>Recently I have two users after their outstation trip when they back to office both user cannot start Microsoft Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>I have a chat with Microsoft Technical but they can't resolve it.</p>
<p>Solution..</p>
<p>I did a test by creating a new UserID and setup Outlook and replicate the user mail. It works but I don't think this is the best solution as we need to create a new userid and setup Outlook mail from scratch.</p>
<p>Since Microsoft Technical I email my issue. I checked the forum they asked to try these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd Solution...</p>
<p><code>outlook.exe /resetnavpane (well it work as it will start to replicate the user mail all over from the exchange server.</code></p>
<p><code>or </code></p>
<p><code>Goto Control Panel at Mail icon. Create a new Profile and this will also work as it will start to replicate the user mail all over again from Exchange server.</code></p>
<p>My question to Microsoft why is this happening on the Outlook 2016 mail ? Please let me know as I don't want to see another user having this issue again.
</p>
<p>

<h2>            Disabled options in navigation pane - Mac &#91;OneNote&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>SCENARIO :</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using OneNote on mac and I used to toggle the navigation panes between viewing just the content and page with sections etc. Now navigation panes do not allow me to "Show sections and pages" and "Show only pages".</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>TRIED METHODS :</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>There are two ways to access this section. One from ribbon bar and other from sidebars. Tried both of them. Still the same.&nbsp;</li><li>Tried to uninstall OneNote and reinstall it. Also did delete all the files with the keyword "onenote" in my mac with the intention to delete the cache</li><li>Install OneNote by downloading it from Office.com and also tried installing it from Apple App store.&nbsp;</li><li>Restart the app (obviously) - it did not work either</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>REQUEST :</strong></p>
<p>How do I get my options in Navigation panes back? I need them.</p>

Do you always use OneNote in a small window? Try to maximize the OneNote window to let me know if the issue remains.<br />

            sim card readers are basically memory readers designed to read contents saved on the memory of the simcard. if those messages were originally saved on the sim card then there is a great chance that messages deleted are scrambled and tossed to any part
 of that memory. rerieving that will require high technical expertise and specially designed software in order to locate deleted data on the sim card , descramble them and view.<br />
so in short, NO :)

<br />
The N95 doesn't store text messages on the SIM in the first place, so the answer is no.

    <title>How can I turn off automatic updates&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I turn off automatic updates&#63;</h2>
                    Currently running build 9879. Automatic updates is turned on and I cannot turn it off. Says this was set by my administrator, but I am the administrator. Yesterday the computer insisted on doing an update which took almost 2 hours and then computer was
 unusable. I had to reboot and rollback to previous OS (version 9879). Does anyone know how I can turn off the updates? Computer is an Acer all-in-one original OS was 64 bit W8.1

<p>Getting into safe mode worked perfectly, BUT: I tried to get safe mode with networking but still would not connect to internet. When I went to "Change PC settings" and select windows update the page remains blank I assume waiting for an internet connection
 which never happens so I still can't get to the setting to turn off the automatic updates feature. My computer is already signalling that it wants to shut down to do another unwanted update. I have deferred it for as long as I can. Don't know why selecting
 safe mode WITH networking doesn't work. Any suggestions?</p>

    <title>NSU - Nokia Software Updater does not resume downloads - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zubin---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            NSU - Nokia Software Updater does not resume downloads</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am a long time nokia customer, and have owned models like the the 3310, the 6600, the E65 and now the new E66.<br />
<br />
In all my times of small frustrations with various Nokia issues, nothing has got me more annoyed than this seemingly very arrogant feature omission to one of the most invaluable pieces of software Nokia has released. I've signed up on this discussion forum
 just to let Nokia know that they are alienating and distancing many customers with this arrogance. Let me explain:<br />
<br />
EVERY Nokia customer needs to upgrade his/her firmware some time or the other. Firmware files are large, and not everyone in the world is on an amazingly fast broadband connection. Not just that, but what if for some reason, after downloading 85% of the firmware
 file, NSU crashes? Or your modem reboots? Or the Nokia servers decide to cut the connection?<br />
<br />
Why does a seemingly modern piece of software like the Nokia Software Updater not have the ability to resume downloads? Software applications from the late 90's have this feature! And why have other people on this forum, who have asked exactly the same question,
 been responded to (with extreme arrogance) with lines like "Get fast broadband, or too bad, go to a Nokia dealer instead"?<br />
<br />
Is that the way one responds to paying customers asking you to make YOUR service and support better?<br />
<br />
Why can't I resume the download of a firmware using the NSU? Is it for "security" purposes? Please - I downloaded a 4.2 GB file from Adobe over a secure connection, and they had the decency and courtesy to include a download manager that resumes.<br />
<br />
I sincerely hope that we see the NSU application get the features of "resume downloads" and "show changelog for new firmware" soon - if your fans and customers are getting annoyed with the inability to maintain and repair their own phones, and the general sense
 of frustration that you take too long to address issues with the phones, you're going to be losing a lot of goodwill with your installed base.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Zubin

            The updater download page clearly states that a high speed connection is required.<br />
<br />
It's a bit late to add this feature now that broadband use has greatly passed that of ancient dial up use in most countries.<br />
<br />
Also updating using a dial-up connection is not recommend anyway.<br />
<br />
For those that don't have or can't afford a broadband connection then nokia will update your phone for free at a care point.

            Well I ~have~ a broadband connection - unlimited data plan. It's not only about the connectivity - there are times when something unexpected happens, and a Nokia customer who's been waiting for a long time has to wait and watch a progress bar start from
 the beginning.<br />
<br />
Please understand, the question here is not about what the users have, but of what capabilities your tools provide, irrespective of what your users have, that are prepared for every eventuality.<br />
<br />
The auto industry equivalent of this would be: "Here's your car, thanks for buying it. Oh by the way, we have a free, new engine for you. But, you have to put it into the car yourself. Don't have a crane and the tools? That's your problem - we're just giving
 you the engine. You have to make sure you have the tools yourself. "<br />
<br />
For the majority of users, this is not a solution - just another problem. Especially from a $billion public global company, you tend to have higher expectations.

            To be honest I really can't see what the big deal is.<br />
<br />
Even a large firmware file (140mb) only takes between 5-15 minutes to download on an average broadband connection.<br />
<br />
I have a stable connection and a well managed computer and have never had an update download fail or reset and i've done a lot of updates.<br />
<br />
You also have to remember that up until a couple of years ago nokia didn't even give us this tool. It's better to have it in it's current form than not have it at all. The NSU is still under constant development so they may add this feature at some stage.<br />
<br />
Ranting about it on this forum will get you nowhere at all as it's most likely will not even be read by nokia.<br />

            I totally share the frustration of the college above.<br />
For the past 5 hours I am struggling to download 123.4 MB for firmware update it breaks every 5-9 MB or so!<br />
<br />
I have 2 broadband connections and it is failing on both!<br />
<br />
Apparently the link to the nokia update servers is dropping somewhere on the line, becouse I am pinging
<a href="http://www.nokia.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.nokia.com</a> and it is replaying and all times.<br />
<br />
It is torture believe me!<br />
<br />
So please please please add a download resume manager!!!

<p>Maybe some people are fortunate enough to be having no problems with their firmware update that's why they can't understand our sentiment. I badly need an update for my phone and its file size is 107.9 MB. Strangely, every time I retry it always stops at
 68.1MB. I have contacted Nokia about my problem and they said it's probably caused by slow connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you saying that you built the NSU for those so-fortunate people only?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please update the NSU with the download manager.</p>

<p>Yes. We really need the download manager and able to resume download when there is error. I kept getting like half way then it restarted. I have a broadband connection but still it does not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope Nokia will include a download manager in the NSU. Or is there any alternative to download rather than using the NSU?</p>

<p>please Mr/Mrs Psycho Mania everyone is not as fortunate as you are, i have been trying to download this update since tuesday 02/02/2010 but when it has downloaded about 95M an error comes up so i have to restart, Please we need this resume manager. I chose
 a nokia phone because nokia updates its software now and again but if i end up failing to update it, these updates end up being useless for users like us. and it would appear as if they are made for just a few nokia users like you leaving the majority users
 like us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it seems its only you who is able to download it without any glitches.&nbsp;</p>

            i am having issues with the NSU. i am in the process of updating now, my appln started downloading the updates. initially, it stated 0 of 64.5MB downloaded... now its increased to 81.4 of 81.4 MB downloaded?!! why is this like this..? I assume the firmware
 do have fixed size and while downloading it do analyse the size to be downloaded! is this a bug in my Sw?

<p>This is a Nokia users forum so they don't build Nokia phones just use them and try to help others .</p>
<p>I would one try to connect off peak internet time .</p>
<p>Disable AntiVirus and Firewall&nbsp; have no programs nor tasks running in the background .</p>
<p>Then try the update on a fully charged phone . That will give you the best chance .</p>
<p>Or if you want take phone to Nokia Care centre for update .</p>

<h2>            Inserted image gets cut off...</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
When I insert an image in Word 2010, the top of the iamge gets cut off? (see pic1). When I double click to edit the header, the dotted line from the header runs through the image and it looks like it might be the header line that cuts the image off? ( see pic2)
 Even if I add a border the border gets cut off... (see pic3)<br />
<br />
I have tried to repair the office package and various other ideas but with no success.<br />
<br />
What coud be the problem?<br />
<br />

TRY PAIRING UP A FRIENDS HEADSET AND SEE IF THAT WORKS OK SO AT LEASE YOU WILL KNOW WHICH IS AT FAULY

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing that you can do to resolve this issue is to check if the installation was successful. Open the
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, go to <strong>Programs</strong>, select <strong>Programs and Features</strong>, then check if the
<strong>Microsoft Office Software</strong> is already installed. If it shows on the list of installed programs, reboot your computer, and after that, launch the Office app again. If it's still the same, try to
<strong>repair</strong> the Office software. You can refer to this article for instructions on how to repair the Office software:
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b?CorrelationId=058ff03e-e39a-4cd6-9237-de3e72d8f62c&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;ocmsassetID=HA010357402" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Repair

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately Office has not been installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I completely removed office (following your "Repair an Office application" article; using o15-ctrremove.diagcab), now I am stuck on the installation section. When I run the installer, the installer stops after a few seconds of&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"We're

<p>

<p>If that's the case, if the installation is stuck in the process, it could be that the Office folder has not been completely removed from your computer. It may show on the Programs in the Control Panel that the Office software is not installed, you may have
 removed the software, but the thing is that the Office folder is still in the Programs files. To successfully install the Office program, make sure that Office is completely removed from your computer. To do that, try to manually remove the Windows Install
 packages or the Office installation folder and files. For instructions, you can refer to this article:

<h2>            Outlook does not send email but saves it as draft only</h2>
                    <p>Since today (havent used email for a few days though) I can no longer send emails from the web-based outlook.</p>
<p>Same applies to my win10 PC, smartphone and tablet (last both androids).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since a few days the interface for outlook has changed but did not send any emails since today.</p>
<p>I can open the emails, select answer, write a reply and press send. Now things go wrong.</p>
<p>The email is saved as a draft and will not be send. Opening the draft and sending it once more has no effect either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help would be very appreciated since I'm using hotmail/outlook for about 20 years now and have become quite depended on it for my email.</p>

            <p>Havent yet tested if I can fix the following, but it seems MS has screwed up somewhere with setting up my account in the new Outlook Mail web-client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I write an email as I've done for about 20 years, it now saves as draft and will not be sent whatever I do.</p>
<p>However I just realized I use a payed for email-address within outlook. So I sent an email using the actual address from the outlook account itself, which did go out after sitting in the draft box for a second or 2.</p>
<p>Now all I need to do is try to clean out my account and set it up again. Hopefully that fixes my issues.</p>

<p>Outlook is now not even allowing me to add the account and keeps trowing up error 'A TSL API failure occurred. Error = 0x80090326'</p>

</p><p>So I could not send emails from my linked account, but I could receive them. Figured I'd update the linked account by first removing it and than adding it again. As the above post mentions I can not add any account to my outlook-account any more, however
 I am still receiving emails from the linked account even after updating the password and making sure that account does not forward emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I.o.w. the situation has gone from inconvenient to bothersome to the point I am somewhat afraid my privacy is no longer private. Really really awesome update that outlook has gotten! Thank you MS for the excellent update and above all the even better support
 on these issues where clearly I am the only experiencing crap like this!</p>

            I am having the exact same issues. I have never had any problems before up until now. Very frustrating to say the least as I rely on this for my business and have had to send emails from my personal address instead of my linked business account.

            And that is only the beginning. When you try to unlink the account you can do nothing anymore. You simply can not get outlook to stop pulling emails from the linked account ... i.o.w. I'm royally screwed.

<h2>            Windows 10 Insider Preview 18298 Freezes at Logo</h2>
                    I have a Toshiba Satellite laptop with Intel i3 processor, 6gb memory, 500gb ssd hd. I downloaded the Insider Preview build 18298 this morning. Everything was fine until I was prompted to restart my computer. It restarted and will not boot beyond the logo
 screen. I pushed and held the power button for 5 to 10 seconds three times to access the recovery screen. I was able to access several prompts, but it takes me back to the logo screen except for the Bios. I can access the Bios utility. I'm very sure there's
 a solution. Can someone assist me or us please?!? By the way, there was an error code 0xc0000001.

<p>This may or may not apply to you but similar problems have been reported to Microsoft and Insiders are awaiting further word. My HP crashed and required "repair"&nbsp; which meant clean installing 17763 the public build available from the Windows Media Creation
 Tool possibly from another computer.</p>

            Thanks for your reply. I can't get beyond the logo screen which will more than likely force me to reinstall Windows 10. I'm not fond of loosing files. I won't let this happen again. Backup is essential.

<p>Sorry to hear, yes backup is important, but that is why it is advised to not use these beta builds on a working or gaming computer. Always use a secondary spare computer, virtual machines or even dual-boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS does warn in the Insider Agreement, you could be at risk for data loss amongst other things. Many never bother to read it unfortunately.</p>

<h2>            &#34;....pst cannot be accessed because another workstation has modified it. close and then restart all mail-enabled applications...&#34;</h2>
                    I've been trying to synchronize Outlook calendars and contacts with MobileMe and on to my iPhone. It appears that the sync does not happen unless Outlook is closed. On occasions where the sync program gets access to my .pst file, I get the error message
 (which I can cure by shutting down Outlook and restarting). I'm trying to figure out why this oesn't work in a more straight-forward way or if there are any settings - for example, regarding file sharing - that would solve the issue. (BTW, I'm not using an
 Exchange server.)

            Hi I'm also getting this error message.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I haven't tried to change anything in outlook or sync with anything. <br />
<br />
Basically outlook has been working fine until about a week ago it started with this error message, in conjunction with it I can no longer search my contact lists or any of my mail folders.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I've tried numerous suggestions on forums to no result. I've tried repairing outlook with control panel - no result.&nbsp; I'm also not using an exchange server.
<br />
<br />
I just cannot understand why it would be working fine one day and for no apparent reason start doing this.<br />
<br />
Please help!<br />

            Is anyone from Microsoft going to address this issue. I haven't installed any new software nor have I changed any settings in outlook. I'm using windows 7 and MicroSoft Office Home and Business 2010. So both are current products.<br />
