<h2>            Go To Meeting calendar invitations disappearing from Outlook Calendar</h2>
                    <p>I have had issues with Outlook Calendar for a couple of months now. &nbsp;I am using Windows 10 and have been using Outlook and Go To Meeting in congruence for about three years now and until recently have never had a problem. &nbsp;This is now close to a weekly occurrence.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using the Go To Meeting plug in for Outlook and creating meetings in my calendar and sending them out to invitees. &nbsp;Often, the calendar reminder gets dropped from the calendar without any warning or deletion from me or anyone else. &nbsp;Today was
 the first day that it was dropped and the server actually re-created the meeting. &nbsp;The original content was gone from the calendar reminder, but instead said "Exchange Server re-created a meeting that was missing from your calendar." and the recreation contained
 the Go To Meeting link. &nbsp;How could it be missing from my calendar if I originally created it in my calendar!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, it will also show me multiple instances of the same meeting invitation. &nbsp;One of my coworkers was invited to the meeting, whose calendar I have access to, and it shows 4 instances of this same meeting. &nbsp;It shows two copies of the original email that
 I sent, one showing as accepted and one showing as pending, and then two copies of the re-created email by the Exchange Server. &nbsp;How can I fix this?</p>
<p>

<h2>            How to resolve a sync conflict between different versions of a Word file&#63;</h2>
                    On my desktop computer I made some changes in a Word file. I saved that on my OneDrive, but I quickly shut down a computer so it's not yet synced with the cloud. Currently I don't have access to my desktop computer, but I want to continue working on a
 file. I know where I left so I can actually continue writing on my laptop. But will I be able to merge new and old changes? Let's say on my desktop I made changes in a page 5 and page 6. Those changes are not yet synced with the cloud. On my laptop I will
 now make changes in pages 6 and 7 which will be synced to the cloud soon after I make them. Will word be able to save ALL changes once I am back at my desktop computer?

<p>
</p><div>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>There is always a confusion while working on different computers and if the synchronization has not done completely. In this situation, there is a possibility of all the changes taking place or it may replace only the newer changes with the existing file
 saved on OneDrive. So, it is always recommended to save and let the file synchronize properly before accessing or making changes in another computer/device.</p>
<p>

<p>I never will lear to understand, why questions are not answered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ISSUE IS:</p>
<p>we have certificate installed =&gt; private Key</p>
<p>we want to send to a recipient which sits somewhere in the world _ not in my LDAP as i am a private person.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THE SMIME principle says:</p>
<p>encrypt with the Public piece and the recipient DEcrypts with the private piece.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SO WHY DOES OUTLOOK want the recipient Key / Certificate, if i want to send him an encrypted mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really would appreciate an answer TO THAT ISSUE .... not how to select the certificate.</p>

<p>Hi JPG_master,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First may I ask what your email service is? Are you using an on-prem Exchange server or do you have an Office 365 for Business account? If you are using on-prem Exchange, there is indeed no OME as
 it is provided by Azure RMS as a cloud service. Please check my following answers:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a.) <span style="font-style: italic">
Office365 is a license model NOT a tool-set description.</span> It depends on your plan. If you are using an Office 365 Home or Personal plan, it mainly provides Office apps. But if you are using an Office 365 for Business plan, you will have additional Exchange
 online, SharePoint online, and Skype for Business online cloud services.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">b.) based on the licens etc there are new Options, like Office in the web / online.</span> Let's use OWA as an example. OWA can be provided both from Exchange online
 for Office 365 for Business and Exchange on-prem, but not from an Office 365 Home/ Personal subscription.
</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">c.) OME.</span> OME only works with Exchange online from Office 365 for Business as I said above.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So in additional to above answers to your questions, if your email account is provided by an on-prem Exchange server, you may need to use S/MIME to additionally encrypt your email contents. And actually
 all SMTP traffics between your client/server and server/server are encrypted by TLS/SSL by default. All these approaches (S/MIME, OME) we discussed here in this thread are additional measures to the default TLS/SSL security measures.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leo</p>

            This error is typically "Decimal field precision is too small to accept the numeric you attempted to add". Can you provide more information? If you remove or change/convert a numeric field from Db2 does this resolve the issue?

            Hi Yashwant
<br />
<br />New laptops will come preinstalled with a 30 day Office 365 trial. These trials usually do not require a product key, but purchase of a 1 month or 1 year subscription after it expires.
<br />
<br />If the suite is currently not working, try repairing it.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features 
<br />Scroll down to Microsoft Office
<br />Select it
<br />Click Change
<br />
<br />Now, wait while the repair wizard starts up.
<br />
<br />Choose the type of repair you would like to perform. Depending on the severity or availability of your Internet connection, you could try the first option, Quick Repair, which is much faster and tries to fix the problem without a data connection.
<br />
<br />If that doesn:tm:t resolve the problem, then go back and try the Online Repair option. For my particular issue, I ultimately had to use the Online Repair.
<br />
<br />The repair process is straight-forward following the wizard. Note that youâ€:tm:ll need to save your work and close all Office programs first, and then click Repair.
<br />
<br />Then wait while the repair process runs.
<br />
<br />You will notice the repair experience is similar to a fresh installation. The amount of time it takes will depend on your connection speed and what the issue is.
<br />
<br />You will see your Office apps light up in their respective colors while the repair completes.
<br />
<br />Once the installation is complete, restart your computer just to be sure and launch your apps and verify if the problem you were having is resolved.

<p>Hi Alexis, </p>
<p>
</p><p>It’s possible that you can’t open a new Word document because Office needs to be reactivated. We suggest that you reactivate the program by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <em>Word</em>, click on <strong>File</strong> and select <strong>Account</strong>.
</li><li>Under <em>User Information</em>, click <strong>Sign out</strong> and click <strong>
Yes</strong> to logout the current account.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Sign in</strong> and log in your Microsoft account that’s associated with your Office subscription.<br />
</li><li>Relaunch the application and check if the issue still occurs. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, we recommend that you perform an online repair to the Office program. Check this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> for the instructions on how to do it. This will refresh the application and make sure everything gets fixed.
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have any other concerns, don’t hesitate to let us know. </p>

<h2>            &#34;To close your Outlook account, you must first cancel your billing service...&#34; error when closing my account</h2>
                    <p><em>Original Title:</em> NEED HELP DELETING HOTMAIL ACCOUNT</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with the many other users who have posted in this community, I can't delete my hotmail account.&nbsp; Every time I try to deactivate my account I get the message "To close your Outlook account, you must first cancel your billing service.&nbsp; Go to Microsoft
 Account and Billing Services."&nbsp; I've NEVER had anything set-up in Microsoft Billing Services.&nbsp; When I access Microsoft Account and Billing Services there is nothing there to cancel.&nbsp; Please help me get this Hotmail account deleted.&nbsp; I would like to create
 a new username that's more professional appropriate, but would first like this account deactivated.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also like to point out that I first tried not using this account for over a year to allow it to deactivate on it's own.&nbsp; I didn't log into the account once for more than a year.&nbsp; Today I tried to verify&nbsp;that the&nbsp;account was no longer active, but
 instead of saying it was not a&nbsp;valid account it asked me my security questions, re-set password, and&nbsp;logged back into&nbsp;an active account.&nbsp; I had never even used Hotmail when it was the new Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please send me a private message so that I can respond with my Unique ID to get this account deleted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

                    <p>I am attempting to remove this annoying and unwanted search engine:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.istartsurf.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far these methods I've seen on the net have failed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Control Panel on Windows - this is not removing it through the normal methods</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use of Revo Installer - just tried it and nothing donng</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google Chrome and Firefox options - no use either, and I looked at them all</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can set my home page on Firefox and CVhrome to google, as normal, easily enough. &nbsp;And I can click on it. &nbsp;But only after I have this istart search engine come up, always first as the default search option. &nbsp;I cannot change it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas to remove istart please?</p>

            When do you get this error? <br />
During the installation process or while accessing notebooks? <br />
<br />
If its while accessing notebooks, save the notebooks locally in PC, then upload notebooks to skydrive one at a time.

            <p>I had the same error. Mine was caused by my proxy server not allowing app traffic for this app through for the synchronisation. To fix it, I bypassed the proxy (switched to mobile wifi) and initial synchronisation complete successfully. I can now use it
 successfully through the proxy - must have been something to do with initial sync.</p>

<h2>            External Email Warning</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just added an external email warning to all emails not coming from within our organization and I'd really like to be able to change the color on that.&nbsp; Is that possible?&nbsp; I can't seem to find a way when setting up that rule.&nbsp; Anyone have any insight?</p>

            You're using a transport rules and want colored text in the warning message? You'll use HTML coding in the rule. 
<br />This is what we use: 
<br />&lt;div style="background-color:#FFEB9C; width:100%; border-style: solid; border-color:#9C6500; border-width:1pt; padding:2pt; font-size:10pt; line-height:12pt; font-family:'Calibri'; color:Black; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#9C6500; font-weight:bold;"&gt;CAUTION:&lt;/span&gt; This email originated from outside of the organization.  Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;

<h2>            How do I create a 2-D array of shapes&#63;</h2>
                    In Visio 2003, I could select one or more shapes, then create a one or 2-D array, specifying either the space between shapes or the center-to-center distance for the repeat.<br />
<br />
I can't find that function in Visio 2010, and I need to get my illustrations out!<br />

<p>
</p><p>Well i solved it tonight in a mad frustration.&nbsp; </p>
<p>All i did to make it finally work was to<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>press&nbsp; {Windows Key}+{Alt}+{Enter} </strong></p>
<p>and it worked!!!!!</p>
<p>No idea why we need to press the Windows key - but IT DOES WORK</p>

            <p>Alright.&nbsp; I'm not sure what is going on, but I have gotten the command to work intermittently.&nbsp; I have found if I alternate between the left and right &lt;Alt&gt; keys I can get it to work in either program.&nbsp; At least I know I can get it to do what I want, but
 it is still a mystery as to why I have to try so hard.&nbsp; The &lt;Alt&gt; key works every time I press it and the &lt;Enter&gt; key works every time a press it.&nbsp; But when pressed together, well, refer to what I typed above.&nbsp;

    <title>Installing Office 2016 with deployment tool - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Installing Office 2016 with deployment tool</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm trying to install Office 365 2016 with the deployment tool, since first release is not activated for my university. However it always displays the error code "30125-1007(404)". I have already deactivated my Firewall and Antivirus and I'm not using a
 proxy. This is my configuration:</p>
<p>&lt;Configuration&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Add OfficeClientEdition="32" Branch="Current"&gt;<br />
&lt;Product ID="O365ProPlusRetail"&gt;<br />
&lt;Language ID="de-at" /&gt;<br />
&lt;/Product&gt;<br />
&lt;/Add&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/Configuration&gt;</p>
<p>In my install logs the last lines are always this:</p>
<p>Nexus Transport a426j Unexpected MsoGetRemoteHostNetworkStatusWithUrlType failed {"RemoteHost": "<a href="https://nexus.officeapps.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">nexus.officeapps.live.com"}</a></p>
<p>I can also upload the whole logs if that helps.</p>

<p>Hi Blabla1758,</p>
<p>I tested the configuration file with language ID “de-at” in download mode and got the same error code. But when I changed the language ID to “de-de”, there was not error occurred. It just stalled in download mode. Then I closed the cmd and reopen it, used
 the same configuration file in configure mode directly to install Office 2016. The installation succeeded with no error.</p>
<p>So, could you try to use configure mode directly or add a source path in download mode to see the outcome?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Ran</p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no option to assign a specific mobile/landline number for your Skype Number. So technically,&nbsp;either your contacts call your Skype Number #1 or Skype Number #2, the forwarded call will be received by the primary&nbsp;Skype call&nbsp;forwarding
 number you will set up. The only time you will received the call on the secondary call forwarding number is when you're unable to answer the call on the primary call forwarding&nbsp;number.</p>
<p>

 is Error I get every time windows loads after any update is installed. I have uninstalled AV and rebooted but the turn on and off button is still greyed out, and no way to do anything but close error box every time I load windows 10. Yes this starts after
 every update and does not go away, and since I am admin and only authorized user for this system it makes it beyond annoying. I have tried to roll back to back up but no issue resolved. I have uninstalled AV program rebooted and no resolution there either.
 I have tried looking in registry for any way to stop message but as yet not found a solution. I have turned off notifications and still get message. I have tried settings for defender and it is greyed out on turn off and on in windows 10. I have also looked
 through as many defender related threads looking for a fix to no avail.

    <title>Could use some guidance on Word forms checkboxes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> loneil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Could use some guidance on Word forms checkboxes</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there.<br />
My company's software product has a feature that allows users to generate forms from Word templates. The program auto fills some fields from the SQL database and the user can fill in other data that they desire. So we have a .dotx template that holds the design
 of the form, and then the user gets the .docx file to fill out when they call it from our program.<br />
The problem we're having is that some of our users have been finding that the forms take an exceptionally long time to open up and then, once open, are so slow to respond (scroll around, etc) that they're unusable. So in my investigations so far, I've found
 out that the problem systems are one with lower powered CPUs (unfortunately it happens for systems above our system requirements) and the Word forms that cause the problems are ones with large amount of ActiveX style checkboxes on them. I verified that reducing
 the ActiveX checkboxes fixes the form loading problems.<br />
<br />
So I have the following questions about solutions:</p>
<p>1) Is there any way to configure Word, or some other settings, so that there won't be such a strain opening a Word form with lots of ActiveX checkboxes? Any way of speeding up Word's opening?</p>
<p>2) Using Legacy style checkboxes instead of the ActiveX ones makes the forms load fine, but it looks like the user has to double-click the checkbox and change Default Value-&gt;Checked. Is there a way to configure it so that they can simply click on the checkbox
 to tick it? "Legacy Forms" checkbox as a name kind of worries me (Legacy…), does that mean a future version of word at some point wouldn't load the checkboxes because they're "legacy"?</p>
<p>3) Yes, it became clear to me after a little bit of research into solutions that Word is not the tool for the job for forms like I'm describing. InfoPath seems to be exactly what we should have been using all along but unfortunately I wasn't involved in
 the decision making or development of these forms, just tasked with coming up with a solution.<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate answers to any of these, or if anyone has any other ideas for solutions to this problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

What is the best approach for your needs is difficult to tell...</p>
<p>Note, however, that form fields certainly work in Word, assuming that you apply forms protection: After you've designed the form, click the Developer tab, and then click Protect Document | Restrict Formatting and Editing. For "Editing restrictions," choose
 "Filling in forms," and then click the Yes, Start Enforcing Protection button (you can specify a password if you like).</p>

<h2>            Scam- From MALWAREBITES &#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Start Over !!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just wanted to report a scam, About a week ago I was having password problems with Google so I call what I thought was Google and I even ask is this Google and person says YES ! So I tell my problem and I was told they could fix so I let them in my
 PC was told someone from Mexico was hacking my PC they would stop this so I am sold a package for 299.00 for 5 year protection and I was told I would have to pay by check C/C unsafe so I do that and they said they removed them and PC was safe.. So I ask them
 to Email me a copy of what I was buying and I'm told I would get that after I called their billing Dept. and OK check, so I then tell him I want to change method of payment to C/C he said no I said forget everything then , He says OK and he would return my
 PC, OH I left out turns out I was talking to Co. called Malwarebites. I hang up phone a few min. later I look at my PC and he is Deleting all my E-mail accounts, I get back on phone and call he says I was frauding Google and would return my Email acc. after
 I OK check.&nbsp; I remembered I have Office 365 so I call them, Microsoft gets in my PC and removes Malwarebites so he cant get back in then Microsoft then restores everything. Microsoft said they had no right to remove anything !! So just wanted to let everyone
 know they were trying to hold my E-MAIL Hostage till I gave them 299.00 !! Person I was in contact with at Malwarebites was Ricky 143, His supervisor was John!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank You, for your time..</p>

 does not provide that kind of support and they do not offer product packages for $299.00 for 5 year protection. Malwarebytes offers a 1 Year Subscription for a fee of $39.99 per year. They also have a 2 Year Subscripion with a 25% discount which you cancel

            1. You may login to Windows with a new user profile and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
2. Review the following thread - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/cannot-open-some-office-files-after-upgrading-from/c103ee49-2e87-4421-ad96-f433ec77ec54<br />

Windows 10 is causing some issues with Office/Excel. Some of the issues are resolved by disabling a new function of the .net installation that comes with Windows 10 and Visual Studio 2015. This feature can be disabled with a registry entry.<br />
To create the entry, run PowerShell with administrator privileges (open the Start menu, enter PowerShell in find box, right-click on PowerShell and select ""Run as administrator"". Enter the following command to add the registry entry:<br />
Set-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\.NETFramework -Name useLegacyJit -Type DWord -Value 1<br />
You can copy the above line and paste it into PowerShell by clicking on the top left part of the PowerShell window title bar and selecting Edit-&gt;Paste. Press ENTER to run the command.<br />
<br />
4. Read the response of Try*3 &nbsp;(http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-excel/windows-10-excel-files-changed-to-read-only/cba3c358-21b5-472d-b5e2-f690f1b0a49b). He has provided a link which also has solutions for problems.<br />
<br />
5. If above don't, re-installation of office may solve your problem. Make sure that you have license keys ready before you attempt re-installation."<br />

<h2>            Wi-Fi not responding &#47; unable to connect Lumia 1020 to Wifi</h2>
                    <p>I am yet another one that is exposed to the issue where suddenly Windows Phone is unable to connect to an already existing Wi-Fi network.</p>
<p>Same deal as lots, and lots of other users have complaints about:</p>
<p>All other devices, Pc's, Ipads, Iphones, Cameras are working without any issues.</p>
<p>The Phone can connect to lots of other Wifi nets - so the wifi&nbsp;HW&nbsp;itself is working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lumia 1020 (Nokia909)</p>
<p>OS 8.10.14226.359 </p>
<p>Firmware 3051.50009.1451.1003</p>
<p>Hardware: 4.4.0.2</p>
<p>Radio software 3.2.0.4059.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried restarting phone, accesspoint, deleting/re-creating manually on the phone&nbsp;- the usual deal for t-shooting these kinds of problem</p>
<p>- Exactly like all the other users have seen and done!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have now had this issue for almost a&nbsp;year now, on both my home network, company network and a guest network in the building where I work.
</p>
<p>Factory resetting the phone works - at least for a while - then it happens again, either&nbsp;on&nbsp; the same network or another one.</p>
<p>Having done this a number of times, needing to re-install apps - re-enrolling to corporate net etc., I am getting more and more frustrated having to do this, due to what so obvious seems to be a bug in the software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going through this forum, I see MS support sending users of in all kinds of timewasting directions. ending up with "You need to factory reset your phone"</p>
<p>It simply cannot be the only solution that Microsoft offers. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to fix this guys - You wonder why you dont sell more phones?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Steven W.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on&nbsp;the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you're having difficulties in relation to connecting your Lumia 1020&nbsp;to variety of WiFi networks.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your experience the built in Reset function resolves the issue temporarily.<br />
Thank you for trying&nbsp;this troubleshooting step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is one more process that I would advise to try in your case.</p>
<p>It is another type of Reset but much more throughout one.</p>
<p>What you could try is to fully reinstall your phone's Operating System and it's Firmware, with the use of specifically designed&nbsp;for that purpose tool, Lumia Software Recovery Tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will find the&nbsp;Lumia Software Recovery Tool's download link in the lower part of the web site :</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/support/faq/?topic=FA142987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/support/faq/?topic=FA142987</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Lumia Software Recovery Tool, just like built in Reset will wipe the content of the phone.<br />
Please create a backup before processing.<br />
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/settings-and-personalization/back-up-my-stuff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/settings-and-personalization/back-up-my-stuff</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please bare in mind, than within the process, Lumia Software Recovery Tool will need to download a substantial amount of data (3-4GB).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If&nbsp;after&nbsp;processing the advised,&nbsp;the issue persists, this would be an indicator of hardware issue and as such your phone might&nbsp;need servicing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this will help in your situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Marek&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Marek,</p>
<p>And thanks for taking your time to respond.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am familiar with the Software recovery tool, and&nbsp; I did try this on my 920 that I had before this 1020 I have now.</p>
<p>It still happened to me 2 or 3 times on that phone. Even after I did a re-install with the recovery tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The exact same issue: that I just one day am unable to reconnect to my wifi as described above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since starting this thread, I have performed a hard reset - yet once more going through connecting up all accounts/apps, loosing all the pictures (again) on the phone. And it did fix the problem - again. Now I'm just waiting for it to happen again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can reset the phone with this tool, and I am sure that it will also work. But this is my point,</p>
<p>I can go on and on resetting to fix this issue - But I dont want to keep doing so. Ideally I'd want someone from MS to sort out the issue - or find a solution other than resetting your phone to remedy from it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having seen this issue now on 2 phones, with a variety of software versions, on different wifi networks, I am convinced there is something in the wifi software that just is not doing what it was supposed to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look through the forums here and elsewhere, there are quite a lot of other users with the exact same issue - all being adviced to do a reset. Please escalate this so we can gain some trust of the stability in Lumia Windows Phones.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>/Steven</p>

<h3> maria rtraska  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fix-it 50535 failed, didn&#39;t remove Microsoft Security Essentials</h2>
                    The error message said the antimalware service couldn't be stopped, but I'm logged in as the administrator.&nbsp; Now I'm stuck in a loop and can't remove the software!!&nbsp; Worse, it's interfering with ZoneAlarm, which works fine without Security Essentials.&nbsp;
 If my hard disc hadn't crashed and needed to be replaced, the tech who did that wouldn't have installed security essentials in the first place, and I wouldn't have this problem.&nbsp; But now I'm stuck and the Fix-it isn't fixing anything.&nbsp; How do I get the Fix-it
 to recognize that I'm the administrator and remove Security Essentials???&nbsp; I'm not an IT person, so please don't redirect me to a long, complicated procedure to do this myself -- that's what the Fix-it was supposed to help me avoid.<br />
<br />
I have Windows 7 with Microsoft Security Essentials 4.1.522.0.&nbsp; Tell me this can be removed.<br />

            Okay, that mostly solved it.&nbsp; Here's the process I followed:<br />
<p><b>Use our FixIt Tool to uninstall Microsoft Security Essentials.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>This tool is designed to fix un-installation issues like, MSE registry issues, removes remnants of Microsoft Security Essentials from your computer.</b></p>
<p>a. To do this run the FixIt tool from the following links.</p>
<p>b. Click the below link and select&nbsp;<b>Run Now</b>&nbsp;button.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/Program_Install_and_Uninstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/Program_Install_and_Uninstall</a></p>
<p>c. After downloading and running for the first time</p>
<p>d. Select&nbsp;<b>Run&nbsp;</b>on small<b>&nbsp;</b>pop-up window and select&nbsp;<b>Run&nbsp;</b>on Internet Explorer-Security Warning Window.</p>
<p>e. Select&nbsp;<b>Detect problems and let me select the files to apply.</b></p>
<p>f. Select&nbsp;<b>Uninstalling.</b></p>
<p>g. After detecting problems Select&nbsp;<b>Microsoft Security Client</b>&nbsp;to uninstall and click&nbsp;<b>Next.</b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>From there on, however, I diverged from the instructions:&nbsp; when Fix-it told me the problem had been solved and asked me whether I wanted to try uninstalling again or try other fixes, I chose try uninstalling ... and it did.&nbsp; I didn't have to go back and
 run Fix-it again to do the thing with the Antimalware separately: it was all taken care of in one step.&nbsp; So this time, the Fix-it worked! YAAAAAAAAAY!!!&nbsp; Now I'll reboot, try to run Zone Alarm and see if it's really true ...&nbsp; and if it didn't, I'll be baaaaaack
 ...<br />
