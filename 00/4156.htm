<h2>            Connected Phone Identification</h2>
                    Will it be better if the connected phone in My Phone website can show it name (About-&gt;Device Id)? You may want to say I can add add a phone number to identify the phone. But once I sync with two phones, I have no idea which one is which one. All display

<h2>            File specific actions for improving Excel performance</h2>
                    <p><strong>Description:<br />
</strong>This article goes through some actions that can be taken with&nbsp;any typical Excel file,&nbsp;and are more or less guaranteed to speed it up. For a shorter version of the below, please refer to
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3070372/how-to-clean-up-an-excel-workbook-so-that-it-uses-less-memory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>. The below are ordered based on their relevance, with the most powerful and simple ideas first.</p>
<p><strong><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;XLSB format</strong><br />
If your file size mainly comes from a&nbsp;big amount of formulas and text in cells (and not pictures etc.), this format can compress your file heavily. With such a text based file, saving it in the .XLSB format could result in a file size of less than 50%, opening/saving
 time less than 50%, and heavily reduced memory usage during opening and handling. This comes with almost no tradeoff and thus, is why it is put at the top of this list.</p>
<p>To try this, just click File – Save as, and choose the Excel Binary .XLSB file format instead. Then compare opening time and file size with the original file.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/66763e81-2a3c-42ce-9fe8-2766303e97a6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/66763e81-2a3c-42ce-9fe8-2766303e97a6" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><br />
2.&nbsp;Excessive amounts of Shapes</strong><br />
A simple way to see what objects exist inside a sheet is to go to the Home tab, and to the furthest right you have “Find &amp; Select”, and “Selection Pane”:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/563d0f23-02cb-4e39-9efc-63c96d89b090" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/563d0f23-02cb-4e39-9efc-63c96d89b090" /></a></p>
<p>Then, you can click on the first sheet, hold down the Ctrl key, and press PgDn or PgUp repeatedly to quickly scroll through all the sheets.</p>
<p><em>(It is also possible, but not that likely, that you have Hidden (or even Very Hidden) sheets with excessive Shapes. Pressing Alt+F11 and pressing F4 will reveal what the “Visible” property is set to, for the sheet that you click on in the dropdown list
 to the left)</em></p>
<p>If you see a sheet with several hundred shapes or a lot more shapes than you would expect, it makes sense to reduce the number of shapes to check if it makes any difference for the file performance. To delete all shapes, clicking “Go To Special…” in the
 screenshot below, choosing “Objects”, and pressing Delete on the keyboard:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/36258aa6-aeff-45a6-b2f9-247e166a3ae6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/36258aa6-aeff-45a6-b2f9-247e166a3ae6" /></a><br />
<br />
<em>(If there are so many shapes to be found in the Selection Pane that you cannot select and delete them, one possible workaround is always to first close Excel, then rename the file from .XLSX to .ZIP in Windows, open the .ZIP file, open the subfolder XL,
 open the folder Drawings, and delete the big files in there. This will cause Excel to repair the file. Please note that this will also delete other shapes, and may have the undesired side effects of data loss as you may lose valid objects too, or other content,
 so use it with caution.)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>3.&nbsp;Remove Styles that addins have added, that you don’t need</strong><br />
If you click the “Home” tab and go to the Styles group, you can click the small button “More”.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0fa67b8e-4307-456c-be57-0e8728a36a2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0fa67b8e-4307-456c-be57-0e8728a36a2f" /></a><br />
The default for new Excel files is just 47 styles.&nbsp;Therefore, if you in this dropdown can&nbsp;see a big mess with what looks like a huge amount of duplicates, probably some add-in must have added them. This can cause performance issues. It could be a good idea
 to clean them up in your file, resetting them to only use the Default Ones, plus the ones that you actually are using at the moment.</p>
<p>To do this, download <a href="http://removestyles.codeplex.com/downloads/get/343633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this addin</a>. This will add a button called “Remove Styles” next to the above mentioned “Styles” window:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/944b0006-6557-4ea1-bed5-636e679b1440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/944b0006-6557-4ea1-bed5-636e679b1440" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The button shows how many Styles there are in the file at the moment. As seen above, there were 55429 Styles. After clicking that button, then saving and reopening the file (important), we now only see the Microsoft Built-in Styles, which are 47 in total,
 plus the amount you were actually using, which&nbsp;usually&nbsp;will not&nbsp;go above 15.</p>
<p><em>For experts: You can also run ?activeworkbook.styles.count to&nbsp;quickly see&nbsp;the amount of styles.</em><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>4.&nbsp;VLOOKUPs and other formulas referring to full columns</strong><br />
Check your VLOOKUPs and similar formulas, e.g. by pressing Ctrl+F to search in Excel, and write an equal sign =.
<em>(You may also want to choose "Options" and "Look in: Workbook" to look at the whole workbook at the same time.)</em> Since Excel formulas (usually) start with an equal sign, this will find you all formulas. If you can see that they are referring to a full
 column, they may be slower than needed. Instead of simply referring to something like “A:B”, you can refer to something like “A1:B5000” instead. This may sound like a small change, but this 2nd reference is actually 200 times smaller than the 1st (since Excel
 has 1 million rows) and should be faster to calculate. You can read more in the section “Formula” from
<a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/the_microsoft_excel_support_team_blog/2012/12/18/top-10-list-of-performance-issues-in-excel-workbooks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>, or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa730921(v=office.12).aspx#Office2007excelPerf_BigGridIncreasedLimitsExcel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;Used Ranges</strong><br />
Make sure that your workbook is only using the cells that you actually need. See this example below from a workbook that had set a table to be
<strong>=$1:$20</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2923ab37-424d-4b66-bce8-a8c6c6a53ca0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2923ab37-424d-4b66-bce8-a8c6c6a53ca0" /></a></p>
<p>You might think that you just asked it to use 20 rows, and you indeed did, but you also asked it to use every column of those rows, and in e.g. XLSX format, that means 16384 columns. See&nbsp;above how a seemingly simple table stretches all the way to the right
 to the XFD column, the last one in Excel.</p>
<p>If you instead of the above use this table definition…<br />
<strong>=$A1:$Z20</strong><br />
…your table will be 8000 times smaller, which is a great thing from a performance perspective.</p>
<p><br />
Even if you don't have a table stretching all the way down or to the right, the Last Cells in your sheets&nbsp;may be much further to the right and/or down than you would expect. This can be checked by pressing Ctrl+End in each sheet. Read more about how to reset
 that under Step 6 <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_excel-msoffice_custom-mso_2016/common-excel-performance-issues-and-solutions/0205f4b4-a10c-43c5-ae8f-140b77bdee91">
here</a>.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp;Conditional Formats</strong><br />
If your file has a huge amount of CFs listed under “Home” tab – “Conditional Formatting” – “Manage Rules”, it may be very slow to work in. You can use the roll bar at the top with the arrow keys to go through your sheets. In the picture below, we can see a
 scrollbar to the right, indicating a very long list:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ebe3bcb0-9628-4fec-8f68-a60c54cf0946" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ebe3bcb0-9628-4fec-8f68-a60c54cf0946" /></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you notice any delay whatsoever when moving between different sheets in the "Show formatting rules for:" dialogue in the screenshot above, this is an indication that you should clean them up. Redesigning these to have much fewer rules, and each of them referring
 to a full range instead of individual cells, can provide a very big performance difference. It may be some work to redesign this, so you may want to test “Home” tab – “Conditional Formats” – “Clear Rules” – “Clear Rules from Entire Sheet”, just to test that
 it really makes a performance gain, before you start redesigning them.</p>
<p><br />
<em>(Wait, how did my file get thousands of Conditional Formats? </em><em>This can happen if you Copy and Paste excessively. Most people don't consider that when they copy paste information, they may also copy CFs and other formatting. If you have experienced
 this issue in a file and want to minimize the chance of it happening again&nbsp;going forward, see
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3114374/december-8-2015-update-for-excel-2016-kb3114374" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a>: “When you copy and paste cells that have conditional formatting set in Excel 2016, the conditional formatting rules are duplicated even though the rules already exist in the cells” with a reg key called ReplaceCFOnPaste mentioned in this article that&nbsp;you
 may want to set. This will prevent most of these issues in new files, but it will not clean up&nbsp;CFs&nbsp;in&nbsp;existing files)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp;Controlling calculation mode, and volatile functions:</strong><br />
-Sometimes, a single “=TODAY()” formula at the top of a sheet that is used in the calculation chain can render a complete workbook volatile, causing each data entry to perform a calculation. More info:<br />
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/bb687891.aspx#sectionSection2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/bb687891.aspx#sectionSection2</a><br />
<a href="http://www.decisionmodels.com/calcsecretsi.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.decisionmodels.com/calcsecretsi.htm</a><br />
-Changing the calculation mode from Automatic to Manual under Formula - Calculation Options, and then trigger it manually with e.g. F9 only when needed in this workbook, can also provide the breathing room that your file needs for becoming acceptable to work
 with.<br />
-Keeping historical data as formulas can both risk the data accuracy, AND slow down the file. All data that should never be changed can be copied, and then “Paste Special –&nbsp; values only”, to convert&nbsp;your old formulas&nbsp;into static values.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>8. Broken links</strong></p>
<p>Usually, broken links don't cause issues with file performance, but it can definitely happen and&nbsp;you may still want to clean them up to improve the file health. To clean them up, you can check your “Data” tab - ”Edit Links” dialogue, and check for links
 that point to e.g. the C:\ drive:<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/770c12be-63a5-4d93-91ec-ba8aff063cff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/770c12be-63a5-4d93-91ec-ba8aff063cff" /></a><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><br />
As seen in "Location",&nbsp;what is selected is a&nbsp;link pointing to&nbsp;a local C:\ drive. This may be intentional if you are the only one working on this file, but usually it is not intended and when the file is sent to another computer, the linked file will not exist.
 If other users might open these files, you would probably want to correct those links before that, or remove them.<br />
</p>
<p><em><br />
(You can also click “Startup Prompt” in the Screenshot above, and make a choice in the menu that pops up, if you don’t want to see a prompt to update links whenever you open this file.</em></p>
<p><em>You can also break any links that are obviously wrong or not needed with “Break Link”. If you want to do this but find that nothing happens when you&nbsp;try, the link is most likely inside a Defined Name, see&nbsp;the section&nbsp;below)</em><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
<strong>9. Defined Names</strong></p>
<p>Defined Names usually don't cause problems with performance, but you may still want to clean them up to improve the file health. You can find the Name Manager in “Formulas” tab – “Name Manager”. Here is an example from a file:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e927026-f10d-485f-b2e2-579b9deb6ac3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e927026-f10d-485f-b2e2-579b9deb6ac3" /></a></p>
<p>As seen, there are very many names that have “#REF!”, a reference error, in the “Refers to” column. These are very likely not in use any more, and should be deleted/corrected. Even ones that only have “#REF!” as part of the “Refers To” column should be deleted/corrected.
 There may also be ones that only have “#REF!” in the “Value” column, those can probably also be removed, but be more careful with removing those.</p>
<p><br />
Defined Names can also&nbsp;be hidden. If you suspect there are, you can remove them with the File – Info – Check for issues – Inspect - Document Inspector, or code like
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/119826" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a>.</p>

            Hello ShahajiNalawade,
<br />
<br />Thank you for your patience.
<br />
<br />I am pleased to inform you that Outlook.com has fully completed its deployment of the fix that had impacted service availability for some users in the infrastructure and there should be no more service interruption now.
<br />
<br />See: <a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/servicestatus</a>
<br />
<br />In case it is still not working for you, it could be a browser-related issue.
<br />
<br />May I suggest you to delete your Microsoft/Outlook.com cookies and clear browser caches then restart the browser? 
<br />
<br />- selectively deleting browser cookies

<h2>            Editing a theme on Office 365 for Excel on Mac</h2>
                    <p>So I'm trying to customize Excel as I just got Office 365 a few days ago and I'm not seeing the option to edit Colors as indicated by this Microsoft article:&nbsp;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Change-a-theme-and-make-it-the-default-in-Word-or-Excel-C846F997-968E-4DAA-B2D4-42BD2AFEF904</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this no longer supported or not supported on a Mac?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read up on the differences between mac and windows and this was never listed. &nbsp;While not a deal breaker naturally I'm unable to set it up the way I use Excel at work and it would have been nice to have seen a list of what truly doesn't carry over to the
 Mac from the windows side assuming this isn't a glitch or something on my end.</p>

            <p>It isn't a matter of "no longer" it's a matter of "never was" :-) The article you read applies only to the Windows versions of Office... Note the
<em>Applies To</em> disclaimer at the bottom of the article. It's easy to overlook to begin with, but is even more deceptive &amp; confusing because the most recent versions for both OS X &amp; Windows have been dubbed "Office 2016" even though feature
<em>dis</em>parity continues to be a reality known to everyone but Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Mac Office you can create custom Theme Colors only in PowerPoint. They will then be available in the other programs. There's no provision for creating custom Theme Fonts. In order to go any further custom Themes, Colors &amp; Fonts can be created on a PC,
 then brought over to Mac Office or you can write your own if you're proficient with XML.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Custom Themes can be saved from any of the programs using the built-in Theme Fonts as well as Custom or built-in Theme Colors. Those are then available in each of the other programs but cannot be set as a default Theme. In order to use any Theme as a 'default'
 you'd need to create a <em>template</em> with that Theme applied, then generate new documents from the template.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 dirsync, adfs source IP addresses</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
We have had our internal domain connected with o365 by some consultants. This functions fine with our own Azure AD Connect and ADFS servers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now we are moving to a new ISP, and we'll be getting new IP addresses. What I can't find out is if there is a setting on o365 that limits the IP addresses that the traffic can come from. I want to make sure the DirSync and adfs traffic isn't limited to our
 current external IP addresses that will change. I know I'll have to change the DNS entries that specify these hosts to o365.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google was not helpful with trying to figure this out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>There are no related settings in Office 365 cloud. Generally, if you use Azure Active Directory, you can
</span><span>use the Conditional Access. The conditions include Sign-in risk, Device platforms, locations, and Client apps. Here is a reference:</span></p>

<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If you have on-premise ADFS servers, you can limit Access based on the location of the clients. You may need to create related claim rules. You can check the steps in the link below if it meets your requreiments:</span></p>

<p>Otherwise, it could be Outlook's counting bug and you won't actually be sending out 2 messages. The counting bug makes it look like it is adding an additional outgoing message for each additional account that you have configured. So in your case; Do you
 have 2 accounts configured in Outlook?</p>
<p>In some circumstances, updating Outlook with the latest Service Pack and updates will fix the issue. In some cases,
<a href="http://www.howto-outlook.com/faq/newprofile.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">recreating your mail profile</a> does the trick. However, the issue could still return.</p>
<p>If you have verified that you indeed don't have a stuck message, then it is safe to ignore it as it is only a visual bug.</p>

            3GB is extremely large - chances are it won't fit in your pc's memory, and if it does, there's probably not enough free memory left to do anything with it. You'll most likely have to use an application that processes the file in smaller chunks.

    <title>N95 All keys lock up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terry1738  say:</h3>
<h2>            N95 All keys lock up</h2>
                    I am in Australia with vodaphone.<br />
<br />
Have had an N95 for 6 months and apart from my first N95 being replaced have had no problems and am very impressed with the phone.<br />
<br />
The night before last I put the phone on charge and at 2AM for no reason it started playing ABBA on the MP3 player.<br />
<br />
I found all the keys where locked except the off button so I switched it off and on but it was still jammed and insisted on playing the MP3 player which would not have been to bad except it choose ABBA again.<br />
<br />
The next morning I took it to the Vodaphone store to see if they had seen the problem where, of course, it preformed faultlessly<br />
<br />
So I went to work and again for no reason, embarasingly, it started playing ABBA in just about every meeting I went to and the keys were jammed.<br />
<br />
After a few switch ons and offs it worked again but alas this morning it is jammed again.<br />
<br />
I updated the phone 2 months ago to the then latest software edition which I cant remember the number and cant get into the phone to find out.<br />
<br />
I have removed the sim battery and SD card and restarted the phone without the sd card and without the sim but it refuses to unlock the keys (even though the "unlocked" message appears when I slide it open) and continues to play ABBA when the SD card is in.<br />
<br />
Any assistance would be appreciated especially if it can change my N95's fetish for ABBA.<br />
<br />
Cheers Terry

            Hi terry1738<br />
<br />
I have a suggestion for you but unfortunately it would lead to loss of data on phone.<br />
<br />
Take the battery out for 5 minutes and then replace and see if makes any difference.<br />
<br />
If not try the 3 finger reset which is depress these three keys simultaneously "*" "3" "green phone" and then power on phone whilst keeping those three keys depressed until "country" screen appears.

<p>Hi Wendy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the reasons why you're experiencing this issue when sending calendar invites from your Outlook account can be due to your message format. How the message appears to the person receiving it depends on their email program. If the recipient's email program
 is set to convert messages, for example, then a message or calendar invites you send formatted as HTML could be converted to plain text or may appear as not readable on their end. For us to be able to provide you the most appropriate assistance, we need additional
 information regarding your concern. Kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Do you have other email address from Outlook? Can you try to send a calendar invite and check if the issue is still the same?</li><li>Which message format are you using?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For more information regarding message format, refer to this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Change-the-message-format-to-HTML-Rich-Text-Format-or-plain-text-338a389d-11da-47fe-b693-cf41f792fefa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support article</a>. Should the message format be under <strong>Rich Text Format (RTF)</strong>, kindly change it to
<strong>Plain text</strong> to make it work on all email programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye for your response.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I would like to know more information about the issue to assist you better. Please provide us the following information:</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>Try running the Internet&nbsp;Explorer Performance troubleshooter to fix the problem. It checks for common issues, such as whether you have enough space on your computer's hard disk to store temporary Internet files. Refer the steps below to run that:<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>1. Press <strong>Windows + R</strong>, type<strong> control panel </strong>and click
<strong>Ok</strong>.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Type <span><strong>troubleshooter </strong>in the search box of the Control Panel</span>, and then click

<span><strong>Internet Explorer Performance</strong></span>. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>Run the Microsoft Fixit as it diagnoses and repairs&nbsp;Internet Explorer&nbsp;problems that make it slow, not secure, unstable or crash, caused by add-ons not working or inappropriate security settings.
</p>
<p><strong>Fix Internet Explorer issues to make IE fast, safe and stable</strong></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Automatic disabling of DEP depends on what configuration has been set in Boot.ini file, and it also depends on the application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please check what Configuration value has been set in the “Boot.ini” file (boot configuration file).There are actually 4 global configurations for DEP. The ‘Boot.ini’ file switches are as follows:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>/noexecute=Configuration_Value </li></ul>
<p>There are four options to this switch: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>OptIn:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></li></ol>
<p>This setting is the default configuration. On systems with processors that can implement hardware-enforced DEP, DEP is enabled by default for limited system binaries and programs that "opt-in." With this option, only Windows system binaries are covered by
 DEP by default.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>OptOut: </li></ol>
<p>DEP is enabled by default for all processes. You can manually create a list of specific programs that do not have DEP applied by using the System dialog box in Control Panel. Information technology (IT) professionals can use the Application Compatibility
 Toolkit to "opt-out" one or more programs from DEP protection. System compatibility fixes, or shims, for DEP do take effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>AlwaysOn:</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This setting provides full DEP coverage for the whole system. All processes always run with DEP applied. The exceptions list to exempt specific programs from DEP protection is not available. System compatibility fixes for DEP do not take effect. Programs
 that have been opted-out by using the Application Compatibility Toolkit run with DEP applied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>AlwaysOff:</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This setting does not provide any DEP coverage for any part of the system, regardless of hardware DEP support. The processor does not run in PAE mode unless the /PAE option is present in the Boot.ini file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To modify the DEP Value and ‘TurnON DEP’ globally, we must edit the ‘Boot.ini’ file.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To know more on DEP and editing the boot.ini configuration, please refer the article:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes the disabling of DEP also causes due to some applications. </p>

    <title>Can not find .exe files for DEP setting. Please help&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> midmccoy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can not find .exe files for DEP setting. Please help&#33;</h2>
                    I am having a terrible time with my DEP settingss. When I click on certain links or buttons it shuts down my Internet Explorer and gives me the DEP error message. I am trying to add the pages to the list to keep them from shutting down on me but I am unsure
 as to how to do this. Here are the steps I have done and in bold is the one that I am having trouble with...<br />
<br />
<p><span><em>c. b. If you choose to protect all programs, you can still turn off DEP for individual programs.
</em></span></p>
<p><em><span>d. If you suspect that a program does not run correctly when DEP is turned on, check for a DEP-compatible version of the program or an update from the
 software publisher before you change any DEP settings.<br />
</span><br />
e. However, the steps below tells you how to Turn off Data Execution Prevention [DEP]:</em></p>
<p><span><em>1.&nbsp; Open System by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking System.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>2.&nbsp; Click Advanced System Settings.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>3.&nbsp; Under Performance, click Settings.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>4.&nbsp; Click the Data Execution Prevention tab, and then click Turn on DEP for all programs and services except those I select.</em></span></p>
<p><em>f. &nbsp;<span>To turn off DEP for an individual program:</span></em></p>
<p><span><em>1. Select the check box next to the program that you want to turn off DEP for and then click OK.</em></span></p>
<p><span><strong><em>2. If the program is not in the list, click Add. Browse to the Program Files folder, find the executable file for the program (it will have an
 .exe file extension) and then click Open.<br />
<br />
</em></strong>Ok so I don't know how to find the right file to put on the list. Here is an example for you and this is only one of the ones I am having trouble with...<br />
<br />
I go on ebay and try to list an item for sale. When I click on the button to upload a picture to my ad my page shuts down and the DEP error comes up. So how do I find the right file for this problem? I do not see any flies with .exe on the end and espically
 not any that are associated with ebay. And as I said Ebay is only one of the places I am having this problem!<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me??? I am going crazy here trying to fix this and can get no help from anyone anywhere.<br />
<br />
<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You should try to determine which ADD-ON is causing the issue (or BHO). Use the rest of the troubleshooter.<br />
<br />
Using regular IE - Tools - Manage Add-ons - you can disable them until you find which is causing it - and<br />
also check with BHOremover for unwanted BHO's (any you did not add are most suspect).<br />
<br />
Hope this help.s<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
EricLaw's IEInternals - A look at Internet Explorer from the inside out. - Understanding DEP/NX<br />
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ieinternals/archive/2009/10/10/Understanding-Data-Execution-Prevention-Crashes-in-IE8.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://blogs.msdn.com/ieinternals/archive/2009/10/10/Understanding-Data-Execution-Prevention-Crashes-in-IE8.aspx</span></a><br />
<br />
The problem might actually be an addon or other program causing the problem and you
<br />
should check that 1st.<br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security product do you have on machine? Include any you have
<br />
EVER had on this machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which
<br />
can cause strange issues).<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs&nbsp;- Accessores - System Tools - IE with no Addons - does this work better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore then click Reset - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security - Reset all Zones to default level - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
any better?<br />
<br />
Close&nbsp;IE and then try IE and/or IE with no Addons<br />
<br />
IE - Tools&nbsp;- Manage Addons (for sure disable SSV2 if it is there, this is no longer needed but
<br />
Java still installs it and it causes issues - you ever update Java go back in and disable it again.)
<br />
Look for other possible problems.<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - Tools - Software Explorer - look for issues with programs that do not look
<br />
right. Permitted are usually OK and "not permitted" are not always bad. If in doubt about a
<br />
program ask about it here.<br />
<br />
Could be a BHO - BHOremover - Free - standalone program, needs no install, download and
<br />
run - not all are bad however some can cause your issue. (Toolbars are BHO's)<br />
<a href="http://securityxploded.com/bhoremover.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://securityxploded.com/bhoremover.php</span></a><br />

<br />
Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that would
<br />
be unusual with Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie (no big deal), UPDATE it
<br />
and then run it as a scanner. <br />
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</a><br />
<br />
I would add prevx as well.<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security
<br />
programs. This is a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here
<br />
or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />

<br />
Do yourself a big favor and work through the above 1st.<br />
<br />
How to control DEP however I do not recommend turning it off and certainly not leaving it off.<br />
<br />

<br />
====================================<br />
<br />
If nothing else works you can try this however I would use as last resort.<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Options - Security Section - uncheck Enable Memory<br />
Protection to Mitigate OnLine Attacks - APPLY - OK&nbsp;&nbsp; Close and Restart IE<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed with the troubleshooting steps, I would like to know some information about this issue.</p>
<p>1. Have you installed all the updates other than the build-9860?</p>
<p>2. Have you connected any external devices other than mouse and keyboard?</p>
<p>3. Have you installed any third party security software on your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try the following methods and check if it works for you.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>If you have connected any external devices other than mouse and keyboard, then try disconnecting it and check if you are able to install the update or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Before install the Build-9860 update, try installing all the updates other than this and then restart the computer. Once after restarting the computer, try installing the build-9860 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>If you have installed any third party security software on your computer, then try disabling it and then try to install the update and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><span><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Disable Antivirus\Firewall temporarily and then check for the issue. Sometime they<br />
might conflict. Please make sure that you enable the antivirus software\firewall after performing the test to keep your computer protected.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply with the status of the issue so that we can help you better.</p>

<p>
</p><p>because I have the same Error-Message as Andrew, I will answer your questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1:</p>
<p>I have an Acer Iconia W510 Tablet with an Keyboard-Dockingstation. I've tried both connected and disconnected (no other devices attached), but the error comes up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I've installed all the updates provided by the windows update a couple of days ago and restarted, no success</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I had installed Bitdefender Internet Security 2014 and uninstalled it for testing the update, but no success either</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, </p>

            <p>hi baith,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same phenomenon as the other 2. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I have the machine attached to a mechanical KVM switch&nbsp; with 1 wireless mouse &amp; Keyboard, as well as a wired keyboard and mouse. There is also a USB Bluetooth adapter attached. Since the original d/led build installed with this configuration, can I safely
 assume the updated build should also install w/ the same configuration?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I have installed all updates that were found by the "Windows Update" applet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) only Windows defender and Firewall is on the machine. To clarify; are you suggesting shutting off Windows Firewall &amp; windows Defender to test if the new build will install? Or. only 3rd party AV &amp; Firewall?<br />

            <p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are still facing the same issue, then I suggest you to reset Windows Update Components and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Follow the steps to reset Windows Update Components:</p>
<p>a. Open a command prompt. To do this, use one of the following methods, depending on your version of Windows:</p>
<p>From the Start screen, swipe in from the right side to display the charms, select
<strong>Search</strong>, and then search for <strong>cmd</strong>. (Or, if you are using a keyboard and mouse, type
<span>cmd</span> at the Start screen.) In the search results, press-and-hold or right-click
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.
</p>
<p>b. Stop the BITS service, the Windows Update service, and the Cryptographic service. To do this, at a command prompt, type the following commands. Make sure that you press Enter after you type each command.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>net stop bits</strong></span></li><li><span><strong>net stop wuauserv</strong></span></li><li><span><strong>net stop appidsvc</strong></span></li><li><span><strong>net stop cryptsvc</strong></span></li></ul>
c. Delete the qmgr*.dat files. To do this, at a command prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:
<p><span><strong>Del "%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Application Data\Microsoft\Network\Downloader\qmgr*.dat"</strong></span></p>
<p><span>d. </span>If this is your first attempt at resolving your Windows Update issues by following the steps in this article, you should skip step 4 and go to step 5. You should follow step 4 at this point in the troubleshooting only if you cannot resolve
 your Windows Update issues after you follow all steps except step 4. (Step 4 is performed by the "Aggressive" mode of the Fix it Solution that was mentioned earlier.)</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Rename the software distribution folders backup copies. To do this, at a command prompt, type the following commands. Make sure that you press Enter after you type each command.
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak</strong></span></li><li><span><strong>Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak</strong></span></li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p><span>e. </span>Restart the BITS service, the Windows Update service, and the Cryptographic service. To do this, at a command prompt, type the following commands. Make sure that you press Enter after you type each command.</p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>net start bits</strong></span></li><li><span><strong>net start wuauserv</strong></span></li><li><span><strong>net start appidsvc</strong></span></li><li><span><strong>net start cryptsvc</strong></span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>f. Restart the computer and then check for the Build-9860 update.</span></p>

                    So who's at fault, Microsoft or Amazon? Will windows 10 mobile, have any kind of plug-in? I thought Microsoft phones made up at least 30% of the phone market. Why is amazon hurting it's own market share.

<h3> lindalowman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost document</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded free app for word to my iPad. I started composing a rather in depth historical document which I worked on for 4-5 days. Each time I opened word the document appeared. No problem. I never did name the document but word was saving it constantly.
 Today I tried to use app but it was frozen. I reset iPad, still no document and word still frozen. I installed upgrade to my ipad 8.1.2 I think. After download complete word is working perfectly but the document is not there. The thought of re-researching
 all this material is painful. Help!</p>

            <p>This has nothing to do with SharePoint server or Filter packs - in fact, I don't even know what those things are.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I am doing: File/Info/Document Properties/Show Document Panel, and insert keyword(s) in the keyword box.&nbsp; (Or alternatively, 'Save As' and inserting a tag in the box at the bottom of the window, which then appears in Document Properties as a
 keyword.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the search box at the top RH corner of Windows Explorer I search the folder for documents with the same keyword, but I only get one result, even though I know there are several files in the folder with this keyword.</p>
<p>I'm sure this is not the way it's supposed to work, otherwise there would be no point in having keywords at all.</p>

            <p>I don't think it is possible to have Windows Explorer search the metadata (such as keywords) that you enter in the file properties. To find out for certain, you may want to ask in a Windows forum instead. For example, go to

<h2>            Pivot table field list too large to work with in Excel 2016</h2>
                    I use pivot tables frequently. &nbsp;However, I have switched recently to Office 2016 and the pivot table field list is too large to be able to work with when I am working on my work laptop. &nbsp;In other words, I can not access the items in the table to move them
 in or out of the main filter, the columns, or the rows. &nbsp;I have also tried experimenting with resolution, but nothing works. Any solutions please?
