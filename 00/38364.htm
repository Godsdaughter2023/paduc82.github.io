            Hi hemantkansagra 
<br />
<br />Most likely you are logged into a Temporary Profile . . .
<br />
<br />Before you do anything or move any files around
<br />
<br />Restart (not shut down) your PC 4 times in a row, this will fix this issue a lot of the time . .. 
<br />
<br />Otherwise: 
<br />
<br />Please open Windows File Explorer 
<br />Navigate to C:\Users 
<br />Do you see a user folder that look like yours?
<br />Open that folder and check inside Pictures, Documents . . . etc. and see if your files are there 
<br />
<br />If your files are there: 
<br />
<br />Create a new user profile with Admin privileges 
<br />Log into the new user profile 
<br />Copy all your data from the old profile to the new profile (Documents Library, Pictures Library . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />If you still have not found your files, look for a Windows.old folder on your C Drive, expand that to open the users folder contained inside - check there for your files, icons . . .etc. 
<br />
<br />If you do find your files . . . etc. there, copy them out as soon as possible as Windows will remove the Windows.old folder in time
<br />
<br />NOTE VERY IMPORTANT: Do Not copy your files into the Temporary profile you are currently in, when the situation is corrected, your files will be deleted with the Temporary Profile and will not be recoverable !!

    <title>2 mysteries- date of update and base system device - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            2 mysteries- date of update and base system device</h2>
                    <p>I recently completely reset my computer, reinstalling the operating system from a dvd.&nbsp; I reinstalled windows 8, then upgraded to windows 10, and I am wondering about the date of updates.&nbsp; Why is it that the following updates are listed as being installed
 several months ago, 4/27/2016, which is more than a month before I completely and totally reset my computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update for Adobe Flash Player</p>
<p>KB3139907</p>
<p>KB3140768</p>
<p>KB3142588</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not understand how the date of installation can be before the secure wipe of my computer.&nbsp; All other updates date to the date when I reinstalled windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a "base system device"&nbsp; attached to my "PCI Slot 2 (PCI bus 36, device 0, function 1)" whatever that is, which does not have a driver.&nbsp; I have disabled it, and I have yet to see any problem.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>This might be due to the system still showing your the dates of the updates when it was installed on your system initially. Further related to

            <p>So if I do a secure system erasure, <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">deleting every trace of my operating system, it still keeps old updates</span></strong>?&nbsp; That does not make sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the security updates are not property installed, that would be bad.&nbsp; How can I check / pre-emptively remedy this?&nbsp; I trust my university's Wi-Fi for downloads of such updates- can I install some updates manually?&nbsp; Should I uninstall and allow windows
 update to redo the update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've disabled the "base system device" so if it does anything, then I will find something that does not work.&nbsp; I have looked through the device manager, and I do not see anything unaccounted for which I use.... but I cannot call that definitive.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us try few of the below troubleshooting steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong><span><span>I suggest you to run a SFC scan and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>System File Checker</span></span></strong><span><span><span>is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.<br />
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Right click on the <strong>Start</strong> button, click on
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type “<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>” without the quotes and hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>After the scan, restart the computer and check for the issue.</span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">: If you are not able to repair some files after performing SFC scan, I suggest you to refer to the point 3 “Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to
 fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log <var><span>%WinDir%</span></var>\Logs\CBS\CBS.log”. Under the section “Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)” to repair the corrupted files after performing SFC scan.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Refer: </span></strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system
 files</span></span></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, </span></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:&nbsp;</strong><span>I suggest you to <strong>run DISM or System Update Readiness tool</strong> and check.</span></p>
<p><span>The DISM or System Update Readiness tool may help you to fix some Windows corruption errors.</span></p>

            <p>Problem persists sweetheart,</p>
<p>SFC/SCANNOW &gt; no integrity issue found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is with encryption, my files are encrypted in an old version of windows i.e win8.1 while i updated it to win10.
</p>
<p>*********i have deleted "windows.old" folder. maybe encryption keys were supposed to be recovered from that "windows.old" folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so now i guess there there's no more hope, right or do we have anything ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Appreciate.</p>

            <p>Hi Jahanzab,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being more clear with the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that users will have to remember and have a backup of recovery key in-order to decrypt the content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that when you perform an upgrade from previous operating system to Windows 10, Windows.old folder will be created by taking backup of the user content from previous operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand how difficult you are facing to decrypt the content. As you have deleted the Windows.old folder you might have lost the recovery key within that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Feel free to contact us for further assistance on Windows Operating System. We will be happy to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>

</p><p>A few days ago my laptop kept freezing and slowing down and displaying the message "restart to repair drive errors".</p>
<p>On restart it displays "Scanning and repairing drive (C:), this continued on every restart, until windows 10 would no longer boot.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I had a new disk installed, and a clean install of windows 10, but a day later the message displayed again, this time as scanning and repairing drive (\\?\C:). When troubleshooting the new drive, windows shows "You don't need to scan drive, no errors found"</p>

"The F Lock key on the Microsoft Keyboards is a relatively new concept facility for Microsoft Keyboards. Introduced with the Office Keyboard and used in later keyboards, it essentially allows keys to do more than one operation. The F Lock key, depending on
 its state, will allow either a function key's "normal" operation or a new "enhanced" operation. The initial state of the F Lock key is "off", and in this state, the function keys use their "enhanced" operation".</p>

    <title>Can someone please help me get my printers to work with windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> benvt12345  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can someone please help me get my printers to work with windows 10 before I go on a killing spree&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I seriously have spent at least 30 hours fighting with the printing function of windows 10 on our office network. I have followed every instruction that windows/microsoft provided. (They offer almost no instructions and the trouble shooting program doesn't
 work at all)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I have experienced with at least 5 different computers and 4 different printers. 3 printers are HP printers released in the last 18 months and claiming to be 100% windows 10 compatible and the other is a Canon printer that is a few years old.
 All work perfectly with something other than Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to let Windows install drivers automatically, Windows generates a bunch of files and installs drivers that don't work at all and then reports that drivers are not available for my printer(s) (not true at all).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then as guided by windows and common sense I went to the manufacturer website for each printer (HP and Canon).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both companies claim to have drivers for windows 10 and offer a downloadable installer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run these installers for each printer (separately, it doesn't matter if you try to install 1 or many printers none of them will work either way.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The install programs run to completion and claim that I am good to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point one of two things happens:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. despite the successful install, there is no sign of any installed printer on windows. doesn't show up at all. can't select it to test print because there is nothing in the printer list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>or </p>
<p>
</p><p>2. It appears to be installed but says it is "offline" despite the printer being fully online and running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>at this point microsoft tells me to run the printer trouble shooter app which insists that my printer is not turned on. It is most definitely turned on. I have tried everything I can find online or offline and nothing seems to work. A few times a printer
 has started working only to randomly stop working for no obvious reason a few days later.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems absolutely absurd that my very very very very common and popular mainstream printer models have so much trouble with windows 10.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>IT IS BEYOND FRUSTRATING! SOMEONE PLEASE HELP! I HAVE SPENT HOURS ON TECH SUPPORT WITH HP AND THEY DON'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY IDEA HOW TO GET THEIR PRODUCTS TO WORK WITH WINDOWS 10. I was told that they would mail me a cd with drivers on october 30th. Apparently
 businesses are expected to operate without printing for weeks and weeks. We have been dealing with this issue since August. absoultely unforgivable situation.

            <p>What I offer here may not be of much help as my printer and associated problems/solutions will differ from the three scenarios presented above. &nbsp;But I offer it anyway, as you are all in a desperate condition and need. &nbsp; I have an HP printer as well (though
 not the same model), and ultimately what got mine to work was to download HP's Print and Scan Doctor which searches for your printer and diagnoses its problem(s). &nbsp; I can't remember the next steps, as all this happened a couple of months ago, but for some
 reason I also have two files (hppiw.exe and HPPSdr.exe). &nbsp; If I have any recollection, these two executables had something to do with my printer working again, although I cannot see my ink levels anymore - not an issue for me).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, in your desperation and in my understanding of your plight, I offer the above, in case you haven't taken that step before. &nbsp; All the best.</p>

            <p>Yes! I finally found a solution. NO THANKS TO MICROSOFT! Hopefully they will read this so they can fix the problem haha</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a youtube video that explained how to fix it. It is fairly simple once you know how to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. type control panel in the search windows field at the bottom of your screen. This will bring up the control panel app. Open it. You will be relieved to see a control panel like the one that you are used to from previous versions of windows instead of
 windows settings.</p>
<p>YOU CAN NOT FIX THIS PROBLEM THROUGH WINDOWS SETTINGS YOU MUST USE THE CONTROL PANEL APP</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. when you open the app, click on "view devices and printers" under the "Hardware and Sound" heading</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. You should see a familiar screen with your printers on it. The one you are having trouble with should be there but grayed out "offline" even though it is not. If your printer is not there, you have a different problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. right click the problem printer. a menu will come up. </p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Select "Printer Properties"</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. click the tab labeled "Ports"</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. at the bottom of the "Ports" page there is a button that says "configure port". Click it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. a port configuration screen should come up. at the bottom of the port configuration page there is a check box with SNTP protocol stuff next to it. Uncheck this box and your printer will come back online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As best I can figure out Windows added a new layer of printer to PC communication that isn't supported by most printers yet. Unfortunately Windows 10 defaults to using this new communication and when your printer doesn't know how to reply to the signal the
 computer assumes it is offline. by turning off this function your computer will go back to talking to the printer as it used to. HP seems to have figured this out now as their most recent driver install seems to turn this function off automatically.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck! It is a great feeling when you see the color come back to that grayed out printer icon :)</p>

            Great find and a greater relief to you!! &nbsp; You mentioned that HP's recent driver install automatically unchecks that SNTP box, which translates that if the latest drivers are downloaded, then the fix is applied automatically. &nbsp; Fortunately, I have not
 needed that fix, but I checked it out anyway after your posted solution, and apparently I am not able to configure the (virtual) printer port, so this option would have been useless to me. &nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway, I'm sure your find will help others.

            <p>I had this problem it's a easy fix you must allow your PC to be discoverable by other PC's or devices on the network your connected to. Here's a website that shows you how (http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-set-a-network-profile-in-windows-10.html)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure how to do this if you do not allow the pc to be discovered though so if your at a unsafe or public network the only way I could think of is turning it on to get the network profile then turn in off but, I am not sure that would work.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Can I add extra search engines to Windows Edge &#63;</h2>
                    I am using Windows 10 on a PC.<br />
<br />
I understand that Bing is recommended for good reasons, but by favourite search engine is not even one of the alternative options, nor can I see how to get extra search engines.<br />
<br />
Ideally I would like to be able to switch quickly between search engines in the way Mozilla Firefox allows.

<p>Thanks for trying - the info in those links is too complicated for me - I am disabled with short term memory difficulties and have problems dealing with sequential stuff.<br />
<br />
I did not see how to simply add a different search engine as well as changing the default search engine to another from a list.<br />
<br />
I shall stop following this thread now and will probably revert to Chrome or Mozilla.<br />

    <title>Blue Screen after RAM Upgrade from 4GB to 8GB - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marcelludwig  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue Screen after RAM Upgrade from 4GB to 8GB</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought this PC back in 2009, it was supposed to come with 8GB (4x2GB) RAM DDR2-800MHz installed. But it never recognised more than 4GB, always a blue screen while booting OS or after 5 min or so running Windows. Back then, I didn't care much, and after
 several tests that I made, I sold 2 stickies of 2GB and I was satisfied with my 4GB (Also because I needed the money, but that's ok).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tests I made included changing and replacing every stick in every slot, all possibilities ever, and nothing would work if 3 or 4 stickies were on the MoBo. In other words, never more than 4GB. The BIOS recognises it fine, but the OS...</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now, with all the games that are being released, and after 2 upgrades of my PC (GPU and PSU), I bought again 2x2GB RAM, last week. But then again, the damned BSOD. This time, it never gets to launch the OS. Also, both of the new stickies are getting
 me the blue screen, as if they are faulty, but they are not. And I don't even have time to read what the blue screen says, it reboots too fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My rig:</p>
<p>Asus P5QL-E (BIOS updated)</p>
<p>Intel Core 2 Quad Q9550</p>
<p>(Current Ram) 2x Kingston 2Gb DDR2-800MHz</p>
<p>GeForce GTX 460 v2 1GB</p>
<p>PSU Corsair TX650</p>
<p>Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 (Same issue happened with Ultimate version)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Importante detail: I bought another 2 stickies of 2GB, also Kingston, DDR2-800MHz, but they delivered me DDR2-667MHz by mistake, I will replace it next week, I don't think it has to do with this, but I'm just saying, maybe this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tampered with some details in the BIOS screen, following the guide of my MoBo, since I'm no scumbag who tosses a manual in the trash, and I actually read and follow it. Adjusting everything that I could, without messing anything up, but no result
 at all. Only thing I didn't do yet is to format PC, reinstall Windows, don't know if it will matter either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Geez... I'm almost done with this problem, I can't find a solution anywhere. In the end of 2013, before I sold my old 2 stickies of RAM, I even paid for a technician to see what could be done, but he could not help me either. I can't upgrade my RAM for no
 reason at all, unless someone help me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Doesn't seem to be a problem with hardware, that's why I'm posting here. I appreciate the help in advance.</p>

            <p><span>Hi</span> <span>Marcel, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community Forum. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please be assured that we would do our best to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>This issue could be due to outdated drivers or </span></strong><strong><span>third party software conflict with drivers.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to follow the methods below and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Safe Mode</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to boot the computer to Safe Mode and check if the issue occurs or not. In Safe Mode computer starts with minimal set of drivers and files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer the article to boot to Safe Mode:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue do not occur in Safe Mode perform a clean boot and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Clean boot</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>

</span><br />
Is there a way to disable/turn off the warning message that appears whenever I change a file's extension?
<br />
I know Vista is trying to look out for me, but I am a big boy and I know what I am doing.
<br />
I know that renaming "Death Metal Polka.mp3" to "Death Metal Polka.jpg" will cause errors when I try to open the file with Windows Photo Gallery.
<br />
I know that renaming a file like "system32.dll" to "system32.xls" will have a detrimental effect on my computer.
<br />
I do not need Vista to hold my hand as I rename files to and from valid extensions.
<br />
Is there a configuration setting or registry key I can change to suppress the warning?<br />
<br />
Thank you for you time.

            Thanks for the tip Matt.<br />
Unfortunately, while the <strong>ConsentPromptBehavior*</strong> keys are useful for shutting UAC up, they do not disable the warning about changing the file extension.<br />
<br />
I initially changed the <strong>ConsentPromptBehaviorUser</strong> key to 0 since my regular user is not part of the admin group.<br />
I rebooted my computer, but the warning message still appeared when I tried to change a file extension.<br />
<br />
I then changed <strong>ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin</strong> to 0 and rebooted again.<br />
I still did not have any luck; the warning message still appeared when I tried to change a file extension.<br />

            Hi alexi_teague<br />
<br />
<p><span>The simplest way to fix this issue is to make the
</span><span>file extensions</span><span> hidden</span></p>
<p><span>To make the file extensions hidden, follow the below steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open Windows Explorer, go to Tools &gt; Folder Options &gt; View</span></p>
<p><span>2. Check the option<strong> Hide extensions for known file types</strong>.<br />
</span><span><br />
Please Post back and let us know if this helped to resolve the issue - thank you<br />

            I do not want to hide the extensions, I just want to be able change them without Vista nagging me each and every time I do so.<br />
For example I would like to be able to rename an image like BattleMime<strong>.jpeg</strong> to BattleMime<strong>.jpg</strong> without the warning message stopping and asking for for confirmation.<br />

            I set both the ConsentPromptBehaviorUser and ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin to "0" and rebooted the computer.<br />
I logged in using my regular, restricted "alexit" account and and the administrator account.<br />
In both cases the changes completely removed the UAC prompts for administrative tasks (such as changing system environment variables), but it did not remove the confirmation dialogue window when I tried to rename a file extension.<br />

How do you manage to come up with that as a solution? This message has been bugging me too, for years even. Ok, it is nice to hold the general users hands, but users with a little more experience, and know what they are doing, should be able to disable this
 irritating and time-consuming warning. Renaming file extensions is a task many users do every day, quite many files as well. Please provide a real answer for both Vista and XP. This got to be possible by changing or creating the correct registry key. Please!<br />

            I think one of the major key points everyone keeps forgetting is that Vista was designed with "Security" in mind.&nbsp; Not every personn out there is as "Tech Savy" as you and if they "accidentally" changed the file extension of an important file, lets say
 an .exe for example, then they will wonder why their program does not work.&nbsp; If they have a Warning Diaglog box stating "hey you're about to make a change that could affect your system" or whatever, then I think that's a good thing.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I agree with you that should be a Feature one should have the ability to turn on or off.&nbsp; People should not be messing around in the Registry regardless if they know what they are doing.&nbsp;&nbsp; IMO, Microsoft should have included a way for us
 Tech Savy folks to turn features on or off such as the ability to turn off some of these annoying dialog boxes.

<h2>            Marketplace, Family and Privacy settings, cannot download anything.</h2>
                    
<p>Here goes nothin'.<br />
<br />
Recently I -finally- got an ISP. Flipped on the Xbox and connected, everything fired up as normal.
<br />
Let's note before everytime I connected to someone else's internet, it worked perfectly fine.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<span> </span>The promotional images that are usually under the games, music, apps tabs were gone. Whenever I tried to view something that caught my eye, which just so happened to be the "Free with Gold" Fable
 3. When I tried to download it, I got this error: "Sorry, there's a problem with the Xbox service. Try again later. For help with this problem, go to www.xbox.com/errorhelp &nbsp;Status code: 8C230002" (As this point in posting, everything is working fine for Live..)
 ... I did as told, and tried every mother livin' thing it told me, no progress. I forwarded the Xbox Live ports, and could -not- access Family and Privacy settings as suggested, which gave me a different error.<br />
<br />
Privacy: 80072746-a76bc0d7-41c9f076</p>
<p>Family: 80072746-a9a501a4-583a0b48</p>
<p>What gives? I was even suggested to download from the Games Marketplace on www.xbox.com.<br />
I did that, as well, only to be told after a few minutes of 0%, that it "Can't be downloaded.", What a bummer, right?</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks guys.</p>

<p>Hey AOS. This error code can also mean that there is a lock on your account, which it kind of sounds like there is, since you cannot access these things.<br />
<br />
In that case, I would suggest giving <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us?isChatCallAvailable=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Hi San, you would be amazed how many users with HP Streams ask the exact same question every day . . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer - backup your data and perform a clean install of Windows 10 - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next 2 years of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything ! 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There are tips here for managing smaller drives including 32gb drives: 
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>

<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br />This should make enough space to install Windows Updates.  But for now I'd focus on the Spring Creators Version 1803 since successfully installing it when released in the next few days will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place.
<br />
<br />Track release of Version 1803 here:  <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#utpDefLLBfmPO4gr.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#ut...</a>
<br />
<br />Once the new version is released install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If the  Upgrade Assistant  has already been installed by WIndows Update then I'd remove it and it's staging files first to recover that space:
<br />
<br />First turn off Windows Update service to regain control:
<br />
<br />Type services.msc in Start Search,  Open Services applet.
<br />
<br />Scroll Down to Windows Update Service and click on it, Stop service and set to Disabled.  Now it should clear the queue of Version and other Updates until you turn it back on and Check again.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Upgrade Assistant In Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Clear out any Upgrade folders in C: drive root.  Restart PC, try Upgrade again.
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

            <pre>Option 1: Get a large SD card - 64 GB or larger. Connect it and redirect your apps, files and folders to it. 
Note: This only works with Microsoft Store apps. Classic desktop apps and those that come built into Windows 10 cannot be moved.
In Windows 10 open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features. Select an app or game downloaded from the Windows Store, then click Move.
Click on the Select a drive to move this app to: list box, choose the drive representing your SD card then click Move.
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/
Option 2: Free up space in Windows 10
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

    <title>Problem with creating hotspot on PC&#59; can&#39;t see microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amannayak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with creating hotspot on PC&#59; can&#39;t see microsoft virtual hosted adapter</h2>
                    <p>Firstly, I want to specify that I am able to successfully start a wi-fi hotspot with connectify. However their quality of connection isn't good which is why I wanted to switch to CMD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I get my internet via an ethernet cable. When I click properties for "Ethernet" in change adapter settings, and go to the sharing tab, I'm not sure which option to select in the drop down menu. There is wifi, ethernet 2 (used by evolve, not my actual
 connection) and a virtual adapter (LAN) used by connectify. (Screenshot attached)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which brings me to the main problem, I can't seem to get the virtual adapter to appear in the change adapter settings screen. In device manager, I have a something called "Microsoft Wi-fi direct virtual adapter". It is updated to the latest software. Is
 this the correct adapter? Most places people say the adapter should be "Microsoft Virtual Wifi Miniport" or "Microsoft Hosted Network Virtual Adapter".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I make the correct virtual adapter appear in the "change adapter settings" screen?</p>
<p>I have already set hostednetwork mode to allow in cmd admin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attached are screenshots.</p>

            <p>Hi Joyce,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps given here to take a screen shots from your Surface Pro. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can take a screenshot of your “<strong>custom</strong>” Surface start screen (or any other screen for that
</p>
<p>matter) just follow these two simple steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Touch and hold down on the <strong>Windows 8 logo </strong>on the <strong>Surface</strong>.<br />
b) While doing that, press the <strong>volume</strong> <strong>down</strong> <strong>
button</strong> once, then release.<br />
<br />
The screen will dim for a brief second. This is your confirmation that screenshot was taken.You can find the screenshot in the Screenshots album in the Photos app. From there you can navigate to your screenshot.</p>

    <title>Want To Join An All Halo Clan&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spartan i043  say:</h3>
<h2>            Want To Join An All Halo Clan&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>We are the founders of the Halo rings. We destroyed the flood and restored humanity. We lived and thrived before anyone. We are the earliest Halo players. We are Team Forerunner.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey! Spartan I043 here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning sound cool? Keep reading! I am&nbsp;currently in the process of recruiting for my clan Team Forerunner in Halo.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We play&nbsp;every Halo that was ever&nbsp;made:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Halo: Combat Evolved (PC)</p>
<p>2. Halo 2 (PC)</p>
<p>3. Halo 3</p>
<p>4. Halo 3: ODST</p>
<p>5. Halo Reach</p>
<p>6. Halo Wars</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will also&nbsp;expand to the upcoming Halo:&nbsp;CE Remake and Halo 4.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ABOUT TEAM FORERUNNER:<br />
Team Forerunner is a clan where winning and losing don't count, where skill doesn't matter, where cussing hardly exists, and where fun is always in the game. If you cuss up storms, only care about winning, and are unsporting don't bother reading on or sending
 us friend requests. We DON'T want players that cuss up storms and we DON'T want players that are unsporting and only want to win. We want players that want to have fun, we want players that are good sports and we'd prefer players that don't cuss (we don't
 mind if a you can't help throw a cuss word in every now and then). We currently have about 70 awesome, official players in Team Forerunner! Team Forerunner only cares about having fun and if we win great. . . if we lose, oh well we have our chins held high
 ready to move on either way. We are very strict on players who only want to win, who are unsporting, and who cuss up storms (We banned two members because they were both cussing up a storm and one of them only wanted to win and was unsporting). Most of Team
 Forerunner's members rarely ever cuss (which is really nice) and we try to help each other rank up, complete challenges and become better players. Both guys and gals are welcome to join our clan. KillJoyseries89 made&nbsp;our websit &nbsp;where you can view more of
 Team Forerunner's information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TEAM FORERUNNER RULES:<br />
1. Player must respect the leaders/co-leaders: Spartan I043, Iron Hawk II, Jakeylakes, Reydaitso, fishiesDONTswim,&nbsp;crazed so, and&nbsp;junglecatz81&nbsp;(So far only two members have disrespected us and I don't want it to happen again)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Player must be a good sport whether it's win or loss. (In other words, have fun whether you win or lose)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Player must have a mic and must communicate to the team. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Player must be willing to participate in ALL Halo Reach game modes. (Slayer, Capture the Flag, Headhunter, Invasion etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Player must change their emblems to Team Forerunner's official emblem (No armor or gamertag changes are required, however if you join our clan, I ask that you put "Team Forerunner" into either your motto or bio so that way when our new members look at
 my friend's list, they will know who is in our clan and who isn't)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I allow ALL ranks to join so I will allow you to join whether you are a Recruit, Inheritor or anything in between. Currently our highest ranked officer is a Field Marshall and our current lowest ranked officer is a Warrant Officer (again these are official
 Team Forerunner members). And we have many ranks in between, so you should be able to fit right in!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TEAM FORERUNNER INFO:<br />
Players can also list a specific preference in which class they will be assigned. (All-Around, Heavy, Long Range, Close-Quarter, Vehicle Operator, etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An Octagon backround with the Champion Star in the middle is the Team Forerunner emblem. The Colors are Steel (Backround Color), Silver (Primary Emblem Color), and White (Secondary Emblem Color). I no longer require the service tag to be changed, because
 it is hard to recognize teammates with the same service tags.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As said above I am trying to make Team Forerunner as fun as I possible can, and if there are any recommendations let me know. We also try to have clan battles every weekend, so if your clan wants to battle ours, feel free to contact our Clan Battle Organizer
 Jakeylakes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TEAM FORERUNNER CONTACTS:<br />
You are more than welcome to contact any of the leaders/co-leaders listed above, but for the most part you will want to send me messages. You can contact me multiple ways:<br />
1. Xbox Live Gamertag: Spartan I043 <br />
2. Right here in the forum<br />
3. Send me a private message</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TEAM FORERUNNER MEMBER NEWS:<br />
We now have our very own clan meeting room! We hold meetings&nbsp;every other&nbsp;Saturday. You can come to these meetings and find out more about us if you wish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, When you join Team Forerunner, don't only send me a friend request, but also send Iron Hawk II (Team Forerunner Leader), Jakeylakes (Team Forerunner Co-Leader and Clan Battle Organizer), Reydaitso (Team Forerunner Co-Leader and Secretary of Treasure),
 fishiesDONTswim (Team Forerunner Co-Leader)&nbsp;crazed so&nbsp;(Team Forerunner Co-Leader), and junglecatz81 (Team Forerunner Co-Leader)&nbsp;one. This way they will know you are wanting to join or have already joined. You can try to contact one of them if I'm not online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Iron Hawk II writes:<br />
"Hey guys, I am proud to be a Team Forerunner leader. I hope you have the best experience possible playing Reach in our clan.
<br />
This clan was built by Spartain I043 and myself and we want other Reach players to play to win, but also be good sports about losing because we will most likely not win every match. This has been a great experience for me. I hope to see you on the battlefield
 soldier. Iron Hawk II, signing out.<br />
PS: I appreciate my fellow clan members to be my friends and also if it isn't too much to ask, I would like a good rep. Oh! And one more thing I would appreciate as little language (cussing/swearing) as possible."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jakeylakes also writes:<br />
"Hey guys i'm Jakeylakes one of the members of Team Forerunner. I would just like to give you a heads up display of how great this clan is and I highly recomend that you join. Team Forerunner plays for fun, Team Forerunner accepts anyone who's willing to join.
 These past few weeks have been awsome, I have played so much now and my ranks are soaring through the roof because I can actually play Reach and enjoy. Team Forerunner has lots of members and there all fun to talk to. If you consider becomeing an honarable
 member of Team Forerunner all you need is a mic, contact Spartan I043( our team leader- also give Iron Hawk II respect aswell) or alteranativly you can contact me and i'll talk with Spartan I043. Many Thanks Jakeylakes Team Forerunner"

"I'm a new member myself, this is a great clan to join. Team Forerunner may put fun first, but don't let that fool you into believing we are not a serious clan. I have been in 4 clans spanning the past 7 years on XBOX Live and I am impressed with the level
 of professionalism on Team Forerunner. "</p>

5. "Team Forerunner's guys are GOOD!" -SILENTxkiller</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONCLUSION:<br />
Believe it or not this is our (Iron Hawk II and me) first time running a clan as well as being in a clan. We must be doing a good job or our clan members wouldn't be saying these things. Personally we love to have fun, but we can get very serious (especially
 when it comes to recruiting and cussing players with unsporting attitudes). If you want proof that these guys have fun in Team Forerunner just send them a message and ask. They will tell you how much fun they have. We guarentee you'd have fun as well. If you
 want to join, but may be nervous if you were to want to quit and not disappoint me, don't worry about it. We don't force anyone to stay, nor do I force anyone to leave. It is completely up to you. We ask that you really think about joining. We have so much
 fun as a group and we want to share our fun with YOU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Team Forerunner is a clan where you want to find friends, play with mature yet fun guys that rarely cuss, have VERY GOOD sportsmanship, and have the teamwork spirit, then Team Forerunner is the clan for you, because Team Forerunner wants you to have a
 Halo Reach experience that you will NEVER forget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Questions and comments needed answered quickly about Team Forerunner should be sent to Spartan I043, Jakeylakes, Reydaitso, fishiesDONTswim,&nbsp;crazed so and/or junglecatz81. Iron Hawk II is online when possible (not frequently) so only send him messages if
 necessary. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On behalf of Team Forerunner we hope that you join (quickly).</p>

<h2>            Reading List app--how to add pages under Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I can't figure out how to add pages to my Reading List app anymore. IE doesn't have a share option, and Edge seems to keep its own Reading List that doesn't sync anywhere. Is this capability just gone now?
