<h2>            Intel Realsense 3D camera problems after build 18312 udgrade</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to build 18312 (may be also after the previous version), my Intel Realsense 3D camera f200, doesn't work any more. I have uninstalled the drivers and the camera several times, and then reinstalled it. A couple of times I succeeded, and could
 use the camera in&nbsp; Skype, but the virtual drive disappeared after reboots. When the camera was working, I was unable to configure Windows Hello (face).</p>
<p>May I hope for a fix, or is the camera not supported by the latest build?</p>
<p>

            As with beta builds have sometimes issues with 3rd party software and devices, you need to post it in the Feedback Hub where MS will see the issue.&nbsp; Check with Intel support to see if any updates for the beta Preview builds.

It's a BETA testing operating system, if the camera works with the current public release than it's ok, when will people understand about beta Preview the purpose is testing for issues and if found report them on the Feedback Hub, sometimes issue will be fixed
 but most times after several builds or during RTM time.&nbsp;

<p>Don't expect answers to your feedback, you might get lucky and get a reply but that's not the norm.</p>
<p>The FBH is a one way street per say. Their first response is always a bot and if the issue becomes popular then someone from the DEV team posts a general update.</p>

            Indeed, I know about the limited support when using an insider build, and I didn't expect an answer from Microsoft. However, when I had problems with stable builds, I never got an (sensible) answer from Microsoft. Any help was always provided by a community
 member or a Google search. That was the reason for my posting. Worth trying.

<p>Yes, it's a one way street. We help M$ improve their OS to make Billions, and we can't even get simple tech support. Pathetic how you defend big Corp, when they are using you, and screwing us all over. M$ is filthy rich, and they could afford to have tech
 support for insider builds. The fact that they won't is a clear indication where their loyalties lie, and it isn't with their end users. It's one thing for the camera to go out in one build or another. But this camera hasn't worked in over a year on my insider
 builds. Their not fixing that, when Windows Hello is a major feature of the OS, is unacceptable. I guess they are too busy making videos about thundercats...</p>

    <title>Outlook 2013 disappearing emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> excaliburnz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 disappearing emails</h2>
                    <p>I have Office 365 Home installed on my Win 7 Pro Desktop and my Win 8.1 Laptop both using Microsoft EAS via my Windows Live Outlook email.&nbsp; I also access this EAS account on my Android phone.</p>
<p>Today I noticed that the Sent mail in my outlook account on my phone was empty when looking for an email I sent last night.&nbsp; When I logged onto my Laptop and opened Outlook 2013 all of the sent emails were displayed but then I watch as they all disappeared
 as if they were all being deleted. At the same time I saw the unread email counter in my inbox counting down and when I went to my inbox it too was empty.&nbsp; I started my Desktop PC and the very same thing happened when I opened Outlook 2013.&nbsp; I then logged
 into my Outlook account via the web and all of my emails are still displayed but only the emails sent in the last few hours are now synchronising in my Outlook on PC and Laptop and in the EAS account on my phone.</p>
<p>This has happened before and I have had to reinstall Office 365 all over again and then wait an age as it synchronises with all devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is happening here and is it unique to the "click-to-run" versions as loaded with Office 365 and could be eliminated if I purchased and installed the full version of Office 2013?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a serious pain in the butt when it happens and has a dramatic impact on my productivity which I find most annoying - can anyone help please??</p>

            <p>Hi Nayana - thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done as you have suggested on both computers and now I don't get any emails synchronised in any folders - they are all empty and Outlook connects to the server and indicates that it is updating folders but then disconnects and remains disconnected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried a more severe approach on my laptop after your suggested approach failed to render a solution.&nbsp; I uninstalled Office 365 and deleted all email profiles and made sure that the .OST files were also deleted.&nbsp; I reinstalled and setup my email profiles
 again but this has not worked either and still get the disconnection issue with the EAS server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other profile I have in Outlook connects to my business Microsoft Exchange Account and it is working just fine.&nbsp; It appears to be an issue with the EAS server.&nbsp; Interestingly my EAS Outlool.com emails had all disappeared too but have slowly started to
 be restored earlier today but not yet complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help??!!</p>
<p>

 and then when back on line it reconnected to the server and then all of my emails started to disappear again.

<h3> grschinon  say:</h3>
<h2>            N95 themes</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
No, I don't want to download themes for my phone. There are gazillions of sites for that so I wouldn't be asking here if that's what I wanted. What I *do* want to find out is how to create themes of my own. Closed-source software for Windows isn't an option
 because a) I don't run Windows on my machines and b) it still won't give me any information about the logical structure of theme files.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?

            Are you sure this is compatible with an N95? Just going on the filename, it looks like it's only good for the N73, N80 and N93.

Thanks. Please re-read what I posted. My PCs are not infected with MS-Windows. Besides, what does using 3rd party utilities teach me about the logical structure of theme files? I reverse-engineered themes for the S-E V600i and for the Nokia 6280 so that I could
 create my own from scratch. Other people have written software that creates themes for S60 devices, so where do they get the information they need in order to do this? Am I so abnormal for wanting to find out how something works rather than just blindly using
 someone else's work?<br />

    <title>How to Get Word Count for Selected Cells in a Table&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nico34b  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Get Word Count for Selected Cells in a Table&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I do translation work so I usually work in Microsoft word using a table.&nbsp; The left column will be the language I'm translating from and the right column is the language I'm translating too.&nbsp; I need to know how many words exist in a column, or even
 better, would be to just select the cells I want to count and get an accurate word count.&nbsp; Selecting a column or a number of cells within a table only gives you the total document word count, and not just the text in those cells.&nbsp; Yes, I could cut and paste
 all the text to a different document and count it that way, but there should be an easier fix.&nbsp; Does anyone have any suggestions?

            No that's not the problem im having.&nbsp; I'm not trying to select regular text.&nbsp; I'm trying to get a word count in a range of cells in a table.&nbsp; When you select text in a range of cells on a table it counts the words from the whole document.

    <title>Problem repairing Office Professional Plus 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skybax  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem repairing Office Professional Plus 2010</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to track down a problem with the icons that should be associated with (a) Office files [like XLS, XLSX, DOC, etc.] and (b) the shortcuts to the Office applications as they're listed in the Start Menu.&nbsp; Instead of the standard office icons, I have
 the generic application icon or, in the case of the XLS, DOC, etc., files, a generic file icon.&nbsp; I've tried rebuilding the IconCache.db file, going to Safe Mode (I'm using Windows 7 Pro) and restarting, and all sort of other fixes that I've found on the web,
 but none of them has helped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the suggestions that I came across is to run the Repair option under Programs and Features in Control Panel.&nbsp; Here's what I do:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1) Open Control Panel</p>
<p>(2) Open Programs and Features</p>
<p>(3) Highlight Office Professional Plus 2010</p>
<p>(4) Click on Change.</p>
<p>(5) Watch the splash screen come up, telling me that to please wait while the necessary files are set up.</p>
<p>(6) Watch while that splash screen disappears and nothing else happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no option to select repair, uninstall, or anything on the next screen, because the next screen never appears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure that I don't hae Click-to-Start installed because (a) Office didn't come pre-installed with my Dell laptop and (b) there is no other application related to Office in the programs listed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My main question here is "Why can't I run the Repair option under Change in the Programs and Features window?"&nbsp; A secondary question is "Why won't rebuilding the IconCache.db file fix the icon problem?"&nbsp; Right now, the main question is more important, as
 it seems to me to indicate some underlying problem that might be affecting the secondary question, too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a million for the time you've taken to read this!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office installation may be corrupt as you are unable to repair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run fix it from the article mentioned below which removes the Office 2010 completely then reinstall and check if that resolves the issue:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301</a>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure you have the product key and installation media for Office 2010 before uninstalling and if you are using Windows 64 bit
 operating system, save the ‘Fix it’ on desktop before running it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once reinstalled try to rebuild icon cache and check if it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Entire Outlook email account appears to have been wiped</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using Hotmail/Outlook for years and have two accounts, which I check regularly, i.e. access both at least once per week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week I signed into one of my accounts to find that EVERYTHING was gone. No emails in my inbox. No folders. No sent items. Absolutely nothing. I tried sending myself a test email from another one of my email accounts but this has not appeared in my inbox.
 I haven't changed anything ever as I'm not particularly techie, but I have no idea what has happened, why it has happened and how I go about recovering my account and retrieving all my stored emails (of which there were no doubt thousands!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also finding it impossible to figure out how to get help from Microsoft to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>
<p>

<p><strong>3. </strong>You are using an e-mail client or a third party spam filtering software to access your account.<br />
This often happens when using the Pop3 protocol to retrieve your mail and the option “Always leave a copy of the message on the server” is not selected.</p>

<p>hi yvanleblanc,</p>
<p>to better understand the situation, i’d like to confirm what mail app you are using on your ios devices, the owa for ios, outlook for ios or built-in mail app.</p>
<p>if it is the outlook for ios, we suggest you contact the in-app support to send feedback or report any issues regarding the outlook for ios app. the related team would like to hear from you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;*note when using the in app support,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; it can take a while for a representative to get back to the user. it is recommended that you turn on notifications for outlook in order to know when the technician is available.</p>
<p>2. if you don’t have notifications turned on, then when you open the app again and go to support, you should see a response from the technician.</p>
<p>3. it is recommended that the user’s initial question be as fully descriptive as possible of the situation.</p>
<p>example:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=f608560d-c1b6-4a1c-ab34-cbdf5fccdd3b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3df608560d-c1b6-4a1c-ab34-cbdf5fccdd3b" /></a><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>if it is not the outlook for ios, please confirm whether it helps if you delete and re-configure your office 365 account.</p>

<p>hi dave,<br />
<br />
from your description, it seems that you'd like to create a sharing link for document located in another user's onedrive for business library. if there is any misunderstanding, please let us know.<br />
<br />
if this is the case, please try the following steps to remove your account from the personal site of that original user and then grant permission again to see the outcome:<br />
1.log in to onedrive for business using the original user account, and remove all permissions for your account to that original user's onedrive for business library as below(<strong>library settings--permission for this document library</strong>):<br />
<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=64d98a92-e2e5-4e4c-8c59-50b1b08e0f66" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d64d98a92-e2e5-4e4c-8c59-50b1b08e0f66" /></a><br />
<br />
2.go to <strong>people and groups</strong> under <strong>site settings</strong>, delete your account from the original user's personal site;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=c9726614-f0c1-4f0b-b12d-c3cfde3e5534" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dc9726614-f0c1-4f0b-b12d-c3cfde3e5534" /></a></p>
<p><br />
3.check the permission to see whether your account has been removed.<br />
4.let the user share his onedrive for business library to you with proper permissions, and then you would be able to&nbsp; get the link via "get a link" option.<br />
<br />
note: the original user may firstly share one document to you before share the whole library to you.<br />
<br />
in addition, if you'd like to access the original user's onedrive for business library without shared by the original user, you need to add your account to be the site collection administrators in site collection owners for the original user via
<strong>sharepoint admin center</strong>--&gt; <strong>user profiles</strong>--&gt;<strong>mange user profiles</strong> (select that original user's profile)--&gt;<strong>manage site collection owners</strong>.<br />
<br />
if there is any update, please let us know.<br />
<br />

            No problem. What is the make and model of the printer. It may be that the printer can't print in higher resolutions.

            I looked up the printer and it is a really high quality printer so now I'm almost at a loss. The only thing I can say is to contact Canon and ask for customer support. Also have you installed the latest driver for your printer? Sometimes this can fix the
 problem.

    <title>Getting Back to Insider Betas from Win 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> unclscott  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting Back to Insider Betas from Win 8.1</h2>
                    <p>So after close to two years of the beta, up to build 14271 never had BSODs or crashes. Actually kind of impressed that&nbsp;after all those builds and installs, the foot print didn't get much past 10 GBs, on a reset I was able to get to 6.9 GBs ( no pagefile
 or hibernate ). Anyway, I am inclined to believe 14271 wasn't stable ( on a side note, I was/am using Java ) for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, how can I go straight back into the latest Win10&nbsp;beta build from Windows 8.1? I think it would be worth testing out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Off topic question:</p>
<p>In the task manger, app history, I'm wondering, When I click "Delete App History" what does it actually do? Is there a command or task it runs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>By the way, might take me a day or two to get back as I'm doing some testing</p>
<p />

            <p>Speaking as one who just did exactly what you describe, I'm afraid the only way to do it is to get an ISO for the current build, and do an upgrade from that (something Fast Ring builds don't get officially; you'll have to find an unofficial one).&nbsp; In this
 case, a computer that I'd just gotten back from the manufacturer came back with a re-imaged hard drive with an OEM of Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, you'll need to have a Windows 10 license key to enter--it'll prompt you for one as soon as the setup process starts, and you can't skip it.&nbsp; (For some reason it didn't recognize that Windows 8.1 was activated and migrate that key.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going through the process to upgrade to Windows 10 TH2 and from there join the Insider Program (and presumably have to download two builds since it doesn't default to the Fast Ring) may be cumbersome, but I'd recommend going that route anyway because it
 means you only use builds that come from MSFT.</p>

            <p>As far as getting back to back into the latest build from Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; if your computer is activated then the easiest way is to use the Media Creation Tool and do a clean install and then get the updates.&nbsp; You will need to go the Settings, Updates, Advanced options and Get Insider builds and move to the Fast ring.&nbsp; It
 may take up to 48 hours before the new preview build shows up in Windows Update.&nbsp; Also there may be a new one out this week.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the responses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So license wise questions, Can I install Win 10 ( with key ) on one system and</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Use my old 7/8 on other systems still? ( these will not be upgraded to win10 as used for testing )</p>
<p>2) Change the Win10 to the Insider build and use the non-beta on a different system?</p>
<p>3) Are there "Service Packs" / "New Builds" in stores/online yet? If not, when?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the current build, as I feel the need to wait a few builds past 14271</p>

            <p>1)&nbsp; If you install Windows 10 with a Windows 10 key, it doesn't impact your ability to use your existing Windows 7/8 keys on other systems.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; I'm not sure how joining the Insider program works now, but when I joined up you could get an ISO of the current Slow Build off the Insider site and go from there regardless of what OS you were starting from.&nbsp; I don't know what you might have to do now
 in order to get an Insider license that's separate from your primary Windows license.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; The most current public build is the TH2 build from last fall; we Insiders are up to 14279 now, and since we didn't get a Fast Ring PC build last week, we're probably on track to get one this week.&nbsp; Presumably TH2's public release has also gotten some
 updates since it was published.</p>

In other words they each must have their own activation.</p>

<p>In Excel when using&nbsp;=XIRR(B1:B32,A1:A32) the answer is esentially zero or an error (<span>2.98E-09).</span></p>
<p>The sum of these cash flows is -618.43, if you modify the cash flows so the sum is positive, the XIRR function works.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook 2013 - IMAP missing messages - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris_sg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 - IMAP missing messages</h2>
                    I had all sorts of problems from day one trying to get IMAP to work. Now it seems to be more or less stable some of the time (still ages behind Outlook 2010), but with one particular account I have a problem: from time to time, apparently for no reason,
 all the messages disappear except for the 2 or 3 newest ones. It doesn't matter how I set the "mail to keep offline", the older messages don't come back.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I deleted the profile so many times I can't count them. Of course with the new profile everything seems to be going well initially, but soon all sort of problems start appearing (I think I experienced one by one ALL of the problems reported on the internets).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any chance to have a stable solution? I'd love to use IMAP for my work email (like I did for many years using the previous versions), but at this time I can't. I still have to use Exchange OWA to make sure I don't miss anything. Plain annoying.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks a lot for any help.</div>

How are viewing IMAP account using OWA?<br />
<br />
Is it possible for you to configure same account on different computer which has outlook 2013??<br />

            The issue affects all accounts, including 1 Exchange-based and 1 Gmail.
<div><br />
<div>OWA has nothing to do with IMAP... the account there is perfect as usual.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't another PC for testing. But I deleted/recreated the profile many times, and I even&nbsp;wiped the registry keys, so I guess it's not a PC problem.</div>

            I have this same problem with multiple IMAP accounts.&nbsp; Also, I notice that the settings I enter for how long to keep messages will change by itself back to 3 months from "All".&nbsp; This is really irritating and not something that I would expect from a major
 release from Microsoft.&nbsp; Solid IMAP support is a no brainer.&nbsp; How disappointing.&nbsp; Now I just have to decide if it's worth it to downgrade back to 2010.<br />

            I also have the same problem with different imap accounts on a thirth party server. All messages within the inbox are gone except for the newest ones of the day and those in sub folders. I must add the messages are not wiped from the server, luckily. Otherwise
 the problem would have been a near disaster. Now it's just <u>very</u> annoying...<br />
<br />
But indeed come on Microsoft, there are more people complaining. This has to be fixed...<br />

            I am not sure that I'm posting this to the correct place, but I came up with a workaround that I thought might help others. I identified that the only 'missing messages' were in the inbox and that Outlook 2013 syncs just fine with all sub folders.
<div><br />
<div>That being said, I created a sub folder called 'New' inside of the inbox and then created a rule in my web-based mail program to move all incoming mail to that mailbox. So basically I'm just bypassing the Inbox altogether and I have yet to lose a message
 (knock on wood). All messages sync perfectly between my phone, laptop and browser-based mail system.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Microsoft ... this is CRAZY that you released new Outlook 2013 without fully testing the IMAP functionality. I have read hundreds of posts online of people having messages disappear from their Inbox and have found ZERO responses from a qualified Microsoft
 person acknowledging it.</div>

            <p>Thanks to NY Publisher for the workaround. It seems to do the trick. I have had a nightmare of a time with email. I've got Godaddy/Outlook 2013/iphones for me and small staff. We were POP and one employee was having intermittent emails never be received,
 though address was correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We switched to IMAP and were doing better. Then&nbsp;I started to see emails that were about 4 days old disappearing from my Inbox --&nbsp;and since we are IMAP, they were GONE, totally GONE! As a backup, I went into webmail and CCed all my incoming emails to a GMAIL
 account. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I implemented the above idea of&nbsp;moving everything automatically to a NEW folder.&nbsp;So far, so good.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So much wasted time I could have spent running my business. Thanks for the tip NY Publisher. Please keep the community informed of fixes.

<p>Google has made its connector available for outlook 2013 and it solved my issues, until that is I start to use another IMAP program.&nbsp; I would hate to see Google solving Microsoft's issues.

<p>
<span>File &gt; Account Settings &gt; Email Tab &gt; Select your IMAP account and double click it &gt; Adjust "Mail to keep offline"</span></p>
<p>
1. Set the "Keep Offline" setting to something other than "All" (I used 24-months)</p>
<p>
2. Restart Outlook</p>

3.&nbsp;Set the "Keep Offline" setting back to "All"</p>

4. Restart Outlook</p>

    <title>Sorting an entire sheet by taking as basis a common column with - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sorting an entire sheet by taking as basis a common column with another</h2>
                    Hello, community<br />
<br />
I have a task that is quite difficult to explain, but I'll give it a try, if any of you would be kind to provide any ideas on how to do it. I thank for it in advance.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the question is as follow:<br />
<br />
I have two different sheets (files) which have only one column in common. This column have random numeric codes, and although all the numbers that are present the column in one sheet is also present on the other, they are sorted in a different way, and they
 aren't sorted in any pattern (crescent or decrescent).<br />
<br />
Besides these columns, the other columns have different data from one sheet to another.<br />
<br />
I cannot modify the order in which one of the sheets is sorted, but I have to sort the order of data in the second sheet in accordance to the first, and this can only be achieved by sorting the column they share in common in the same way (the column in the
 second sheet sorted the same way as it is in the first one)<br />
<br />
Is there a way to do that? Is that even understandable? I hope so...<br />
<br />
Thanks for paying any attention to this request and even more for providing an answer.<br />
<br />
Best regards
<p><br />

 any particular order, I want Powerpoint to "decide" what to play next rather than me having to go through the whole presentation and "decide" for myself.</p>
<p>Can this be done?&nbsp; I've checked in the help section but can only find "random transition" and this doesn't address&nbsp;the issue.</p>
<p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

            It happens after some third part software installation? If yes, remove...<br />
If just "happens" then, do a backup, and search for a firmware upgrade. If it already have the last version, just format the unit. If is firmware, should solve the problem.

            the camera issue u r talkin abt is not a software issue at all try pressin a small black switch (that the slidin cover presses) wen ur foe's back cover is removedthe camera will function normally, so if ur fone is still under warranty have the defective
 slidin cover replaced for free from a level 3 nokia care centre. or else purchase a new cover for ur fone. it will work. do lemme knw after ur prob gets resolved.

<br />
I think you are SOL.&nbsp; This is an unfortunate long-standing design flaw in Excel.&nbsp; Excel will interpret the numeric text as numbers even if they are written to the file surrounded by double-quotes or prefixed with an apostrophe.<br />
<br />
I believe you will have to resort to writing a VBA procedure to input the file and interpret the fields as you require.&nbsp; This might be a medium difficult to hard task, depending on the structure of the data.<br />
<br />
But the first step is to open the CSV file using a simple text editor (e.g. Notepad) and verify that the leading and trailing zeros were written to the file as intended.<br />
<br />
If you need further assistance on the VBA implementation, the next step will be to provide an example CSV file that is a good representation of all the kinds of data that might be in the file.<br />
<br />
You can upload an example CSV file (devoid of any private data) to a file-sharing website.<br />
<br />
Then post the "shared", "public" or "view-only" link (aka URL; http://...) in a response here.<br />

<blockquote>I can do it VIA VBA, but the data is all different. One thing may need to be called 12.10, but something else is called 12.100... So I would need to do a different VBA script for each cell... and there are about 4000 of them.
 And yes, all of the trailing 0s are there. They show up if I go to the "Data" tab and click "From Text," but then there is the issue with commas in a column. Because it's a CSV, or comma delimited for those who don't know, it splits each cell for every comma.
 So while cells are saved in text as:</blockquote>

            <p>You will have a problem importing the text file, even with a custom procedure, unless there is a way to determine what is data and what is the description. In other words, how can the code tell whether a comma is a field delimiter or is part of a description?
 Are there a fixed number of fields, before the description, in each line of data. For example, would it be the case that the first 5 commas are data delimiters and anything else past that is description text? Without some means of determining where the data
 ends and the description begins, you can't do what you want to do.&nbsp; If the file has this distinction, the code&nbsp;is trivial.</p>

            Don't double-click the .CSV and expect it to import to Excel correctly. Excel's built-in 'error control' will make changes that may not be appropriate for your data. Open a blank&nbsp;workbook&nbsp;and use
<i>Data, From Text</i>&nbsp;to start the import process.
<div><br />
<div>On the first screen (Step 1 of 3) of the <i>Text Import Wizard</i>&nbsp;choose&nbsp;<i>Delimited</i>&nbsp;and click
<i>Next</i>.</div>
<div><br />
<div>On the second screen&nbsp;(Step 2 of 3) choose <i>Comma</i>&nbsp;as the <i>Delimiters</i>&nbsp;and clear everything else. You should see a sample portion of your CSV separate into defined columns. Click
<i>Next</i>.</div>
<div><br />
<div>On the third screen&nbsp;(Step 3 of 3) select the column with the leading zero numbers and choose
<i>Text</i>&nbsp;as the <i>Column data format</i>. Repeat for any other seemingly numeric columns that should not be converted to numbers or numbers to scientific notation. Click&nbsp;<i>Finish</i>&nbsp;and select a location for the imported data.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your .CSV should be imported correctly. When it is time to save (i.e. <i>Export</i>) your file, use

I had taken it for granted that you were right about the Text Import wizard.&nbsp; But it appears that you are incorrect, at least if the CSV file is constructed correctly.<br />
<br />
If you saved the CSV file using Excel, the CSV file will look like this when opened in Notepad:<br />
<br />
cell one,"cell two, with some random data",cell three<br />
<br />
Note that the contents of cell two are enclosed with double-quotes because its content includes a comma.<br />
<br />
<br />
To "open" the CSV file, I create a new workbook, then I click on Data, Get External Data, From Text.&nbsp; After selecting the CSV file, I select "delimited" in the first menu and just "comma" separator in the second menu.&nbsp; The Text Import wizard correctly shows
 the following 3 (not 4) columns:<br />
<br />

<br />
And when I click on Finish, the data are correctly entered into A1, A2 and A3 as intended.<br />

<br />
This is a separate issue.<br />
<br />
Excel is not "removing" the leading and trailing zeros.&nbsp; It is merely interpreting the text as numbers and formatting them as General.<br />
<br />
As long as the "numbers" are 15 digits or less, no information is lost.<br />
<br />
You have several options.<br />
<br />
You could manually reformat those cells so that the appropriate number of leading and trailing zeros are displayed.&nbsp; Alternatively, you could write a VBA procedure to do that.<br />
<br />
(You might be able to use an event macro so that you do not need to run the VBA procedure manually.&nbsp; I would need to investigate further.&nbsp; Are you interested?)<br />
<br />
Alternatively, in the final menu displayed above, you can select each column with such data and click on Text.<br />
<br />
However, the data will then be interpreted as text, not numeric.&nbsp; That might be okay in some contexts.&nbsp; It might cause problems in other contexts.<br />
<br />

<br />
I believe Excel does the same thing.&nbsp; The real issue is how the text between the double-quotes is interpreted.<br />
<br />
IMHO, the double-quotes should mean that the text should not be changed.&nbsp; For Excel, that would mean that for "00012.0000", either it should be entered as a number with an appropriate Custom format to preserve the leading or trailing zeros, or (more likely)
 it should be entered as text.<br />
<br />
But AFAIK, there is no standard for interpreting CSVs.&nbsp; (RFC 4180 covers only how to create CSV files, not how to interpret them.)&nbsp; Besides, Excel's treatment of CSV files predates any "standard".&nbsp; Changing Excel's interpretation now might create backward-compatibility
 issues.&nbsp; (Just a complication; not unsolvable.)<br />
<br />
Not trying to make excuses for Microsoft; and I do not speak for them.&nbsp; Just trying to offer some insight into why MS might not change this, despite enduring many years of complaints from all of us.<br />
