<h2>            My account has been suspended &#40;two of them&#41;. Cannot access verification code. Account is hacked.</h2>
                    <p>Two of my accounts are now suspended.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First one Hotmail and now a new outlook one</p>
<p>I cannot get a verification code. I put in my phone number and then I get a message 'usage limit exceeded try again tomorrow. how can i resolve this as it seems both have been hacked.
</p>
<p>One is my paypal linked email so very important for me </p>
<p>Is there a huge vulnerability with outlook accounts and how can I contact Microsoft. I have tried the virtual assistant and it sends me round in circles and back to the enter phone number screen&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at my wits end, and very worried.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would like some help please Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            Dear Glenn ,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />If your account is suspended, please try to unblock it using tips in this article <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13956/microsoft-account-temporarily-suspended" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13956/...</a> If you exceeded the limit, you can try to use another phone number for verification If you will be unable, it means that it is compromised <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/10494/microsoft-account-how-to-access-a-compromised-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/10494/...</a> and not suspended.

<p>Hi Glenys</p>
<p>that email doesnt sound genuine to me</p>
<p>i dont think microsoft would say ‘please reply us’</p>
<p>the language sounds odd</p>
<p>have you checked out the email address it came from?</p>
<p>does seem an awful lot of phishing and hacking around</p>
<p>i eas relying on windows defender and bitlocker but now im investing in some betyer security and a vpn as i travel a lot and hotel wifi is not very safe. Not sure that the hotmail, outlook etc ate very dafe either</p>
<p>
</p><p>think if you can still sign in on web and account is active id delete email and change your password</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope you get to bottom of it</p>

<p>Thanks Glenn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did check the email address it came from which came up as Hotmail but when I went back to see if I could get an address on the reply it was dodgy - guess I was just being extra careful.</p>
<p>On the plus side it did make me think so downloaded emails and addresses which were really important.</p>
<p>I travel loads too, both in UK and abroad and have a good security system set up, can't trust somethings now.</p>

<p>I want to make sure I do it right, so I'm not locked out of my admin page, email, or website. The website accepts traffic for both domains and I would like to keep it that way for now.</p>

<p>Hi Junior,</p>
<p>To address your concern about the possibility of account lock out, I'd like to suggest creating another Office 365 admin account.</p>
<p>To change the assoicated domain, go to Office 365 admin center &gt; <strong>Users</strong> &gt;
<strong>Active Users</strong> &gt; Select account &gt; <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>
Details</strong> &gt; select the domain under <strong>User name</strong>.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />

<h2>            Podcast Problems - unable to manage podcast feeds</h2>
                    Device: Nokia Lumia 1050<br />
Problem Application: Music - Podcasts<br />
<br />
Trying to deal with podcasts directly on the device has been something of a nightmare.I leave the default settings to be 3 episodes per podcast, newest first.&nbsp; However, every time I check my phone, I have between 4-6 podcasts for a given show, and if I delete
 any of them, or mark them played, it just starts downloading more.<br />
<br />
I don't want it to download more. I want to be able to manage the space and only keep the podcasts that I haven't listened to yet.&nbsp; I shouldn't have to leave podcasts that I've played on the phone as placeholders.&nbsp; This should be tracked by a file, database,
<i>something.</i> Tracking which podcasts have been played on my account, and which podcasts I've already downloaded in the past should
<b>NOT</b> be that hard.&nbsp; Maybe I'm missing something.&nbsp; But on my old Samsung Focus, using the Zune software, podcasts were easy, I had 1-2 episodes from each show I followed that I hadn't listened to.&nbsp; And when I finished listening to them, next connection
 to the Zune software, it pulled the listened to shows off my phone.<br />
<br />
TL;DR version:&nbsp; You've already proven you have the technical know how to allow tracking of which podcasts I've listened to several years ago.&nbsp; Please implement it on your new phones.

<p>
</p><p>One quick anecdote, perhaps....</p>
<p>
</p><p>One day I came into the room to find him wearing bad/awful wig. He was bald as a, well, bald-eagle and this was rather a shock. I must have looked at him with eyes like saucers, but he just glanced at me, smiled and continued reading his book. So I stared
 some more and went about my business, which was playing with toys my grandparents had played with when
<em>they</em> were young. What Glory! Occasionally, gramps would fiddle with his wig in a way that was getting more and more ridiculous until I finally started to get it that something was on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still not sure what was going on, I went, "Err", pointing at my hair. </p>
<p>"Oh", he said, "I'll be going by train and this way, I'll be sure to have the compartment by myself". And went on reading his book.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can tell you, this was followed by some 'diverse alarums'. Going on for quite some time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now I remember another one. Thank you, I will rest well tonight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you wil too and all my best to you,</p>
<p>Stephen</p>

            "it's a feature, not a bug" ... &lt;sigh&gt;<br />
<br />
Starter is a "click to run" installation. That limits the things you can do to fix this sort of problem.&nbsp; You can do an Office, repair, uninstall and reinstall ... that's it.<br />
<br />
<b>HP instructions on Office Starter Repair, Program Manager, Uninstall Starter and Re-install Starter via Program Manager in Pictures</b>
<div>
<p>
Although they are by HP, they can by used on many computers. The best instructions I've seen for "fixing" Office Starter are this HP page:</p>
<p><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=uk&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;docname=c02981221#N272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.co`m/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=uk&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;docname=c02981221#N272</a></p>
<p><span>Starter is not actually installed on your computer. It runs inside of a “virtual computer”</span> , “computer within a computer”,
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>located in the “Q:\” drive and the program code is downloaded over the internet every time the program is started. Therefore there are limited things we as users can do to "fix" starter:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Run an Office Repair on Starter</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Confirm that you have the KB 2553141 update (in theory it should be there ‘automatically’ … )</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Use "MS Office Manager" to re-install Starter from the Windows program Manager</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Re-install WINDOWS from the recovery partition, wiping all installed programs and personal data files!</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Phone the OEM who supposed to support Starter. They will tell you to do steps 1-4 and then lie to you and tell you to call MS!</span></p>

<p>On this HP notebook, if you go to the Advanced Recovery Methods page in Control Panel, you're given an option to "Return your computer to factory condition." After a restart, you're presented with these three options. The Minimize Image
 Recovery option does exactly what it sounds like. You get a clean Windows installation, with the proper drivers and required HP utilities. But trialware and other unwanted software are completely missing. On a default installation, the Programs option in Control
 Panel includes 50 entries. Using this option, the same list is stripped down to a mere 25 entries.</p>

<p>Getting the error 0x80188308 / 80188308 error when trying to install the critical update to fix random reboot issue for Windows Phone 8.1</p>
<p>***And so I post this to bring the issue to the attention of Microsoft***</p>
<p>
</p><p>specs</p>
<p>-----------</p>
<p>HTC 8X Windows 8.1 with update 1 installed</p>
<p>OS version: 8.10.14203.306</p>
<p>Firmware revision number: 3030.0.52009.605</p>

<p>
</p><p>issue</p>
<p>-------------------</p>
<p>- update downloads fine</p>
<p>- 'Preparing to install' progress to 72%...pauses awhile...advances to 78% pauses...finally to 100%<br />
- offers to 'install'.....select 'install'</p>
<p>- phone restarts...HTC...Verizon.... gears....restart...HTC....Verizon....Windows....lockscreen....</p>
<p>- Check Phone Updates....fails with error message 0x80188308...try again later</p>
<p>Multiple attempts fail</p>
<p>------------------------------------<br />
<em>Can't update phone<br />
It's probably a temporary problem. Try again, go to Settings &gt; Phone update (0x80188308)<br />
</em>-------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&nbsp;-----------------------------<br />
<em>Sorry, but we are having trouble updating your phone. Please try again in a little while (80188308)</em></p>
<p><em>-----------------------------</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>From other refs to this MS updating &nbsp;error I see something about insufficient 'System install space' (not User space), about which nothing can be done to alleviate by the user. MS seems to have re-packaged the update in the past to go-around this&nbsp;error/problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question: Can MS address this issue/provide a fix/re-packaged update please? This seems to be a reoccurring issue with the&nbsp;Windows Phone 8 updates.&nbsp;</strong><em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Note: I tried the MS 'Stop Restart' fixit at link below to no avail...it just defaults back to 'need to install update first'.</p>

            <p><strong>Update (8/5)</strong>:</p>
<p>We have made another publishing change to the mandatory update which we believe should fix outlying HTC 8X devices still getting the prompt for the "Critical" update (again, only this "critical"/"important" update has been stopped). Just as before, your
 device may need to fail the install on the currently downloaded update and/or wait for the update to age-off after a few days before it re-scans Microsoft's update servers and finds there is no update available any longer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update (7/13)</strong>:</p>
<p>To address the ongoing update failure (80188308) experienced by some HTC 8X and 8XT phones, we've stopped delivery the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=615857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
mandatory update</a> to these devices. Within a few days these phones will stop prompting you to download and install the mandatory update. The vast majority of these HTC 8X and 8XT phones already applied a similar fix to the mandatory update by taking advantage
 of an existing 'self-healing' system component. To learn more about the situation and how to use an app to confirm your phone is OK and will not restart periodically, go to
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=614824" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft remains committed to ensuring HTC phones have a great experience on Windows Phone, and will continue to work with HTC for future improvements and solutions to impacted phones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update (6/24)</strong>:</p>
<p>For those of you who are doing or plan to do a <a href="https://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/settings-and-personalization/reset-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
hard reset</a> as a means of getting the update installed, a bit of advice to improve your chances of success:</p>
<p>
</p><p>After performing the hard reset (Settings &gt; About, reset phone) do not restore from backup. Instead, skip signing in and go directly to Settings &gt; Phone update and download any pending updates. Once the updates are installed, hard reset again and this time
 you should restore from backup. The difference is that you'll be restoring to a fully updated phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update (6/23)</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey everyone - so here's the situation so far. First, we know why you are failing with this error. As many of you have correctly identified, the issue is related to lack of system partition space; a storage area of the phone you can't manage directly, for
 the most part. Performing actions like a hard reset or even restarting, etc. can influence the overall size of what's taking up space there and is why some of you have reported success by doing those things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, we're republishing the <a href="https://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/basics/why-am-i-seeing-a-critical-update-notification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
mandatory update</a> as a prerequisite "hard stop". Meaning, it'll download and install by itself first instead of as a co-install with other update(s), which some of you may have been receiving. Since the update is very small in size this way, we expect it'll
 increase the success rate dramatically. However...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update you already have downloaded may stay on your phone for up to five days before it 'times out' and you can go and re-check for the update we are actively republishing. Performing a hard reset would also allow for this more immediately, of course,
 but many of you may choose to wait and see how it goes when your phone re-pulls the update after the 'time out' period. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That all said, future updates or other existing and pending updates that are larger in size may still fall into the same situation you are currently experiencing. The issue with the system partition space getting filled unnecessarily is something Microsoft
 has worked with HTC on in the past, as other phones aren't necessarily afflicted by the same, and will continue to look into this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Original (6/22)</strong>: &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to all who have raised this issue for our awareness and attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While some of the suggested work arounds may work for some, I recognize that these steps aren't working for everyone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is actively looking into this problem, and I will reply back when I have more information to share.</p>

                    <span>
<p>Used Microsoft Equation. Worked well at first. Equation editor and menus appeared on doc and when clicked outside of the editor the equation would appear on the doc. Then the equation editor started coming up as a big box and after I typed in the equation
 and clicked X, the equation would appear as {Embed Equation.3} on the doc. Thought I could uninstall ME to solve the problem and did, but all the {Embed Equation .3} stuff stayed&nbsp; on all the docs. How do I get everything back to normal? Thanks for the help.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                    From my Android-based mobile phone, I attempted to forward a single email in my Hotmail account on Hotmail/Outlook's mobile web site containing a travel itinerary to a Gmail account. The email arrived, but it had no contents. I tried this three times,
 and three times a blank email arrived. &nbsp;When I forwarded the same email using my Safari browser on my Mac desktop computer from Hotmail/Outlook, the email forwarded correctly with the contents. &nbsp;What happened? Why did the email arrive blank when I sent it
 from my phone?

<h2>            Excel export file without changing file type of original document&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to export a file without changing the file format type of original document?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So say I am working in myfile.xlsx and I want to export it to a csv file. Currently I can do a SAVE AS and choose CSV, but when after it is done exporting, the document has changed to myfile.csv and I am no longer working in myfile.xlsx. I have to re-save-as
 and choose xlsx now to get back to original document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I export myfile.xlsx as a .csv instead of using Save As so that the original document I am working in stays as an xlsx?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<li>Export is just another name for Save As - the process is the same regardless of name, &amp;</li><li>File management on OS X is [pretty much] dictated by Apple</li></ol>
<p>If you're using a newer version of OS X (10.8 or Later) you might see if the <strong>
Duplicate</strong> command is available from the <strong>File</strong> menu. It may be an acceptable alternative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option similar to what Bob G suggested;</p>

<h2>            Can you turn Auto-capitalization Off in OneNote online</h2>
                    <p>I have done the free upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10, which went great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I am playing with Windows 10 OneNote (which I guess is the OneNote online freebie).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What a letdown - I expected much more when based on the Microsoft promotions for this product (have been using OneNote 2010 on my Windows 7 system for quite some time, and love it - just want some thing improved like mainly printing control).</p>
<p>
</p><p>[By the way, the&nbsp;OneNote in Windows 10 - and the OneNote online freebie - and the offer I get&nbsp;in OneNote 2010 to upgrade to a later version of OneNote -- are all the same product, aren't they].</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, to my question - in the Windows 10 OneNote (the Toy OneNote) I am playing with, it is&nbsp;"auto-capitalizing" the first letter of the first word of what it thinks is a new sentence (I guess) - is there any way to turn that annoying feature off?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting in the Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no way to currently turn off the auto-capitalize feature for the online product, but we would like to understand your scenario to determine if this would be a very common scenario. Would please let us know what you are using OneNote for and why
 you would like to turn off auto-capitalize?</p>

</p><p>I USE OneNote A LOT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I "live" with it's erratic behavior (like creating tables when I don't want it to, like taking over my Lists and Indentations when I don't want it to, like not functioning very nicely when trying to drag comments around in tables, etc. -- and most importantly,
 OneNote's lack of any printing control, causing me to break comments and data up into separate pages in order to control what I want to print).</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as far as "Auto-Capitalization", I have a lot of information (in tables, non-tables, lists, etc.) that is essentially comments (not complete sentences) where the Capitalization is un-necessary and un-wanted. &nbsp;In particular, email address -- and passwords
 is a particular annoyance since passwords are all case-sensitive.<br />
</p>
<p>And to reemphasize, it is particularly annoying in tables (that I am forced to use) where a lot of the entries are just comments (i.e. not complete sentences)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just don't like "Auto-Capitalization", and I rarely use it, even when it is available as an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my 2 suggestions are:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;Get rid of Auto-Capitalization entirely (not particularly needed in OneNote)</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;Make it an option - since you already have it there and it "sort-of" works</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now my lectures / comments:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- You don't have Auto-Capitalization in the Office version of OneNote (unless it is some option that I don't know about) - are people complaining about that.</p>
<p>- Auto-Capitalization is a pain to those that don't want it -- i.e. it is a real pain to fix (like backing up and re-typing the lower-case character). &nbsp;I guess I should be thankful that you can even correct it in that way.</p>
<p>- Most people are totally accustomed to doing the Shift-char thing WHEN they want Capitalization (i.e. only the few people who are too lazy to use the Shift-key really want or need Auto-Capitalization).</p>
<p>OK, ENOUGH ON AUTO-CAPITALIZATION -- NOW CONCERNING ONENOTE ONLINE</p>
<p>- OneNote online is awful (when compared to the Office version of OneNote)</p>
<p>- Why did Microsoft release such a inferior product - it is featureless compared to Office OneNote</p>
<p>- Why does the Microsoft promotion of the OneNote online product make it appear to be a great substitute</p>
<p>- From comments on the Internet, most people LOVE the Office OneNote,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;so why damage its reputation by releasing such an inferior product</p>
<p>- Why would anybody want this product (except that it is FREE)</p>
<p>- Why would anybody ever use this product (except that it is FREE)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My 90-year old mother-in-law would LOVE to get and use OneNote - BUT she particularly wants one of the features of the Office version of OneNote, the &nbsp;Screen Clipping feature -- BUT</p>
<p>- she is anti-cloud (you know how those 90-year old computer users are)</p>
<p>- not sure she would use it (screen clipping) even if it was in the online version (because it is cloud)</p>
<p>- doesn't to pay for the stand-alone Office version</p>
<p>- [I am working on her cloud-phobia - but not making much progress, particularly since I can't demonstrate to her a worthwhile OneNote product.]</p>
<p>- YES, it does accept typed in notes, but that is about the only good thing I can say about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, sorry -- this got a little long, didn't it.</p>

<p>Please help us with this requirement. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Web note taking applications from every single computer where I have no privileges to install a software client. &nbsp;In this scenario, the only way to access OneNote is with OneNote Online, but this does not help since every single line is "corrected"
 with capital letter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help with this requirement.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;why you would like to turn off auto-capitalize? &lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Only someone who never had to deal with auto-capitalize can ask such question (...ooor someone who wants to avoid work?)</p>
<p>Good explanation is provided on <a href="https://onenote.uservoice.com/forums/327183-onenote-online/suggestions/31259317-please-turn-off-auto-capitalization-or-give-us-the" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page</a>:</p>
<p>...Here are a few cases where many users would not want a capital letter at the start of a line (table cell): passwords, email addresses, scientific terms, citations, poetry. We are not idiots who can't use a shift button. Please give us control of how text
 appears in OneNote. Mandatory auto-correct features become constant problems for many users, and make the app LESS functional for us</p>
<p>...And also after each abbreviation. I.e. When I use abbr. Like e.g. Jan., Feb., etc., the dot is always evaluated as period/full stop/end of sentence. Like T N said, as if we were idiots wo don't know when we mean to end a sentence.</p>

<p>Thanks for the great feedback, really appreciate it. We are considering offering
<span>customization on settings including auto-capitalization. On Word online, w</span>e have built such an option to allow user to disable the auto-capitalization. And the next step is to populate it among other web products
 including OneNote online and PPT online. Please feel free to send us feedbacks/comments on it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>BTW, for folks who are using the offline version of OneNote (i.e.OneNote 2010), there are ways to enable/disable the auto-cap by going to the File-&gt;Options-&gt;Proofing-&gt;Autocorrect Options...</p>

<p>Thanks very much for the detailed feedback. We understand the pain when autocorrect works unexpectedly. Unfortunately, we do not have a confirmed date on the schedule, but your feedback is very helpful and will be considered while prioritizing all the feature
 on our backlog.</p>
<p>A workaround in case you haven't been aware of: if a word is auto-capitalized, you can make a undo to cancel the capitalization for that specific occurrence. It's not very convenient but can work around the issue at this moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Group of shapes and animations</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys !&nbsp;<br />
I am making a presentation, where are a lot of user icons.<br />
The user icon consists of 2 shapes ( head and body).<br />
I need often to change the color of the user, BUT, the "Fill color" animation is not available when i make a group of these two shapes. It gives me some troubles, because after that i want to make motion animations, but it is very hard if the "user" is not
 grouped.<br />
<br />
Why it is working only when the shapes are selected separately ?&nbsp;<br />
</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon checking, most of the animation will be greyed-out when you group the shapes. Any effects that will change the color of the shapes will be greyed-out once you've grouped the shapes. We suggest that you keep the shapes ungrouped so that the
<strong>Fill Color</strong> animation will be selectable. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want PowerPoint to have a feature that will allow you to select any animations that will alter the color of the shapes even if they are grouped, we highly recommend that you post it
<strong><a href="https://powerpoint.uservoice.com/forums/288949-powerpoint-for-windows-desktop-application" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> so that our Engineers can look into your suggestion and add it in the future update of PowerPoint.
 We also recommend that you post the link of your suggestion in this thread so that other community members can vote for your suggested feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have any other questions, feel free to reply to this thread.</p>

<p>Where i can find this tool ? Don't see it in Powerpoint.<br />
<br />
This user shape was created in Illustrator, and imported as EMF file.&nbsp; But I tried with 2 simple shapes in powerpoint, and it also doesnt color fill if grouped.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you select both shapes, then go to Drawing tools, format tab, insert shapes group, the button merge shapes is there, click on it and you will be given 5 options, one of them is combine. To make it work both shapes must touch each other.
</p>
<p>So if you want the head to be slightly detached from the body you will have to apply a thick white border to it.</p>

<p>I started having the BSOD using Outlook 2007 in Windows 10. I was able to solve this problem by setting the properties on the outlook.exe file. I set the compatibility mode to ‘Windows 7’ and under settings I checked the ‘reduced color
 mode’. I’m not sure which option fixed my problem. The resolution on Outlook is not as good, but it works. I did purchase Office 2019 with my new computer, but I really don’t like it. I might be forced to upgrade in the near future.</p>

            I tried both ways. sharing video directly from camera roll folder. when i try to share a photo from camera roll i get option of watsapp along with google mail, etc. however when i try to share video, i get other options but not watsapp.<br />
The other i did was, to open watsapp, go to chat where i want to share video. click attach icon i select choose from albums which opens camera roll folder where only photos r visible, the videos r not there to select<br />
Please suggest

            I have a similar issue. I can share my saved pictures via the whatsapp option very quickly, but when I try and do it from the camera roll it loads whatsapp but doesn't give me any contacts.<br />
Also, when I try and play back videos I have taken with my phone it is telling me that there is an error and the video cannot be played on my phone.<br />
<br />
I'm really upset because I have lost some good memories. Has this happened to anyone else or does anyone have any ideas?

<p>Actually apps can have access to media which is the exception to the rule here. So it most definitely is an issue with Whatsapp.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Insider Preview 10076 - Flashing Grey Screen Upon Boot</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello. I have been having a problem with my Windows 10 Insider Preview version 10076. I tried to update to it while I was away from home, and when I got back, the screen had been flashing my primary color (grey) and black. I have tried pressing Shift
 + F8 to get to safe mode, but the same thing happens. In case you are about to ask what kind of PC/Laptop I have, it is a HP Notebook 2000 (or HP 2000 Notebook).</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is a little bit of the story on how this started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't think before installing the first build, so I didn't create a backup. (I don't remember specific build numbers) With the first build, my mouse didn't work. It did on the second one. Then on the one where the design was almost completely revamped,
 I couldn't open my start menu. Then when 10076 came out, I updated it when I went away for a couple hours. Now we are back at the top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of writing this, I am on another computer. My laptop is on it's table, plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is all the information I can really give right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Nathan</p>
<p>
</p><p>====================================================================</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened was that I must have restarted enough times for my computer to automatically take me to the recovery menu (or I may have pressed something without knowing). I pressed Roll Back to Previous Build and now it works. I continued and only my internet
 needed to be re-connected. Thank you Srimadhwa B. for helping, but it didn't recognize my flash drive for some reason.</p>

            Hi I have 2 Nokia 920s firstly they are not compatible with the Windows 10 update but you should be able to get 8.1 by simply going to update and tapping update now if it doesn't take you to 8.1 try doing a soft reset by pressing and holding the volume
 down and the power buttons until they vibrates and restarts don't touch the screen until it restarts let us know how you go or if you need more help rgds Roy

            Please, remove the SIM tray and a have a look for a 7-letter (Product) Code (starts with 059). That determines your firmware variant. That determines your latest firmware version. By the way, even with Windows Phone 8.1 or Lumia Denim you do not get Windows

            I know you probably don't want to hear this as I noticed you said your,new 920, but I updated to a 930 so I could get W10 but after trying it I went back to 8.1 having said that I can recommend the 930 it's probably the best phone I have had it is currently
 running on Windows 8.1 2nd update so it has hey Cortana and Bluetooth4.0 so the battery seems to last forever Roy

<p>Hi Sean,</p>
<p>To better understand your situation, I’d like to collect the following information:<br />
1.&nbsp;Are you unable to add specific users or all users?<br />
2.&nbsp;Create another group and see if the issue occurs.<br />
3.&nbsp;Use an admin account to check if the user can be added to this group via PowerShell.</p>

<li><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell</a> with an admin account.
</li><li>Run the cmdlet: <em>Add-UnifiedGroupLinks -Identity "<strong>group name</strong>" -LinkType Members -Links

<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>Question was: &nbsp;all users or specific. &nbsp;I experienced with 2 particular users, not all.</p>
<p>So, I finally got around to this and when I tested on step 2 with the same users, no error. &nbsp;So, I just went back to the original group ... no problem this time. &nbsp; So I guess it was some issue in O365 at that specific time. &nbsp;The condition lasted for over
 an hour though. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t sign in with Microsoft Account to Windows 8 HTC 8x, setting time doesn&#39;t help</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I just got an HTC 8x from my neighbor (WP8). I'm new to Windows Phone. </p>
<p>I'm trying to set up the phone but when I try to sign in with my Microsoft Account I keep getting the error:</p>
<p>"Can't Connect&nbsp; We're having a problem signing in. Make sure you have good reception. If you do, the problem may be on the other end. Wait a little while and try again."</p>
<p>Well, I tried it over several days now. Wi-Fi connection is good an solid. I re-started the phone several times. I completely reset the phone twice. I checked the time and date settings. Nothing seems to help.</p>
<p>One thing: I did not have a Microsoft account previously and set one up just for this phone. Is there anything particular I net to set up in this account for it to work with the phone?</p>
<p>Any other ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

                    I do all the scheduling for my boss who has shared her outlook calendar with me and given me full edit rights.&nbsp; Up until yesterday, I could have both HER calender and MY calendar selected/open and could see ALL of her appointments and ALL of my appointments
 at the same time for any given week. The problem starting yesterday is that NOW, whenever I have MY calendar open/selected, many but not all of her appointments disappear. I can actually see appointments disappear when I click my calendar to display as well.
 When I de-select my calendar, her missing appointments&nbsp;miraculously REAPPEAR. This is driving me crazy and our web tech team is stumped. PLEASE HELP ME.&nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>In that scenario, please share the file with the user again with Edit Permission to check the outcome. To do that:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If that couldn't help, I'd like to collect the following information for further investigation.</p>
<p>1.Check the user's permission for the particular spreadsheet and provide a screenshot of the result. To check the Permission:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Open the library to find the spreadsheet&gt;Click the ellipses(…) next to the file name&gt; Select

            When it comes to games that essentially exit the desktop to render a game full-screen, there is no guarantee a desktop sharing application will display anything. Overlay software may not help the situation either. Place your game in windowed mode, then
 try to share that window. If that works and you find the window distracting, you can look into using borderless window mode tools that might be able to remove the border.

<p><span><span>Welcome to the Skype Community Forum.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>We apologize for the inconvenience. <span>
The system</span> might be updating but this is just temporary and should be back
<span>to</span> normal within 24 hours. That being said, I suggest to try the following below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Use other browser </li><li>Clear your browser cache and cookies</li><li>Exit your browser then re-launch </li><li>Sign in using In-private browsing</li><li>If all else fails, restart your device and router or try again at a later time.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Kindly reply to this thread if you have additional questions. Glad to assist further.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Regards,</span></span></p>
