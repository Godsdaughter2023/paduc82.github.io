            I am having the very same issue, but only with browsers. My keyboard will operate with Word, or anything else, but after updates of 9/14/2013 my system has never recovered from&nbsp;Microsoft's update; I've restored it THREE times, and it runs fine back to
 that point, but after successfully installing updates again, anytime I load ANY browser I cannot enter any search info and browser stops operating, "checks for solutions online" (has anyone EVER found one of those?~think it's a ruse from MS anyway) and browser
 shuts down with NO solution from Microsoft (as always!) I guess the 'community' will have to figure it out for them. &nbsp; Sure tired of THAT response from MS! Looks like they're putting out their 'beta-ware' updates again.

            <p>Had already run the troubleshooter, and found no problems. How do I know what update is related to what when you release them 20+ at a time? Which one should I disable? which one is corrupting my driver? I spent about two days reinstalling TOSHIBA drivers
 after MS wrote over all of my work with "Microsoft's system repair".&nbsp; After that was done,&nbsp;system was operating fine until the release of the 22 updates all at once.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had many problems with MS drivers overwriting Toshiba drivers in updates and system repair.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps y'all shouldn't be messing with manufacturer's drivers if I have to reinstall Tosiba's afterward, anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How an I to reinstall ANY driver with an inoperable keyboard after your update? It seems to me that if a manufacturer requires a specific driver from THEM then MS should be bright enough to figure that out before they release something that writes over it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do thank you for even responding, though, as it's the first time I've ever received any constructive advice from MS on anything, at all, so I sincerely thank you for that, and would appreciate an&nbsp;effective solution or methodology. This kind of thing happens
 with virtually every update in some form or other; rarely is there one without ANY issues, but this one is especially irritating as there's 22 updates at one time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks!</p>

<h2>            Getting Critical_structure_corruption &#40;tcpip&#47;sys&#41; BSOD on Windows 10 computer</h2>
                    <p>Old title: critical_structure_corruption (tcpip/sys)</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I keeping getting a random BSOD with "critical_structure_corruption (tcpip/sys)" as the reason. I then have to wait approximately 10 seconds during which time Microsoft are collecting information about the error. This seemed to be introduced after the last
 Windows update Tuesday. I couldn't find the cause so did a system restore and all was fine again until the following morning when Microsoft automatically installed the updates again. A rollback doesn't fix the problem now.</p>
<p>When are Microsoft going to fix it for me?<br />
I have got an old-ish motherboard who's latest BIOS update was 2010 so I can't help but think this may be the reason. I've tried everything else.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <blockquote>I didn't ask if anyone knew what it was. I asked how to find it.</blockquote>
<p>Ask an ambiguous question and you might not get the answer you expected. See <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/555375" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/555375</a>&nbsp;for guidance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>I am setting up my exchange email account on my iphone and the only info left to fill in is Server in the form of server.company.com
</blockquote>
<p>So exactly where does it say above that you have asked "how to find it"? And I am none the wiser even now. Do you mean where in your building is it? How would I know? Go looking for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you mean the name of the server, as I have already stated this can either be entered as an IP address , i.e. a 'public' IP address, or it might be referred to by name as dictated by DNS servers on the internet. If your exchange server does not have a
 (fixed) public IP address then you need to get one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contact your IT department or the people who host your domain/exchange server/e-mail. Speculation is pointless, this forum cannot help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, if my memory serves me correctly, default set up of Exchange Server does not permit iPhone access. So you are probably going to have to get someone to enable this if it hasn't already been done for someone else. If it has already been done for
 someone else ask them what their settings are. Also, firewalls may need to have ports opened up.</p>

            It's in the tittle of the question. "How do I find my server information?". Other people managed to try to help without the initial snide comment. Where in the building? Thanks, but really? I know these kind of comments are typical but try to rise above
 it if you can manage it.

    <title>Secrets you may have learned the hard way, but I bet nobody told you. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> barry the gibb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Secrets you may have learned the hard way, but I bet nobody told you.</h2>
                    
<p>I'm not a real good shot, so I have to rely on tactics more than anything else. Here's some things that've saved my butt and/or got me kills. Feel free to add yours but try to avoid the ones that everyone's told before. Tell us YOUR secrets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
KILLCAM. Don't be the idiot that shoots somebody then stays exactly where you shot them from. Experienced playes know the maps like the back of their hands and will identify where you are from the killcam and come back to slit your throat. LEARN THE COUNT-
 next time you're killed yourself start counting and note your count from A) time&nbsp;of death to end of killcam and B) end of killcam to re-spawn. Then when you know your count use it when you kill somebody ESPECIALLY if you're near a flag because if they've got
 any kegs they'll be determined to re-spawn at that flag and get their vengeance on you. So when you kill them, use the time of A (death to Killcam) to feint - run to (or stay) where you WANT them to think you're gonna be and then use B (killcam to re-spawn)
 to get into the position that you WANT to be. You can set traps this way - there's the spot where you want the vengeful enemy to think you are, and then there's the spot from which you're watching the spot where the vengeful enemy thinks you are. So when he
 comes back to slit your throat, it's&nbsp; you that runs up behind him and slits his. Of course if you're not near a spawn point this is pretty irrelevant but it's a good habit to get into for when you are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
DEAD LEGS. Whenever taking shelter in a structure, DO NOT hide yourself up close to a wall and go prone (in fact I don't wether standing, squatting or prone). The reason is because if your legs or other parts of your anatomy are butting up against that wall
 - they'll stick out the other side wether it be through solid concrete or cold steel. And an enemy on the other side will see your legs and shoot you in the ankles until you are dead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
SPOTTING. "Just mash the back button" - anyone told you that? WRONG! The game has an anti-mash built in so if you mash you maaaaaay or maaay not spot the first enemy, but none after that. Slow, deliberate spotting giving the machine the chance to know you're
 NOT mashing is the way to go. You can still scan/spot, just be slow and deliberate about it. For an example of this in action next time you see a parachute, point at it and mash and you'll see you spot nothing, Now point at it and press once - enemy parachute
 spotted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
CAPPING I. If you're lucky enough to be in a squad with mics or running with a mate, when you all rush to cap a flag DO NOT all rush in there at once. One go in - if it starts capping there's nobody there, it don't there's at least one enemy there. So now bring
 in a second squaddie, if it's capping you know there's one enemy there, if it doesn't at least two. And so on and on with 3-4 squaddies working together. Knowing how many enemies you face is an advantage so use it. If you're real skillful (and I'm not particularly)
 you can tell how many enemies there are just by the speed of the capping so if you got this skill or are capable of developing it do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
CAPPING II. On your own. DO NOT run into the centre and sit by the flag. Look for cover as close to the edge of the capping circle as possible and then defend the approaches - DON'T stay on the edge looking IN at the flag, stay on the edge looking OUT. The
 reason is that if you're right near the edge and it's capping, the flag itself has your back. Anyone enters the circle and you'll be alerted, so you can look outwards defending the approaches. If you're looking at the flag then someone can sneak up from the
 approach (if you're on the edge) and stab you in the back without you knowing they're coming. For them to do it while you're guarding the approach, they have to enter the capping circle and so you'll be alerted to their presence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
DEFENDING. Some may call it camping and I know it's not etiquette. But some maps do lend themselves to flag defense and I'm looking at the AK maps as I have an obsession of keeping the Gunship flags in friendly hands. So if you're guarding flags take a bit
 from the above CAPPING II. DON'T sit inside the capping circle as if one enemy enters you won't know he's there but he'll know you are (2+ you will if you're alone). Find defensive positions outside the capping circle where you can attack with first shot advantage
 if you see them coming, and if you don't then at least you'll know an enemy has arrived because the flag will start capping and then you'll have the advantage of knowing he's there while he doesn't know you are... untiil of course you step over the cap line
 and do your best defending it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
MINES. This is a tip I picked up from a mine laying guru on Youtube and it's a beauuuuuuutiful one - USE RUBBLE. Once things start getting blown up in game you'll find bits of concrete, assorted crap, even things that look suspiciouly like pizza boxes lying
 around the place. Lay your mines directly on them and sometimes (not all) you'll see that they disappear straight into them -and even when they don't you can position them so that they can't be spotted from the approach you expect the enemy to come. Some rubble
 you can even push around into position as demonstrated by the Youtube bloke but i never really bother with that, I just use the rubble where it lay if it's in a good enough spot. Done right the mines CAN NOT BE SPOTTED by the enemy. Also any approaches where
 there is water (EG: the landing zones on Noshair, the creek on Caspian), if you can stand in the water you can lay mines and again THEY CAN NOT BE SPOTTED by the enemy.</p>

<p>It's always useful to know the furthest extreme of a cap radius just to make it less obvious.&nbsp; There are some parts of maps that I'm pretty sure no one knows about because I literally see no one checking those areas when I'm capping from there.<br />
<br />
Two are on Kharg Island.&nbsp; One at Docks flag where there's two fallen containers perched on a 3rd with open doors linking them.&nbsp; The other is at Construction Site at the warehouse underneath the white truck (go prone and wiggle a bit until you get the cap icon).<br />
<br />
There's also one on Wake Island but I forgot where it is.&nbsp; It's one of the buildings that have yellow sun screens I think.<br />
<br />
I know a few others but can't recall them off the top of my head.&nbsp; If you ever play with me and wonder why I'm the only guy with signle digit&nbsp; kills and deaths but having 6000 points, I'm using these tactics to cap everything.<br />
<br />
I remember Zehq knifed me one Kharg when I tried to cap Docks the way I mentioned (was on the way to it, not actually in the area capping).&nbsp; I rage quit lol.</p>

<p>I'll add another one -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When gunning in a chopper or tank (but especially chopper), re-load as often and early as you normally would. Don't get caught with a short strafe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And for The Flyboys here's a name for you to better, "FatterThanYaMum" - best pilot I've gunned for by pleeeeeeeeeeenty. Also the best combat Engineer I've come across by pleeeeeeeeeenty, the places this bloke puts his chopper down and how quickly he repairs

<p>And another one for chopper gunning while I think of it. Pay close attention to that direction box thing and keep the pipper centred (or looking in that direction), that's the direction of the chopper. You're gonna get faaaaaaaar more kills following the
 pilots field of view than trying to kill something way over to port and sliding to the rear fast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look at where the pilot's looking, pay attention to the box and adjust to the turns.</p>

<h2>            Ways to tweak 7 64bit for gaming&#63;</h2>
                    Ive read over and done most of the basics such as shutting off visuals, deleting unwanted programs, minimizing start up programs ect. I was wondering if there was a place I could see what can be turned off as far as processes and services, if there was
 a free reg edit i could download and where. I built this computer a few months ago, only installed one MMO so far, and has been running great. But suddenly over the last few days ive been getting some bad lag, fps has gone way down. Im not running anything
 else that I hadnt been already, and ive completed several disk cleanups. Ideas?

<br />
TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.
<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,
<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model
<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate
<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -
<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party
<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device
<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for
<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after
<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually
<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers
<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as
<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check <br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred
<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows
<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be
<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then
<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
===========================================<br />

Refer to this thread for many more excellent tips however be sure to check your antivirus<br />
programs, update major drivers and BIOS, and also troubleshoot with the cleanboot method<br />
first.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 - Local Group Policy - Drive Redirection not working as - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bukama  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - Local Group Policy - Drive Redirection not working as expected</h2>
                    <p>I have a unique situation&nbsp;attempting to disable drive redirection for mstsc. I am attempting to prevent local drive sharing when I remote to another PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My steps:</p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Start gpedit.msc&nbsp; (local group policy editor)</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Navigate Local Computer Policy -&gt; Computer Configuration -&gt; Administrative Templates -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Remote Desktop Services -&gt; Remote Desktop Session Host -&gt; Device and Resource
 Redirection</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Select “Do not allow drive redirection” and enable it.</span></p>
<p><span>I</span></p>
<p>The PCs&nbsp;is not domain joined and is running Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The wording of the setting explicitly says "client" so this the behavior is not entirely unexpected, but the operation seems counter-intuitive to me. If session host is the PC on which I run mstsc, and the client is the PC to which I want to connect, and
 I enable "do not allow drive redirection" on the client PC, then the session host drives are not visible when I connect. Disabling this setting (client), and reconnecting, will show the session host drive. So in reality this client PC&nbsp;setting is preventing
 a session host from redirecting their drives to the client PC remote session. The counter-intuitive part is that I expected this option to affect local PC drive redirection, not remote drive redirection for other PCs connecting to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the flip side, if I enable this setting (disallowing drive redirection) on the session host, and then initiate mstsc, the local session host drives are available for the session. (not what I want)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a setting on the session host PC that will disallow the session host from using local session host drives in mstsc?</p>

<p>Sorry to say but I don't have the receiver. so I was hoping u guys would give me a driver that would act as a receiver</p>

<p>If you don't have the receiver, the mouse is useless.&nbsp; It can't be replaced, and it certainly can't be replaced with software.<br />

<h2>            Cannot connect Nokia E6-00 to Nokia Suite&#40;E72 works&#33;&#33;&#41; Windows installs wrong drivers</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two mobile phones. Nokia E6-00 and Nokia E72. In past I had no problem connecting them to PC through Nokia Suite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now on Windows 10 clean install, I installed the Nokia Suite. Connected E72 in few seconds it got connected, and worked like a charm.
</p>
<p>Then when I connected E6-00 it kept installing drivers over and over. After 10 minutes I checked the Device Manager, all the drivers were installed but all with yellow exclamation marks and error-codes(mostly Code 10).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a lot of different approaches of reinstalling uninstalling reconnecting... but still only end up with Nokia E72 working without problems and Nokia E6 not working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although if I connect Nokia E6 as mass storage or media transfer, it works and the drivers for this are OK too, only If I choose Nokia Suite, it doesn't recognize the mobile in File Explorer and also the drivers for this are with Exclamation marks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<p>I am Dhinakaran. Using HP Laptop powered by Windows 7. It was very nice to work in this OS since I got this laptop in April, 2010. Recently, in between&nbsp;my works, it started to&nbsp;show Blue screen with these error messages: STOP 0X0000005/7E/A/D1. It is also
 getting restarted and asking for Safe Mode options. I will open with normal mode. I tried to reduce the space in the C:/ also. Even after, setting only the Microsoft services alone to startup while opening the Windows, it is showing BSOD.</p>
<p>Here are the details of my Laptop:</p>
<p>RAM: 4GB.</p>
<p>Processor: Intel Core i5.</p>
<p>Intel Graphics Media Accelerator HD 8.15.10.1968.</p>
<p>320 GB Harddrive.</p>
<p>Please help me in resolving this issue.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            A bugcheck (BSOD) is a mechanism to protect your PC from damage.<br />
<br />
To see the cause I have to take a look at the dumps with the Debugging Tools for Windows.<br />
<br />
Please start the Windows Explorer and go to the folder C:\Windows\Minidump. Next, copy the dmp files to your desktop, zip all dmp into 1 zip file and upload the zip file to your public Skydrive [1] folder and post a link here.<br />

            Hi HernanDLozano 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Let's first rule out whether the keyboard hardware is an issue or not. Can you use Keyboard tester and press keys to see if the keys are working correctly or not? If keys work as intended, then problem is not the hardware of Keyboard.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html</a>
<br />
<br />If no hardware issue - Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Till your problem is resolved and you need to do urgent and limited typing, use Onscreen Keyboard - Type OSK in Windows Start Search Box (Cortana) &gt; Click On-Screen Keyboard
<br />
<br />2. Run Keyboard Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down and click Keyboard &gt; Run the troubleshooter &gt; Follow onscreen directions
<br />
<br />3. Uninstall &amp; reinstall Keyboard Driver
<br />Windows Key+X (Or right click on Start) &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Keyboards &gt; Right click on Standard PS/2 Keyboard &gt; Uninstall &gt; Reboot the computer to reinstall

<p>Good morning Vijay,</p>
<p>

<p>this kit has:</p>
<p>mouse - works</p>
<p>numerical pad - works</p>
<p>keyboard - does not work</p>
<p>One usb receiver</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;The mouse and keypad work 100%. Keyboard is having the issues I described in message 1<br />
</p>
<p>I am connecting the usb receiver to a laptop... I tried the tester and none of the keys n the keyboard react. Keys in the numerical pad (separate from the keyboard) works okay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I uninstall all drivers (including my laptop keyboard and reinstalled them) with no success for the Sculpt keyboard.</p>

            Attach any other keyboard (wired or wireless) and see whether it works. This will help us to point where the issues is - Keyboard or Windows.

<h2>            Can&#39;t locate System Update Readiness Tool or CheckSUR.log</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I've had my Windows 7 64-bit system for a while now and for a long period of time i did not use it at all. I've started using it again and many things have become corrupted on it. e.g. windows updater had stopped working, windows installer stopped working,
 etc. however, i got most of these problems fixed with thanks to everyone on these forums but there is still a problem with a few of the updates.
</p>
<p>Update: Windows 7 Service Pack 1 for x64-based Systems (KB976932)</p>
<p>will NOT install, windows detects it being an important required update and will attempt to install it but fails repeatedly and comes up with the error code: 800B0101. I tried using Microsoft Fix-it but it was no help. Obviously I went searching on these
 forums for help with this error and came across this page: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/windows-update-error-800b0101#1TC=windows-7</p>
<p>It instructs the user to install the 'System Update Readiness Tool' for their correct operating system and I carried this out and it installed successfully but I can't figure out how to access that program or run it since I cant locate it on my system, I
 then retried the update with no success so I went to the next step down the page. It says to type in the start menu 'CheckSUR.log' but when I do this apparently I have no such file on my computer and I don't know where it has gone if I ever even had it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone direct me to what I should do now to locate 'System Update Readiness Tool' and therefore hopefully 'CheckSUR.log' aswell since they're connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply ASAP because it says this&nbsp;Windows 7 Service Pack 1 for x64-based Systems (KB976932) update is extremely important and I'd like to get it fixed quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again</p>

            <p>To run SURT again you have to run the installer again. But as the update wouldn't let you reinstall we will have to follow some other steps, this will take a few steps. Please follow the belong guide:</p>

A .vob is a DVD video file file type, which along with other file types is used for standard DVDs. It is a special type of mpg video file, and an isolated .vob file will play on only some players. If you have other players installed, first see if it will play
 on one of them. Depending on the OS and WMP you have, often you can make a .vob video file play on WMP by changing the extension .vob to .mpg. The player may ask you if you want to try to play the file, and if you answer yes it will then play. If both of these
 fail, there are many programs available that will convert a .vob to .wmv, .mpg, or other formats that WMP will play. A few such programs are free, but many pay ones give you a free trial which might be enough to get you past your current problem.<br />

<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes to the computer before the issue occurred?

<p><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which p2p program are you referring to?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the steps provided below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Windows 7 contains several troubleshooting programs that can automatically fix some common problems with your computer. One among them is Internet Connection troubleshooter. If you’ve a problem establishing Internet connection or if you’re not able
 to connect to the Internet using the existing connection, then the troubleshooter will diagnose and repair the problem.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Method 1: </b></span></p>
<p><span><b>Step 1: </b><span>Use the Internet Connection troubleshooter.</span></span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the Internet Connections troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Click View all, and then click Internet Connection troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: &nbsp;</span></b><span>Using the Network troubleshooter in Windows 7:<b>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: </span></b><span>Try to follow the steps from the link below.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong><span><span><br />
The issue may be caused also by your security program such&nbsp;as anti-virus or a Windows Firewall /Defender which might have conflicting settings as to not to perform certain tasks. I suggest that you temporary disable the anti-virus and firewall and check the
 result again. You would need to turn on the security programs again which you had disabled.<br />
<strong><span>Disable antivirus software: </span></strong><br />

<p><span><span><br />
<strong><span>Important Note: </span></strong>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other
 software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></p>
</span>&nbsp;
<p><strong><span>Method 4:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></span><span><span>T<span>ry to set your computer in

            Microsoft is not responsible for writing the drivers. The hardware mftr. writes the drivers for its device(s). In this case, that would be Creative. The hardware mftr. is the *only* one who will do this, not the creator of the operating system you're using
 (Windows).&nbsp;All the hardware drivers that come with Windows 7 were written by the various hardware mftrs. and provided to Microsoft for inclusion. If the hardware mftr. has no plans to write Windows 7 (or other operating system) drivers for a particular device,
 then that's the end of that story.<br />
<br />
Is Creative even still making SB Live cards? IIRC, this is an *ancient* sound card. Replacing it with one that supports Windows 7 (when Win7 is finalized) will be extremely inexpensive.

<p>Hello Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is possible that the Indexing Service did not update, hence the deleted file is still showing in Cortana search. To assist you with your concern, we suggest to rebuild the indexed locations of your computer to resolve the issue. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Hit the <strong>Windows key</strong> and type <strong>Indexing Options</strong> in
<strong>Search</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>Indexing Options</strong> window, click <strong>Advanced</strong>.</li><li>Click-on the <strong>Rebuild</strong> button.</li><li>Once it is done, reboot the computer if necessary.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> This process may take a while depending on the files that you have on your computer.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
        </p>

<h2>            What happened to my account&#63;</h2>
                    Hello! I'm having trouble with my Skype account: when I logged in today with my username, I found the new contacts I added over the past year missing, as well as any conversation history. My profile picture and screen name were also not the same as I remembered
 last time I used it. It seems that my account has been restored to two years ago?? Anyway, I would very much appreciate it if anybody could help me with this.

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Most likely you’re signed in to a different Skype account that is why you’re not seeing your contacts on your Skype app.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>If you created your Skype account with a unique or personalized Skype Name, sign in to Skype using the Skype Name and not the email address.

    <title>Network Discovery not working after sleep - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> swsboss  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network Discovery not working after sleep</h2>
                    <p>I have five computers on my workgroup network.&nbsp; When I boot up my Windows 7 computer I can see and access all the computers through Windows explorer.&nbsp; After my windows 7 computer goes to sleep, when it awakes it no longer sees the workgroup computers.&nbsp; By
 start different services I can sometimes get the other windows 7 computers to show up, but never can get the older windows computers; although all the computers will re-appear if I reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can access all of the workgroup computers if I search for the computer by IP address and&nbsp; in the explorer window the workgroup computer is listed by ip address under the network tab.&nbsp; This ip listing is only available as long as that explorer window is
 open.&nbsp; I have disabled my firewalls and no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabling sleep mode on the network adapter is not an option.&nbsp; I want to save electricity so I need sleep mode.</p>
<p>Have tried restarting services relating to network discovery, but no luck rediscovering the non windows 7 computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be a service which starts on system startup which provides the network discovery for all the workgroup computers and then shuts down during sleep mode and fails to restart properly when the computer awakes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what service is not restarting properly?&nbsp; My wireless router is set as my DHCP server and I can always see it.&nbsp; If it takes installing an IPhost file on the computer to correlate the ip address to the host name, I am willing to do that.</p>

            <p>None of your suggestions work because they are not addressing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem is that after entering and exiting sleep mode, windows explorer will not find any of the computers in my workgroup.&nbsp; I can search for the workgroup computers by //192.168.100.4
 and an explorer window opens showing that workgroup computer.&nbsp; I can even search for the workgroup computers by name, //windstorm and an explorer window opens showing that workgroup computer.&nbsp; Once I close either of these windows and reopen an explorer window,
 no workgroup computers show up.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have found one fix.&nbsp; If I go into task manager and stop the "explorer" task (which clears my computer desktop) and then using task manager, restart explorer, explorer comes back and finds all the workgroup computer just fine.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Obviously the clear conclusion here is that when Windows 7 goes to sleep, when it wakes up the explorer process is not recovering correctly.&nbsp; I do not know if there is a temporary file that explorer is using, or some other process that explorer uses to find
 workgroup computers, but whatever it is, it is not recovering correctly from sleep mode.
<br />
<br />
<br />
"My fix" of stopping and starting explorer works, but I should not have to do this.&nbsp; I tested this on another Windows 7 computer and the same condition occurs.&nbsp; When the computer wakes up from sleep, explorer loses the capability to find other computers in
 the workgroup.&nbsp;&nbsp; Explorer even loses its connection to other windows 7 homegroup computers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft wants to fix this problem, all they have to do is reset the explorer process when a computer awakes from sleep mode.&nbsp; The one drawback of simply restarting explorer may be that if you had an explorer window open, you would lose it when the computer
 awakes, so Microsoft would have to somehow save the details of any open explorer windows, restart explore, and then re-open the explorer windows that were open before the computer went to sleep.<br />
<br />
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT THAT THIS IS A BUG IN WINDOWS 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Get a Windows 7 computer connected to other Windows 7 or older OS computers and try it out and report back if they get a different result.<br />
<br />
Until Microsoft fixes the bug in Windows 7 I have come up with the following fix.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; I created a file called ExplorerReset.bat .</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The files contains the following two command lines:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; taskkill /im explorer.exe /f<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; start explorer.exe</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; These commands stop and restart the explorer process.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; I setup a shortcut icon on my desktop to execute the file ExplorerReset.bat</p>
<p>When I awake my computer from sleep mode, I simply execute this shortcut.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will lose any explorer windows that are open and it takes explorer a moment to reinitialize and find all the network connections, but it is better than having to restart your computer to re-establish your network connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft has a better solution, please share it, but do not tell me to update my power plan, or update my drivers; when this is not where the problem is.&nbsp; The problem is in the way Windows 7 handles explorer when it wakes up from sleep mode.</p>

<h2>            how to validate windows XP and  get wireless to work on compaq mini 110c-1001nr &#63;</h2>
                    <p>my father(86) crashed his compaq mini and it was just blue screen, so I tried to use recovery software on it to restore to factory settings but nothing worked. a friend suggested start from scratch so formatted hard drive and reinstalled windows Xp for him.
 it worked for a month and now asking for product key but when we enter the key from bottom of computer it says invalid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i tried HP support but I need to connect to the internet to download anything and the wireless is not working.what can I do now?</p>
<p>when I start it up it says windows xp starts and says "the copy of Windows must be activated before you can log on" so we are stuck on the enter your product key page. i click telephone since my key doesn't work and called the number it says and will not
 let me reset it.</p>
