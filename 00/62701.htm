<h2>            Windows 10 Magic Mouse 2 scrolling does not work</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a fairly new Dell XPS laptop running Windows 10. I'm generally a Mac user and love Magic Mouse 2. Unfortunately,<strong> scrolling does not work</strong> after installing the recommended driver (AppleWirelessMouse64 from bootcamp5.1.5769). I'm not
 interested in using a paid utility to get what should be a rather simple function to work within Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone been able to get this to work on a newer machine? I know that it works within a bootcamp installation&nbsp; and I know that it works running windows in a virtual box using VMware (I've done this). What does NOT work is scrolling on a Dell XPS (and
 probably other new devices) running Windows 10. I suspect that this is a Win10 issue and would like to help the community by working to find a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Cannot turn automatic downloads on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ethyrdude  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot turn automatic downloads on</h2>
                    <p>In settings, under Windows Updates/Advanced Options there are three switches.</p>
<p>1 Give me updates for other Microsoft products...</p>
<p>2 Automatically download updates, even over metered data connections …</p>
<p>3 We'll show a reminder when we're going to restart...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second setting is turned off and there is no way I can turn that on. This means I have to download every update manually, a definite pain. I have even checked the registry and this is supposedly turned on but it isn't. As a result, there have been times
 when Windows defender suddenly warns me that it is out of date. How do I turn that switch on so it stays on!!! As soon as I click it, it goes right back to off. I have gone through all the settings to make sure to allow downloads over metered connections without
 any resolution to this issue.</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />Try setting 'Allow updates to be downloaded automatically over metered connections' group policy under Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Windows Update to Enabled.
<br />
<br />See if that makes any differences.
<br />
<br />Good luck!

<p>I have Windows 10 Home so I had to find (hopefully the right one) gpedit.msc, download and install. I started the program and got to Windows update but this has eleven different parts, I picked Configure Automatic Updates but in the side window it states
 this is for Windows Server 2003, XP SP1, 2000 SP3 and while I did try to enable this with the various settings provided, it did not work, so I need to find a gpedit for windows 10 or try something else.</p>

<p>My screen does not look like that however I don't have a limit set as the limit I do have I never get close to exceeding it. Besides the setting on the page states that I should be able to turn on auto downloads regardless of metering or not.</p>
<p>

            Hi ,Ethyrdude version 1803 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete and that should also resolve any issues with the Windows 10 Update Process . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .       
        </p>

<p>This problem is occurring on build 1803. Build 1803 has already been installed. As I stated above,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: As there seems to be a bit of confusion as to what the problem is, I have included a picture.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba6ffe03-59f4-4008-8a18-4812c4a40340?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba6ffe03-59f4-4008-8a18-4812c4a40340?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>The switch that I have circled is the one causing the problems. A second or two after turning that switch on, it turns back off. I'm thinking of rolling back to 1709 as this wasn't a problem before.</p>

<p>I was able to repair gpedit.msc by running "<span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth" and then "sfc /scannow", restarted my machine and then ran gpedit.msc. Gpedit started but I cannot resolve this problem with

Please read the Info on the links above and also keep in mind if you have a third-party Firewall you need to configure it to allow the Remote Desktop process to go through and connect to the Internet!</p>
<p>Also, you need to pay attention to your security and scan regularly for malware and viruses, and keep your system Software up2date.</p>

            Hi JoelWang412. &nbsp;
<br />My name is Douglas and I am an Independent Advisor. 
<br />I would like to help you.
<br />
<br />
<br />There are several factors why your camera may not be working one of them is probably because the drivers are missing after a recent update or the antivirus program is blocking the camera as it could also be the privacy settings that do not allow access to the camera. trying to follow these steps you can give solution to your problem.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Check the antivirus software.
<br />
<br />In the antivirus software settings, look for the settings that block access to the camera or the permission to use your webcam.
<br />
<br />
<br />2. Find an obsolete webcam driver
<br />
<br />Another possible cause could be an obsolete webcam driver.
<br />
<br />&gt; Select the Start button, enter Device Manager, and then choose Device Manager in the search results.
<br />
<br />&gt; Search your webcam on Image Devices or on Sound and Video Controllers and game devices.
<br />
<br />&gt; Press and hold the name of the webcam (or right-click on it) and select Properties.
<br />
<br />&gt; Select the Driver tab, select the Driver Details button and look for a file name that includes stream.sys. If one exists, the webcam was designed before Windows 7 and you will have to replace it with a newer webcam.
<br />
<br />&gt; If you cannot find a filename that includes stream.sys, try reverting to the webcam driver.
<br />
<br />Check the privacy settings
<br />
<br />If you have updated Windows 10 recently, you may have to grant applications permission to use the camera. This is because, in the latest versions of Windows 10, some applications do not have default access to the camera.
<br />
<br />To allow applications to access the camera, select the Start button and then Settings&gt; Privacy&gt; Camera. Next, enable Allow apps to access the camera. If this switch button is dimmed, enable Allow access to the camera on this device. If you do not see this option, you will have to ask the device administrator to enable this configuration for you.
<br />
<br />Select the applications that can access the camera.
<br />
<br />
<br />4. Uninstall the webcam driver and look for hardware changes.
<br />
<br />&gt; In Device Manager, press and hold the webcam (or right-click on it) and select Properties.
<br />
<br />&gt; Select the Driver tab, select Uninstall&gt; Remove the driver software from this device and then select OK.
<br />
<br />&gt; In Device Manager, on the Action menu, select Search for hardware changes. Wait for the updated drivers to be found and reinstalled, restart your PC and try to open the Camera application again.
<br />
<br />&gt; If the webcam still does not work, look for help on the website of your camera company.
<br />
<br />5. Revert to the webcam driver
<br />
<br />&gt; In Device Manager, press and hold the webcam (or right-click on it) and select Properties.
<br />
<br />&gt; Select the Driver tab, select Revert to the previous driver, and then choose Yes. Note that some drivers do not provide a rollback option.
<br />
<br />&gt; Once the reversion has been made, restart your computer and try to open the Camera application again.
<br />
<br />&gt; If the reversion has not worked or is not available, uninstall the webcam driver and look for hardware changes.
<br />
<br />
<br />6. My camera is not found in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />If the camera is not in Device Manager, try using the camera with a different port on your device first. If this does not work, try these steps:
<br />
<br />&gt; In Device Manager, on the Action menu, select Search for hardware changes. Wait for the updated drivers to be found and reinstalled, restart your computer and try to open the Camera application again.
<br />
<br />&gt; If the webcam still does not work, visit the camera manufacturer's website.

<h2>            Asus g75 Speakers Not Working</h2>
                    I have a 2012 Asus g75 laptop. &nbsp;The speakers work just fine with Windows 7, but every time I upgrade to Windows 10 - three times so far - all audio functions stop working. Help?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Check with your System Maker's Support (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) <br />
their&nbsp;on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known <br />
issues.&nbsp; Or&nbsp;with the actual audio/sound device makers if a separate card/device.<br />

No sound in Windows - Use the troubleshooters - Control Panel -&nbsp;Troubleshooting&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Check to see if you have the latest available driver.&nbsp;Download and&nbsp;install the latest<br />
driver. If you have the latest driver re-install the same one.<br />
<br />
<strong>How to manually install&nbsp;drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates <br />
to&nbsp;the&nbsp;BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate&nbsp;device
<br />
drivers.&nbsp;Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without
<br />
Dump in&nbsp;their name.<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your&nbsp;system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address&nbsp;of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and&nbsp;more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker, as fallbacks, and the Device Maker's for which <br />
are the most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - <strong>Device Manager - Sound - write down
</strong><br />
<strong>the make and&nbsp;complete model of your&nbsp;sound adapter - double click - Driver's
</strong><br />
<strong>tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do
</strong><br />
<strong>anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
</strong><br />
<strong>REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.</strong><br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Display Adapters, Mouse <br />
and Keyboard&nbsp;if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other <br />
major device drivers&nbsp;you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check in Device Manager to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

    <title>Hewlett Packard 6P&#47;6MP Postscript Laserprinter does NOT work on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rocema  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hewlett Packard 6P&#47;6MP Postscript Laserprinter does NOT work on Windows 7 via USB cable</h2>
                    <p>Hewlett Packard 6P/6MP Postscript Laserprinter will NOT work and is NOT recognized on new desktop running Win 7 Pro 64-bit; but works fine on laptop with same Win 7 Pro 64-bit OS, and works fine on new laptop running Win 8.1 64-bit, so I know it is NOT the
 parallel port to USB cable running from the printer to the computer. With the Win 8.1 laptop I simply plugged in the cable to USB physical port and it was immediately recognized.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">For the problematic desktop (Win 7 Pro 64-bit): I have read a lot of forum posts so know it is possible to be successful.
</span></strong>I have ...</p>
<p>Used the Add Printer from Devices and Printers</p>
<p>Add a Local Printer &gt;&gt;&gt; Create a New Port and specify it as USB001</p>
<p>then from following screen choose HP and then HP Laserjet 6P/6MP Postscript and let Windows install the driver. And as some forum post suggested I check marked so this is NOT a shared printer. The Test Page button is pressed but nothing happens at all; no
 blink of any light on the HP Printer.</p>
<p>
In Device Manager, there is listing for Unknown Device, and clicking on it and then Driver tab it shows:
</p><p>Microsoft</p>
<p>6/21/2006</p>
<p>Version 6.1.7601.225.35</p>
<p>and on same Driver tab page, clicking on Driver Details ... pop up says <strong>
"No driver files are required or have been loaded for this device."</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Devices and Printers shows it under Printers and right clicking and looking at Printer Properties and Ports tab, the Bidirectional printing option is unchecked and is also greyed out, and it shows USB001&nbsp; Local Port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the above using different USB slots on desktop (both USB 2 and 3, on front and on rear of computer; and after rebooting).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This older and very popular HP printer does NOT have a USB port and that is why I and many others use a parallel to USB cable.</p>
<p>
I'd be most grateful for advice as this has been quite puzzling and frustrating.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your issue on the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand the inconvenience this issue must have caused. I assure you of assistance and guidance in the right direction.<br />
</p>
<p>It is likely that you are facing the issue as the drivers either not updated or are corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lets try to resolve this by using the following methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Windows Updates<br />
</strong>Update for your device driver should be available in the Windows Update (Optional). Please check if there is any update regarding your printer. If yes, please install the same and restart your computer. Check if the printer works now.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Reinstall Printer Drivers</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This can be done in two steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: Uninstall USB mass storage device and the USB controllers</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows Key + X</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Device Manager</strong><strong>.</strong></li><li>Expand&nbsp;<strong>USB Serial bus controller.</strong></li><li><strong>Right-click </strong>on a Generic USB hub in the list and click "<strong>Uninstall."</strong></li><li><strong>Repeat </strong>the same&nbsp;for all&nbsp;Generic USB hub and&nbsp;the USB root hubs.<br />
(<strong>Note: </strong>The mouse may stop working, please use the touchpad)</li><li><strong>Restart </strong>the computer.</li></ol>
<p>When the computer is restarted,&nbsp;all the USB hubs will be scanned and installed automatically. Plug in your&nbsp;Printer now and follow step 2 for installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: Installing Device Driver.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the following article to help you with the installation of your printer.</p>

<p>Thanks for response and instruction but before I implement:</p>
<p>1) If for some unknown reason your suggested Step 1 does NOT "go well" would a system restore point protect me and re-establish the USB connections? While I expect your Step 1 would be fine, I prefer NOT want to embark on it unless I have some place where
 I can fall back.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the continued support, but do wonder if you have read completely what I&nbsp; thought was clearly written:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your first response to my initial post your instructions include the above which at
<strong>point 5 asks me to use "touchpad" which would be impossible as the problematic installation is for my DESKTOP which does NOT have a touchpad.
</strong>Will arrow keys and enter key be sufficient and any other needed keyboard combos?</p>
<p>
</p><p>=============</p>
<p>In my additonal request for info, I asked whether a Restore Point made just prior to uninstalling ALL USB hubs would recover the USBs from such a system restore point? (Your response does NOT make much sense, but I will assume that the System Restore point
 that I will establish will cover me in case their is catastrophe from taking your recommended steps.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>=========</p>
Will include screen shots when helpful, again thanks for sticking with me on this.

<p>Well this was unsuccessful in resolving issue and nearly a disaster - glad I established a System Restore point. Screen shots shown below but not sure whether I can insert one for each portion of text. Steps I took and results follow:</p>
<p>1) Per your instructions above I tried 3 different times variations of "Uninstall" USB items via Device Manager (Screen shot 1 labeled SS1) is list before doing anything. Upon reboot and recovering use of mouse, keyboard, and USB ports plugged in printer
 via its parallel-to-USB-cable to desktop computer. Printer comes up as Unrecognized.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>2) Attempts and steps to Install Printer</strong></p>
<p>Upon plugging it in to USB port, initially I get screen shot SS2 near the Tray and TaskBar bottom right corner, then followed by SS3.
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d02e1ff2-a801-4f07-b0a9-5c44fa696142" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6f93275e-4495-4024-bd43-e465fc3d47a6" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>SS3 is a bit mis-leading; meaning that when I go into Device Manager it shows the Unknown Device and&nbsp; checking Properties it shows that No Driver was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Based on suggestions on HP forum with many people with same problem over the last few years, I have tried the following several times INCLUDING after uninstalling the USB hubs described above.</p>
<p>In Devices and Printers, choose Add Printer; choose Local Printer. The first time I did this, I had to create a virtual USB port and per forum suggestion named it USB001. On all subsequent occasions this USB001 continues to be available and I have continued
 to use it. On one of the following screens I choose NOT to share this printer (wanted to keep things very simple even though eventually I'd like it to be available to all devices on my home network). The first time I did things the HP 6MP was NOT in the list
 of printers, but clicking the Windows Update button adds man more printer choices to the menu including HP&nbsp; 6P&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HP 6MP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HP 6P/6MP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At various times I have tried each of those choices.</p>
<p>On subsequent screen one can print a Test page which I have done with no success. No lights blinking on HP; no print. In Devices and Printers the newly installed printer shows up with the name I had given it, checking its print que shows nothing in it. Again
 per the forum I have turned off bidirectional printing via the Properties of Printer (actually the choice was already grayer out as well as unchecked).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional screen shots below: THe first time I removed the USBs and then rebooted, initially device manager showed many unknown USB line entries, but over a period of a few minutes they started to populate and then splash screen showed the following that
 were Ready for Use:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/120ae315-0e97-460d-8793-54e04455d087" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/08a174e9-0ca9-4f16-85ee-262397efd290" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9334d8f-1fb3-4b20-b0cc-7692e751b2d1" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>4) You probably did NOT want me to uninstall the Intel USB 3.0 Root Hub shown with Red Arrow in my first screen shot (SS1) but since your instructions said to uninstall Root Hubs I did so, and realize perhaps you meant only "Generic" ones. Anyway that is
 what almost led to disaster and glad I had Restore Point established just before doing all of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Going to the HP website for driver downloads, for my printer it indicates compatability with Windows 7 and 8, AND indicates to just use the driver in the Windows OS. There is no place on HP website to download any driver or driver installer. From memory
 and my notes: My old laptop running WIndows 7 64-bit (same as new laptop) that had no problem installing the HP printer. IT showed in devive manager a driver (USBprint.sys) in C:\windows\system32\Drivers\&nbsp;&nbsp; The new laptop has the&nbsp; same driver file, HOWEVER
 it never gets "associated" with the HP printer.</p>
<p>
Obviously this is extremely frustrating. Thanks for your continued help.</p>

<p>seems to have disappeared, or is on extended vacation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded and ran MicrosoftFixit.Devices.Run.exe which indicated that Unknown Device has a driver problem BUT it reported that it failed to reinstall device driver. So another dead end in attempting to resolve this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=========</p>
<p>Other website forum posts suggest removing some line in Registry related to Printers and then try to re-install, but do NOT want to do this without some expert input, thanks.</p>

            <p>A few points of clarification:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Most of the people who respond in the "Microsoft Community" are volunteers who have no connection with Microsoft.&nbsp; This includes those with a blue "MVP" badge or "MS-MVP" next to their names as well as "Community Moderators."&nbsp; Many volunteers, especially
 the MVPs, are long-time Windows users and highly knowledgeable.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On the other hand, Microsoft has contracted with some third-party organization whose employees are designated as "Support Engineers."&nbsp; Despite the blue "Microsoft" badge, these individuals are not Microsoft employees.&nbsp; The technical expertise of these "Support
 Engineers" is highly variable.&nbsp; Sometimes, the advice they give is downright dangerous, as you experienced when you uninstalled all of your USB hubs and root hubs.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The basic problem you have is that your old HP 6MP printer only has a parallel connection and your new computer does not.&nbsp; You have attempted to solve this by using a parallel-to-USB cable, but as you've discovered, this can be problematic.&nbsp; Sometimes these
 cables work ... and sometimes they don't.&nbsp; Based on your screenshot SS2, my guess is that your cable -- not your printer -- has failed to install properly.&nbsp; The situation is a little confused, however, because you write at one point that you have an "Unknown
 device" in Device Manager but in your SS1, all of your USB controllers seem to be OK.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Plan A</strong><br />
</p>
<p>It's possible -- but I can't tell from the information so far -- that the "USB composite device" shown in Device Manager under USB Controllers is your cable ... but it might be something else, such as your card reader.&nbsp; Please do the following:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Double-click on the "USB Composite Device" entry<br />
</p>
<p>Select the "Details" tab<br />
</p>
<p>Under "Property," use the drop-down list to select "Hardware Ids"<br />
</p>
<p>In the "Value" box, the first line will look something like this:<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USB\VID_046D&amp;PID_C045&amp;REV_2730<br />
Right-click on that line and select "Copy"<br />
</p>
<p>Paste the data into your Reply here, noting that it came from the "USB Composite Device"<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you still have an "Unknown Device" shown in Device Manager, do the same for that entry and paste the USB\VID - PID data in your Reply.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Given that data, it's possible -- but not certain -- that I can find a driver for your parallel-to-USB cable that will let you install it.&nbsp; Once the cable is properly installed, you should be able to install the printer.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Plan B</strong><br />
</p>
<p>Given that the computer on which you're having the problem is a desktop, it's possible that you have a vacant expansion slot (probably a PCIe slot).&nbsp; If so, forget the problematic converter cable and get a PCIe card with a parallel port, such as

<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL THOUGHT</strong></p>
<p>Another bit of diagnostic information that would be helpful is to know what port has been assigned to your printer.</p>
<p>In Devices and Printers, select any printer and then click on the link for "Print server properties" that appears in the tool bar at the top of the Devices and Printers window (no link shows unless some printer has been selected).</p>
<p>Click the "Ports" tab and scroll through the list.</p>
<p>What port is associated with your HP 6MP?</p>

<p><strong>1) FYI</strong> Physical cable does work on my older laptop (running Windows 7 64-bit) and newer laptop running Win 8.1 64 bit, so I conclude that the physical cable is NOT damaged. From your post it seems that the "cable" itself gets "installed"
 and that that might be the problematic source.</p>
<blockquote>Excerpts below:

<p><strong>3A) USB Composite Device</strong></p>

<p>I just turned on printer and plugged in Parallel to USB cable into USB port on desktop to get an Unknown Device in DM with hardware ID shown below.<strong><br />

</p><p><strong>4) @LemP </strong>I truly am grateful to you for clear explanation of forum, posters, etc. and graciously offering your help. You can ignore all of this if none is of any value.

<p>Would any info from device manager for older laptop on the USB device also running Win 7 64-bit as is desktop when same printer works there be of any value in diagnosing things?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>5) Plan B</strong> This might be a good approach, but will check some forum posts to get an idea that this has actually worked for people. I'm not a "hardware" person, but believe there is an empty PCI Express x1 slot. On surface of it, I'd expect
 it'd work, but then again I expected the Parallel-to-USB cable that works on other machines to work on desktop as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>6) Port associated with HP 6MP </strong>is USB001&nbsp; Description is Local Port. This is the virtual port that I created based on instructions on another thread via the Add Printer wizard from the Devices and Printers area. In one of my subsequent attempts
 after uninstalling or deleting the Printer, I created a USB002 port and went through the remainder of the steps with the same lack of success.</p>
<p>
FYI, the failed device is a brand new Dell desktop XPS 8700</p>

<h2>            80151904&#59; the most frustrating experience&#59; brought to you by microsoft&#38;&#35;39&#59;s xbox.</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, so i searched out the posts about this problem, and it became clear that; <br />
1 - i'm not the only one having these issues<br />
2 - the 'automated' answers from ppl trying to help are always the same, and don't work.<br />
3 - even though i'm completely used on doing network maintenance, this is a completely RANDOM and misterious error.</p>
<p>I've been getting this error code since dec 23rd, and since then, i wasn't able to stay connected for long.<br />
The 'set-up' is still the same it was on the 22nd, haven't changed any cables or routers whatsoever.<br />
The network on all other computers, tablets, phones, tv, etc, is still working like a charm at 95.8Mb/s - both downloading and uploading.<br />
The DNS is set, and not having one problem resolving everything other than the xbox.</p>
<p>So, ok, let's LOG this experience up:</p>
<p>i recently had my console fixed on microsofts warranty, for a 'disk-tray-problem'.
<br />
the 'new' xbox came in, i turned it on, it updated itself and worked fine. nothing to worry there.<br />
on the 23rd, i turned the xbox on, and it strangely did not connect to the Xbox LIVE network.<br />
it asked me to 'test the connection' and right there i got my first 80151904 notice. (i mean the first, FIRST time, like EVER).<br />
at first i just did what it told me to do; restart modem, restart routers and switches, change DNS to manual (copied from a PC with internet access)...
<br />
nothing helped, and that's when i started to worry.<br />
<br />
got my way into the forum, and started to follow other steps; <br />
cleared my cache, reset network settings to factory (turning modem on and off in between acts..) and deleted my profile (oh why, why did i?!)...<br />
turned xbox off and on again, just to find out that now i had 2 problems; no network and no profile.<br />
when i try to download the profile, it asks me to test the network, and when i test the network, i'm back to the beginning.<br />
oficially worried.</p>
<p>by this time i started trying other stuff; <br />
got everything in between my xbox and modem off, got a big cable directly from the modem and... nothing.<br />
got it all back togheter (so i could access the web for more info, or whatever..), and tried sharing the net via wireless from one of the computers in the office...<br />
got the cable OFF the xbox and, for my surprise, i was able to download my profile - without needing to test the network before.</p>
<p>got my profile on, and decided to try and play from the wireless... it connected for a couple minutes, and there goes the 80151904 error again.
<br />
got the cable back on, test connection; DNS error... and back to the beginning, AGAIN.<br />
a friend who had this problem before, told me to try changing the DNS to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4...<br />
didn't work at first, then i tried the modem-to-xbox cable, and it suddenly WORKED.<br />
ok, i didn't even dare to change anything at this point, it was about 45minutes in of plugging and unplugging, i decided to use the rest of my 'break' just playing.<br />
played for a while, then got back to work.. and for that, had to get the modem-switch set-up back on so the net would work everywhere else.</p>
<p>the next day, right before my break, i decided to just plug the switch-to-xbox cable on (as it always were, before all this...), so i wouldn't have to disconnect my wife's computer and everything else, hoping the xbox was already configured since it connected
 the day before.</p>
<p>that's when it got worse.</p>
<p>if the day before had took me 45 minutes to get it MISTERIOUSLY on, this day took me 3 whole hours to get it right, and it wasn't by the same config of the day before.<br />
the 8.8.8.8 DNS wasn't working anymore, i went thru all the steps from the day before (even making the mistake of deleting the profile again, wich added way more trouble every time!) for 5 to 10 times... cleared the cache, restored to factory and etc.<br />
when i finally got it on, it was waaay past my 'break', i *** the net for everyone in the house for 3 straight hours, and wouldnt be able to play.
<br />
it had connected thru the switch-cable, i got in a chat-party with some friends just for testing, and turned the xbox on. thinking it was ok for later.
<br />
net on xbox; check. net on rest of the house; check.</p>
<p>the next day - x-mas - i would have all day long to enjoy the setup i made the day before, and no one would complain of the net not working all over.</p>
<p>my mistake. first thing i notice on x-mas morning is that **** error 80151904. i collapse!</p>
<p>about 2 hours in, i GAVE UP. and gave up again the next few days... it became the most frustrating experience EVER. i'm so disapointed at this stupid console i can't even start... i'm a 29yr old who pays for every single product and service in this *** place,
 so i can get the few minutes of homeoffice break i have, PLAYING! not working like a frekking network engineer!<br />
don't get me wrong, i obviously have the knowledge to it, but i'm PAYING, not getting payed!
<br />
<br />
since then i only had the nerves to go all the way, taking me about 3-4hs to connect (modem-to-xbox cable, turning the rest of the house OFF), one last time. Yesterday.<br />
i even got the stupid HOSTAGE idea of keeping the frekking xbox ON so i wouldn't have to do it all over again, and so i did, keeping all the rest of the house OFF for the day.<br />
by the end of the day, i needed the network so i could check some work emails... and there it went.</p>
<p>today, i gave up for good.</p>
<p>i got it all back to the ORIGINAL (that ALWAYS worked before the 23rd - modem-to-switch-to-xbox), as usual and expected, everything works... imacs, tablets, phones, wi-fi work at 95Mb/s, and the xbox... NOT. 80151904 hours i would spend to fix this.
</p>
<p>i refuse to become a hostage of this error, i need an answer! <br />
<br />
i hate xbox and microsoft so much right now, it's best i keep my last comments to myself.</p>

            Hi   , I am Rob, an independent and a 12 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as independents we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. If you will work with me I will be here to help until the issue is resolved.
<br />
<br />Does the Snowball work on other computers?:
<br />
<br />Do other mics work on that computer?
<br />
<br />Check with your System Maker's Support (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known issues.  Or with the actual audio/sound device makers if a separate card/device.
<br />
<br />On the Desktop - Taskbar - Right Click on the little speaker near the clock - Recording Devices - Click in the Box then Right Click - check all boxes - Apply/OK. Double Click the Microphone there - check the settings - make sure it is enabled and on the Settings tab make sure MUTE is unchecked - Apply/OK.
<br />
<br />You can also use  Start - in the Search box type --&gt; Sound 
<br />then Recording Devices tab - Microphones and set those.
<br />
<br />==============================
<br />  
<br />Fix common sound problems 
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/fix-sound-problems#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/f...</a> 
<br />
<br />No sound in Windows - Use the troubleshooters - Start - Settings - Update &amp; Security - Troubleshot --&gt; "Recording Audio", "Hardware and Devices", and "Playing Audio".
<br />
<br />Check to see if you have the latest available driver. Download and install the latest driver. If you have the latest driver re-install the same one.
<br />
<br />How to manually install drivers.
<br />
<br />Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their name.
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker, as fallbacks, and the Device Maker's for which are the most current. Right Click Start Button- Device Manager - Sound - write down the make and complete model of your sound adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Display Adapters, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check in Device Manager to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<br />
<br />
No sound in Windows - Use the troubleshooters - Start - Settings - Update &amp; Security - Troubleshot --&gt; "Recording Audio", "Hardware and Devices", and "Playing Audio".
<br />
<br />
Check to see if you have the latest available driver. Download and install the latest driver. If you have the latest driver re-install the same one.
<br />
<br />
How to manually install drivers. <br />
<br />
Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their name.
<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created
 the driver, and more. <br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker, as fallbacks, and the Device Maker's for which are the most current. Right Click Start Button- Device Manager - Sound - write down the make and complete model of your sound adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the
 version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Display Adapters, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check in Device
 Manager to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed. <br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites. <br />

Hello, I do not have any other computers and mics to test on their respective areas mentioned above. The mic in question is a USB microphone which does not require drivers to be installed on to it. The sounds area was an area I had already tried before to no
 avail, same results this time. Sorry for vagueness in my question, but I don't know how to phrase this.&nbsp;

            Well the inability to test with other mics and computers makes it very difficult to determine which has the issue. So no matter what we do we could be barking up the wrong tree.
<br />
<br />Be sure to contact Blue Snowball Support.
<br />
<br />Do other USB devices work on that computer?
<br />
<br />There could be an issue with the BIOS and chipset drivers so check with
<br /> your System/Motherboard maker to ensure you have the latest available.
<br />
<br />Let's try the USB platform (be sure to check the Record settings afterwards).
<br />
<br />Right Click the Start Button - Device Manager - Universal Serial Bus controllers - Right Click on ALL one at a time (Do not remove the Universal Bus Controllers category) - Uninstall - OK.
<br />
<br /> Reboot and those will be re-installed.
<br />
<br />Again check the MIC settings in Sound - Recording devices tab.
<br />Does the Snowball at least show up?
<br />
<br />Let me know how its going.

<p>
</p><p>I tried what you said but was unable to uninstall all the programs as my mouse and keyboard are USB connected and got shut off, but after shutting the computer off and turning it back on the microphone shows green in the recording tab so it appears as if

<h3> beanyboy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Explorer left or right hand pane menu scrolling focus only works after clicking an item</h2>
                    The new windows 7 explorer will not allow mouse wheel scroll function over left or right panes until you have actually selected an item on the left or right hand pane for the first time. This is even when the Windows Explorer window has the focus. This
 is a deviation from Windows XP mouse wheel scroll function where it would&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;allow&nbsp;scrolling&nbsp;when hovering over the left or right panes when the window is in focus
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Ultimately this adds another click to&nbsp;every time&nbsp;you open windows explorer and is annoying</div>

<p>Initial testing suggests it does exactly what we're chasing here (i.e. scroll by cursor location rather than selection location).</p>

            <p>I don't know why my response from the original thread was split, and this separate thread was created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update did not FAIL to install. It installed. And then created the following problem that many others on the original thread are experiencing. Namely:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows which I have at a certain size and placement, default to the middle of the screen now with the wrong size. It won't remember my size and placement now.</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After narrowing it down by restoring my system and downloading and installing each of today's updates , I narrowed it down to&nbsp;</span><span>(KB3021674).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Basically, this update breaks the memory of the default windows size. Only after system restoring to before KB3021674 do my windows open to the normal size. It took a while to narrow it down to that update, as a number of other updates were downloaded
 and installed in addition to that one on that particular day.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So... anyone have an answer as to why this update breaks the windows size memory?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For now I have that update hidden so I don't mistakenly download it again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, to repeat:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>KB3021674 does something that makes Windows Explorer windows not remember size and position. windows open small and centered on the screen. After dragging the edges to make them fill the screen and closing them and then reopening, they do not maintain
 the last known size. The size reverts back to small and centered.</span></p>

<pre>Below is the plan that we need to follow.
MS15-003 / KB 3021674, released January 13th, 2015 resolves a privately reported elevation of privilege that leverages the Windows User Profile Service (Profsvc) to potentially run programs with elevated permissions. Customers are reporting multiple systems after installing MS15-003 / KB 3021674 including but not limited to
·         Profiles fail to load for 1st time user logons
·         Profiles fail to load for users logging on with cached user profiles.
·         The profile load failures primarily impact non-admin user accounts.
·         Services fail to start because of profile load failures.
·         Office SharePoint Server may no longer search data
·         Other symptoms.
Action plan:
Short answer: Users should have Full Control over both NTUSER.DAT and USRCLASS.DAT, not just read and execute.</pre>

@susan, is there an official fix or work around for this? I am encountering it now applying security updates in preparation for upgrade to Windows 10. &nbsp;I cannot proceed.

            There are a number of keyfinder utilities but the only one that works for Windows 8 at all is Belarc Advisor, others produce nothing or the wrong value. Volume License Keys has always been the piracy route in the past so are much more guarded.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Thank you for posting&nbsp;in Microsoft Community. We appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I understand the inconvenience that you are unable to install
</span></span>Citrix Receiver 4.3 on Surface Pro 3, we will help you&nbsp;to resolve this issue</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>This issue is due to the compatibility of the app in Windows 10.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>I suggest you to check with the compatibility of the app in Windows 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/compatibility/Error/Index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Compatibility Centre</a></strong> and try to install the compatible versions of the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Step 2: </strong>Follow the steps given below to Install Citrix receiver.</span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>Type <strong>Windows app store</strong> in the
<strong>Search </strong>box from the&nbsp;desktop and select it.</span></span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>Type <strong>Citrix receiver</strong>.</span></span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>Click on Citrix receiver from Windows store and click on Install.</span></span></span></li></ol>
<p><span>I suggest you to install it in Compatibility mode on Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Compatibility mode</strong> runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows. Try this setting if you know the program is designed for
 (or worked in) a specific previous version of Windows. To change compatibility settings manually for a program, right-click the program icon, click
</span><strong><span>Properties</span></strong><span>, and then click the
</span><strong><span>Compatibility</span></strong><span> tab.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To change compatibility settings manually for a program, right-click the program setup file (publisher pro 22), click
<strong>Properties</strong>, and then click the <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab. Click on
<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong> and select the Operating System&nbsp;(As you prefer).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps. Feel free to contact us for any further issues on Windows Operating System, we will be happy to help you.</span></p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i've tried everything from that article, but still no help.</p>
<p>in normal conditions the cortana setting (grayed out or not) should be in the settings menu of the search bar, but not in mine.</p>
<p>the only options i can find are "my divice history" and "other privacy settings".</p>
<p>my system is still in the supported settings for cortana, and for some reason some system features are still dutch.</p>
<p>i don't want to do a factory reset becuase all my files are on this laptop and i don't have a drive for a back-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>please help me further</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Alright then. What we suggest is that you <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/5de907f1-f8ba-4fd9-a89d-efd23fee918c/create-a-local-user-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create a new user profile</a></strong>.
 Temporarily create a new admin user into your PC, then see if Cortana works on that profile.
</p>
<p>Let us know the outcome.<br />

            <p>i've tried and didn't work, but ik think i know why.</p>
<p>during the waiting and stuff i saw a article that says: cortana removed from windows 10 educations.</p>
<p>so i got worried, and i got windows education.&nbsp;so i can't use cortana on the windows version that has been installed on my computer.</p>
<p>is there a way that i can get a windows version (doesn't matter if i've to downgrade to windows 10 home) that has cortana and i don't have to make a back-up because i got nothing to store it on as i mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i'm sorry for being that stupid to try to get cortana on windows 10 education </p>

            <p>Well that's fine. You're initially correct, Windows 10 Education doesn't have Cortana as per
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ph/WindowsForBusiness/Compare" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Compare Windows 10 Editions</a></strong>. It seems that the best way is, to go back to the previous version of your Windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to do this, we suggest that you perform a factory reset as rollback wouldn't work anymore. If you want to know how to do factory reset, you may check with your device manufacturer to ensure that you will be doing the correct steps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly backup your files before doing a factory reset. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

<h2>            Lifecam VX-800 has started coming up as unknown device on Windows 8</h2>
                    I recently upgraded from Win7 x64 to Win8 Pro x64. I have a Microsoft LifeCam VX-800 webcam which, initially, worked without issue.<br />
<br />
However, I now have a weird problem whereby on start-up Windows decides it can no longer see the device and Device Manager just shows 'Unknown device', both Skype (desktop version) and the Metro Camera app say that no camera is connected.<br />
<br />
Now, if I unplug the camera from the USB at the back of the PC and then re-insert it Windows decides it can see the camera after all and it is then available as expected both in the Camera app and Skype and the device is listed correctly in Device Manager and
 also in Control Panel.<br />
<br />
Anyone else seen this and have a resolution? I don't fancy having to keep firking around the back of the PC every time I want to Skype someone.<br />

    <title>Black Screen&#47;Installing Windows 10 on a new SSD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garrety  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black Screen&#47;Installing Windows 10 on a new SSD</h2>
                    <p>Last September I built a computer for the first time. Everything was working flawlessly until this March when Windows suddenly froze while I was watching a show on Amazon Prime. I did a hard restart, as that was the only thing I could do, and when I turned
 my computer back on, all I got was a black screen. A friend of mine, with a background in computer science, was able to help me get Puppy Linux booted from a USB drive a couple weeks ago. However, when I boot Linux, I get an error message: "Windows NTFS hibernated
 partition, cannot mount pausing..." A couple Google searches were enough to inform me that hibernation is some variant of sleep new in Windows 10. Because of this, and because I can access Windows file directories through Linux (although in a view-only mode),
 I presume the problem is with Windows itself, not any of my hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that I know absolutely nothing about how operating systems work, I don't have the faintest clue how to proceed. I can access my BIOS, boot into Linux from a USB drive, and that's literally it. I can't access Windows in any capacity. (I have tried getting
 into safe mode in every way that I know how.) Naturally, I've considered just buying a new SSD and being done with the whole thing. This brings me to my question: How do I install Windows on a new SSD? I still have the original USB drive the Windows came on,
 I presume I can just use that, but will I by asked to enter another activation code? I won't seriously have to buy a new copy of Windows along side an SSD, will I? (Needless to say, because I can't access Windows at all, I can't create a USB recovery drive.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just as a side note, if anyone has any ideas as to how to gain access to Windows without having to totally reinstall it, I'll gladly listen.</p>

            When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

<p>So if I install Windows on a new SSD, from the original thumb drive it came on, all I have to do is enter the same code again? What if I no longer have the original code? While I still have the thumb drive, I didn't keep the code... I never thought I'd need
 it again.</p>

            You don't even need to enter a product key, because the system is already registered. Just skip entering a product key when prompted then wait 24 to 72 hours and it will automatically reactivate.
<br />
<br />Just make sure you install the edition you previously had installed.
