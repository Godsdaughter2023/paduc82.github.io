                    <p>I&nbsp;know the Scorpio reveal is only a few days away but I thought I would start this thread to talk about monitors that will fully support the specs of the new Xbox. As far as I can tell, for gaming monitors anyway, there are only a few monitors out there that support freesync at 4K&nbsp;with 1ms response time. But I&nbsp;believe the Scorpio will have FreeSync 2?

            <p>Xbox Scorpio will not beat high end PC gaming specs. The Xbox Scorpio only has a 2.3Ghz clock speed 8 core processor. And this low clock speed will be the bottleneck when it comes to simulation games, since simulation games are more CPU intensive than GPU. Even my i7-6700k has a stock speed of 4.2Ghz (4 cores, 8 threads, 8MB cache). And clock speeds do matter. </p><p><br /></p><p>As for monitors, I'm completely fine with my Sony KDL40EX720 Full HDTV. 1080p gaming is still the norm. If you go for 4k, then you're gonna get less frame rate than if you play in 1080p. 1080p still looks pretty good. A lot of games on Xbox 1 aren't even 1080p native. You don't have to waste your money on the latest most flashiest monitor on the market. When the Full HDTV or full HD monitor you already use, will do the job well enough. I'm sure Xbox Scorpio will have anti-aliasing too (a mechanic which works to reduce common jagged corners and lines in Graphics). Samsung and Sony are good brands. They may not be the ch

    <title>My console has extra green lights when there is only one controller - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dreadedentity  say:</h3>
<h2>            My console has extra green lights when there is only one controller turned on.</h2>
                    
<p>I'm having a problem with my xbox 360 elite (the shiny one) with an extra controller being signed in (On the xbox itself, the first player and second player lights are on). I first had this problem on Netflix, I was watching Prison Break Season 2. My controller
 idled and turned off, the episode ended and I turned my controller back on to start a new show but I noticed the controller had the second part of the ring lit up. I accidentally left my xbox on all last night, so I turned on my controller and I had somehow
 been disconnected from xbox live and my controller was signed in as the second player. So I turned it off and restarted it. Now I'm finally in the first player spot, but my xbox still shows that there are two controllers turned on and registered to my xbox!<br />
<br />
My brother and I only have 3 controllers and they're all by me, with my controller being the only one that is actually on. After a walkthrough of my house I found that I'm the only one home, so nobody could just be messing with me. Now, my incredibly large
 superiority complex won't let me play as 2nd player, turning a minor problem into a major problem; but what's more important is that if I ever made enough friends to have friends over, then only 3 people will be able to play and they'll probably say something
 like "Dude, what's wrong with your xbox?". Obviously, I'd like to avoid that.</p>
<p>Additional details:</p>
<p>1. Turning the console on by pressing the button on the console will always result in the "ghost" controller signing into my profile (I have it set to auto-log in) and taking the first player spot.</p>
<p>2. Turning the console on through the controller will move the "ghost" controller into the second player spot.</p>
<p>3. My xbox can no longer be turned off. After a few seconds it turns on again, with the "ghost" controller taking the first slot. With additional testing, I found that the chances of me turning on my controller in time to register under the first player
 spot are relatively low, resulting in my controller taking the second player spot 2 out of 3 times.</p>
<p>4. My xbox is not modified in any way.</p>
<p>5. I have a few extensions and xbox paraphernalia (An Earforce x11 headset from Turtle Beach, the textpad extension for my controller, and the rechargeable battery dock along with rechargeable batteries).</p>
<p>6. My brother and I both have xbox 360 elite's (the model's that have a reflective black shell) and they are currently sitting next to each other.</p>
<p>7. (extension from #6) Due to being forced to use a different TV, I moved my xbox and hooked his power block and A/V cables to mine. I told him about my problem and he said he'd never experienced a problem like this.</p>
<p>8. I've unplugged the textpad extension and the headset and the "ghost controller" problem has not been resolved.</p>
<p>I think the testing that I've preformed has limited the possible problems to my individual console. I hope this helps support and I hope this issue is resolved as soon as possible!</p>

<p>Just an Idea here, but if there were no issues, then a 360 turning on with a controller automatically taking the first slot would mean a wired controller is plugged into one of the use ports.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>So, I think one of your usb ports is insisting it has a controller inside it, when it really doesn't. Try plugging usb items into your usb ports - you'll likely come across one that either won't work, or will suddenly evict the ghost from your system, no
 exorcists needed. </p>

<p>My console just started doing the same thing and I don't have any mods either. My console is just hooked up to my TV. I tried Toad 004 solution but it didn't work it just keeps one controller from connecting. =( I hope Microsoft finds a fix to this quick.</p>

<p>Hey Crypto, can you try the troubleshooting steps the OP has listed in his post? OP, it sounds like the issue is in fact with the console itself. If no USB devices are plugged in, and if you've tried the cables and power supply from that other console, and
 if you've tried a different TV and wall outlet, I'm not sure what else we can test. When did this issue begin, exactly? Did it coincide with any other event taking place on the Xbox 360?</p>

<p>My console kind of fixed itself, like it had a cold and got over it. It got exponentially worse, and then just stopped completely. Thank you for the responses guys.</p>
<p>I can't be bothered to read everything I wrote, again. But one other detail is that I eventually just decided to live with it but when I tried to watch Netflix again, it would act like the first controller was pressing the "start" button faster than, say,
 10 times a second. I somehow managed to delete the updates from my xbox but it did nothing. (It was extremely hard too, because it kept trying to go into all these other options instead because apparently pressing "start" does the same thing as pressing "a"
 when you're at the dashboard.)</p>
<p>@Crypto If you have a Turtle Beach Earforce headset try unplugging the USB from your xbox and see what that does. Also, unplug any flash drives/transfer cables/all that other ***. If that doesn't work, give it two days and your console should be completely
 fine. Lastly, I've dealt with support forums before, try to do extensive testing and give a complete description of the problem and when it started, or else moderators will only be able to help you minimally or not at all. If your problem persists or gets
 worse, you can even add me on Live and I'll try to talk you through your problem or at least find out the extent of it.</p>
<p>@Toad 004 I think you're right and my brother's headset was interfering with the console and insisted it was a controller. My little brother doesn't like when I take his headset (Think about those 15-year/old MW2 ragekids, he's one of them) and he usually
 unplugs it when he gets home from school. I'm not sure if it stopping doing that because he took his headset or not, but the next morning it stopped doing all those weird things.</p>
<p>@Fitzer I'm glad someone from the support team finally got to me, but the problem has been resolved. Thanks!</p>

<p>I know this was a long time ago when you posted this but for anyone else who has this problem I just fixed it. If you have a Rock Band/Guitar Hero controller that might be the problem, Or it might be another bluetooth item, wireless keyboard for example.
 So make sure all of the stuff is turnt off, batteries are out of controllers( Guitars, Drums, etc. )

<p>This is happening to me too. My xbox shows a second player when its only me playing. The "ghost" player is also somehow pressing the start button because the menu always pops up in the middle of a game. I've also noticed that my xbox will not stay turned
 off because as soon as I turn it off, the "ghost" player turns it back on. I have no idea what the problem would possibly be but it's very annoying and I don't know how to fix it. HELP WANTED

<p>Well, some of the suggestions above are pretty good. </p>
<p>Do you have any other controllers plugged in? Is there another profile signed in? Is there another wireless device in the area (like a headset or controller?) Has anyone near you ever synced their gear to your Xbox (say a neighbor or roommate?)
</p>
<p>I'd also ask you when it happens again, push your "Guide Button" on your console and see "Quadrant" is active. You'll know this by the little Xbox circle in the top right of the main card, next to your Wireless Controller Power icon/above the time. -Adam

<p>OK thank you for the reply. I will look next time it happens. It does it on and off too so it's not like my xbox is ruined it just gets very annoying. Also I noticed it was still doing it when ALL my controllers (3) didn't have battery packs in them. It's
 like my xbox is doing it somehow.</p>

                    <p><span><span>Just had local tech install BX200 SSD on Win 10 64 bit unit and as&nbsp;C Drive leaving old regular hard drive empty for data. This is a Dell XPS8700.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Prior to installation of BX200 I had one hard Drive partitioned as Follows (some came with PC from Dell, I guess): 500MB EF System partition – OS (C:) 477GB NTFS Primary-Boot, Page, Crash – M: (M:) 440GB NTFS Primary – 450MB Recovery Partition
 – 13.41 Recovery Partition.<span>&nbsp; </span>So 5 partitions in all. I only have clarity about the C and M ones As I made them from one months ago when I got the PC.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>After installation of the BX200 and putting all the C: stuff in I had an empty M: hard Drive which is fine and I have copied in all my data to it. It is fine with now having 931GB there.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>BUT the SSD is not right to me. It now has: 500MB EF System – (D:) 102.06 GB NTFA Primary – OS (C:) 343.57 GB NTFS Boot, etc. – 450 MB Recovery Partition – 450MB Recovery Partition.</span></span></p>

</p><p><span><span>Of course, what I expected was a C Drive just like I had before except the Boot drive would be now about 480GB (SSD size) less the System and couple of Recovery partitions by Dell or whoever.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make sure I understand correctly, you would like to allocate D driver's memory to C drive, is that right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that a local tech made the changes to your system. In this case, we would recommend you to visit the local technician for further assistance on how to achieve this if you are not comfortable making the changes to the system on your own. However,
 you can try the steps provided below to merge the two drives through disk management and check if it helps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you proceed, make sure you have all the backup of the D drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press Windows key + R to open the run command.</p>
<p>2. Type diskmgmt.msc and press enter to open disk management.</p>
<p>3. In the disk management Window, right click on the D drive and select 'delete volume".</p>
<p>4. Once you select that, it will be shown as "unallocated".</p>
<p>5. Now, right click on C drive and select "extend volume". Doing this will merge the two drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance, we will be glad to help.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. I had already tried your idea but I tried it again. It makes the 'D" drive unallocated OK. BUT When I right click the 'C' drive the "Extend Volume is greyed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
The local tech's explanation is that this is how it works sometimes when going to a smaller drive. Before putting in the SSD I had one 1T hard drive partitioned into a 'C' drive of about 500GB and an 'M' drive of about the same - see detail in my original question
 above. So I am taking a 500GB drive down to a 480 as I have set out in detail in my original question. I have no idea what the 13.41GB Recovery partition was for sure but suspect it was the Dell revert to the original Win 10 thing. Not sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
So you can see I now have 500MB System partition - a D partition - a C partition and 2 little 450 MB partitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What would happen if I went into Win 10 Update and Security - Recovery - Advanced Startup and chose my Image file from before the tech did his thing. Would the old image file work or would it screw everything up?</p>

            <p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your initial post, you mentioned that the computer came with OEM C drive and recovery partition. Could you clarify how exactly the C drive's data and system files were transferred to the new SSD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the changes were made by the technician you mentioned, as stated in the previous response, I would suggest you to contact the technician for further assistance.

<h2>            No Taskbar Icons after upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Finally got the notice that I could upgrade to Windows 10 from my Toshiba Netbook running Windows 7. I guess the upgrade worked because it boots up but all of the program icons that I had pinned in the taskbar are not showing. If you run the cursor along
 the taskbar little grey blank boxes come up but do not work if clicked on. Same thing with the Windows icon on the taskbar, it will not do anything with a right or left click.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could understand if some of the icons did not work because of maybe but not all of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get my icons to show and work when clicked on, especially the Windows start icon.&nbsp;

            OK, I tried starting up in Safe Mode but missed it and it started up normally but this time all the icons were in the taskbar and everything worked. What I'm worried about now is will this happen again? I was thinking about when I upgraded my PC to Windows
 10 and had some other problems and was able to fix it by turning off the quick start or something like that, maybe that's what is happening here. Only thing is, is that I forgot where to turn off the quick start.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No; you can not use it on another PC, if it came preinstalled on your old computer or it was a System Builders OEM License.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Laptop/Computer came with the Windows Operating System preinstalled (Dell, HP, Acer, etc), that Product Key that came with the Laptop/Computer is for the preinstalled OEM License and is non-transferable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OEM License/Product Key&nbsp;(preinstalled Operating Systems&nbsp;on Dell, HP, etc&nbsp;machines) is tied to the first machine it is installed on and dies when that machine dies.</p>
<p>________________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only Retail Operating System&nbsp;License, that you buy and install yourself, are allowed to be transferred to another machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And Retail Licenses can also only be installed on one machine at any particular time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>Hello InTranceWeTrust,</p>
<p>The easiest way to counter the pop-up notifications at this point in time is to make some adjustments to your
<strong>Friends Favorites</strong> list. Only your Favorites display the notification.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />

            Hi Stuart, 
<br />
<br />Any updates pending? Settings - Update &amp; Security - Windows Updates - see if you have any settings out there. 
<br />
<br />Next, let’s get your BIOS updated

Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.
<br />
<br />Next, let’s run through a list of clean up actions we take, and see if we have better luck. 
<br />
<br />Have you deleted items from both your Windows Temp Directory and your App Data directory? 
<br />
<br />C:\Windows\Temp - ctrl + a and delete the contents. 
<br />
<br />C:\Users\YOURACCOUNT\App Data\Local\Temp (If AppData doesn’t display, go into control panel, file explorer options, and make sure show hidden files / folders is checked off” 
<br />
<br />After this, Download and install Ccleaner - <a href="https://www.ccleaner.com/ccleaner/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.ccleaner.com/ccleaner/download</a>

<br />
<br />After installing, run the registry tool. Run the registry tool until there are no more fixes to be made. Once done, and no more fixes are there, reboot. 
<br />
<br />Click start, type “cmd” - right click and run as admin, then type: 
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth (note the space before each "/") - and hit enter 
<br />
<br />Wait for that to finish, and move onto the next command. Type: 
<br />
<br />sfc /scannow (note the space between "sfc" and "/") - and hit enter 
<br />
<br />Finally, 
<br />
<br />Chkdsk /F /R
<br />
<br />Let me know!

            Hi Stuart, 1703 is no longer the latest version of Windows 10, 1803 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete and more than likely fix any issues you are having . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

            A piece of hardware may be failing on your machine. 
<br />
<br />When you boot up your laptop, tap the "esc" key, and see if you can find something that says system diagnostics, something along those lines. Run a hardware test (short and long if applicable) to see if something is failing.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I bought a new laptop last week running on windows 8.1. Although I hated windows 8.1 in comparison with windows 7, I had decided that I would leave the computer on 8.1, rather than updating to windows 10 that was offered when setting up the laptop. However,
 this idea was short-lived unfortunately, as when I tried to use the safe money feature on my antivirus today, it said I had to update windows in order for it to work. I pressed the update button, only to find that the update was not an update of windows 8.1,
 but actually to update to windows 10. I felt that I had no option but to update.</p>
<p>Whilst the laptop was on windows 8.1, I was able to download new drivers from the Kodak website for my esp 3250, &amp; it worked for printing. (I did not try to see if it would scan, so I cannot comment on problems other people have had in this respect).</p>
<p>After windows 10 had installed, I needed to print something. However, when I checked my printer in settings, it said no drivers were available. I went to the Kodak website, but no joy. There do not appear to be any drivers on the Kodak website&nbsp;for the Kodak
 esp 3250 on windows 10. I will be fuming if this renders my printer obsolete, as it was fine before the update, &amp; also I have 2 boxes of printer ink in hand, so that will be another £40 or so down the drain. So much for progress! I would be very grateful to
 hear any suggestions on how to overcome this problem.</p>

<p>That URL give a message saying "<em>This answer is no longer available</em>."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kodak are not doing themselves any favours here. They do not seem to have&nbsp; produced a driver for Windows 10, and are not making it easy for people to find a solution. Perhaps they are hoping people will go out and buy a new printer. Well, the bad news is
 that anyone having to buy a new printer because of lack of a driver for the current Windows, is unlikely to buy another Kodak printer. I for one will be looking at a brand that puts a bit more effort into supporting customers.

<p>
</p><p>Goodbye Kodak. </p>

            Kodak has ceased all manufacture and sales of printers - I presume this also means that they will no longer provide any support including drivers.&nbsp; They quit the printers in late 2012 or early 2013, well before Windows 10.&nbsp; I've got 2 that were great printers
 and cheap on the ink but will now have to be replaced.&nbsp;

<p>
Re-install the software but do not connect the USB cable immediately. Begin the installation and let the software tell you when to re-connect the Usb Cable to the computer. Let it finish&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Reboot computer and Windows will find it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Or, go in control panel and click on Scanners and Cameras. You should see the Kodak icon there. Click it and scan from there. If the scanner was well installed, it should work from there as well.<br />

            when I first upgraded to windows 10, everything worked. But somewhere among the updates, my kodak printers are unable to even be
<span>recognized as a valid USB device whenever plugged into the computer. Both Window 10 computers are this way. But the kodak printers work ok with my Windows 7 pro, I use at work.&nbsp; I even bought a new hp computer April 5th, same problem, "does not recognize

<h2>            Unable to install HP 3600n on new Win 8.1 machine</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>spent all night reading and researching various solutions people have tried and have claimed have worked for them to get this printer working with Win 8.1.</p>
<p>I, however, have had no luck.</p>
<p>Even&nbsp;tried manually extracting the files from hp's suggested driver msi install and had printer installation app brows to the folder with the extracted files. No dice.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any help to get this thing to print from this new &amp; quite expensive 15" Sony flip running Win 8.1 x64, would be appreciated--worthy of beers, etc.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance, Hiram</p>

            <p>Here is a solution that worked for me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Download Windows 7 64-bit drivers from HP (it is about 150 MB, named&nbsp;HP_CLJ_3600_Installer_WW). DO NOT install it.</p>
<p>2. Extract the files and you will see the folder "HP_CLJ_3600_Installer_WW\Drivers\x64(64 bit - XP_S2003_Vista)"</p>

            I too thank J.G.Kim for solving this problem.&nbsp; Over the course of many months, I tried many fixes for getting&nbsp;my Windows 8.1 computer to print to my HP 3600n printer, but none worked--until his.&nbsp; Here is a summary of the instructions on the Korean website
 for disabling driver signature enforcement.&nbsp; Follow these, and you won't have to go to that site.&nbsp; In Windows 8.1, do this:&nbsp; Settings, Change PC Settings, Update and Recovery, Recovery, Restart now, Troubleshoot, Advanced options, Startup Settings, Restart,
 7 (Disable driver signature enforcement).&nbsp; Next, go to Mr. Kim's link and download the host based driver.&nbsp; Clicking on it unzips it to the folder of your choice.&nbsp; Next connect the printer to your PC and&nbsp;go to Device Manager and double click on the HP item,
 and then click "Update Driver".&nbsp; From there, direct it to the file that the driver was unzipped to.&nbsp; Good luck! &nbsp;Here again is the link to the driver site:&nbsp;

            It will not work, Windows 8.1 needs to be installed on a internally attached storage device such as a hard disk or SSD.

<h2>            what does Alienautopsy &#38; PC-Doctor module background processes do&#63; i was wondering.</h2>
                    what does Alienautopsy &amp; PC-Doctor module background processes do? i was wondering, are the two doing their own PC maintenance, separate from PC build in maintenance?&nbsp; i only know that when i open Autopsy i can create backup with it &amp; that's all i know
 about the program, both background processes run sometimes, not all the time, when i open autopsy it dose the same what it dose sometimes it self, scans for error's dunno what error's, hard drive error's system error's or software error's or all what i mentioned,
 it has been in my PC sins i got the PC 2 months ago, alienrespawn i uninstalled cause it was like a demo, u can do only factory state backup with free ver, so i decided i don't need it, autopsy &amp; windows system both have the option to make backup free, autopsy
 dose not seem to be that unnecessary like respawn, i may not need it, but i may need it, plus the background process what runs sometimes mite be useful to&nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>Hi Akshay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When making any changes on the PC, the user is required administrative privileges. This mean, the user account that you're using should be an Administrator before you can proceed to install/uninstall your antivirus software of choice. One thing that you
 can do is use the Administrator user on the PC to make the changes that you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any further questions, do get back to us. We're happy to help.</p>

    <title>How to stop Windows Update from force downloading Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danielcarreon  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to stop Windows Update from force downloading Windows 10</h2>
                    Because I just found out Windows 10 will nuke some very important programs that simply do not work on it, alongside a lot of other problems, I do not want to upgrade into Windows 10 right now. However, whenever I try to update other files through Windows
 Update, it forces the Windows 10 download, even when I don't have it selected. I have to force shutdown my PC, because I am afraid that I'll wake up the next day to windows 10 on my PC, and important programs uninstalled.<br />
<br />
Anyone know what I can do?

            I also have the same problem with Win 7 Home Prem. 64 bit.&nbsp; I'm a graphic designer with many programs that are critical to my work and I just can't afford to take a chance that some may not work.&nbsp; And there are times I can't tolerate the slowdown during
 auto updates, so I'm not going to use a program that doesn't give me FULL control of when I can update.&nbsp; I finally just turned off Windows Update because it got so frustrating trying to do my updates.&nbsp; I installed Win 10 on my wife's PC and it blocked my Kaspersky
 Internet Security saying Windows Defender is better and no you can't use Kaspersky.&nbsp; Go to hell MS!&nbsp; I'm pretty sure Kaspersky is better.&nbsp; MS NEEDS TO PROVIDE A FIX FOR THIS IF THEY DON'T WANT TO LOSE MANY MANY CUSTOMERS!<br />

<p>
</p><p>I selected one update to download and install and this is what I see, notice the file size?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The GUI is screwed up, it's not actually downloading windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next I see this...</p>

<p>
</p><p>Once again, it's not really doing what it says it is. When&nbsp;I mouse over the windows update icon in the system tray, I see "Installing updates xx%".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I let it run it's course and it just installed the one update. I repeated the process with the other 10 critical updates and saw the same incorrect GUI and it only installed the updates.</p>

            <p>Thanks for trying Sqrly, but it doesn't work like that on my Win 7 PC.&nbsp; When I tried, it said "downloading 2,xxx MB" (2.xxx GB), no thanks again MS.&nbsp; On my wife's 8.1 laptop, it's already done the Win 10 download, so it just goes straight to the install
 and EVERY TIME I decline to accept MS's terms.&nbsp; And on her laptop it just opens Win Update on boot.&nbsp; I have it set to NOT DO ANYTHING but it's still a pain to have to close Win Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess your PC is in a different world Sqrly.&nbsp; Hmmm - do you work for MS?</p>

            <p>There is one crazy idea you haven't tried. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let it upgrade, then roll it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the <strong>1st month**</strong>, according to the UI, there's a "return to previous OS" option in&nbsp;"settings &gt; update and recovery &gt;recovery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But 1st, the upgrade renames your user folders and any shared folders, then doesn't change everything&nbsp;back when you roll back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend un sharing everything and making complete copies (hidden and system files too, you can set these to show in "folder options")&nbsp;of your user folders on a separate drive. (USB Flash drive would work)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do the upgrade, make sure it's activated&nbsp;(just under recovery from previously), then roll it back. Remove the users (if there's only 1, make a new temp admin level one, logon with it, then remove the old one, then recreate the old one, logon to it and delete
 the new temp one you just used) and recreate them. Then copy the user folders you made copies of back into place, overwriting the new with the old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go and share whatever you had shared before.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>WARNING! This may not work for you, it could make things even worse but, if it works for you like it did for me, you'll have your old PC back without reinstalling windows 7 from scratch.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>** Currently there is a box in the recovery UI of PC's that were "upgraded" to Windows 10 stating that for one month, you can roll back to your previous OS. If this doesn't change, this option would vanish on July 28th, 2015.</strong></p>

            <p>I think that A. Paul has suggested that method assuming that you are able to view the contents of the DVD and go to the .exe file. &nbsp; Obviously, you cannot since you don't have the DVDs and are seeking to download FSX from the Web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, the short answer is that FSX cannot be downloaded - it has to be installed from the DVDs. &nbsp; Only the Trial version can be downloaded, but that is not what you are seeking. &nbsp; Either you purchase FSX, which is currently selling for a premium cost, or
 else go for the cheaper (and considered better) FSX-Steam Edition. &nbsp; &nbsp;This version is downloadable from the Dovetail Games website: &nbsp;&nbsp;http://www.dovetailgames.com/products. &nbsp; As well, Microsoft did produce Microsoft Flight a few years ago, but that is not
 only a very simplistic simulator, but also limited in aircraft and scenery and is no longer being supported (as is FSX).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a cost for FSX-SE, but it will be substantially less than FSX and sometimes Dovetail offers them at a special discounted price. &nbsp; The benefits of FSX-SE are that no activation code is necessary (unlike FSX), so one can reinstall it multiple times
 from your media, and there are several improvements made that make it compatible to newer OS platforms. Then there is Prepar3d, X-Plane, etc. as very good substitutes to FSX.</p>

<h2>            Sync Settings &#38; Settings in Edge are greyed out</h2>
                    I bought (Jan 2019) a demo machine at Costco. It has Win 10 v 1809 on it. I cannot save any favorites in Edge and settings is greyed out. When I looked at sync your settings, there is a message saying "some settings are managed by your organization" -
 I have looked at many posts and cannot get this out. I was wondering if these are related and how to remove. Please advise. Thank you&nbsp;

            Hi MITCHFRIEDMAN,<br /><br />I'm Stefano an Independent Advisor here to help you.<br />I think you have a Volume license for Windows 10, that only for business user. If you have this Kind of license, you Need to buy a new valid license because It Is illegal use a Volume license on home user PC.<br />You can know which license you have with this procedure:<br /><br />1. Type "cmd" in windows search bar<br />2. Right click on  "Command Prompt"<br />3. Select "Run as Administrator"<br />4. Type "slmgr /dlv" without quote and press ENTER <br /><br />Post the result please, so I can tell you which license you have.<br /><br />If you have a Volume license, also you will have domenica restictions on customization like the ones you actually are seeing.
