<h2>            How to create docked and undocked display profiles&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Howdy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Pro, upgraded to 8.1.&nbsp; I have a Surface dock with DVI adapter connected to external monitor.&nbsp; I have it configured to only display to the external monitor while docked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When undocked, I like to have the display settings set so that menus and dialogs are set to "Larger - 150%" size via the Display control panel's "Change the size of all items" option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I am docked the 150% size selection is a bit overwhelming, so I have to go into the display settings and change them, which forces me to log off to have the change take effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is highly annoying as I need to dock and undock multiple times each day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some way to create a "docked" and an "undocked" profile that will will automatically switch?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p><br />
Dan K.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have any other questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to ask!</p>
<p>

<p>That will depend solely on where you live. Some countries charge sales tax on digital purchases, while others do not. Even in a single country, some regions charge that tax, and others do not. Your best bet is to contact your country/region's department
 of revenue or taxation and ask if they charge sales taxes on such purchases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, if you attempt the purchase with your gift card and it asks for another payment method to pay off the rest, that would answer your question, as well. You can always back out of the purchase before you confirm it, of course.</p>

            It is regional, and in some regions it can be more specific, such as in the US some states require digital sales tax while others do not, so it can vary quite a bit.&nbsp; If you initiate the purcahse, prior to the last confirm, it should mention if there is
 tax included and you can see it from there with the full price of the purcahse.&nbsp; You can check that and decide before full confirmation if you want to purcahse the title or not.

                    After upgrading to the free Windows 10 (from 8.? - don't think it was 8.1)&nbsp;it doesn't seem to recognize any SD card. It gives NO error messages.&nbsp; It has worked for about a minute twice but that is all, then it goes away. I have tried MANY times. I use
 this everyday so what can I do to fix this? Thank You!

            <p>Just got off&nbsp;a long&nbsp;&nbsp;phone call&nbsp;with an engineer, I'm writing this up in case someone out there is in the same boat as I was... here is what fixed my problem (*I couldn't find anything on the web from others having the same issue with a fix involved). &nbsp;I
 have a dell inspiron laptop. Had windows 8/8.1 then upgraded to 10 and my SD card reader was no longer recognized. In the end, the fix seemed to be , click on the windows button (looks like four squares -a real house window appearance icon button for those
 of you non tech's) and the X button at the same time (again, windows button and X button together). Then&nbsp;click on Device manager option. Then click&nbsp;on the&nbsp;expansion arrow next to &nbsp;Universal Serial Bus Controllers, and &nbsp;in that I had 'Realtek USB 2.0 card reader'
 * your looking for card reader (maybe not always realtek, but def. card reader). I had to Right click on Realtek USB 2.0 Card Reader and a little pop up box appears, select 'update driver software' it gives you an option after that... box asks if you want
 to search the web automatically for updated software, or browse my computer for updated software. Choose the first one, to search automatically for updated software. once I did this, the E: drive appeared and I was able to see/use my SD card reader. *Note:
 I found out some laptops aren't prepared to handle the upgrade to windows 10, the tech at Microsoft had to look into my model number to confirm if my drivers were outdated/or able to be upgraded successfully. Otherwise I would have had to go back to my previous
 version of windows. oh another bit of info, if you have the same/similar computer as I do. Go to the start button and type in the search box&nbsp; msinfo&nbsp;&nbsp; this brought up the system information page for me about my particular computer and it's there that I'm able
 to see my computer system model which happens to be a Dell Inspiron 7720. </p>
<p>As of 6-7-16, this model&nbsp; has drivers that can be successfully upgraded to windows10 per the programmer I spoke to/worked with to get&nbsp;mine working again/&nbsp;fixed.</p>

            <p><span>I have a similar problem with my Linx 1010 tablet.&nbsp; since the last Windows 10 update the integral card reader is not recognised i.e. only C drive now&nbsp;shows and not the D drive for the SD card.&nbsp;
 I've read the 2 responses above - troubleshoot showed nothing wrong.&nbsp; Devise manager doesn't list an SD Card Reader,&nbsp;and it doesn't appear under USB either.</span></p>
<p><span>Contacted Linx but they said Card Reader in the tablet does work with Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, it did until the last update.&nbsp; Is there an answer or will the next update fix this?</span></p>

<h2>            Restoring WindowsImageBackup after changing hard drive</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Is it possible to restore a WindowsImageBackup from an external hard drive after changing your computer hard drive.?</strong></p>
<p>My hard drive recently crashed, beyond repair, so I had to replace it. Before it died, I had backed up my data to an external hard drive, specifically a WindowsImageBackup. Now I want to restore those files. Because I did a full system back up, rather than
 backing up individual files (in retrospection, the better option), I can't just copy the files back to the computer. Now, when I go to control panel &gt; backup and restore center &gt; restore files, it says there are no backups on the computer. True, but there
 is also no option where I can browse to the external hard drive and select the WindowsImageBackup. So what do I do? Can anything be done? &nbsp;All suggestions are appreciated. Thank you.</p>

<p><span><span>As per your query, I like to inform you that; when you select Remove under the specific credentials, it will remove the specific credential details.
 Since you have followed the correct steps to remove web credentials but the program is not available, I suggest you to Run DISM commands and check if the Web credentials programs works.</span></span></p>

            the program is still available in the system but not under Web Credentials - i realize now that i should have changed "show" to "hide" What i did was click "remove" and of course the http was removed - What i want to do is ut it back into web credentials
 so that i can hide the password - days ago i told the computer to save my password - and now anyone bringing up that program can go right into my accounts - at the signon the password is not displayed in letters but is displayed in dots all someone has to
 do is click on signin - i want to go back to when i had to type in my password - it is my banking information and it should be for my eyes only but anyone sitting at this home computer has access - dangerous&nbsp;

    <title>Can only boot from F10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robaire99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can only boot from F10</h2>
                    I have 2 drives, C: and D:. Windows 7 is on my C: drive and D: is for files. When I boot I get a message to re-start and hit F10 to choose the boot disk. I must select my D: drive or it won't boot - but selecting D: causes it to boot correctly on C: -Go
 Figure- I have tried swapping drives, logically and physically, fixmbr. fixboot, disk repairs, etc. I am able to run this way but&nbsp; want to be sure that files I make and kill are the right ones.
<br />
<br />
I have a 250GB Seagate and a 200GB Western Digital for my C: and D: drives, 2GB Ram all SATA drives. I lost some files in this move to W-7 and am considering partition swapping or restoring my C: drive but am afraid to loose more files.<br />
<br />
Can anybody tell me what to do to fix this, I have tried much of what I find in this forum but I'm still stuck. Thanks to all for your help. Bob

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Is your computer has dual operating system installed?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to change the startup sequence in your Basic Input/Output System (BIOS).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>During startup, BIOS searches for a disk that has an operating system it can load. On a computer that has an operating system installed,
 this is usually the hard disk. The BIOS is configured to search disks on the computer in a certain order, called the startup sequence. If the computer hard disk is configured in the BIOS as the first disk in the startup sequence, the computer starts by using
 the hard disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To configure the BIOS follow the below steps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Restart your computer.
</span></li><li><span>When the computer first starts, it performs the power-on self test (POST). This test checks that all connected devices are functioning.
 As part of the POST, the memory is checked. During the memory test, a message will appear that tells you how to access the BIOS. For example, you may see the following message or a similar message that explains how to start the BIOS setup:
</span></li></ol>
<p><b><span>PRESS DEL TO ENTER SETUP</span></b></p>
<p><span>In this example, you must press the DEL key immediately after the memory test is finished to start the setup process. You may have to press
 the key several times to make sure that you access the BIOS setup.<br />
<br />
<b>Tip</b> There are other keys that may provide access to the BIOS. They include the following:
</span></p>
<ol>
<ul>
<li><span>F1
</span></li><li><span>F2
</span></li><li><span>F10
</span></li><li><span>CTRL+ENTER
</span></li><li><span>ALT+ENTER</span>
</li><li><span>CTRL+ALT+ESC</span>
</li><li><span>CTRL+ALT+INSERT
</span></li></ul>
</ol>
<p><span>If you are not sure how to access the BIOS setup, see the user manual for your computer's motherboard.
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Look for the startup sequence settings (also known as boot sequence or boot order). You can usually use the arrow keys to move through
 the menus and settings. </span></li><li><span>When you find the startup sequence setting, you can usually press ENTER to modify it. Press the PLUS SIGN (+) or MINUS SIGN (-) key until
 the Hard disk drive is selected as the startup disk. <br />
<br />
<b>Tip</b> More information about how to modify the BIOS can be found in your user manual. It usually contains descriptions of the menus and instructions on how to modify the options. The BIOS itself usually contains context-sensitive Help with the individual
 steps. </span></li><li><span>As soon as you have specified the hard disk drive as the first location to search for a startup disk, you can usually press ESC to return
 to the menus. In the main menu, select the option<b> SAVE AND EXIT SETUP</b> or a similar option. When the confirmation
<b>SAVE TO CMOS AND EXIT</b> or a similar option appears, select <b>YES</b>. 
</span></li><li><span>If you cannot select
<b>YES</b>, type the letter <b>y</b>. <br />
<br />
<b>Note</b> BIOS uses a QWERTY keyboard layout. If your keyboard settings follow a different layout, you will have to press the Y key as it appears on a QWERTY keyboard.</span>
</li><li><span>After you exit the BIOS setup, your computer will restart.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are not comfortable trying to perform this task, you may want to ask someone whom you know for help.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span>Note:Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can causeserious problems that may
 prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;

<p>Hey Xg Morgoth,</p>
<p>Sorry to hear you're experiencing this. Have you gone through the standard troubleshooting like deleting your profile and re-adding it, or installing the Xbox (beta) app and seeing if the issue reproduces there?
</p>
<p>If you're still experiencing this, can you please submit feedback using the Xbox (beta) app by selecting the Feedback option from the menu dropdown in the top left corner? This will allow us to do a more thorough investigation with data from your PC.
</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>~Hammer</p>

<p>You sir, over two years later, have helped me more than anyone else on the entire internet could. Not only was this hindering my ability to join parties on XBL, but I also couldn't join or host ANY worlds on Minecraft Windows 10 Edition. I had tried literally
 everything. I posted on Reddit, reinstalled the game multiple times, tried with and without the beta, power cycled my modem and router, factory reset my router, and used another XBL account. Nothing worked at all, and I could not find any solutions online
 whatsoever. Then I realized the error code in the Xbox app. Searched for that with the message it gave, found this post, and did what you suggested. Literally every single problem fixed with the click of a button and a restart. Thank you for not just finding
 the solution and not posting about it. You have saved me hours of head scratching. 5 stars and rated helpful. Seriously a shame that Microsoft couldn't figure this out and had to "investigate". I legitimately find more help from other users rather than most
 big companies' "customer service" reps.</p>

<h3> cyranobirdwa  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Settings&#34;&#47;Storage&#47;Save locations not working &#40;among many other issues&#41;</h2>
                    Using "Settings" I corrected the save locations for music, pictures, and videos on the drive where the files are stored under their correct file names (F:). After exiting, they all revert to (C:) drive which doesn't even have correspondingly named folders.
 The documents folder seems to be ok since the folder is on (E:) and Settings agrees that it's there. I even re-targeted via "This PC", right-clicking on each affected folder's "properties" selecting "locations" tab, and re-selecting the appropriate folders
 located on the correct drive. No luck!<br />
<br />
Microsoft just announced they're killing off Control Panel which has been invaluable to me for years. Since it was included in Windows 10, I finally caved and decided to install it (fresh install, purchased disc, new build). Control Panel is indeed there and
 it does the job.<br />
<br />
Settings is too simple, lacking the diagnostic tools I've had with Control Panel to fix problems, and now I find some it just doesn't work per the issue stated above.&nbsp; Without control panel, how would we be able to (for instance) re-assign drive letters? I
 currently feel like a victim of bait and switch...

            <p>Swathi 1709: Thanks for taking this on. I tried "clean boot" as instructed, tried changing the locations for "Music, Pictures, and Videos" without success. They don't stick.&nbsp; (they return to what I assume is the default location of (C:))&nbsp; So it would appear
 other applications aren't at fault. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just curious: Do you have a hotfix that would bring all the&nbsp; assignments for documents, music, pictures, and video back to "ground zero" so they can be re-assigned?</p>

            Following a hunch I looked for and discovered Windows SEARCH (indexing options/modify/show all locations) can't see my (F:) drive where I have as the primary source for Music, Video, and Pictures folders. It does see the (G:) drive which is a mirrored
 backup of (F:). I suspected using the "rebuild" option wouldn't find the missing drive, but I tried it anyway. No luck. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
So, I disconnected both drives, booted up with only the two remaining drives showing, shut down, and re-connected them. Now (F:) drive can't be seen at all in "Settings/system/storage/Save locations" (the same issue found in "search".<br />
<br />
From "This PC" and "Computer Management/Storage/Disk Mangement" all drives show, are healthy, fully functional, and the folders all open with correct contents.<br />
<br />
Via "Settings/system/storage/save locations" I then selected the mirrored backup drive (G:) as locations for Music, Pictures, and Videos. THEY NOW STICK - but they're on a drive which is set to delete files not found on (F:).
<br />
<br />
So, why isn't my (F:) drive being recognized by Search and Settings, yet is fully functional and working? Is there some way to "reset" search/settings?

            In addition to the issue of not having Windows "Settings" recognize and accurately target my music, pictures, video, and documents folders, I found that my mirrored drives suddenly generated a 30 GIG DISCREPANCY. Displayed folders matched up with the same
 amount of content, but F drive (source) read as having 30 gigs less available than the mirrored drive (G). ????<br />
<br />
Both drives were attached from a previous Win7 installation on a different computer where their contents were mirrored correctly. Installed on 10, Permissions, ownership were worked out and both are deemed "healthy" with no errors.
<br />
<br />
I finally decided Windows 10 was stuck and compounding its own errors, so I did a re-format on the source (F) drive to give it a fresh start. Then copied over the contents from G (destination) back to F. Then designated my primary video source to F.
<br />
<br />
Re: the 30 Gig discrepancy:&nbsp; I suspect the video folder on the pre-re-formatted F drive had a duplicate "phantom" video folder that wasn't displayed but had a sizable chunk of duplicate video data "stored" on it.<br />
<br />
Finally all drives are now recognized and all folders (music, pictures, docs, videos) are displayed and targeting the correct folders on the correct drives. (absolutely critical for mirrored backups)<br />
<br />
Then, happily, the next fix: Got rid of all the unwanted Apps that came with 10 with a handy set of scripts found on "HowToGeek". We're told Microsoft will probably re-install them during future updates, but at least now I know how to dump them again. Whack-a-mole...

<p>Hi there.&nbsp; What kind of signal strength does your console report when you check your connection under networking settings?<br />
<br />
If the signal is strong but you've still got lag, you could try changing your routers wireless channel.&nbsp; If the signal is weak, you could purchase a Wireless range extender like
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B007AEDK4M/ref=asc_df_B007AEDK4M11907441?smid=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;tag=googlecouk06-21&amp;linkCode=asn&amp;creative=22206&amp;creativeASIN=B007AEDK4M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this one from Belkin</a>.<br />
<br />
I know you've said you were 'thick', but don't be too hard on yourself, networking isn't for the feint&nbsp;of heart.&nbsp;But, if your after an extender, that one is highly recommended&nbsp;because it's very (and I mean very) easy to set up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If there are a number of wireless networks around you from surrounding houses/flats then try logging into your router and changing the wireless channel. The new channel may be less congested (and thus less subject to interference). &nbsp;Otherwise, Sky do sell
 a Wireless N router which would carry the signal further for about £30. Other options include powerline adaptors (which use your home electrical wiring) or a wireless repeater (which you put somewhere in you house that has a good signal and it projects it
 on). Search for both of them on Amazon and you'll see plenty of choice.</p>

<p>cant get it anycloser iv already switched to a closer room, im on sky which i think has the lowest speed but every now and then will go realy well so it must have potential</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>There is your problem right there. Your on Sky get rid of them they are crap. I keep getting offers for Sky Broadband because I have Sky+ but I keep turning them down as why the hell would I want to go from the 90Mbs download speed I can get from Virgin
 Media to the 4 or 5Mbs speeds I would get with Sky. Also my sister is with Sky and she is constantly having bother with them.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>There isn't much wrong with Virgin's wi-fi. The 100Mbs hub I have works pretty well.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If you are still having bother my I suggest getting an ethernet cable and hooking your 360 straight into your modem. I run my PC and 360 via two 20 meter ethernet cables as I have awful trouble receiving wi-fi in my bedroom.</p>

<h2>            Does the Xbox one under-perform while using an external surge protector&#63;</h2>
                    <p>There seems to be two schools of thought on whether or not to plug the xbox ones into a surge protector or not due to possible under-performance.
</p>
<p>

<li>Does the console actually under-perform if it is plugged into a surge protector?</li><li>Also do you personally use a surge protector with your console?</li></ul>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe Brad mentioning the use of a third party "surge protector" was meant to describe an Xbox One Power Supply. Your console's warranty will
<em>not</em> be voided by use of a surge protector, however; if you use a <em>third party power supply</em> on your Xbox One console, you may risk damaging the console over the use of a Microsoft Xbox One PSU(power supply unit) which is specifically designed
 for your Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Kindr3ds,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your issue. To answer your questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Yes a console can under perform plugged into a surge protector or ext. cord. For example these are known issues that have been resolved, controllers keep disconnecting, games not launching correctly, and even console not powering on. Reason for this is
 there is no way to tell if a surge protector or ext. cord is faulty or not putting out enough power unless you have the meter to test this.</li><li>NO I plug all my consoles directly into the wall. The consoles all have there own surge protector. To use another you can void your warranty if found you used another. One has it on the power cord, Xbox one S, X have them inside the console.</li><li>&nbsp;Another Note if the surge protector or ext. cord is faulty, this can damage the console as it is not getting the required power to run correctly.</li></ol>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<p>My 7th xbox (2nd slim) Broke after a year of being looked after perfectly, Don't worry, I know what Microsoft are like. But either way, The only reason I play my xbox is for Halo reach. It stopped reading disks so I am downloading halo reach from the marketplace
 (This will be my 8th halo reach purchase). But when I try downloading it, I get disconnected from xbox live every 10 minutes or so. The download is taking forever, and I am using a wired connection. Why do I keep disconnecting from xbox live, and the download
 is on 16%. </p>

<p>Greetings, runescape gawd! To start, if your console will no longer read discs I would recommend running through this Disc Drive Solution guide:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/disc-drive/disc-drive-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../disc-drive-solution</a>. This will help determine whether you need to submit it for repair.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding your disconnection issue, let's have you take a look at this sticky and post your replies to the questions in bold at the bottom of the page:

If you do not have specific firewall rules defined/configured&nbsp; you can reset the firewall to default settings..<br />
