<h2>            Error reinstalling Symbian Belle Refresh 111.030.0609 on N8-00, product code 059C8T6</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided to post a new topic after unsuccessfully looking for&nbsp;another post reporting the issue I am experiencing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had to reinstall Belle Refresh version 111.030.0609 on my phone after the trial of Swype 2.1 for Symbian was concluded by Nokia Beta Labs. According to a very kind customer care rep., reinstalling everything from scratch was the only way to get Nokia Store's
 version of Swype to work on the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The actual reinstall process (using Nokia Suite)&nbsp;was flawless. However, after&nbsp;the process was completed and&nbsp;I also completed the installation of the many available updates, I realized that&nbsp;some items were missing and others stopped working:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many widgets are&nbsp;missing, like the&nbsp;small music player,&nbsp;the additional clocks and&nbsp;some of the extremely useful on-off widgets.</li><li>Check-in is not working at all: it just stalls when looking up the list of social networks</li><li>Weather (one of the most useful apps on the phone) is not working: it just notifies that the forecast is not available</li><li>Public Transport fails to complete the first-time configuration</li></ul>
<p>This is just a short list of the&nbsp;the issues&nbsp;I detected so far, as there are other minor issues as well. I reported them all to the same sutomer care rep. that recommended reinstalling Belle Refresh, but he was unable to provide a solution and suggested to
 look if there was a post with the solution on Nokia Support Discussions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has someone experienced the same problem and found a solution? If so, please share it. I'd really appreciate any help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, and btw, I was able to get Swype 1.x to work again! :smileyhappy:</p>

 down for Symbian/Belle and third party Apps were recommended.</p>

<p>A "Refurbish Flash" is the only way to restore the N8 as it is supposed to be. On top of the other trouble you are having, there will also be an issue with the C drive on the phone running out of free space - every reinstall and factory reset eats a chunk
 of the free space. A Nokia Care Point or Nokia approved workshop can do this for a fee, or&nbsp;search elsewhere for instructions since the procedure can not be discussed in this forum.</p>

<p><br />
Thank you, Hans. That's interesting...<br />
Let me explain: I reinstalled the phone’s software using Nokia Suite following the written handwritten instructions of a technician from an official Nokia Care Point. I had taken the phone to them because because it was behaving erratically after Nokia suddenly
 decided to&nbsp; disable the use of Swype 2.1 for Symbian on Jan 1st, 2014. The technician's instructions on their official work order also explained that reinstalling the software was the only way to get the version of Swype available at the Nokia Store to work
 on the phone again.<br />
I still have the customer’s copy of that work order form. They didn't charge for this recommendation, although they offered to perform the reinstall using Nokia Suite for a fee.<br />
Now, following your suggestion, I took the phone to the same Nokia Center and they confirmed your assertion: The phone needs to be "re-flashed". And like you said, they want to charge an incredibly high fee for doing it (almost half the price I paid for the
 phone!). I tried to explain that I had only followed their recommendation, but to no avail.<br />
In summary,<br />
1. Nokia recommends reinstalling the phone's software using Nokia Suite,<br />
2. After following their recommendation, the phone doesn't have all the software components it is supposed to have as per its product code,<br />
3. Nokia requests a fee to perform a "Refurbish Flash" because it is the only way to restore the phone as it is supposed to be.<br />
According to the preliminary review of my law firm, this is obviously a blatant case of fraud, although I already decided not to dwell on it and will leave my phone as is, even when everyone in my law firm wants to represent me and file a case in court against
 Nokia.<br />
Cheers,<br />

<p>The update or reinstall through Nokia Suite is the last of several troubleshooting steps, that the customer are allowed and recommended to perform, before sending the phone in for repair:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nokia.com/us-en/support/product/n8-00/product-troubleshooting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.com/us-en/support/product/n8-00/product-troubleshooting/</a></p>
<p>Notice: These steps are not guaranteed to solve the problem,&nbsp;they are&nbsp;just easy fix suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For my out-of-warranty N8&nbsp;in Denmark,&nbsp;an examination of&nbsp;the phone through a Nokia Service Partner is equal to USD50 + USD12 for shipping the phone back + the cost of mailing the phone to the workshop 100 miles away. This is the minimum charge. If they are
 to perform&nbsp;a&nbsp;refurbish flash and warrant that the phone works as out-of-the-box, I expect the bill will add up to something like USD100-125 in total. (Maybe more, but that already exceeds the value of the device).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, there are solutions out there, which can't be discussed here, and I refuse to tell anyone&nbsp;the details&nbsp;since there is a risk of bricking the phone and turn it into a paperweight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you get it sorted out one way or the other. It takes&nbsp;some commitment to keep an old Symbian phone!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Hans</p>

<p><span><span>Thank you&nbsp;for your support , Hans. I already knew there are other free alternatives to fix the phone and&nbsp;I also knew that those alternatives come at&nbsp;a risk I'm not willing
 to take. As I said, I decided&nbsp;to leave the phone as is, at least&nbsp;for&nbsp;as long as the phone works (see below).<br />
Before terminating this topic let me share one last comment about a new problem I experienced&nbsp;while we held this conversation:<br />
It turns out that when I tried to use the mobile dictionary&nbsp;application (which, by the way, I always&nbsp;used as a quick reference tool),&nbsp;I got a message telling me that&nbsp;I had only the default&nbsp;English dictionary and&nbsp;offered&nbsp;to download an additional language. I
 always had two additional languages installed&nbsp;befor reinstalling the phone's software using Nokia Suite, so I&nbsp;decided to download them&nbsp;again. To&nbsp;my surprise,&nbsp;the installation process finished&nbsp;notifying that the certificate had expired. I tried again, and then
 again with a different language, but&nbsp;the result was the same. I immediately called&nbsp;that friendly technician at the Nokia Center&nbsp;and told him what was happening. He told me the following:<br />
As of January 1st, 2014, Nokia decided not to renew&nbsp;certificates for&nbsp;any Symbian application as they&nbsp;expire, which means that,&nbsp;in time, most of Nokia's applications will stop working. This includes&nbsp;the Maps application, the Music Player and the Camera, which
 means that I will end up anyway with a nice and expensive&nbsp;paperweight brick.The technicioan&nbsp;also explained that Nokia implemented&nbsp;this strategy to make sure they&nbsp;control the market lifecycle of all for the&nbsp;products they release. This strategy also applies
 to&nbsp;the Lumia/Microsoft line of products (finally someone taught Microsoft how to control the lifecycle of their products).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once more, I will use my "old" Symbian brick... pardon me, my Symbian phone for as long as I can and then switch back to communicate with people sending letters using the
 postal service.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Take care,<br />

<p>Carlos, for the certificate issue you can try the old trick of setting the phone's date one or two years in the past. No guarantees that it will work, but worth a try.</p>
<p>You can also try another restore of the firmware using the new tool Nokia has made available for consumer use as per

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time needed to understand the problem and for providing some suggestions to fix it. Unfortunately, none of them worked, at least in my case.</p>
<p><br />
First, I tried the trick of setting the phone's date one or two years back in the past. After each date change I even restarted the phone and only then&nbsp;tried downloading the additional languages, but every single time&nbsp;the target site reported that the connection
 had been terminated (Connection lifetime expired).&nbsp;But wait, it gets worse: now, after resetting the phone to its factory settings again, correcting the date and making sure the date is automatically updated,&nbsp;I can't even get to the download page: the site
 keeps reporting the same error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, I tried the Nokia Software Recovery Tool to get the latest widgets back (btw, it took ages for the 4GB+ download to complete). Still, after the phone was restarted and after it finished downloading all the available application updates, I am still
 missing&nbsp;all of those&nbsp;useful Belle Refresh widgets: the small music player, the latest on/off widgets, the different clock widgets, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I am now wondering what's&nbsp;</span><span>next:</span> Should I give up&nbsp;<span>and</span>
<span>enjoy whatever I can, even though&nbsp;</span><span>I have
</span><span>official documents from</span> <span>Nokia</span> that&nbsp;<span>show without any doubt that</span>
<span>all this trouble</span> <span>was caused by</span>
<span>mistakes they made at </span><span>the official</span>
<span>Nokia service center</span><span>?</span> Or take my phone back to them again,&nbsp;<span>pay a small fortune&nbsp;</span><span>for
</span><span>refurbishing it&nbsp;and cross&nbsp;</span><span>my fingers while they try to fix the problem? Never mind, I'm just thinking out loud.</span><span><br />

<p>Hello Hans,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I checked using SW update and installed 12 updates that showed up&nbsp;when the phone was restarted after completing the software recovery. One of those updates in particular (New Homescreen Widgets) made me think I had finally hit the nail and that the
 phone had been&nbsp;restored to the state it is supposed to be. I was wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can also confirm that the missing widgets came as part of an additional update after installing Belle Refresh (not more tha one or two months afterwards).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<h2>            cannot install an extension without administrator password&#59; and an internet explorer process that cannot be removed by simply end-tasking it.</h2>
                    When i'm using a public computer with a Dorkbot virus (it sometimes goes back for several days to weeks after removing it), it always have an internet explorer process without description, and cannot be end-process or end-process tree. there's also a lots
 of "windows installer", "notepad", and "Microsoft paint" when i view it on Windows Task Manager, sometimes, i cannot install an antivirus program, is this really a super threat to the computer? because when i use other computers nearby to the infected computer,
 Dorkbot also&nbsp;propagates there, i don't put any removable drives because i know it's unsafe . another problem not connected to this,&nbsp;&nbsp;for Internet Explorer,&nbsp;how can i install adblock and ghostery without asking for administrator password? i really hate ads,
 whether form other unknown sources or from Microsoft itself (sorry) . how could i bypass it legally?

<h2>            Notes Master Corruption and PowerPoint Online</h2>
                    This is based on a small sample, but it looks like editing in&nbsp;<strong>PowerPoint Online</strong> may be cause of the Notes Master page shrinking (it never seems to get larger).&nbsp;

<p>My mother downloaded Office 2007 successfully onto our PC at home back in 2008. The license she got was for three users but so far it has only been used on the home PC.</p>
<p>I have been using trial versions of office and Office 2003 on my laptop but they have now been deleted off my laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish to install Office 2007 on my laptop using the license/product key I have from the version my mother downloaded on the home PC.</p>
<p>How do I install/download Office 2007 given I have the product key/full license???????&nbsp;</p>

            It was never an app store install. &nbsp;Not sure why logs showed that other than it must try those rights as well during the install process.

<div>I'm dealing with the iMac that had safe boot issues. &nbsp;In fact that is cleaned up at this point.</div>

<div>What finally fixed this for me was downloading the "trial" version of Office 2011 from MS and entering the software key that came with my DVD. &nbsp;Installed just fine.</div>

<p>Hi Hari,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. As I understand you are prompted to active the Office suite and when you try to active it fails. Let me help you with the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verify if you have multiple versions of Office installed on the computer by going to control panel, programs and features list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you find any Office suite apart from the Office Professional Plus<span>&nbsp;
</span>2010 which you have installed, you may uninstall the unwanted Office program from the computer to avoid conflicts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If multiple Office programs does not exist and you are facing issues with online activation, then you may contact the Microsoft activation department to get the Office program activated over the phone:</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span>I hope the above link helps. If you need any further assistance reply and we will be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Before uninstalling, you could try closing all office apps, then starting one using (one of the following) "Run As Admin" techniques and activating it one more time.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<b>Win7 &amp; Vista – in Start menu, single click to select item to select it, then use &lt;CTL&gt;&lt;SHF&gt;&lt;Enter&gt; to start it in “Run As Admin” mode</b>

</i></p>
<p>FYI: for this situation, you can consider Vista and Win7 to be essentially interchangeable with only minor differences between the user interface in the 2 versions.</p>
<p>In Win7, even when you are logged in as administrator, UAC no longer gives you “Full” administrator rights. To get all of the access you now also have “run as administrator”
</p>
<p>It appears there is an error where your userid is not being allowed to update the activation information in the registry.</p>
<p>The general process is :</p>

<p><span>This works great, except for when there are no records for one of the subs; I get the typical “Blank Form” sub main form. I’m trying to find a way to have the sub 'auto-open' in data entry when an instance of no sub-records occurs. This would also
 trigger a message box that tells the user they need to add information. <span>&nbsp;</span>I’m struggling with the method, and where to link the ‘event’ to: does it belong in the parent form/sub form? I have custom navigation buttons that allow the user to move
 through the ‘parent’ records that drive data/record population in successive child sub forms using queries and Master/Child based on Foreign keys. .
<span>&nbsp;</span>I’ve tried using the after event for the textbox in the ‘parent’ sub to check the record count of the sub form, but that didn’t work. The sub(s) still blanked out as soon as there were no results.<span>&nbsp;

    <title>What&#39;s Working Right In Windows 10.... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            What&#39;s Working Right In Windows 10....</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>Its normal for people to post the issues and questions they're having in an attempt to get answers. But unlike these posts, I'm finding really excellent success in getting Windows 10 to function as an OS. Sure, I've found problems, but nothing that can't
 be worked around, e.g., having to go to the Start Menu instead of the Taskbar to select an app or program.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My Comments Accumulated Over Time - Build 9841 - October 5th - 11th</strong><br />
<br />
October 5th - Installation. I chose to install it as the sole OS on a legacy laptop - A Dell Latitude D630; Intel Core Two Duo with 2GB RAM. It installed flawlessly; it looked like a finished OS Application. There were no 'awkward pauses', screen hick-ups,
 or any hint of a crash or mis-step. Even on my legacy machine the installation took less than 30 minutes (obviously this doesn't include the 3 hour download time).<br />
<br />
The first thing I do when I set up any new computer is to take the basic OS and customize its working to my style. This involves the obvious personalization choices (tan beach over early-prison-reform-blue) as well as the personal productivity tweaks that lets
 me be in control of how the computer works. Some of these tweaks date back to Win9x; everyone, save one, has installed and functioned without a problem.<br />
<br />
My specific comments begin with the new Start Menu. The right-click menu is a vast and tremendous improvement. It may not be useful to novices, but to the rest of us its a true godsend. Keep it as is, at a minimum, and maximally let users add to it. Overall
 I see a menu that tries to be everything to all people, and while unification across devices / formats is a desirable goal, it needs to be a seemless merging of the desktop and the tiles. Think of it this way, it currently looks and feels like A or B, it needs
 to be AB, and barring that it needs to have an AA and BB capability.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that some of us want or need a strictly desktop configuration, the same way some people will want / need the mobile version or the tablet version, or the phone version. The function needs to be universal across the board, using as many common
 elements as is possible across all users' experiences.<br />
<br />
Other Personalization notes:&nbsp; In working with the Desktop Background component when one clicks on either Select All or Clear All, it clears or selects every tile across every single background selection and not just the selection group you're working on. In
 the Color Category, where you elect to modify the color scheme, the controls don't allow you to turn off the "aero" transparency. The section is also exceedingly slow to load thumbnails and work with areas of color. All other areas of the Personalization section
 worked as expected.<br />
<br />
Applications:&nbsp; As I said at the beginning all of my legacy apps save one installed without a hitch and all work as they should. These include all of the following apps and programs. Those with an "*" are more 'modern' apps that currently work and are maintained
 to remain compatible with Windows versions 7 &amp; 8 / 8.1.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DblClick - makes the middle mouse button the equivalent of a double left-click button, v. 1, 2012.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CapsLock Changer - allows you to assign a specific function to the Caps Lock Key (mine I disable), 2012.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ClipX - a clipboard enhancement utility, 2011.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * StartMenuX - a Start Menu replacement utility, where all Start Menu items appear on a single screen, 2014.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Startup Guard - Startup Guard will alert you when new programs are added to the auto-startup sections in real time, 2009 (!).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Texter - allows the creation of hotstrings, where a given shortcut is replaced by a string of text, v. .6, 2011.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Ultimate Windows Tweaker v. 2 &amp; 3 - tweaking utility for Windows versions 7 and 8 / 8.1, 2014.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WizMouse - a scroll wheel enhancement utility, 2013.<br />
<br />
The one program that didn't install / run properly was my zip extraction utility, Universal Extractor, version 1.6.1. The error message was that the application failed to install a file system driver. Which brings me to my last point here. NetFramework 3.5
 is not installed by default. As many applications, such as photo editing and imaging apps, use previous versions of numerous legacy redistributables and NetFramework , more than just the current NetFramework and redistributables must be included in the final
 production release. It easily makes the difference between an application installing and running, and not working at all.<br />
<br />
As for more modern production applications, I've installed and tested several, and again all have worked flawlessly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diagram Designer - a flowcharting drawing program complete with layers, scaling, spell checking, and color print capabilities.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DropBox - a cloud file sharing storage and sharing application.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hard Disk Sentinel - a hard drive real-time monitoring and alerting application.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hekasoft Backup &amp; Restore - Backs up and restore all manner of internet browsers and email clients; one app covers all.<br />
<br />
<strong>October 10th:</strong><br />
&nbsp;I continued to install programs on my legacy machine (Dell D630; 2009 build date), and all continues to work flawlessly.<br />
<br />
Applications:&nbsp; I've installed / used several more modern programs that currently work and are maintained compatible with Windows versions 7 &amp; 8 / 8.1.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Auto Update of Pale Moon - a x64 Bit Firefox derivative optimized for speed and the 64 Bit environment.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AVG Internet Security 2015 - Anti-virus and Firewall program. It performs perfectly under 10.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Belarc Advisor - a system-wide security and reporting application.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FileMenu Tools -&nbsp; file tools program that corrects missing new folder function in Win 7 (amongst other file and folder functions).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FossaMail - Thunderbird derivative for x64 Bit systems.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gadwin Print Screen - x64 Bit utility that takes screenshots and edits and transmits them.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IOBit Uninstaller 4 - a 3rd party uninstaller, including deep scans for leftover components.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Java - x64 Bit programming language.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAGIX Photo Designer 7 - an alternative to PhotoShop while providing medium to high-end editing capabilities.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PC Boost - a program that optimizes speed and transfer rates on computers with multiple processor (CPU) cores.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SoftMaker Office for Windows, 2012 Edition, updated through 2014 - a Microsoft Office Compatible Suite.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sumatra - a very fast and lean PDF reader; integrates into browsers.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UnLock it v3 - a utility for unlocking files and folders locked by the Operating System.<br />
<br />
All but IOBit Uninstaller and UnLock It v3 installed and ran flawlessly on the first go 'round. IOBit Uninstaller required that I uninstall the earlier version first and then install the newer version. After that, it worked fine as well.<br />
<br />
UnLock It gave the error message that it was missing a file driver (Error 50), and could not be run, the exact same problem as Universal Extractor (zip de-archiving program).<br />
<br />
<strong>October 11th:</strong><br />
I lost the Taskbar shortcut for File Explorer, and have been unable to re-pin it to the Taskbar. Today I abandoned the effort. Whatever the reason is, pinning apps and programs to the Taskbar is an essential requirement for the desktop to perform. No one but
 the end user should decide what can and cannot be added to the Taskbar.<br />
<br />
Today I also played with the Registry. With great success. I am visually impaired and the standard system fonts are not bold enough for me. I have found that modifying these lines with the Bold-weighted Trebuchet Font as the system font provides the necessary
 enhancement, without forcing me to give up the other vidual effects I'd like to keep.<br />
<br />

;End file. Save as a *.reg file then double-click it to add the file to the Registry.<br />
<br />
The script was originally written for Windows 7; I took a chance that it would work with the Registry in 10, and it did. Its most notable impact is the Taskbar and the revised File Explorer, where both are noticeably easier to read.</p>

<h2>            How to use two separate kinds of footnotes&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i would like to have two different kinds of footnotes. Both should appear at the bottom of the page, but one would be for annotations, while the other one would be for references.</p>
<p>Ideally, they would be in different fonts or with arabic and latin numbers. So basically my problem could be solved if it was possible to make endnotes behave like footnotes.</p>
<p>This isn't an academic work this and references means URLs etc., mostly not formal citations.</p>
<p>

            You can mix 1, 2, 3, ... numbering with manual footnotes, if that helps. You will have to use the Footnote and Endnote dialog box (click the dialog launcher button in the Footnotes group on the References tab) to insert them.

<h2>            Need Answer to Perfectly Reasonable Question</h2>
                    <p>Two weeks ago&nbsp;I contacted Microsoft live chat about a problem and they knew literally nothing, but tried their best.&nbsp;They told me to ask in the forums where a Microsoft representative can find an answer for me. I haven't got any reply from you and get an

<h2>            Error 504 5.5.2</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to connect to a IMAP server, the SMTP keeps coming back with "Send test e-mail message:&nbsp; The server responded: 504 5.5.2"</p>
<p>I have increases time out time, tried all the various port/authenication combos possible, deleted the account and added it manually as well as automatically, still no joy.&nbsp; Is there a fix for this?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Triple-check the name of the SMTP server.&nbsp; That error often means the server couldn't be found because you don't have the fully qualified domain name.&nbsp; i.e. it may need to be SMTP.YOURHOST.COM or something like that.</p>
<p>Confirm with your ISP if possible.</p>

    <title>Hybrid Setup with non Exchange Server - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Hybrid Setup with non Exchange Server</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p><br />
I have a few mailboxes I currently can't migrate from our old non Exchnage server.</p>
<p><br />
Thus I setup connectors as described here: <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn751020(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
technet.microsoft.com/.../dn751020(v=exchg.150).aspx</a></p>
<p>But sending the test (from the Connector Validation wizard) email to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (a mailbox on that other server) fails with the following error (see at the end of the post).</p>
<p><br />
I assume this is because I need to specify which mailboxes exist on the other server - but how can I do this? If I don't need to specify the mailboxes - where is the error?</p>
<p><br />
Thank you</p>
<p><br />
Philippe</p>

<p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>Based on my experience, some folder permissions assigned to others in the Outlook client may not be synced to OWA(<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>). To do a test to reproduce it, can you please provide the detailed steps of how
 you share folders&nbsp;with others and capture corresponding screenshots for us?</p>
<p>Also, about&nbsp;“They appear in the employees desktop Outlook”, can you share with us a screenshot for analysis?</p>
<p>To upload screenshots, you can click <strong>Use rich formatting</strong> in the forum and then click the icon of
<strong>Insert Media</strong>.</p>
<p>We appreciate your efforts.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Aaron</p>

<p>Hi Aaron</p>
<p>Very simple: create folder &gt; right click said folder &gt; Permissions &gt; Add &gt; Select staff member and press OK &gt; Set permission level to publishing editor &gt; Apply &gt; OK</p>
<p>Folder then shows in their desktop Outlook (sorry can't provide screenshot at present) under the info@ mailbox heading in the left pain but doesn't show in 365 OWA.</p>
<p>We really need these folders to show in OWA.</p>

<p>hi kevin,</p>
<p>does the shared folder show up in the outlook desktop client like the following screenshot displays?</p>

<p>if yes, we need to manually add them to owa. here are detailed steps:</p>
<p>sign in to owa &lt; right click your main mailbox name &lt; add shared folder… &lt; input the owner’s email address</p>
<p>if not, could you send us a screenshot, so we can better understand your situation?</p>
<p>thanks for your efforts.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Traversetrans,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings from Skype!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can still call your MAC contacts on Skype. This is only possible if your MAC Address contacts are synchronized to your Skype app. To isolate your issue, are these MAC address contacts already synced to Skype? If not, kindly follow the steps provided
 on this <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34840/how-do-i-sync-my-address-book-with-my-skype-contact-list?q=sync" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade &#38;&#38; Clean install fails - weird situation</h2>
                    <p>So here are the steps I took and what it resulted in:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to upgrade to windows 10 through windows update. This seemed to work, but alas once it downloaded and finished installing, it kept saying installation failed. No reason given. My test pc was somewhat messy and even mutilated, so I decided to try
 a clean install. During the clean install (burned ISO to a DVD+R), but when trying to install it informs me that I am possibly lacking media drivers... maybe... it is impossible to know what drivers, I tried my driver CD's but non showed up containing any
 drivers according to the auto scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end I decided to install a clean windows 7 (that was due anyway) and retry. After installing my graphics card, activating windows and running windows update to install all non-optional updates I downloaded the upgrade tool again. Before even getting
 to windows update it now tells me my system does not meet the requirements to install windows 10 TP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run with a quad core 2,83 ghz, 8 gb ram and a gtx680 and run windows 7 home (I am not sure wether prior to installing I had 7 home or 7 ultimate installed, I have both)</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that the installation did not run well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which tool did you use to burn the media?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you use the tool from the below mentioned link to download and create installation media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Download Windows 10 Technical Preview ISO</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso</a>
</p>
<p><strong>Create installation media for Windows 8.1</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The troubleshooting steps in the above link are for Windows 8, however they hold good for Windows 10 Tech Preview as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Remember, trying out an early build like this can be risky. That's why we recommend that you don't install the preview on your primary home or business PC. Unexpected PC crashes could damage or even delete your files, so you should back up everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I suggest you to please go through the suggestions in the below mentioned link.</p>

<h2>            How to convert XML files to Word 2007&#47;2010 Doc</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>i have two Word files, which are surveys that contain some questions. I have a lot of these surveys answered but in a XML format. What i wanted to do is to convert/import these XML files to the same file of my surveys, like if the users were answering
 directly using MS Word. Is it possible to convert/import several files? These XML files contain basically some text and the path to some images (which are stored in the computer). Can it be done using Word alone or do i have to make it via coding?</div>

            If you insert an XML "data" file into Word, all you see is the data in the elements, and possibly some element tag markers. To make it appear the way you want it you either need to&nbsp;
<div>&nbsp;a. write VBA code (say) that reads the XML file "as data" and inserts whatever you need into the document or</div>
<div>&nbsp;b. write an XSLT transform that converts the XML file to WordProcessingML (Word 2003 format), then insert that file into your document.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The trouble with (b) is that you have to understand a lot about the WordProcessingML vocabulary even to get started. Once you have written the XSLT, you can use { INCLUDETEXT } fields to include the transformed XML, e.g.</div>
<div><br />
<div>{ INCLUDETEXT "the path name of the .xml" \t "the pathname of the transform .xsl" \c XML }</div>
<div><br />
<div>which might be an advantage in your scenario, but I think you will probably be better off with (a).</div>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same question... 5 years later.</p>
<p>Is there any new convenient way to insert XML code in Word and Excel ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Project: define a XML object that can be inserted into Word and Excel, and if possible edited there.</p>
<p>(Word offers the lay-out and traces changes, while Excel offers a tabular lay-out, close to the application data, which is coming from a database. Like you did with .NET, can we combine these advantages ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The INCLUDE field is a kind of XML.text method. Is there a way to manage the XML as an object, providing a wider interface? Example: When editing a XML object in office, is there a way to catch the event XML.edit ? &nbsp;(to interact with the XML object, through
 .NET : well this would require to define the "editor=.NET" attribute).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&gt; Is there any new convenient way to insert XML code in Word and Excel ?<br />
<br />
There is nothing new in the out-of-the-box version of Word for that. I really don't know on the Excel side - you may be better off asking a separate question. The main change in recent versions is the availability of &nbsp;Microsoft's JavaScript Office APIs, which
 may have a bearing on what you want to do.<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I am assuming that you are not looking for the kind of XML-related facility that Word used to have in the 2007 version, and for a short time in 2010, but which was removed following a
 court case, but rather an ability to edit some thing like an XML code block.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If so, it sounds as if what you are looking for would actually be satisfied by an XML Editor that is capable of acting as an OLE server, or perhaps as an ActiveX control that can be embedded
 in Word.<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">There are certainly things out there that do something like that - e.g. the commercial TX Text Control, but AFAIK not all ActiveX controls will work well when the container is a Word
 document surface. Still, it suggests that you could do most of what you want if you are are capable of writing your own complete COM server.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Even in that case, if you need your XML objects to be able to span pages in Word, your server would have to be able to render the object's contents as plain text, RTF, HTML or possibly
 OOXML (not sure about the latter), which means it would be difficult to prevent users from "accidentally" editing the text without using the server.<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Other approaches you might be able to take (and I am really just speculating here) include...<br />
&nbsp;a. you find or implement a .NET Windows form control that can do the editing you require, and use VSTO to enable you to host it on the document surface. I believe VSTO actually uses Word's ActiveX Control feature to do that.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;b. you isolate the XML code in a rich text content control and try to use its events to control how the content is edited (my guess is that realistically speaking you would have to do
 something like detect a click in the control, copy the content to an editing pane somewhere, then copy it back when done).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;c. Like (b), but provide a separate editing panel and rely on the user to indicate that they want to edit the content. At one time, you could use things such as "Smart Documents" or
 Task Panes constructed in VSTO. I do not know what the status of those technologies is now. However, this is I suppose where the Javascript APIs might come in, because (1) they are the thing Microsoft is actually trying to push at the moment, (2) you have
 a chance of re-using the vast collection of JS code "out there", and (3) the technology is intended to be cross-platform (desktop Windows Word, desktop Mac Word, Online Word), although there is still a long way to go on that front. None of the other suggestions
 made so far would have a chance of working on anything except desktop Windows Word.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Finally, what about Word ability to "write back" text included with an INCLUDETEXT field to the original file? Well, unfortunately that only works when the file is in one of Word's "native"
 formats, and I think you always have to use a named converter to include a .xml file that you want to be treated as text.<br />

<p>Yes, I think I could write .NET code and manage my data into a word file, may be as a COM object. Huge work. I am just surprized that there is no such interface between word and xml, or at least not the one I expected to exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So I rephrase the question:</p>
<p>Is there any attempt to have structured text into Word ? &nbsp;(I believe there is something).</p>
<p>Example: I wish to write docs in a structured way, using a xsd template for "project description" and include data for "tasks" (description, due date, responsible...) or "myData" (title, problem, possible solution)".</p>
<p>I wish I have the option "insert a new project", then fill the xml elements.</p>
<p>dotx templates are not a nice solution.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>&gt; (I believe there is something).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would say that there *used to be* something, as I said before, and there may be 3rd party things (in which case a search engine will likely give you more help than I can).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's nothing in the product itself that will take a .xsd and present you with a form that would constrain you to enter insert text. etc. that conformed to that .xsd. There used to be a kind of facility to do that (the Document Information Panel), but
 that has now gone, was really tied to SharePoint use, and panel itself was presented by InfoPath, which is now deprecated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does still exist is the ability to insert content controls, individually or grouped inside rich text content controls, protect the document so that you can constrain editing to those controls, and associate the controls with an item (such as an element)
 in an .xsd that you have imported into the "Office Schema Library", in which case Word will do some validation on the content. It's not an area I have visited for a long time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows Word 2013 and later you also get "repeating content controls" which may help you create things such as task lists. But you are then talking about having a fairly fixed layout, e.g. not one which would present different elements depending on the
 task type, etc.&nbsp;</p>

 "copy &amp; paste" or I can select ALL the cells that need to have the same data, enter the data &amp; hit CTRL + Enter but that takes too much time as well. Because lets say the amout of cells I need to have the same data is 100...I don't want to have to select ALL
 100 cells! Is there a formula out there that can help me achive this?

            <p>Hello Arvind,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the late response. &nbsp;The holidays were busier than I expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Answers:</p>
<ol>
<li>I changed my primary alias and deleted my previous one.</li><li>In total two aliases were created.</li><li>There were no errors, just that the emails went to my work email account.</li></ol>
<p>In Depth:</p>
<p>My company is trying to move to Visual Studio online and wanted our MSDN licenses to match our company emails. &nbsp;My MSDN license is associated with my personal email. &nbsp;I received bad instructions on how to create an email and how to transfer the license which
 resulted in the loss of my primary email. &nbsp;Previous posts confirmed that my hotmail email would not be restored so I created an outlook version and informed my contacts. &nbsp;Previously emails I would send to the account only directed to my company email and did
 not come into outlook.com. &nbsp;I think I have resolved that issue as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only outstanding thing I would like would be to separate my work email alias into its own account that carries the MSDN license and maintain my personal email without the license. &nbsp;Can you tell me how to accomplish that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Louis</p>

            <p>Hi Louis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the delayed response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue seems to be with your account subtraction settings. It is possible to remove the licenses from your personal e-mail account, but they are dealt by MSDN support members.

<p>Hi MohammedAftab,</p>
<p>To let the "EDIT LINKS" button show up, we need to enable <strong><em>SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure</em>
</strong>feature under Site Settings &gt; <strong><em>Site collection features</em></strong>, and then enable
<strong><em>SharePoint Server Publishing</em> </strong>feature under <strong><em>Site Features</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>Hi Frank,</p>
<p>the EDIT Link works in team sites and other templates not in Document Center template,</p>
<p>I know even after enabling Pub features, it will not show up in Document Center template,</p>
<p>second - I wanted to use SAVE as site feature, so will not enable publishing feature unnecessarily,</p>
<p>What I am looking for - &nbsp;if there is some workaround exist with adding some css/javascript via some link ?</p>
<p>apart from this - I am on same page I was earlier :)</p>

<p>Hi MohammedAftab,</p>
<p>To add the Edit Link button via some css/javascript, we’d suggest you post the requirement in our

SharePoint 2013 Development and programing Forum</a> which is a specific support channel for script related questions.</p>
<p>In addition, I noticed a same thread here: <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/63b54b73-9b81-4d57-b95c-daa49e5ef1c8/edit-links-missing-in-document-center?forum=sharepointgeneral" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
