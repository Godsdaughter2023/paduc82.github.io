<h2>            Winows 8 and office starter 2010 - Need help</h2>
                    I bought a Sony VAIO (SVE14113EN) laptop last year which was preloaded with Windows 7 and Office Starter 2010. I have upgraded to Windows 8 few months back and I was able to use Office even after the upgrade (Thanks to Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant which
 advised me to upgrade Office Starter before Windows upgrade).<br />
Last week, when I have reset (Remove everything and reinstall Windows) Windows 8, I saw that Office Starter was removed from my laptop. Microsoft website says "All of your personal files will be deleted and your settings will be reset.<b> Any apps the came
 with your PC will be reinstalled</b>, but all other apps will be removed. " if I reset Windows but as per this statement Windows should have re-installed Office Starter as it was preloaded when laptop was bought (given by OEM).
<br />
<b>Is there any way I could re-install Office Starter in Windows 8 now ?</b><br />
Many suggested me to do a Factory Reset of VAIO and then upgrade to WIndows 8 but that would take my laptop to OS Windows 7. My question is,<b> since I have already bought Windows 8 and using it now, will I be able to upgrade to Windows 8 using the present
 Purchase Key of Windows?</b><br />

            You misunderstood the instructions. The "apps" they are talking about are only Window 8 "Metro" / Windows Store apps.&nbsp; Any "desktop" type applications will be lost during Win 8 Reset and Refresh. They all have to be re-installed IF YOU USE THE DEFAULT
 refresh "image".<br />
<br />
I suspect since you didn't do any preparation to re-install Starter, you will have to use the recovery partition to reset computer back to Win7, apply the Windows Update to Starter, Upgrade to Win 8.<br />
<br />
Yes, you can re-use your Win 8 25 character Product Key.&nbsp; You cannot re-use your 27 character Product Key Card PIN (If you got one).<br />
<br />
Here are some methods to re-install starter:<br />
<div>
<b><span>Re-install STarter</span></b>
<p>There are 5 ways of re-installing starter that I am aware of:</p>
<ol>
<li>use the "Office Program Manager" entry in Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features</li><li>re-install Windows from the recovery partition </li><li>you have a backup copy of the Starter program files</li><li>you can find a copy the Starter installation file, SetupConsumerC2ROLW.exe, somewhere on the internet</li><li>talk to your computer builder</li></ol>
<p>Option 2 wipes out all of your installed programs and personal data files. You have to have a good full disk backup before doing it.
</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>Option 4 requires some dedicated googling. Another poster said he recently found a copy of it.&nbsp; As well, you have to decide if you trust the source to be clean of malware ...</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>Option 5 is a very long shot. They typically, ERRONEOUSLY, tell you to talk to MS for help.&nbsp; They are unlikely to give you the installation file.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>Here are the various links I've collected on re-installing Starter.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<div>
<b><span>&nbsp;</span><span>HP instructions on Office Starter Repair, Program Manager, Uninstall Starter and Re-install Starter via Program Manager in Pictures</span></b>
<div>
<p>
Although they are by HP, they can by used on many computers. The best instructions I've seen for "fixing" Office Starter are this HP page:</p>
<p><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=uk&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;docname=c02981221#N272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://h10025.www1.hp.co`m/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=uk&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;docname=c02981221#N272</span></b></a></p>
<p><span>Starter is not actually installed on your computer. It runs inside of a “virtual computer”</span> , “computer within a computer”,
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>located in the “Q:\” drive and the program code is downloaded over the internet every time the program is started. Therefore there are limited things we as users can do to "fix" starter:</span></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Run an Office Repair on Starter</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Confirm that you have the KB 2553141 update (in theory it should be there ‘automatically’ … )</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Use "MS Office Manager" to re-install Starter from the Windows program Manager</span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Re-install WINDOWS from the recovery partition, wiping all installed programs and personal data files!</span></p>
<p><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Phone the OEM who supposed to support Starter. They will tell you to do steps 1-4 and then lie to you and tell you to call MS!</span></p>

<p>On this HP notebook, if you go to the Advanced Recovery Methods page in Control Panel, you're given an option to "Return your computer to factory condition." After a restart, you're presented with these three options. The Minimize Image
 Recovery option does exactly what it sounds like. You get a clean Windows installation, with the proper drivers and required HP utilities. But trialware and other unwanted software are completely missing. On a default installation, the Programs option in Control
 Panel includes 50 entries. Using this option, the same list is stripped down to a mere 25 entries.</p>

Office 2010 Starter is only officially installed by computer builders. If you google skillfully, there are a few links to the installation files.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Home users do not have access to the installation file so there are only 3 options for “re-installing” it.</p>
<p>There is an option that allows users to re-install Office Starter without using the recovery partition.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It requires that you have the “Microsoft Office 2010 Program Manager” installed. If you go into Programs and Features dialog, look for the “Microsoft Office 2010” entry.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The link above shows how this entry appears in Programs and Features, and how to use it to re-install Office Starter.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<b>Starter is Part of the Recovery Partition</b>

</b></p>
<p>Hard drive recovery is a requirement for distributing Office Starter 2010. A hard-disk-based recovery solution enables Win7 to automatically recover from most known causes for unbootable systems as a result of loss or corruption of files.
</p>
<p>This type of recovery will wipe out all of your installed programs and personal data files. Therefore, before starting this type of “repair” you should make a backup of your disk and make sure that you have the installation files and
 product keys for all of your applications.</p>

    <title>Office XP Professional Service Pack 3 will not install with out disk. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gdreiman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office XP Professional Service Pack 3 will not install with out disk.</h2>
                    I am attempting to install Service Pack 3 for Microsoft Office&nbsp; XP Professional. However once the installation process starts I am asked to insert the Office XP Professional disk, which I don't have. Office XP Professional came preinstalled on my computer
 so I have no disk to insert to continue the Service Pack 3 installation. I have already tried downloading the full service pack version from http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=23334.
<br />
<br />
The site says "<b>OfficeXpSp3-kb832671-fullfile-enu.exe</b>: Download this file if you do not have access to your installation source or if you experience problems installing the officeXpSp3-kb832671-client-enu.exe file." However when I download the file and
 try to install it, I run in to the same error. Is there any way to install Service Pack 3 with out having to spend $125 to buy software I already have?

            You cannot block the phone if it is switched off. Your network should be able to blacklist it if you report it missing based on the IMEI, but all that means is that it will not be possible to use it on that network and maybe on all networks in your country.<br />

<h2>            Outlook Keeps changing IMAP Server Settings</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p><span>This is definitely a MS problem.&nbsp; I'm having the same issue and I use ipage yet have the same problem as others have stated.&nbsp; 3 times MS has "fixed" the issue and today it's back.&nbsp; I just got off of live chat with MS
 their solution now is to create a new profile...&nbsp; That is not a fix!&nbsp; Why is no one from MS stepping here to assist with this?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have pasted the above comment from a poster because MS in their questionable have locked the topic. I have exactly the same problem, albeit with a different server. The problem is exactly the same with settings constantly
 changing no matter what steps are taken. Our Office 365 account is up for renewal soon and there is absolutely no way that it will get renewed if the problem is fixed very soon. It is disappointing because the whole pack is quite good except for this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>None of us have the time to waste checking these settings constantly while MS does nothing whatsoever to fix the problem.</span></p>

I am not sure why the name of the mail provider is significant. The IMAP accounts were set up manually in order to make sure all settings were correct!

            This same issue started for me just a few days ago.&nbsp; It is affecting 3 out of 5 computers in my office.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has taken me until today to find that there are (2) ways/areas to get to the server settings.&nbsp; Day one and two,&nbsp;I used&nbsp;the tab labeled Server Settings
 (most obvious so that's got to be it, right?), confirmed setting&nbsp;information to be correct, as I exit and save, I keep getting an error message saying something went gone....try again later.&nbsp; &nbsp; Today, I used Account Settings and chose Repair.&nbsp; Opens the same
 box as the Server Settings tab however, this time I find the wrong server name and once I changed it (keep in mind, as a repair), my email was up a running but&nbsp;for only minutes.&nbsp; I have had to check those setting (under two different tabs, server settings
 and account settings)&nbsp;and change them both at least&nbsp;5 times today just to be able to send and receive.&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it that Outlook is changing this setting?&nb

<p>
</p><p>Very succinctly put indeed. The arrogance of Microsoft is palpable because they appear to have no intention of fixing this broken piece of garbage. I managed to solve the changed IMAP settings somehow! But now it either saves sent email in the Drafts folder
 or not at all and then decides whether or not to even send the email to the intended recipient. The success of my business depends on this once great software but not any more! I have spent the last week setting up Thunderbird to replace Outlook and so far
 it is a great success. There is no chance of us renewing the Office 365 account when it falls due. I am quite surprised how many other people suffering the same problems as us.

    <title>Rentals not showing up on other devices - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patron5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rentals not showing up on other devices</h2>
                    <p>I rented a few $0.10 movies on one device, but not the device I want to watch them on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to the other device, there are no movies listed that I rented/own. Both devices are fully updated Win10 PCs using a MS account to login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the device I want to watch them on, I signed out of the store and signed back in (saw a thread about that), but it didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I'm assuming this works like the competition (Google Play, iTunes, etc) where you just sign in and it works, but no such luck for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks...</p>

            <p>Well, I thought this would be interesting to figure out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After my last call to Microsoft, which lasted one hour and five minutes, I hung up. (At the time, accounting was transferring me somewhere and I gave up on waiting.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Summary: Nobody at Microsoft could tell me what happened or how to see the movies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boring details:</p>
<p>On my first call, I was disconnected transferring to the third department.</p>
<p>On my second call, I was disconnected by the third technician (he seemed to by typing something, and the line went dead.)</p>
<p>On my third call, I was disconnected on the second transfer.</p>
<p>On my fourth call, I was disconnected transferring to sales. Before the transfer I asked for the number of the next department.</p>
<p>I called that number, 855 425 8769, and got dead air.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hour long call...</p>
<p>The first person couldn't say what department they were, but transferred me once.</p>
<p>The second person was a Win10 technician who remoted in to my computer, poked around, and transferred me to billing.</p>
<p>The third person (billing) was very confused and offered a refund, which I didn't want. She transferred me.</p>
<p>The fourth person was back in Win10 support and after reviewing things, had no suggestions and transferred me to accounting (different from billing.)</p>
<p>The fifth person (billing) verified all the transactions are there and couldn't do anything else. I thought she was transferring me back to Win10 support, but I think the automated prompt that asked for my phone number said Xbox.</p>
<p>I then gave up.</p>

                    I'm still in the trial period of subscribing to Office 365, am I correct in thinking that I should already have the 1tb of onedrive space allocated to me or does that happen when Microsoft take the first payment? currently onedrive is showing 18gig.

<p>1 TB of storage will not be available with trial version of Office 365. You will be able to use the full storage capacity once your Office 365 subscription is upgraded to full subscription. Office 365 subscriptions
 will be increasing from to 1 TB by about August 31, 2014.</p>

    <title>I see an overlap between WTP and 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I see an overlap between WTP and 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Since the first version of WTP arrived I've seen what I call an overlap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I change the background in WTP the next boot into 8.1 shows the same background.&nbsp; This started before 9860.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just now, while exploring Start Menu I managed to change the color and appearance personalization.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new color was migrated to 8.1 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first noticed different colors in WTP when I switched between Start Screen and Start Menu from Taskbar settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this intentional or some artifact?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Inquiring minds...</p>

                    <p>This is an issue I have had off &amp; on for some while and surprised that there is no one else suffering.&nbsp; I Have a hotmail.com account for more years than I can remember and pay for it as well.&nbsp; I use through Outlook (Office 365) on my PC and the Outlook App
 on my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the different levels of junk filtering am now getting 130-150 of them a day in my Inbox. Blocking them and they still turn up from the same addresses.&nbsp; Must be a limit on how many you can block or just ain't working as there are only 343
 blocked senders in my list - let me think 3 days worth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen many historic posts on this and there never is a fix posted - I have 3 other email accounts with gmail and I am surprised if I get 1 junk email in a year in those.&nbsp; It going to be a pain but I think I am going to move everything over to gmail
 at least I will save myself a few bob every year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can't MS stop spam on Hotmail?<br />

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Hmm! &nbsp; For the past few weeks it nas been working fine with junk going to junk with little or no unsafe mail going to my inbox - Oh and I did not do anything since my last post - Explain that one MS? &nbsp; Yeah you have done something with your filtering processes<br />
I bet. </p>

<p>Hello Pblake80,</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I know how did you configure this hotmail account in Outlook client? Via the default Exchange method or using POP/IMAP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, please go to the web client of Hotmail, try adding the blocked sender in the block lists. Will it work when checking emails via web page? If yes, Outlook should works fine after that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, please share the version of your Outlook client (File &gt; Office account)&nbsp; and then try creating a new profile for your hotmail account. Will the issue occur again in the new created one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Choose Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Mail.</p>
<p>Show Profiles &gt; Add</p>
<p><span>In the Profile Name box, type a name for the profile, and then choose OK</span><span>，</span><span> tick

<p>My issue on this note is that I can only successfully create rules like once per day. Meaning one lonely spam mail/day.

<p>
</p><p>And how just many do I receive in a day?</p>
<p>

</p><p>It was set up in add account option in Outlook 365 I think using the default exchange option.&nbsp; I had the issue before and I deleted the account and added it again and that seemed to sort it for a while.&nbsp; Interesting the Blocked sender list in the web Outlook
 looks different to the one in Outlook 365 Client.&nbsp; You cannot enter the export lost in the web version or copy the one from the web version - no import / export function there.&nbsp; I am not going to enter blocked sender 1 by 1 - I also noted that in the webs
 version you can only enter 1024 emails and 1024 Domains.&nbsp; Well they does not take long to fill up with 100 junk emails a day.&nbsp; MS should be doing more at their end to stop spam.&nbsp; other providers do.&nbsp; Oh and what the is the point of having a junk mail filter
 that says only from safe sender list - it clear does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a new profile and told to use that - lest see what Happens</p>

<p>Just had an automated prompt&nbsp; form MS asking if this has been resolved - I have now completely given up - The only thing left to try is to remove my account and set it up again when I have a spare few hours or so.&nbsp; In the meantime I will just keep deleting
 the 100 or so junk emails in my inbox as none of the other features are working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Absolutely pathetic.&nbsp; Instead of having routines to check whether an issue has been resolved MS should have a human looking at these posts and responding accordingly or use the code for processing queries used for blocking junk email - Other providers can!</p>

<p>I also get about 150 emails per day routed to my Junk inbox.&nbsp; Every day I delete all of these and mark them as junk (meaning they will be deleted and I will get them no more).&nbsp; &nbsp;Most all return with the same "from name" and the same subject information.&nbsp;
 They do NOT have the same email address so I guess that is why they are not deleted.&nbsp;

<h2>            Using a Combo Box with One to Many Relationships</h2>
                    <p>I have two tables, EquipmentTypeList and EquipmentList.&nbsp; There is a one to many relationship between the two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the index keys setup as a number for the relationship.&nbsp; But I would like to be able to setup a form without a subform that I can enter new pieces of equipment.&nbsp; I would like to be able to select the the type description in the form from a combo box
 and have it automatically pull in EqTypeVerInterval and EqTypeEVP, and then put the Equipment List stuff in next but tie it all together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I don't want to do is need to reference the autonumber from the EqTypeList.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should be easy, but I'm struggling to make the Query work.</p>

            You typically want to base a form on the single table tblEquipList. This table will have a single field eqType which will store the value from EquipType. You can include the EqTypeVerInterval and EqTypeEVP fields in the Row Source of the combo box. Then in your form, add a text box with a control source that will display one of the non-bound columns of the combo box with an expression like:
<br />
<br />=[YourComboBoxName].Column(x)
<br />
<br />The number for "x" is the column number from the combo box keeping in mind the columns are numbered beginning with 0.

            Thank you.&nbsp; is there a way that i can select the eqTypeDescription, and not select the number and have the cascading in the query work right?

<br />
<br />You need to joint the Equipment lIst to the Type table on the Type ID. You can then pull in any value value from either table into your query.

            When inserting a new row into tblEquipList&nbsp; you would select an equipment type from a combo box set up in the way Duane and Scott have described.&nbsp; However, you might wish to assign the equipment to a new equipment type not currently represented in the
 tblEqipType list table, which will require a new row to be entered into that table before the row in tblEquipList can be saved.<br />
<br />
To do this you can make use of the NotInList event procedure of the EqType combo box in the form.&nbsp; This enables you to type the new eqTypeDescription into the combo box, which will cause the NotInList event procedure to execute.&nbsp; In your case you will need
 the code to pop up a dialogue form, bound to&nbsp; tblEqipType, at an empty new record, passing the eqTypeDescription value you entered into the combo box to the form. This will enable you to then insert values into the EqTypeVerInterval and EqTypeEVP columns.&nbsp;
 When the dialogue form is closed, and focus is returned to the calling form, the new row will appear in the EqType combo box's list and the EqTypeVerInterval and EqTypeEVP will appear in the unbound controls.<br />
<br />
You'll find an example of this in <em>NotInList.zip</em> in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link, copy the link (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo file illustrates the use of the event procedure in a number of contexts.&nbsp; The City combo box in the frmContacts form would be the model to follow in your case.&nbsp; It's NotInList procedure is as follows:<br />
<br />
Private Sub City_NotInList(NewData As String, Response As Integer)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim ctrl As Control<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strMessage As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set ctrl = Me.ActiveControl<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strMessage = "Add " &amp; NewData &amp; " to list?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If MsgBox(strMessage, vbYesNo + vbQuestion) = vbYes Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenForm "frmCities", _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DataMode:=acFormAdd, _<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
This code calls the frmCities form, in which the region in which the city is located can be entered/selected.&nbsp; The code in the form's Open event procedure assigns the value, i.e. the city name passed to the form via its OpenArgs property to the city text box
 control in the form as its DefaultValue property:<br />
<br />
<br />
Private Sub Form_Open(Cancel As Integer)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNull(Me.OpenArgs) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.City.DefaultValue = """" &amp; Me.OpenArgs &amp; """"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
The above example is for demo purposes only, as in real life city names can be duplicated.&nbsp; A more realistic scenario is to be found in
<em>DatabaseBasics.zip</em> in the same OneDrive folder.&nbsp; In this the section on <em>
'entering data via a form/subforms'</em> includes a contacts form in which correlated combo boxes are used to select a country, then a region and finally a city.&nbsp; The first two are unbound, while the city combo box is bound to the CityID column in the table.&nbsp;
 The NotInList event procedure of each combo box allows a new country, and/or region and/or city to be entered into the control, but in this case no dialogue form is opened as all the necessary data is entered into the referenced tables in the event procedures:<br />
<br />
Private Sub cboCountry_NotInList(NewData As String, Response As Integer)<br />

In this case cities of the same name can be inserted.&nbsp; The demo use Paris, Texas, USA and Paris, Île-de-France, France as examples.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Shipping Version Hangs at &#34;Confirm Media Center&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tigerg2000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Shipping Version Hangs at &#34;Confirm Media Center&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Today I started the install of the shipping version of Windows 10. It failed to install! I have been impressed by the Preview version but now the shipping version has failed for different reasons to install on my laptop and on my desktop.&nbsp;I have already&nbsp;submitted
 a post on the installation problem experienced on my laptop. This post is about the problem on my desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The desktop has Windows 8.1 Pro 64 bit installed. It includes Windows Media Center. I started the installation of Windows 10 and it ran for an hour "getting ready". After making sure I was ready a window appeared that said Media Center would be uninstalled
 if I confirmed. There was&nbsp;"Confirm" button displayed. I clicked it. Nothing happened. I clicked again (crazy is doing the same thing and expecting a different result). Nothing happened. I clicked the back button on the bottom of the page and was asked if I
 wanted to cancel the install. At this point I figured I could uninstall Media Center and restart the installation process. I went to Programs and Features - Windows Features and clicked off the install of Media Center. I was asked to restart and I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the restart I tried Media Center and it is STILL installed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get past the screen that wants confirmation that Media Center should be uninstalled?</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I have gone from being an advocate for Windows 10 to disappointment and frustration. How hard would it be to check for Media Center early in the install process?&nbsp;If it is incompatible with Windows 10 why am I asked to confirm its uninstallation?
 If I have spent an hour waiting for Windows 10 installation, I think that indicates a fair amount of commitment to completing the installation so why the "confirm" button that deep into the installation process? But I am less committed to Windows 10 than when
 I started the "installation". </p>
<p>
</p><p>I may be staying with Windows 8.1 until my hardware dies (and its not old).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I put a stake into Media Center and get Windows 10 installed?</p>
<p>

<p>I hope the answer to how to get rid of Media Center is not to re-install windows 8.1 and all of its hundreds of patches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to upgrade this machine and not have re-install windows 8.1 and all of my applications. It is truly a slog to re-install 8.1 and then all of its hundreds of patches. Then on top of that painful process I would have to install all of my apps and all
 of their patches.&nbsp;So lets hope someone has thought through process of upgrading to Windows 10&nbsp;with Media Center. Because if the choice is re-install&nbsp;before upgrading or staying on Windows 8.1, my choice will be to stay on 8.1 until hell freezes.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have the same, problem but I just decided to click and just wait and wait, no double clicking,&nbsp; after a while the ready to install came up. I guess that someone forgot to button.disable also its&nbsp;plausible that every time you press that button, it
 runs another tread of the same hanging, I would have liked to see a button.disable and even a progress bar for the task to remove media center or prepare it for 10's flavor if there is that, Guess the programmer were under pressure to get it done.&nbsp; I am&nbsp;about
 to hit install button now. :) So Excited.</p>

<h2>            How to Hide Comments by Default</h2>
                    
<p>Hi-</p>
<p>I have a word 2007 document in which i have put up comments so that people can review to those comments from discussion point of view.....the option for me to hide those comments is to click on show markup and then uncheck the comments box.</p>
<p>I want to make this box unchecked by default so that once people open the document they can have a clean document, incase they want to have details then they can go to show mark and enable comments to get more details about the different paragraphs.</p>
<p>Is there any solution for this?</p>

<p>No. The view settings for documents with markup, including comments, are determined by the settings on the computer where the documents are opened.</p>

                    Well we finally got a new build. Now to start putting it through its paces. One of the first things I looked at was the "unreliability monitor". It is finally once again showing event detail below the graph. Thank you for fixing it. I will be checking
 out the issues I had with "memory leakage" that I had in build 10130.

            <p>Mine installed on my Toshiba P750, core i7, 8 Gb's DDR3, with only one minor issue, a Toshiba driver would not install. The only thing is, for me, it took about 10 hours from the time I started downloading the install files, until it completed the installation.
 Of course, there were some minor tweaks to my settings, but nothing I could not figure out on my own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, I have found no real issues...... yet.</p>

            It could be that originally the memery card was almost full. If it was the phone gallery is unable to process the images, etc. Good idea is to not fill the card to the limit, leave some space. Hope this helps

<h2>            Group Messaging Lumia 950</h2>
                    Group messaging was working fine, then stopped a couple of weeks ago, can't send or receive group messages. &nbsp;I downloaded the app "Group Me" around the same time but doubt that would change anything. &nbsp;I have uninstalled Group Me hoping that would be the
 culprit but still nothing. &nbsp;Thoughts?

            Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/6984728a-19ba-45a0-8b30-4c9cc4c759c5" title="REXmedia">

IIJOHN22II</a>. Are you still experiencing this issue? If yes, have you&nbsp;tried creating another group &amp; deleting the previous one&nbsp;to see if it still the same? How about removing the SIM card &amp; then put it back into the phone?&nbsp;You may also consider rebooting
 it by pressing &amp; holding the volume down &amp; the power keys together. After doing so, you may try checking if there's an update available for your phone's system apps. Just go to Store&gt;Menu&gt;Downloads and updates&gt;check for updates. We'll wait for your reply.

            <p>Group are MMS messages. I have had this exact problem, it occurs when you switch between the native messaging app and Skype Preview. Anyway, here is how to fix it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://forums.att.com/t5/Windows-Phone/INTERNET-APN-amp-MMS-APN-SETTINGS/td-p/4167855</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13391/lumia-problem-with-sending-or-receiving-multimedia-messages</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to settings--&gt; Network &amp; Wireless --&gt; Cellular &amp; Sim--&gt; Sim Settings </p>
<p>
</p><p>Scroll down to MMS APN</p>
<p>and tap the " + " button</p>
<p>Then enter in the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>APN: "phone"</p>
<p>IP Type "IPv4" - default is IPv4v6 and what is listed on ATT site which is WRONG</p>
<p>other settings leave blank</p>
<p>
</p><p>For MMS APN - again make sure ATT knows you have Windows Phone on your primary SIM, where you should have no MMS settings. If you have dual sim like me then need to these add MMS settings ONLY to second SIM:</p>
<p>APN: "Phone"</p>
<p>WAP Gateway (URL): "proxy.mobile.att.net"</p>
<p>WAP&nbsp;Gateway port:&nbsp;"80"</p>
<p>MMSC (URL): "<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://mmsc.mobile.att.net"</span></p>
<p>MMSC port:&nbsp;"80" (if you leave blank it will auto-populate as 80)</p>
<p>Maximum MMS size - just leave blank (not 600K)</p>
<p>IP type: "IPv4" - not IPv4v6</p>
<p>
</p><p>This fixed it for me!</p>
<p />

<p><span>This is more a question than anything else. I am long time user of windows mobile going back to the Lumia 900, Lumia 1520, and just bought a Lumia 950 XL on 8/30/2018. My problem is that the 950 XL is
 recognizing a&nbsp;single text blast of 16+ people non-group enabled from the device button&nbsp;as a restricted group message from the network. Att has&nbsp;such restriction of max 10 people per text. However, the Lumia 1520 that was replaced on 8/30/2018 did not have such
 restriction or better stated it did not recognized the network limitations and was able to send 50+ people in a single blast non-group enabled message. The new SIM card was deactivated today (9/2/2018)&nbsp;and the previous&nbsp;card&nbsp;used in the 1520 was "re-activated"
 by ATT today (9/2/2018)&nbsp;as an exception based on my complaint but to no difference - the limitation remains. Both cards were displaying a message as follow:&nbsp;the deactivated card&nbsp;today stated "a max 10 recipients&nbsp;group message is allowed by the network" the
 old "reactivated" displayed "Network allows&nbsp;a 1 person group message please remove one or more recipients." Note in both instances 10 people can be included in a single message without issues or phone "error messages" whether "group enabled via phone button
 or not."&nbsp;So here is the question:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Is the 950 XL limited to no more 10 people per single text independent of enabling or not the group message feature button in the text settings link?
</span></li></ul>
<p><span>I feel like a hawk caged &amp;&nbsp;restricted to fly as high as possible. I look forward to your response.</span></p>

<h2>            Highlighted Content web part showing duplicate content</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I am using the Highlighted Content web part to show the latest webinars we've posted. However, it is showing duplicate entries for every webinar:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa568a33-503f-4b19-86cd-67712db2e91f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa568a33-503f-4b19-86cd-67712db2e91f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the video list to which the webinars are uploaded, and they are only in there once. There are no other lists in this site yet as it is brand new, so it can't be pulling from other areas. I even made sure the recycle bin was empty. I've tried
 to delete the web part and recreate it, but it stills pulls duplicates. If it's important,&nbsp;I uploaded the videos all on the same day as&nbsp;I am migrating these from a 2010 site. Also I had to configure the Highlighted Content web part using the SPContentType
 managed property since when I tried to filter by video, no results were displayed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c40c110-54f7-46fe-b141-a6da90050d06?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c40c110-54f7-46fe-b141-a6da90050d06?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The videos are stored in a rich media asset library. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Lisa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is related to those later uploaded videos, I would suggest you try the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Make sure you have back up for all these videos. Download them as back up. </p>
<p>2. Remove one of the duplicate video. Wait for 24 hours to see if it will disappear from the web part.
</p>
<p>3. If yes, remove other duplicate videos (the 5 later upload videos). </p>
<p>4. After they all disappear from the highlighted content web part. Re-upload them to that library.
</p>
<p>5. Check the outcome. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't work, we may need to collect some trace logs to investigate the issue further.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<h2>            Facebook app</h2>
                    My Facebook app has disappeared from my Windows phone. I have tried to reinstall it, and it fails, saying "Attention required". When I tap the message, it does nothing. Others Windows phone in our company have no issues, just mine. I asked T-Mobile for
 assistance, and they said it is a Microsoft issues, and that maybe our company needs to switch from Microsoft phones to Android/Apple phones. If there is not a solution, then I guess we will be moving away from Microsoft. Any ideas?

</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query here in Microsoft Community. Usually when a device starts behaving oddly or an app can't be installed like for this scenario, we would recommend an easy remedy which is a soft reset. This is more like an extended reboot and
 can rectify the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>How to Soft Reset:</p>
<ul>
<li>You perform the soft reset by having your phone turned on.</li><li>Then press and hold the <strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong> </span>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />and
<span><strong>Power</strong> </span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f71780ab3-e8a1-45b0-a0d1-220bfbe6b989%2fhardware-icon-power-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />buttons until your phone vibrates and restarts.
</li></ul>
<p>Note that you should not touch the device screen during the process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears).</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are situations where soft reset is necessary:</p>
<ul>
<li>An app that usually starts won't start</li><li>The camera&nbsp;won't open</li><li>The device starts using too much battery</li><li>The device starts behaving oddly</li></ul>
<p>Let us know if this helped you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

            Please try these options one by one and check after each option. These options are independent and can be executed in any sequence. Do let me know if these don't work for you. If not, I will provide further troubleshooting steps to you to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />1. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />3. Login to Windows with a new user profile and see if problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />4. Sometimes, this is caused due to application not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.
<br />
<br />5. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky &amp; other Anti Viruses  etc. If you want to know if some program is conflicting -
<br />
<br />Boot your computer in Clean boot mode and then start the application. If it works successfully, then some program is conflicting with this.

<p><span>FYI: for this situation, you can consider Vista and Win7 to be essentially interchangeable with only minor differences between the user interface in the 2 versions.</span></p>
<p>In Windows 7, even when you are logged in as administrator, UAC no longer gives you “Full” administrator rights. To get all of the access you now also have “run as administrator”
</p>
<p>It appears there is an error where your userid is not being allowed to update the activation information in the registry.</p>
<p>The general process is :</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Close all of the office apps</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Start one of the Office apps using any one of the following “run as admin” techniques</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Activate office</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Close the app</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Start it normally, confirm the message has “gone away”</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If the message is gone, reboot the computer</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Start the office app again to confirm that the message really is gone for good (was saved in the registry)</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>What you need to do is "runas admin":</b></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Go to the start menu<span> </span>and find the program icon you want to start</p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;Shift&gt; &lt;Right Click&gt; on it</li><li>Select “Run as …”</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>If that doesn’t work try this: </b></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the start menu<span> </span>, right click on the shortcut for any Office app, select “RunAs Admin”<br />
If runas does not appear, right click and drag the shortcut to the desktop </p>
<ul>
<li>create a shortcut on the desktop. </li><li>Right click on the desktop shortcut,</li><li>&nbsp;runas admin should be there.</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Activate the application/office: </b>
</p>

</p><p><span>Users can add up to 10 distribution lists to their Skype for Business Contacts list. However, it’s not feasible to add more than 10 distribution lists. Here is an article for your reference:
