<h2>            Purchased Arcade Games Showing as Trial Versions</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was in the mood to play one of my arcade games but when I selected it it was only giving me the option to play the trial version. I've purchased this game, won a number of achievements (these are showing in my achievement list) and yet it was telling me
 I only had the trial version. I've tried switching off and on again but the problem is the same. &nbsp;The game is Peggle however I also noticed it with Bejeweled 2, Puzzle Quest etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not connected to internet on my xbox at the moment but as you can imagine this is rather disturbing. I've only got an internet dongle at the moment so don't really have the connection, bandwidth or usage allowance to go through and delete then download
 all my games again :(</p>
<p>Anyone know what the problem might be?</p>

<p>Hey UnholyTom1980! Do the games you're talking about show up in your download history when you view this page while you're signed into the account that originally purchased them?
<a href="https://live.xbox.com/en-US/Download/History" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
live.xbox.com/.../History</a>&nbsp;If so, try to add them to your download queue.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Also, I believe the steps listed in this article will be of use to you: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/purchase-xbox-live-content#abff1a346edb4e9fb550b286c7f0f04a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi UnholyTom1980,<br />
<br />
Has this console gone through a license transfer or was this content purchased on a different console than the one that you are playing on right now? If so, you will run into this problem because the console needs to authenticate the games that you own with
 your connection to XBOX Live. So if you are not connected to XBOX Live they will show up as "trial" games. The games would have to have been purchased on the same console that you are trying to play on using the same gamertag that purchased them.<br />
<br />
Is this is the case, then you now know why these are showing up as "trial" only games until you connect your XBOX 360 to the internet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Are you the one "in charge" of the WiFi?&nbsp; I ask because devices can be "kicked off" or blocked from the wifi by the person who administers or controls it.&nbsp; The block can be done by the MAC address so you wont get back on. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it isn't the above then have you tried telling the Xbox to forget the connection and set it back up from scratch?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you login to the router you can also clear the current table of devices and it will automatically refresh (wont hurt anything on the network already) and try to bring your console in again like its new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A full power down and up will fix a lot of things if you have not done that I do suggest it.&nbsp; It can be done from the menu of just hold the Xbox button for 8 seconds; if you want a full reset remove the power cord for 30 seconds prior to turning the console
 on again.</p>

            Do you use an external harddrive with USB 3.0? If you do. Plug it off abd try to connect. Xbox one has very bad problems with some kind of Usb 3.0 cable. If you read this Microsoft please fix this problem.&nbsp;

<h2>            Earn points to use for a Gift Card, automatically places into MS Account - &#91;Mod Removed &#8211; Profanity&#93;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>When I earned points, I would use my points for gift cards. I would then receive an email with the digital code. I could then use the code myself, or give the code to my son or granddaughter as a gift so they could use the dollar amount on their Accounts
 for their xbox games and such.&nbsp; Now, the gift card amounts are AUTOMATICALLY placed on my MS account.&nbsp; I wanted to give the amounts I chose as Christmas gifts.&nbsp; NOW I CAN'T! &nbsp; I saw another conversation on this same issue and a related issue of using the credits
 to give to a family member.&nbsp; NOW that option is gone. If you try to use the CREDITS to purchase a gift card in order to get a digital code to give as a gift, the option is grayed out with wording in RED FONT, that this option is not available.&nbsp; I saw the
<strong>[Mod Removed – Profanity]</strong> rationale about buying a burger with a burger, I was also told in a MS chat that it is like using a gift card to buy a gift card!&nbsp; ARE YOU KIDDING ME?&nbsp; A gift card is like CASH.&nbsp; You should be able to purchase ANYTHING
 and that include a gift card with a digital code so you CAN GIFT THE AMOUNTS! &nbsp;<br />

<p>We used to be able to do this?&nbsp; Why has this changed? Is MS trying to drive people to AMAZON to purchase gifts? Or driving people to GOOGLE to search instead of BING?&nbsp; I use BING for all my search and view. But I can change this in a heart beat !&nbsp; I use
 a computer for a living. I earn points by using BING and I should be able to use my reward points to give to someone in my family! &nbsp; I WANT THIS OPTION BACK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ANYONE KNOW how to use the CREDITS now automatically placed on our accounts to get a gift card or to assign the credits to a family member?</p>

<p>Hi Prof.RN,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us! We understand this is frustrating since you were trying to gift the codes for Christmas but did not have the option available. It is a feature that was implemented&nbsp;awhile back.&nbsp;Honestly, I have done the same thing where I thought
 I was able to gift the card but I realized I should have read the description first. I ended up with credit on my account that I was not going to use.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The description states: "<span>NEW! Microsoft Rewards has enabled direct deposit.
<span>Now when you redeem points for an Xbox Gift Card the value will be directly deposited into your Microsoft account. You’ll no longer receive a code in your inbox that you’ll have to take to Microsoft.com to apply yourself. We’ll only email you to confirm
 when the value is ready for you to spend."</span><span>&nbsp;Also, it is not possible to purchase Microsoft account currency with currency on the account. You would need to use a credit card.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I
 would suggest you start an idea thread over at&nbsp;<a href="https://xboxideas.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">User Voice</a>. We appreciate all feedback in order to improve our system and services.&nbsp;</span></span>For more information, please view:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10562/microsoft-account-gift-card-terms-and-conditions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

"Promotional Gift Card Rewards".</a></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>By the way, it is possible to share your reward points with family though and purchase the credit on their account instead. However, they need to be added to your Family and depending on their "Level" it will allow only a certain amount
 of points to be transferred within the month. If they are in your family already, go to<strong> Rewards &gt; Community &gt; Give points.
</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>I hope this helps</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Why is Cortana not available in Australia&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen multiple posts and recommendations in relation to&nbsp;Cortana not available in Australia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a chat with Microsoft tech (Ticket Number <span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">
1333035424</span>) and he advised e the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">Thank you confirming, just to provide some details I'm afraid&nbsp;as of the now Cortana is not yet available it Australia, if you want the is another way to make your Cortana work this is by changing your
 time to US time zone.</span></p>
<p>My answer to that response was;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>they should activate it in Australia or Completely remove it from user interface where not applicable</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have bought a new laptop and cortana came up in the front screen. I spent 2 hours to trouble shoot it myself then with the microsoft rep. I am sure many others would be facing the same issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>So I would like to ask that what is the point of providing a&nbsp;functionality&nbsp;to the user which is not active in that region. It should be disabled as soon as user select any other region where it is not applicable, unless it is resolved.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Please do advice and raise it as a defect.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Where did my computer find these api-ms-win-&#42; dlls in the last two weeks&#63;</h2>
                    <p>A system service (Rasman) is failing to start on my wife's computer because it can't load one or more communication dlls. Searching through rasman.dll I found the names of 21 api-ms-win-* dlls that are all in my System32 folder, and none of them in hers.
 I see 15 of them in the System32\downlevel folder on both of our computers, but I can't find 6 of them anywhere on her computer. My computer was refreshed two weeks ago, and updated with Windows Update. My computer has all 21 of those api-ms-win-* dlls that
 are named in rasman.dll, including the six that aren't anywhere on my wife's computer. Can anyone tell me where my computer could have found those dlls in the last two weeks? I downloaded the SDK for Windows 10 to see if it has those dlls, but before I installed
 it, I discovered that my computer already has a Windows Kits\10 folder in the Program Files (x86) folder, which has the same 15 api-ms-win-* dlls in its&nbsp;Tools\bin\i386 folder that are in our System32\downlevel folders, and does not have the same ones that
 are missing from my wife's computer. My computer has all of them in the System32 folder. Where could it have found them in the last two weeks? Where, in the last two weeks, could my computer have found these dlls?</p>

            Could those dlls have already been in the refreshed 8.1 system, and not part of any updates, and somehow been removed from my wife's computer? The only api-* dlls in my wife's System32 folder are api-ms-win-crt-* dlls. My System32 folder has all of those,
 plus dozens of other api-ms-win-* dlls besides those, including all the ones named in rasman.dll. There are six of them that are not anywhere on my wife's computer and not in the SDK for Windows 10, Windows 8.1 or Windows 8. My computer has all of them, after
 being having the system refreshed and updated two weeks ago. Where could it have found them?

            Sorry, false alarm. When I was looking at my wife's System32 folder, it wasn't showing the hidden files. All the dlls I've been looking for are there, but they're hidden.

            The rule is 1 product key per computer. To install any Windows on more than 1 computer, you need 2 copies. There are no discounts available.

                    <p>Original title: windows store won't open on windows 8.1 (prior solutions don't work)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Updated to Windows 8.1 Pro, the Windows Store does not work any more. I have tried the command prompt solution provided by Luis Cantero:
</p>
<div>(Please run the following in a Command Window to re-register the Store app:
<div>"powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $Env:SystemRoot\WinStore\AppxManifest.xml")</div>
<div>I tried the command set in both command prompt and run. I have also tried the command "sfc /sannow".</div>
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Funny thing is I can access the Windows Store using run and some command I saw online.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's what it says when I try to access the store:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"This app can't open.</div>
<div>There's a problem with the Windows Store. Refreshing your PC might help fix it."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But I don't want to go through installing every program I have after that.</div>

            Hi Marc, this is a known issue in the 1803 Update,
<br />
<br />It is the recovery drive, you are not meant to see it, it is not meant to have a drive letter, remove the drive letter and everything will return to normal:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />select volume F
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />remove letter=F
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and this issue will be resolved !       
        </p>

<p>First, kindly turn off the Caps Lock key.&nbsp; It is considered SHOUTING when used in an online forum and it makes your messages difficult to read.</p>
<p>Second, be sure you have the correct version of Java installed.&nbsp; Many Java software products like jInitiator are very picky about this, and will not run if the wrong version of Java is installed.</p>
<p>Finally, try uninstalling and reinstalling Java.</p>

<h2>            Touch screen keyboard does not appear on log on screen when I boot up windows</h2>
                    I am running windows 7 home premium 64 bit on a acer touch screen pc.<br />
<br />
When I boot up the pc for the first time the touch screen keyboard doesn't appear on the login screen and I have to use my wireless one. However, once the system goes into standby and I then wake it up, the touch keyboard option is now visible on the the login
 screen.<br />
<br />
Is there something that needs to be enabled for it to load up when windows loads for the first time?

<p>Hi Colsterr,<br />
<br />
A.&nbsp;Was it working fine earlier?<br />
B.&nbsp;Any recent changes made on your computer?<br />
<br />
Perform clean boot to check if any third party application is conflicting. Here are the steps.<br />
&nbsp;1. Click Start <br />
&nbsp;2. Type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
<br />
<br />
1. On the General tab, click Selective Startup. <br />
2. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box. <br />
3. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.
<br />
4. Click OK. <br />
5. When you are prompted, click Restart. <br />
6. After the computer starts, check if you are still getting the same error.</p>

            Hi, doing the selective start up has not resolved it.<br />
<br />
Just to be clear, it is the "toggle the visibility of touchscreen keyboard" button that doesn't seem to appear. The very first time I turned the computer on and set it up, the keyboard was there as it was the only form of user input available.
<br />
<br />
As described before, the toggle button appears once the system has come out of standby.

    <title>How to still get Freelancer &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelpelgrims  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to still get Freelancer &#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been a long fan of Starlancer, I never had the actual official version but i could play it at my friend's place.<br />
<br />
To make a long story short, after some years, other friends and a new PC, i find myself without the game completely.<br />
<br />
I have found out that the game is as good as nowhere to be found anymore, allthough remembering the communities of freelancer (that are still there up to this day)<br />
and that it still is one of the best freeroaming-spacesim action-shooter up till this day.<br />
<br />
Local game- / PC-shops don't have it (not even 2handed). </p>
<p>The site "good old games", programs like "steam" or "origin" all can't get some sort of agreement / certificate / license / or whatever to sell this game</p>
<p>And i recently found out that its not even enlisted in ur own Windows catalog of games, yet i have found old links<br />
to ur catalog regarding freelancer that identify it was once there.</p>
<p>May i ask then from you, what does it take to be able to buy/get the official game ? It was made by Digital Anvil wich was bought / taken over by Microsoft.</p>
<p>Is there a way via Microsoft or other ways to get my hands on the game ?<br />
<br />
Would really love to actually have it (i'm sure all the previous lines indicate the effort / research)</p>
<p>Hope i can get a positive answer / feedback</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

</p>
<p>1) shop.microsoft.com =&gt; at the microsft catalog, the game is nowhere to be found</p>
<p>2) Gamestop =&gt; "The page you are looking for has been eliminated" "Uh oh! you 404'd"</p>
<p>3) EB Games =&gt; "The page you are looking for has been eliminated" "Uh oh! you 404'd"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, aint that helpfull.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have heard from other forums that the only available option may be to resort to ebay / amazon, and just hope someone is selling a cd in good condition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but my question remains, has Microsoft rlly eliminated Freelancer in many ways via its own sites / resources ?</p>

WEll it's been almost two years since&nbsp; the guy posed the question.<br />
Think you fellas at MS can find it in your schedule to put an answer up?<br />
I only ask because i enjoy playing Freelancer, and was looking for more information.<br />
Good game , you guys at MS game studios &amp; Digital Anvil did a great job with the game, Then you abandoned the people that enjoyed playing it and shut down the Global Server. Guess a multi-billion dollar company just couldn't afford to keep a $129.00 a month
 server going, to much overhead?<br />
<br />
I challenge Microsoft to respond with something other than their standard reply ; "Please go to www.microsoft.com/wedontcare/changethread/mybossisouttolunch"

            Heya Kawffee, I had completely fergotten about this post, because i'm no longer surprised by inactivity or unresponsive costumer supports of ANY big company.
<div><br />
<div>I was lucky to find a british shop that was still selling Freelancer over ebay, so i purchased it and it was shipped over. I'm very happy with the game and the quality.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>And yes for big company's its way over the head to keep a server up on something that isn't (that) profitable. Whatever the costumers may say/think/complain. Its all about the money, nothing more, nothing less. Ugly truth, but still the truth.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is happening everywhere, with any big company regardless of the product.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>PS: Just take a look at "EA" that won "Golden Poo" twice in a row, and from personal experience, well **** deserved. (excuse my language)

            Thanks Michael,  Your time spent in responding is appreciated. You proved me both wrong and right. Enjoy the game . Beat it several times before changing the prices on goods in the files.  Star Citizen will be coming out in the fall this year . Looks to be a **** of a game, but i gotta update my processor and VG cards. It is funded by ordinary people not a giant corperation (so sayeth the devs )  Freelancer may die but i wasted many hours and braincells to it without regret. Stay Frosty!  Thanks again for taking the time to reply to a guy 1/2 **** flaming in a forum K.

            <p>I picked up Freelancer for $15 shipped at Bananzathon.com:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.bananzathon.com/mcrosftfreelncrpc.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>Order came in 3 days.&nbsp; This company sells them on eBay (seller id SWSOLUTIONS) as well, they had it priced higher presumably to cover eBay's exorbitant fees.&nbsp; Their feedback rating on eBay was nearly perfect at 99.9% positive and 15 years of selling experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although Microsoft doesn't operate the online servers anymore, there are dozens of dedicated and safe servers out there still. Just do a web search for active freelancer servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck!</p>

            <p>Keep an eye on the development of Star Citizen.&nbsp; It's made by Chris Roberts, the same guy that made Freelancer and the Wing Commander series.&nbsp; It's in early alpha now, you can play what they have finished if you pledge for the game.&nbsp; $45 will get you Star
 Citizen and alpha access.&nbsp; $60 will get you Star Citizen and Squadron 42, which will be a single player military campaign game similar to the Wing Commander series.&nbsp; You can pledge more money to game development if you wish and get additional ships to start
 with, but it's not necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will be able to get all the ships in game with in game currency.</p>
<p>S42 will hopefully be out by the end of this year, though no promises.&nbsp; Star Citizen is likely at least 2 years from release, but development is starting to speed up as the tools they created to build the game come online.&nbsp; The game currently has over $144
 Million in crowd funding, the largest crowd funding project ever, by far.&nbsp; It is the most ambitious game ever created, the things they have planned are staggering.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you decide to pick up the game, use STAR-632J-VJJW in the referral code.&nbsp; It will get you 5000 additional in game credits when the game goes live.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Found this thread because I was looking for my Freelancer disk to play it again and couldn't find it.&nbsp; I just moved, I know it's in a box around here somewhere...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope to see you in the 'verse</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 x86 to Windows 10 x64 Questions</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is currently running Windows 7 SP1 x86 on a Dell OEM licence. I have recently reserved my copy of Windows 10 via the upgrade advisor (yayy).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking to upgrade the RAM on my system to 8GB and therefore i would like to upgrade the system to Windows 10 x64 (via a custom install) when Windows 10 becomes available. My understanding is that when the W10 upgrade is available my existing copy of
 W7 will be upgraded using the current architecture (x86) and OEM licence. So my questions are...</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>After W10 is installed will W10 give me the option to create recovery media? (if so will the media allow to me to re-install using a x64 architecture?)</li><li>In terms of licencing If i perform a custom install of Window 10 x64 on my machine (after the automated W10 upgrade has been completed) will the new install W10 (on the same computer, just a different architecture) activate using the OEM licence?&nbsp;</li><li>Will Microsoft be releasing an ISO to allow custom installs?&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Thanks for all your help guys :)</p>

            <p><strong>I want to switch from my currently installed architecture when migrating to Windows 10. Do I have that option with the free upgrade offer?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The free upgrade does not have the option to&nbsp;switch architectures, so the architecture will remain the same. If you want to switch architectures, you will have to download the Window 10&nbsp;.ISO file in the appropriate architecture (32 or 64 bit)&nbsp;and do a custom
 install.

            Hi Mabolghar 
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />Updating to the latest feature update 1809, should resolve this.
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

<br />All steps, including upgrading using ISO file and Media creation tool, are covered here:

<br />
<br />If you have any trouble with the above link, with these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<h2>            Dual Monitor issues running on laptops with Windows 10 Enterprise v. 1607 &#40;OS Buils 14393.1198&#41;</h2>
                    <p>We are experiencing multiple issues with laptop users that are using dual monitors through a docking station. However, there is nothing in common within the hardware.</p>
<p>1. We have users on HP and Dell laptops, with their respective docking stations</p>
<p>2. Most users have a 24" and a 19" monitor, all different manufacturers, as well as different display topographies: some have a DVI and Display port, some have 2 Display ports</p>
<p>3. Users are experiencing&nbsp; a flickering in 1 monitor, and once it starts, the only way to seem to stop it is to physically disconnect the video cable from the dock.</p>
<p>4. even with display settings set to high res (recommended by Windows for the monitor connected), font is blurry.</p>
<p>5. In some applications, (I.E., WebEx scheduling), the GUI comes up very condensed and font too small to read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            Hello Mike, <br />
<br />
Try updating them to the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/d4efb316-79f0-1aa1-9ef3-dcada78f3fa0/get-the-windows-10-creators-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 10 Creators Update</a>. <br />
<br />
Confirm if drivers are all up to date. When did you started getting this issue? Normally, blurry fonts/text could be be due to driver issue. It is best to manually download the latest driver from the hardware vendor’s website to make sure the one installed
 on your PC is all up to date, outdated or incompatible drivers could cause issue such as this one.
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, check <strong>Ferman Ver</strong>'s answer on this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-desktop/after-changing-custom-scaling-in-the-display/873e8ba6-2ec1-4694-9397-7667d2c5df98?tm=1491532320905">
thread</a> with the same issue. <br />
<br />
With regard to the flickering monitor, check all wired connections, make sure that the computer is properly docked. The alignment pins on the docking station should be aligned with the holes on the bottom of the computer. For further assistance, we recommend
 contacting the device manufacturer for possible BIOS update.<br />
<br />
Hope this information helps. <br />
<br />
Regards.

<p>Hi Jane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will look into the first 2 recommendations on Monday. As for the drivers, cabling, BIOS and properly being docked; at the time the rollout began, our SCCM administrator had downloaded everything available from the respective manufacturers. Everything was
 working as Windows 7. Once they were upgraded to Win10, these issues started occurring.</p>

<br />Try re-registering Sticky Notes app. Perform these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search.
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name Microsoft.MicrosoftStickyNotes | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose} 
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Sticky Notes app, it should work fine now.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

<h2>            Credit card issues..</h2>
                    
<p>Well, I stopped playing xbox live for a while, with a renewal subscription on my account. I never thought to deactivate it at the time, as I usually pick it back up now and then. During this break, my current credit card has expired disconnecting my xbox
 live account. I do not mind my gold account being expired at the moment, as stated, I'm not playing anything online lately - However I can not even connect to xbox live silver. Everytime I go to connect to xbox live, I get a big pop up screen telling me to
 update my credit card details or ****, so I can't even access the xbox live silver, making me unable to download demos, buy anything in the market place and keep in contact with any of my xbox-live friends, which is rather annoying. Any way to work around
 this without having to do some call to remove all of my details and such?</p>

<p>yep UPDATE your creditcard details</p>
<p>you are currently on suspension till you pay off the outstanding balance</p>
<p>however there is a chance after 45days after the suspension that they may or MAY not write it off</p>
<p>keep in mind you may never used the same card ever again if you try to do that
</p>
<p>the only way to receive your dlc or demos on the same account is to pay off the outstanding balance you promised to pay or you can forfeit usage of your account and make another account</p>
<p>(it is upto the customer to cancel service not the service)</p>

<p>Wait, I shouldn't have any debt? Doesn't the system pay for a month at the beginning, then re-renew once it runs out? That being said, it should have not recieved any money and thus not updated my account.. Meaning neither company or user should owe one
 another money/service. Reason I don't want to update my credit card details onto the console is because 1.) I don't want to go back onto paying by credit card, I'd rather have them deleted from the system due to the recent PSN hack. Secondly, I plan to go
 back onto redeeming vouchers.</p>

<p>you don't understand</p>
<p>when you aggree to monthly billing if you do not pay your bill like every service your service continues</p>
<p>it is UPTO you to cancel</p>
<p>when you purchase subscriptions you are told this membership will renew</p>
<p>you are contracted to continue service till you give notice of cancelation</p>
<p>the only way to go pay as you go is go PAY AS YOU GO &nbsp;with prepaid membership</p>
<p>however even with a subscription you can cancel at anytime before the membership renews but however you did not
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you can only remove a creditcard as long as its not on an active membership</p>
<p>however you are on an active membership and are suspended till you pay it off</p>
<p>don;t even bring psn into it any comments on that is offtopic and not allowed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i suggest you read the terms of use you signed</p>

<p><b><span>Hi there, SUPERDAN90.
</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>I just want to try and clear things up here. You may not have an outstanding balance against your account, however when you purchase a subscription with a credit/debit card
 the LIVE service needs to keep an active and up-to-date payment method assigned to that subscription. If the payment method expires or becomes invalid then the LIVE system detects this and suspends the account untill the issue is resolved.

 renewal off; once your Gold time expires you can visit xbox.com and remove your credit card information.

<p>Ok so i have been having the same problem as superdan90, but i actually am trying to put in a new payment method and it says that my new visa is "good" while my last one was "declined" and has me written off as suspended. I have waited for about 2 weeks

<p>Hey impereia, that sounds like the best course of action. Ignition, I recommend calling phone support as well to sort out this billing issue.
