<h2>            People without mobile phones or personal comuters to be able to receive phone call with security code when blocked from their email account.</h2>
                    <p>I understand what you are saying about privacy &amp; identity fraud. I know it is important for security due to bank fraud &amp; online scammers hiding their identity behind other people's email accounts, etc. *I have already sent off an escalation form to Microsoft
 to deal with this problem but, I have already done this many times in the past &amp;&nbsp;even when I get help to access my email account I still, all too&nbsp;frequently, get locked out of every single new email account I am forced to&nbsp;create. I&nbsp;can never get a resolution
 to my problem. I am still always being expected to meet the same exact terms &amp; conditions in the security test. I can not do this because it is too complicated &amp; the list of security questions is too vast &amp; complex!&nbsp;There needs to be another alternative solution
 for people who are in an emergency &amp; can not reasonably provide the&nbsp;required information as listed in the terms &amp; conditions. I have contacted Microsoft so many times &amp; spoken to too many people about this but, I never get a proper solution to this dilemma.
 I am tired &amp; exhausted from trying to contact the people in charge, who have the power to change this. I&nbsp;only ever get to contact &amp; speak to&nbsp;I.T. professionals, who help to guide me through the steps to opening my account again. I am trying to contact the
 people in charge of outlook/Hotmail/gmail/windows live, etc... who have the power&nbsp;&amp; authorization to change these conditions so it does not happen to me ever again in the future. This&nbsp;has cause me so much trouble &amp; now I&nbsp;have lost contact with many very important
 people throughout the world whom I rely on EMAIL to contact. I have been forever blocked from my original email account, with windows live, because their email numbers were all listed &amp; stored in my email account. I never needed to have an extra copy of their
 email numbers written down on paper for this eventuality.&nbsp;When I needed to contact someone all I needed to do was type the persons name into the search engine &amp; their precise&nbsp;email number would immediately appear. I never needed to remember all this in my
 head before but, now I am being expected to commit to memory all the subject matters &amp; passwords &amp; exact email numbers of all my email contacts. This is stupid!!! I am not the CIA or some kind of top secret government agency with the need for all this security.
 I just need a simple&nbsp;email account for me to send &amp; receive messages to people&nbsp;with a simple code to enter to prove my identity. We already have passwords for our email accounts. Why do we also need an additional password??? This is too much!! It is like those
 top secret government agencies, or federal banks, which require 2 people to turn their keys at the exact time in order to get access to the vault&nbsp;(like in the move 'Terminator 2' where 2 people must turn their keys at the same time) Can you see&nbsp;the point&nbsp;I
 am trying to make here?&nbsp;The trouble is that I am only given 2 options (have a mobile phone or internet service at home so I can receive a phone call with a code - or answer a long &amp; complicated series of questions which I would need to have written down on
 paper &amp; carry it on me at all times. The trouble with this is that I do not have a mobile phone or laptop of my own so I can be at home next to the computer to receive the code to unlock my account. It seems as though that is the only option available to me
 - to have a mobile phone&nbsp;or pc at home. This is not an option for me &amp; I need to find out if it is possible for Microsoft to amend these terms &amp; conditions on behalf of all those who do not own mobile phones or pc's. Is this at all possible or does Microsoft
 not have any inclination in doing this at all. Is Microsoft in league with mobile phone companies to make this a necessity in order to give people no choice &amp; try to force every person in the world, who wants to have an email account,&nbsp;to buy mobile phones?
 This is a serious question. Is there a contract between mobile phone companies &amp; internet providers where mobile phone companies are paying large amounts of money to internet providers to force people to buy mobile phones? Because that is the only option I
 am given when locked out of my account. The only other option for me is to&nbsp;answer a group of security questions which seem completely 'unreasonable&nbsp;&amp; unrealistic'. They&nbsp;expect me to know&nbsp;by memory (a)&nbsp;the email accounts of at least 4 friends, (b) The 'subject
 matter' at the top of at&nbsp;least 4 recent emails - I never enter subject matters in my emails. I just send an email &amp; that's all. (c)&nbsp;to provide several different passwords I have used on the email account in the past... &amp; many other questions which seem completely
 unreasonable &amp; unrealistic. They expect me to remember all this in my head. Sometimes I have written down peoples emails on paper when I meet them but, mostly I just rely on it being stored in my email account. When I send emails, I just enter the persons
 name &amp; their exact&nbsp;email account appears. Sometimes, when I am away from home or travelling, I do not have all this information with me &amp; written down in a book. What happens when I am in another country &amp; I lose my book, or I get robbed of my possessions,
 &amp; I do not have this information written down??? How am I expected to contact my family for help in an emergency if I have no money for a phone call &amp; I lose my book of email contacts??? How am I expected to be able to prove my identity in an emergency under
 these unreasonably strict conditions??? I don't know any person in the world who, when sending emails, would keep a written diary including 'precisely-worded subject matters'. Again, I understand the need for security but, this is absurd!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine what would happen in the future if you are forced to use a mobile phone to be able to start your car, or open the door to your house, or pay for food, etc - what happens if you get your phone stolen &amp; there is no other option available to you to
 prove your identity other than with a mobile phone??? his is the way the world is heading! People are more increasingly&nbsp;using mobile phones to conduct their lives &amp; all their personal information is stored within these devices. What happens if there is a breakdown
 within society &amp; there is no electricity or phone service - how are you expected to pay for food or start your car or open&nbsp;the front door to your house???
</p>
<p>There needs to be another 'reasonable' alternative for these eventualities &amp;&nbsp;there needs to be consideration for all the people who do not own mobile phones or computers. Some people, like myself, can not afford to own a mobile phone or internet service
 of their own. I need to rely on public computers to send emails. </p>
<p>I generally only&nbsp;use facebook but, sometimes, when conducting business I need to send &amp; receive only&nbsp;emails. When contacting my Father I need my email. I can not use facebook for some of my emergency contacts. But, with facebook, when I am travelling the
 world &amp; I get blocked from my facebook account&nbsp;- all I need to do to prove my identity is to identify a small group of friends from their photographs. This is acceptable for me as it is not overly complicated. I do not need to answer a&nbsp;barrage of complicated
 security questions to access my facebook so why is it so different with my email account? Why can there not just be a simple pin number or secret code, which I can&nbsp;easily remember, in these situations.</p>
<p>Do you have the power to change this? If not, who do I contact &amp; how do I contact the people in charge of the email&nbsp;services&nbsp;in order to amend this dilemma. I am spending too much time &amp; energy&nbsp;contacting the wrong people who have no power or authorization
 to do anything about this. I need to have someone with authorization to listen to me &amp; consider my plight &amp; CHANGE the list of options available to me to prove my identity.&nbsp;How about a social security number? Wouldn't that be a simple &amp; secure way for people
 to prove their identity? It needs to be easy &amp; not so overly complicated to do this. This is very important because&nbsp;people rely on computers too much these days &amp; it needs to be possible for people to easily identify themselves without the need to meet&nbsp;these
 stringent conditions. This is causing me too much distress &amp; I&nbsp;have&nbsp;been very badly affected because of this. Can you help me to get something done about this?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Ankit 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />This is an issue we often see where personal copies you buy and try to install conflict with pre-bundled trials of Office 365. You need to remove the trial first, then install your copy.
<br />
<br />Use the fix it tool to completely uninstall Office:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninst...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 1 - Sign in to download Office
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sign in with the account you associated with this version of Office. This account can be a Microsoft account, or work or school account.
<br />
<br />Forgot your account details? See I forgot the account I use with Office.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-forgot-the-account-i-use-with-office-eba0b4a2-c0ae-472c-99f6-bc63ee2425a8?wt.mc_id=scl_installoffice_home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-forg...</a>
<br />
<br />On the Office home page, do the following depending on your version of Office.
<br />
<br />If you signed in with a Microsoft account, from the Office home page select Install Office &gt; Install. (Office 365 subscribers should select Install again).
<br />
<br />This begins the download of Office. Follow the prompts on your screen to complete the install.

    <title>Access 2010 input language keeps changing during form input - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mcfarljw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2010 input language keeps changing during form input</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate x64&nbsp;edition&nbsp;with Office Professional 2010. I have two input languages activated; English and Chinese. The default IME language is set to English. All of the Office 2010 language preferences are set to English. All location
 and administrative location settings are set to the United States.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For all of my computer's applications and even all the other office applications it stays with English unless I switch it. For some reason when I'm building forms in Access the input IME is English, but the moment I view the form to enter data all the
 fields change the input IME to Chinese. It's not related to Chinese, because I removed Chinese and added Spanish. It just force switches it to the other enabled IME language.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm really at a loss for how to troubleshoot this. Any thoughts?</div>
                </div>

<p>OneNote does not do anything with your email, unless you yourself have stored email in OneNote. If you have, OneNote will naturally save them, that's the program's purpose.</p>
<p>Maybe&nbsp; you can explain a bit more what exactly you mean?</p>

            <p><strong>Hi Jan Relof,</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The best way to exclude it in the installer sequence of MS Office Student 2007. BUT YOU must have the CD that you installed it with on your PC with its CD key and UN-install it all. Then re- install it back without One note.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To unistall any program, you first have to go to the Control Panel and look for 'Add or Remove&nbsp;Programs' In Windows XP or "Programs and Features" in Windows 7. and look for "Microsoft Office 2007 Student" and then uninstall it. You cannot reinstall
 it without the CD and its CD key. Also if you backed up the CD the way it shows on the CD itself, you can even run it and install it with the CD key. You have to type it back in with the dashes by hand to work as to be accepted. It is you option to install
 which segments you do and opt out not those you do not want. My opinion is that because it is producing all these "OneoneTableof contents.onenote2" it is a virius and should be avoided. I&nbsp;&nbsp; had this problem about the same time as your post and I reiterated
 this sediment.I rather use the earlier version of MS Office 2000 Pro, which works even with Windows 98 to 7. but I do not have to rerun it from the CD because IT also can be executed and repaired where it is stored from off the hard disk. I think it is always
 wise to keep these installer programs in a safe place on your hard drives somewhere just for this reason.</strong></p>

<h3> wyndham  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to I get Word 2013 to detect Mr. and Mrs. etc&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It used to be the case that Word would detect the salutations of Mr, Mrs (etc) which had a period on UK English documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This no longer happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a switch that needs setting or something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those unfamiliar&nbsp;with this, in UK English, the use of the&nbsp;period after an abbreviated&nbsp;salutation is deprecated. So in UK English, we refer to (<span>eg</span>) Prof Brown,&nbsp;Mrs
 Bassington, Dr McCoy, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked that there is nothing in CUSTOM.DIC that could cause&nbsp;this, at least as far as I can see. Is there anything else I should do?</p>

Hello,<br />
<br />
I made this purchase requisition form that gives the user the account number, once he/she chooses the account name from the drop-down list provided. The formula for the account and cells used are shown above. Now this is where I'm stumped. Since there are different
 department codes, I decided to amend the file by adding a cell where the user would manually type the department number, and it would show up in the results. (Ex: 200.<span style="font-weight: bold">655</span>.740300.000.201, where 655 would be default and
 it would change to whatever they input). Once I did that and changed the formula to look up that info, the result gives me #N/A when the account cell is blank. Before I did this, I had no problem with #N/A, but now it won't go away. I've tried ISNA, ISERR,
 ISERROR, ISBLANK, and I still get #N/A. The formula works fine, but it just bugs me that I'm getting #N/A.
<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to fix this? Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm open to suggestions too, if there's a better way to do this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Miguel Martinez<br />

<h2>            Microsoft, please add more color theme options to Office 2013, specifically Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p>The only color option for Outlook 2013 is grey or light grey. This is a far cry from the options Outlook 2010 included.
</p>
<p>For folks with reduced vision or vision problems, grey or light grey doesn't give them enough contrast to differentiate one section from another.
</p>
<p>Internet forums all complain heavily about the limited color options in Outlook 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Universities &amp; schools alike will not&nbsp;upgrade to Office 2013 for this exact reason.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft,&nbsp;it would be prudent to take these observations seriously since Office is a big part of your&nbsp;revenue.

<p>Adding additional colors seems like a no brainer to me, but please think about all those loyal users over the years &amp; add some other color themes to Outlook 2013.

    <title>Rules for Outgoing Exchange Messages - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jason vanpatten  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rules for Outgoing Exchange Messages</h2>
                    <p>Hey folks -</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently upgraded my Office 2011 --&gt; Office 2016 on my work laptop. &nbsp;I have an
<strong>Exchange</strong> (not Outgoing!) rule set up such that if the "From:" is my Exchange account, it moves the message to a different folder on one of my IMAP accounts. &nbsp;For archiving purposes. &nbsp;With 2011, this works perfectly. &nbsp;I send a message from my
 Exchange account and it gets sent appropriately, with the resulting message also stored in the IMAP folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook 2016 isn't processing the rule the same way. &nbsp;In fact: it's not processing the rule at all. &nbsp;Here are all of the things I've tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exchange Rules</p>
<ol>
<li>"From" &nbsp;"is me", move message to IMAP folder</li><li>"From" "is" <em>my_work_email_address</em>, move message to IMAP folder</li><li>"From" "is"&nbsp;<em>my_work_email_address </em>and "Account" "is" <em>my_work_account</em>, move message to IMAP folder</li></ol>
<p>No bueno.<br />
<br />
I tried similar rules in "Outgoing", but because this is an Exchange account, "Outgoing" rules won't work. &nbsp;Sure enough: they don't.<br />
</p>
<p>I'm missing something. &nbsp;Any ideas or guidance?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Obviously some spammer has your name on one or more lists and you're receiving the blast. To the messages appear in the Inbox or the Junk Email folder. If the latter, just ignore them or empty the folder. Eventually it will stop or lessen.

<p>When using AAD Sync/DirSync you must edit the group membership in the AD. </p>
<p>If you create a snap-in for them to the AD -Group &nbsp;the owner should then be able to edit it. The management of AD groups from Outlook has long since been removed . When it did work you could only add a cloud user because if you added an AD user on the next

</span>When no settings on my printer worked, I called my printer manufacturer. Tech support said</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"the option to [print last page first] does not exist for my printer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since you cannot do this from the printer, you will need to make <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the change within each software program you use."<span>&nbsp; </span>

<p>Older versions of Word and my old printer each always offered that option, but I cannot find it on

            In Word 2010, go to File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced, scroll down to the Print section, and check "Print pages in reverse order".<br />
<br />
I don't have Outlook 2010 on this computer, but I don't see any option like that in Outlook 2007. I also didn't see that option in Internet Explorer 9.<br />

If you get one of the (usually free) utilities that have a print-to-PDF driver (for example,
<a href="http://www.bullzip.com/products/pdf/info.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">BullZip</a> or <a href="http://www.primopdf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
PrimoPDF</a>), you can print anything to a PDF file, and then Adobe Reader can print it in reverse order (in Reader X, in the Print dialog, click the "More Options" link under "Pages to Print" and check the Reverse Pages box).<br />

<h2>            Windows device Recovery tool proxy error.</h2>
                    <p>Hi Friends,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for all those folks who have this error, this is how i found a solution if you can call it so&nbsp;</p>
<p>(I AM RUNNING WINDOWS 10)</p>
<p>1. First go to Control Panel &gt; System &amp; Security &gt; Allow an app through windows firewall. Click on &nbsp;Change the settings, then click &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;allow another app and add the WDRT app. Also make sure you are using a private network. You can always check that in
 your &nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; internet settings.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;If you are using an antivirus do the same , most of them will let you add it through settings in each of those service providers.</p>
<p>3. Now go on settings on Internet explorer and under settings open proxy settings and untick all proxy options. Do the same if &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; you are using chrome or firefox.</p>
<p>4. Resart your computer. Open WDRT and in most cases you should not come across the error. If you do then keep clicking try &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; again and eventually it should download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its more or less trial and error thing, for majority it works for some.....hmmm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>

    <title>HTC Windows 8x phone cant connect to microsoft account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            HTC Windows 8x phone cant connect to microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a windows 8x htc phone. I've had this phone about a year. When hotmail vanished i was forced to create a live account, but my microsoft account was through hotmail, so my phone would not let me sign in. I have factory reset my phone to create a new
 microsoft account and now i get a "can't connect" message when i'm trying to log in. I have tried the manual date and time trick as well as several more factory resets to no avail. On my computer i can sign in to my microsoft account with no issues confirming
 i am using the correct email and password. The connection over wifi and data are both stable as well. Any advice on how to alleviate this issue would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the info. May we also know the current OS of the phone? In the meantime, try re-flashing the phone's SW using the Windows Device Recovery Tool:

<p><span><strong>Security Certificate Expiration on HTC 8X (PM23300)</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>On Monday, October 19, 2015, a security certificate on the Microsoft authentication servers was updated. This certificate change causes customers using AT&amp;T HTC 8X devices to be unable to log into and use
 a variety of Microsoft services.&nbsp;This severely impacts the device experience.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>How does that affect you?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
The HTC 8X device uses a security certificate named SHA-1 (pronounced “Shaw One”) to authenticate you on Microsoft services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Xbox, Windows Store, etc.
</li><li>
This security certificate has known vulnerabilities and is being replaced across the industry.
</li><li>
<strong>Microsoft</strong> began replacing this certificate in their authentication servers on Monday, October 19, 2015.
</li><li>
After this certificate is replaced, the HTC 8X device can no longer use <strong>Microsoft
</strong>services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Xbox, Skype, etc. </li><li>
Because of the age of the device operating system, the only way to change the HTC8X security certificate is to change the device firmware using the
<strong>Microsoft</strong> Device Recovery Tool.
<ul>
<li>
It cannot be changed by an Over the Air (OTA) update.</li></ul>
</li><li>
This process should take about <strong>45 minutes</strong> to complete.</li></ul>
<p><strong><span>AT&amp;T HTC 8X devices with Windows Phone 8.0 can’t use features that need a Microsoft Account
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Symptoms</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Starting on October 20, 2015, AT&amp;T HTC 8X devices running Windows Phone&nbsp;8.0 will not be able to authenticate to the Microsoft Account service due to a problem updating an SSL certificate.
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When using an app or feature that requires <strong>Microsoft </strong>account authentication, you may see some of the following errors such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
"We can't connect right now. Please wait a few moments and try again." </li><li>
"Can't connect. We're having a problem signing in. Make sure you have good reception. If you do, the problem may be on the other end. Wait a little while and try again."
</li><li>
The Windows Store will present the following message when attempting to download, purchase, or update apps:&nbsp; "<strong>Microsoft</strong> account service is unavailable at the moment try again later"</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Resolution</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Back up your files to a PC and use the Windows Device Recovery Tool (WDRT) to re-flash the device.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
Transfer any files (such as photos, videos, and downloaded music) you would like to keep to an alternate location.&nbsp; To do this, connect the device to a PC and use File Explorer to manually move the files from the phone to the PC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instructions for using File
 Explorer to transfer files can be found here: <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/How-to/wp8/apps/sync-documents-using-my-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</li><li>
Use the&nbsp;WDRT to re-flash your device with a replacement ROM image.&nbsp; You can find instructions and the download location for the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</li><li>
When the recovery tool is completed, your device will be re-flashed to the original factory state with an updated OS image.&nbsp; You’ll then go through the setup process.
</li><li>
If your device was set to back up to the cloud, you can sign in with the same Microsoft account you originally used, and you will see a “Restore” option during setup.&nbsp; This will restore many files and settings and help you download your previously acquired
 applications. </li><li>
Once setup is complete, you can transfer any files you copied to your PC back to the device.&nbsp;&nbsp; To do this, connect the device to a PC and use File Explorer to manually move the files from the PC to the phone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instructions for using File Explorer to transfer

<p><span>This is my problem…! All the solutions so far don't work so your stuck with a useless phone just like myself..!! I've been trying to resolve this since October..!!</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Security Certificate Expiration on HTC 8X (PM23300)</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>On Monday, October 19, 2015, a security certificate on the Microsoft authentication servers was updated. This certificate change causes customers using AT&amp;T HTC 8X devices to be unable to log into and use a variety of Microsoft services.&nbsp;This
 severely impacts the device experience.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>How does that affect you?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The HTC 8X device uses a security certificate named SHA-1 (pronounced “Shaw One”) to authenticate you on Microsoft services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Xbox, Windows Store, etc.
</li><li>This security certificate has known vulnerabilities and is being replaced across the industry.
</li><li><strong>Microsoft</strong> began replacing this certificate in their authentication servers on Monday, October 19, 2015.
</li><li>After this certificate is replaced, the HTC 8X device can no longer use <strong>
Microsoft </strong>services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Xbox, Skype, etc. </li><li>Because of the age of the device operating system, the only way to change the HTC8X security certificate is to change the device firmware using the
<strong>Microsoft</strong> Device Recovery Tool.
<ul>
<li>It cannot be changed by an Over the Air (OTA) update.</li></ul>
</li><li>This process should take about <strong>45 minutes</strong> to complete.</li></ul>
<p><strong><span>AT&amp;T HTC 8X devices with Windows Phone 8.0 can’t use features that need a Microsoft Account
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Symptoms</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Starting on October 20, 2015, AT&amp;T HTC 8X devices running Windows Phone&nbsp;8.0 will not be able to authenticate to the Microsoft Account service due to a problem updating an SSL certificate.
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When using an app or feature that requires <strong>Microsoft </strong>account authentication, you may see some of the following errors such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>"We can't connect right now. Please wait a few moments and try again." </li><li>"Can't connect. We're having a problem signing in. Make sure you have good reception. If you do, the problem may be on the other end. Wait a little while and try again."
</li><li>The Windows Store will present the following message when attempting to download, purchase, or update apps:&nbsp; "<strong>Microsoft</strong> account service is unavailable at the moment try again later"</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Resolution</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Back up your files to a PC and use the Windows Device Recovery Tool (WDRT) to re-flash the device.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Transfer any files (such as photos, videos, and downloaded music) you would like to keep to an alternate location.&nbsp; To do this, connect the device to a PC and use File Explorer to manually move the files from the phone to the PC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instructions for using

<h2>            Way to forward emails to a personal contact group that contains over 20 people</h2>
                    <p>We have a shared email account that receives industry notifications and news emails.&nbsp; The email is set to forward incoming mail to a specified list of users using a mailbox rule.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After we upgraded to Exchange Online, we're unable to perform this action because there is a limit to how many people can be in the forward rule.&nbsp; I'm sure this is a new security setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We cannot use a Global Distribution List because an individual outside of IT maintains the list of users and wants to add and remove them as needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system does not allow you to use a personal distribution list in the rule.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way for us to accomplish this without moving that mailbox back to our on premise Exchange Servers?</p>

<p>Hi Gigglelizard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the shared email account you mentioned is a user account, you can take the suggestions Germain Navas brought about. To create an Office 365 group, you can take a look at the following link. It's also convenient to add or remove member of an Office 365
 group.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/get-started-with-office-365-groups-in-outlook-b86c141b-39cf-49d9-a4db-124c3d786204" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/get-started-with-office-365-groups-in-outlook-b86c141b-39cf-49d9-a4db-124c3d786204</a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, since the transport rule/mail flow rule can't be applied to Office 365 group, you need to create the forward rule in OWA (<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web Access</a>). For your reference,&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-rules-in-outlook-web-app-to-automatically-forward-messages-to-another-account-1433e3a0-7fb0-4999-b536-50e05cb67fed#__toc377639464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-rules-in-outlook-web-app-to-automatically-forward-messages-to-another-account-1433e3a0-7fb0-4999-b536-50e05cb67fed#__toc377639464</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another front, if you don't change the member frequently, it's recommended to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-a-shared-mailbox-871a246d-3acd-4bba-948e-5de8be0544c9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
create a shared mailbox in your organization</a> and add them as member of the shared mailbox. The shared mailbox would automatically appear under their email accounts in Outlook desktop client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if there's any difficulty on this issue.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Marvin</p>

<h2>            Uninstalling Office for Mac 2011 after installing Office for Mac 2016</h2>
                    <p>After just installing Office for Mac 2016, I noticed at the bottom of the installation instructions that I should have removed Office for Mac 2011 first. I didn't, so both are now on my computer. How can I now remove Office for Mac 2011, which is deactivated,
 without affecting my Office for Mac 2016 install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the instructions to "Uninstall Office 2011 from a Mac"; however, I am hesitant to follow them as I am concerned that following some of its steps, e.g., "Remove preference and license files" will affect my 2016 install.</p>

    <title>Nokia E5 Lock Code - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wasim sabir  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia E5 Lock Code</h2>
                    <p>Hello;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently switched from Nokia E5 to another recent smartphone model. &nbsp;I had bought E5 in 2011 and had set up a lock code with option "Lock if SIM card changed" set. &nbsp;Now I noticed this as I wanted to give this old phone to my daughter with a different SIM
 card. &nbsp;Now I don't have any idea what I had set for the lock code 5 years ago and I have tried all combinations that had come in my mind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't get it flashed because its USB port is bad/broken. &nbsp;I also understand that Lock Code can't be removed in any other way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to know if it is possible if I get re-issue for a duplicate SIM for same number that I have been using in old Nokia E5 and will it accept a SIM duplicate of same number? &nbsp;For the new smartphone, I have already trimmed my original SIM to Micro
 SIM version and it can't be used now in old phone slot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be really appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            You can use your old SIM via an adapter. However, to remove that lock, you still need your personal Nokia Security Code. Therefore, even a duplicate SIM would not help. As solution, I am aware only of

flashing that phone via USB</a>. And because its USB port is broken, I am out of ideas. What about a used

<h2>            Quick Analysis Tool</h2>
                    <p>I am teaching an Excel class called "Data Analysis Simplified. &nbsp;I want to the students to use the elements of the "Quick Analysis Tool": Formatting, Charts, Totals, Tables, Sparklines to analyze and summarize large sets of data. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, I need samples of spreadsheets with a lot of data. &nbsp; I am going to use these spreadsheets to demonstrate the function of each element on the Quick Access Tool. &nbsp;Thank you so much.</p>
