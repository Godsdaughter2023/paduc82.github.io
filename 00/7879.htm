<h2>            Links from  Aol email will not open in Internet explorer new tab</h2>
                    <p>original title: IE9 and AOL mail -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have IE9 set to open new tab when following a link. When I open AOL mail, it opens a new tab. When I click on a link within a message, it opens a new tab, but it remains blank .&nbsp; Any ideas on how to populate the new tab?&nbsp; It's like the url in the link
 gets lost somewhere.</p>

            Hi Kevin-
<div>Thanks for the attempt at helping- Method 1 was great, but did not solve the issue.</div>
<div>Methods 2 and 3 aren't helpful because inserting links for trying to find a solution won't work when our problem is that WE CAN"T OPEN LINKS!!!</div>
<div>BTW- &nbsp;My problem is on a new out-of-the-box Windows 7 with IE9 preinstalled, and I haven't made any changes to the original configuration.</div>
<div>Google Chrome works fine opening links for everything.</div>

            <p><span>Hi <b>Charlie</b>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Were there any changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try these steps and check.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Internet Explorer in No Add-ons mode.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on <b>Start</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on <b>All Programs</b> and then on
<b>Accessories</b>.</span></p>
<p><b><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></b><span>Choose <b>System Tools</b> and then click on
<b>Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>How do browser add-ons affect my computer?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/How-do-browser-add-ons-affect-my-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/How-do-browser-add-ons-affect-my-computer</span></a></span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Check if the issue appears in no add-ons mode. If it does not appear, then uninstall all the toolbars installed for Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Uninstall the Toolbars.</span></b></p>
<p><strong><span>Uninstall or change a program</span> </strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program</span></a>
</span></p>
<p><span>Once all the toolbars are uninstalled, check the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, then perform Internet Explorer Reset and check.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong><span>Reset <span>Internet&nbsp;Explorer</span>&nbsp;9 settings</span> </strong>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Reset-Internet-Explorer-settings-in-Internet-Explorer-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Reset-Internet-Explorer-settings-in-Internet-Explorer-9</span></a>
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: <span>The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control
 settings. We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

    <title>Making a Skype to phone call - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brendamr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Making a Skype to phone call</h2>
                    <p>I have been having a problem with one of my skype contacts. It started out being occasional, but now it is all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This one contact, when I try to call her (Skype to phone), instead of getting her I get the Online Lottery System answering system. It only happens when I call her from my desktop at work or my laptop at home (Windows and Mac). I have no problems on my tablet.
 And, as I mentioned before, it doesn't happen all the time -- but most of the time now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried editing her contact. Same thing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do? Why is there this cross-over. And, btw, it's different countries!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor. I love helping other users in the Community by sharing my experience with Microsoft products.

<br />That is quite strange indeed. Have you tried, in both your pc and mac, to uninstall skype, restart the device and install Skype again?
<br />
<br />I wish you a great day/night :)!

    <title>New chapter start on an odd page number&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tap17  say:</h3>
<h2>            New chapter start on an odd page number&#63;</h2>
                    Most books have major sections begin on odd page numbers. Is there a way to make Word 2010 do this such that if material is added or removed the new chapter still starts on an odd page? I know about page and section breaks but if material is added such
 that an extra page is needed, the new section will move to an even page.

            Use an <i>Odd Page Section Break</i>. These are found in the Page Layout's Page Setup group. Use the Breaks drop-down to pick your option.
<div><br />
<div>Note that sections <i>can</i>&nbsp;have independent headers, footers and page numbering options. You might have to
<i>Link to Previous</i>&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;header/footer and set the page numbering to <i>Continue from previous section</i>.</div>

            Thank you! For some reason I never noticed that even though I've used section breaks many times.<br />
<br />
I do use headers that vary between sections, and they are different for odd and even pages.

            Possible problem with Odd Page Section Break: Apparently the blank page that is sometimes inserted is not displayed at all. This shifts my desired display of odd pages on the right (like an open book) to odd&nbsp; pages on the left. Very confusing! I prefer
 my screen to look like an open book, so I put in two Next Page section breaks, which maintain the display I want. I realize that if I add a large amount of&nbsp; material the page parity will change and require removing page breaks, but that's more acceptable than
 the wrong display.<br />

            Hi Shonda,
<br />That is a google login screen - it now comes up for google accounts instead of the standard Outlook password screen.  
<br />
<br />Are you getting that denied message when you click Allow? 
<br />
<br />Log into your gmail account in a browser - do you have an security alert emails? If so, you may need to click a link and say "it was me".  Also, you need to either use 2-factor authentication or use 'allow les secure apps'.

            <p>After trying all the suggestions offered by all I gave up and went on a two week trip without my laptop. Upon returning I booted it up and let it do an update cycle this past Friday (March 28). After that, everything is now fine: I can access the website
 and log on. So either one of the updates did it OR Medicare modified their website. I did nothing.</p>

<h2>            N95 8gb - Moisture Problem&#63;</h2>
                    Hi there people. I've had an N95 8gb phone since christmass last year. A week ago the screen suddenly went black and un responsive. Took it into my local vodafone shop and they sent it away with repairs.<br />
Got a call today to say to come into the shop because there is a problem..<br />
<br />
Went into the shop and aparently my phone has got moisture in the circuits, i mean.. what?! They have this little photo with an arrow showing a little 'blue' patch saying that it is moisture and that my phone is broke. Me having no insurance (£8 a month...)
 was p***ed off to the extreme. I mean this phone cost me around £500 so i have taken so much care of it and now i am being told i messed it up. Never jumped in a pool with it, never left it in the rain, never done ANYTHING to it. Not even dropped it!!<br />
<br />
So i decided to google if anyone else has this problem.. and to my suprise lots of people do. A lot of people are complaining about Nokia's moisture bulls**t. Also when i looked at my phone the backplate is nearly half off and a it just looks like its been
 abused to hell and back in the repair shop!<br />
<br />
As multiple people have this problem can i argue against it saying its nokia's fault?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Tom.

            The only way you can argue is to take legal action out against vodafone (because it's a vodafone supplied/branded phone).<br />
<br />
There is no excuse for the way they treated your phone, moisture damaged or otherwise. The phone was most likely sent to a nokia authorised care point/repair centre, not nokia themselves.<br />
<br />
Moisture damage is more common than people realise. I personally have damaged a phone when I got soaked and it was in my pocket. The phone didn't feel wet but the dampness of the fabric against it caused the phone to condensate inside.<br />
<br />
Leaving a phone in a steamy bathroom or kitchen is also a very common cause.<br />

            That blue patch is normally white and only turns blue on contact with water. It would be very difficult to explain how the patch turned blue without the phone getting wet.

<h2>            preview will expire on July 15, 2016</h2>
                    I am traveling internationally and have the insider preview. I am getting these messages that this will exp in 13 days or so. I have a slow internet and I buy my data so can I update with a key, probably not, but because the anniversary edition is coming
 out at the end of the month; I don't get the time difference between the middle of the month and the end.

            The problem is I, as a hardware tech, upgraded from a licensed win 8.1 when I purchased my Asus Zenbook laptop in Nov. So at the time I was able to help out with being a Beta tester. &nbsp;However, now I am in and out of the country I don't have time to troubleshoot
 like I did before. I know I can download the usb file to make a iso and go through all of the time that it would take to get my system back to where it was before. The problem I am having is the new insider ver will not download or it starts and hangs at 100
 percent. I just upgraded to Pro yesterday and thought that might fix my problem but all it does is opens the door to for Pro to work but I am still on the insider base system. I just became Pro insider. I will try to download my video driver and reinstall
 hopefully this will take away from the Black screen I get after I log in and instead of going to my desktop I wait for 4 minutes of black screen (by the way I can pull up task manager and it works and shows all of the programs

<h2>            Word 2010 mail merge special request. &#40;How to collect multiple entries with the same email address into one email&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a mail merge created by an earlier co-worker, with the purpose of sending out late/overdue notices to library patrons, using an excel file created by our catalog program as a source for recipients. &nbsp;The issue I need to fix is to edit the mail
 merge in a way that will combine any library items that apply to one email address, to all be sent in a single message. &nbsp; &nbsp;The current system sends multiple emails to the same person for each item they have overdue/lost. &nbsp;Here is a copy of the mail merge below,
 please suggest any edits that may be able to accomplish this (or any scripts/addons that would help).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Paul</p>

            <p>Easiest way is to use the Many to One facility on my Merge Tools Add-in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>You can download the MergeTools – 20140218.dotm Add-in that I created from the following page of my One Drive:
</span><span><br />
</span><a href="http://bit.ly/1hduSCB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>http://bit.ly/1hduSCB</span></span></a>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
The MergeTools – 20140218.dotm file needs to be saved in the Word Startup folder.
<span>&nbsp;</span>In Windows XP the default location for that folder is<br />
<br />
C:\Documents and Settings\[User Name]\Application Data\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP<br />
<br />
In Windows Vista and Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 it is<br />
<br />
C:\Users\[User Name]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP<br />
<br />
If you do not see the AppData folder: - <br />
<br />
In Windows 7, - In Windows Explorer, click on the Organize drop down and then on Folder and search options and in the Folder Options dialog, go to the View tab and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to
 uncheck the box of "Hide extensions&nbsp;for known file types".<br />
<br />
In Windows 8 and 8.1, in the File Explorer, click on Options on the View tab of the ribbon and then on the View tab in the dialog that appears and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to uncheck the box of
 "Hide extensions&nbsp;for known file types".<br />
<br />
When that has been done and Word is started\re-started, the tab shown below will be added to the Ribbon:<br />
</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bd47faec-6b3e-4375-9e4d-6ce2047c33ec" /></p>
<p><span><span>One thing to note is that the field names in the data source must contain only alphanumeric characters (No @,#,$,%,&amp;,(,), etc) and the field names must not start with a numeric character (0-9).</span></span><span>
<span><br />
You may also want to download:</span></span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>the Merging with Attachments document that is also on that page which explains how the system is used.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is not actually necessary to have separate attachments as the facility can be used to send just the documents created by the merge itself as attachments, either as the body of the message itself or in the form of Word files or .pdf files.<br />

                    I am working on a newsletter for a nonprofit organization and have it formatted entirely in Outlook mail.&nbsp; I would like to add the hyperlinks to the website and FB pages to this newsletter via icons.&nbsp; I have tried creating a Word document and adding a
 hyperlink to the icon, but when I copy and paste it to the email, only the icon picture transfers.&nbsp; It will not allow me to add the add the hyperlink to the icon in the email or in a signature, instead it creates a link beside it.

                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to set Read Permission on&nbsp; a mailbox ( shared mailbox ) in Office 365.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried fromPowershell command even then. Though i can give Reviewer permission using the Add-mailboxFolderPermission, but that would not solve the issue as I have to add the folders individually.</p>

<p>Hi UMaitin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your prompt update. Per my test, you need to grant the folder permissions in additional to the mailbox permission to get it working. Given the situation, you may have to add the folders
 individually. After that you can add a shared folder in OWA.</p>

<p>There should be a button when we sign into our account where we could easily check this.

<p>This is ridiculous that I have to go through all this to find out a very simple question.</p>
<p>I had my account for over 18 years and have a lot of data stored there which I don't want to loose for lack of space.</p>

<p>I grabbed a new outlook.com accout to see the look &amp; feel of it.&nbsp; I love it!!!</p>
<p>Now, I'm trying to figure out how move my custom domain registered at domains.live.com, or at least my account over to the outlook.com service.&nbsp; So far I'm coming up blank.</p>
<p>There is no option in my Account, or e-mail options to upgrade/move to outlook.com - and I've searched all over the options.</p>
<p>There's nothing in the Windows Live Admin Center (domains.live.com), about moving/upgrading to outlook.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still want to keep my custom domain name, but use the new outlook.com interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any guidance on this yet?</p>
<p>I'll keep looking too.</p>

            <p>Scott,</p>
<p>I found this tip on Reddit&nbsp;by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/OutlookOnReddit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
OutlookOnReddit</a> - &nbsp;"<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xgjrw/we_are_the_team_behind_the_new_outlookcom_service/c5m5kx9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">If you have cobranding, you need to turn it off at domains.live.com, but otherwise yes. Full support is coming
 soon."</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my case, I was able to get the "<strong>Upgrade to Outlook.com</strong>" option to appear in Hotmail by turning off "<strong>Co-branding</strong>" in Windows Live Admin Center as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to <a href="http://domains.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://domains.live.com</a> and select the domain you want to manage
</li><li>In the left navigation menu, select "<strong>Co-branding</strong>" </li><li>Click the "<strong>Unpublish from the web</strong>" button to turn off the co-branding feature</li></ol>
<p>Once the co-branding feature was successfully disabled, I was able to upgrade to the new Outlook interface:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to <a href="http://mail.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mail.live.com</a> with your custom domain email address
</li><li>From your inbox, click the "<strong>Options</strong>" menu in the top right corner and select "<strong>Upgrade to Outlook.com</strong>" from the drop-down list
</li><li>Follow the prompts to enable the new Outlook interface</li></ol>
<p>Further, once you have successfully upgraded your custom domain email account to the new Outlook interface, you can easily create a new
<strong>@outlook.com</strong> email alias for your existing custom domain email address:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.outlook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.outlook.com</a> with your custom domain email address
</li><li>From your inbox, click the options "<strong>cog</strong>" icon in the top right corner, and select "<strong>More mail settings</strong>" from the drop-down list
</li><li>Under the "<strong>Managing your account</strong>" heading on the "<strong>Options</strong>" page, click on "<strong>Create a Outlook alias</strong>"
</li><li>Follow the prompts to setup your new <strong>@outlook.com</strong> alias</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These solutions worked for me, and I hope they work for you too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Auto complete for Urdu</h2>
                    Hi, I'm composing a long Urdu document. I have a text file, it is a huge word list, contains Urdu words.
<br />
<br />
Now I want that Word loads the list and then during typing offers auto word complete feature. Is this possible? Like I type the initial letters/characters and Word offers suggestions for possible matches etc. (Sort of like the IntelliSense feature in MS Visual
 Studio etc.)<br />
<br />
Also tell me if this feature is in a specific version of Office only.<br />
<br />
How do I do it?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

I think you misunderstood my point. What I'm talking about is word completion. Let's say you have entered some text and now the next time you type some word from the already entered text, Word gives you option to complete that word based on the initial letters
 etc.<br />
<br />
LibreOffice Writer does this. I type few sentences, it saves new words into a list and then next time I'm typing the same word, it offers for auto completion.
<br />
<br />
Like I type this sentence "I need help regarding word completion in MS Word", so next time I start typing the letters "regar", it offers popup (a tooltip basically) in which the complete word "regarding" appears and if I want I can hit enter and complete. Is
 this somehow possible?<br />
<br />
But problem with it (LibreOffice) is that it only recognizes (saves) English words. So if I type some esoteric word "asfdsvcx" it won't save this because it is not an English word.<br />
<br />
I hope my point is clear now.<br />

<h2>            Watchdog virus - unable to access troubleshooting options.</h2>
                    <p>Ok so my other computer is a Samsung with windows 8, my dad was using it and he made a virus, i learned this virus is called the Watchdog virus, it's a hoax pop-up, "virus protection" scanner and stuff...anyways it doesn't allow you to access any icons,
 except the trash bin and every document, you can see everything( i even identified the virus) but i cannot delete or open anything, i STILL have internet access, i have now tried to restart windows for troubleshooting...THE ONLY THING I GET IS: continue to
 window, use a device, and shutdown. OK sooo i have all these websites on my other computer telling me how to get rid of this, but all of them require me to get on a browser, or start troubleshooting to get into safemode, sooo actually if someone knows either
 how to access safemode without going to troubleshoot( and with out trying to open anything) or if there is some way i can make a troubleshoot icon appear for my restart. ALSO i have tried to use msconfig on windows-run but it says i am not administrator, EVEN
 know i went through a video to make me an administrator, but i was already one!!! This is very frustrating, i believe i am getting juked because i see alot of people have a troubleshoot, but i do not....Thank you......&nbsp;

<p>The issue is with the way in which you have inserted the Chart bookmark in the mail merge main document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make sure that you insert it in the correct manner, place the selection in the cell into which the charts are to be inserted, and then on the Table Tools&gt;Layout tab of the ribbon, used the Select Cell facility to select the cell and then, with the cell
 selected in that manner, insert the Chart bookmark.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2011 Email Display and Printing Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drboneman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2011 Email Display and Printing Problems</h2>
                    Certain emails that I receive have display and/or printing issues. In some cases, the email displays properly, but when I attempt to print, the right side is cut off. In a few others, not all of the graphics will display, even after clicking Download Pictures
 - I still end up with some blue squares with question marks in them. And in one recent instance like this, I was also unable to print more than the first page of the email. Saved as a PDF, Preview indicated that it was 2 pages in length, but also would not
 display the second page. I questioned the sender about their HTML formatting, and they swear that the email in question is formatted correctly. FWIW, viewing this same email in GMail, I was able to print the entire email, but I saw no graphics in the places
 that Outlook indicated that there were.<br />
<br />
Certainly a solution to the margin issues mentioned first is for MS to add an option to change the page format (margins, orientation, etc.) and/or image size of messages. The undisplayed graphics and inability to print the second page seem to be more of a bug.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions are appreciated.<br />

            Select Print then Print to PDF. This should save the entire message as .pdf. Print the PDF.<br />
<br />
Next, drag the message to the Desktop then open Apple Mail and try printing from Mail. Does that work?<br />
<br />
If these fail, it sounds like a bug in Outlook. Be sure to let Microsoft know by sending them feedback (via the Send Feedback command in Outlook’s Help menu)<br />
<br />
The more reports they get the higher it gets on the list.<br />

            <div>Solution below is applied to email print out gets cut-off on right side. Even selecting "Scale to fit paper size" doesn't work.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Solution: Under "Page Setup...", create a custom paper size that is 9x11 (instead of using default 8.5x11). Then when print, under the drop down menu select "Paper Handling" and select "Scale to fit paper size". Then click "Print". The total width will
 be visible on an 8.5x11 paper.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Reason: Outlook masks out the excessive width on the right. If you export it as PDF and open it in Adobe Illustrator, the data is there and it's just hidden behind the mask. So by fooling Outlook to think it's 9" wide, then the entire width of email data
 will be printed on an 8.5x11 paper.</div>

            <p>I have this problem today (MAR 27, 2014) with latest Office v14.9.3 (not just Outlook) on MAC OS X 10.9.2 and v10.8.5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PRINT DIALOG of Word,Outlook, etc do NOT allow the setting of the ORIENTATION or SCALING. &nbsp;The MAC OS applications (Preview, Safari, Mail) ALL allow access to these settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using PRESETS (created LANDSCAPE-Duplex) under MAC OS app, then applied to Office Word or Outlook... Office print subsystem IGNORES orientation settings, does not update on PREVIEW in print dialog either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a PROBLEM. &nbsp; A customer printing an EMAIL in OUTLOOK, WORD, etc that is too wide for PORTRAIT, will lose data on printing or saving to PDF... and may not realize before they delete the source email or document. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>WORKAROUND:</p>
<p>Exit the PRINT DIALOG and access FILE_PAGE SETUP and change the scaling and orientation there. &nbsp; This seems to work and then PRINT DIALOG shows correct results and prints correctly. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER, this is not user friendly and you can NOT dynamically scale to user's requirements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SOLUTION as I recommended to Office for MAC Support...&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Integrate PAGE SETUP button on PRINT DIALOG to allow easier access. &nbsp; This is similar to Windows-based Office.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Allow the ORIENTATION and SCALING fields on the PRINT DIALOG screen. &nbsp; This is best option and same as MAC OS applications... consistent.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Fix the PRINTING PRESETS so that the work with Office applications. &nbsp; Currently, ORIENTATION is IGNORED by Office when printing as an example. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this solves your problem. &nbsp; In terms of defaults, your PAGE SETUP must be setup in Word normal dot template... changing to PORTRAIT mode should fix your original problem. &nbsp; Normally this is the default. &nbsp; I would look there.</p>

<h2>            Drafts on Teams Mac app</h2>
                    <p>I'm a relatively new user to Teams (using Mac app) and am running into a challenge with the draft message functionality. &nbsp;A lot of the chats I make in my role are one-offs so the individuals won't be in my recents or contacts. &nbsp;I open a new chat to them
 and am drafting a message to them but need to reference something from another individual or teams chat before sending the message. &nbsp;Once I click away from the draft the only way to get it back is to search for that person's name again. &nbsp;I appreciate it remembering
 what I've entered once I pull that chat back up but it's a pretty painstaking process having to search for them again. &nbsp;Is there a way to get draft messages to stay in my recents so I can quickly click back into them to finish my messages? &nbsp;Or a better way
 to accomplish this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hello Amanda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post in forum, regarding your description I understand your concern, but
<strong>it is not possible</strong>. In individual chat first we are typing draft message in particular individual chat before send, after that when we are searching that person's name in individual chat, we can see our draft message on that chat before send.
 But it cannot seen in recent or contact. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I understand your concern and dissatisfaction. It cannot meet your requirements, so we recommend you that please give a feedback to
