<p>
</p><p>So, I've been reading this entire thread and have a similar issue. I have scoured the ENTIRE web looking for a solution with no luck. The only difference is that I'm running a 13" Macbook PRO from mid-2009 with the last version of windows 7 on there. Initially
 when I bought this Macbook and installed bootcamp, it was a smooth install but this version of Windows is more robust and 64 bit as opposed to the 32 I initially installed AND it was an it was an earlier version of bootcamp that came with my OSX disc. This
 version I'm trying to install is 4.0.4033. Dont know if all those factors make a difference. I thought about piece-mealing it and installing each individual driver at a time until the disagreeable culprit causing the problem was exposed. Some folks told me
 that it's not possible but it seemed you folks have found a way? Where could the individual drivers be found?? Also, would it work if I tried an earlier version of bootcamp (perhaps the one that came in the initial OSX disc when I bought my Macbook PRO?),
 or is 4.0 THEE earliest version for the Macbook Pro? &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            BSOD _ hardware swaps so far no help.  Windows 8 64 bit.. then upgraded 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I get several types of BSOD.&nbsp; </p>
<p>While in windows 8 64bit I had a lot of crashes due to "windows driver" and the kernal.&nbsp; no memory problems and they seemed to be random acts.&nbsp; But I did see that windows update was trying to connect to the network and could not minutes or secods before
 (for a driver update.)&nbsp;&nbsp; But that was not ALWAYS the case.&nbsp; Sometimes it was DeviceSetup even that preceeded it.. sometimes not.&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Upload the zip containing the .DMP files to Onedrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply. Prefered sites: Onedrive, Mediafire, Dropbox, etc. Nothing with wait-timers.<br />
<br />
<strong>4 (optional):</strong> The type of .DMP files located in the Minidump folder are known as Small Memory Dumps. In %systemroot% there will be what is known as a Kernel-Dump (if your system is set to generate). It is labeled MEMORY.DMP. The difference
 between Small Memory Dumps and Kernel-Dumps in the simplest definition is a Kernel-Dump contains
<em><strong>much </strong></em>more information at the time of the crash, therefore allowing further debugging of your issue. If your upload speed permits it, and you aren't going against any strict bandwidth and/or usage caps, etc, the Kernel-Dump is the best
 choice. Do note that Kernel-Dumps are <em><strong>much larger </strong></em>in size due to containing much more info, which is why I mentioned upload speed, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/skydrive/add-photos-files-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Upload photos and files to Onedrive.</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete .DMP files upon use.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.

<p>
</p><p>As of today... I ran a script miner all night long to test the system.&nbsp; Just one simple card and I did not try to push all the resources... just simulated watching videos with a bit of network traffic.&nbsp; I ran some system monitors so that there were some
 "other" services running and interacting with windows' services.&nbsp; Other than an occasional drop in connection to my mining pool (I think it is down right now).&nbsp; The system is fine.&nbsp; It has NO minidump folder as of yet.&nbsp; It has not crashed.&nbsp; Even though this
 installation image I made in acronis back up (offline) was from the potential problem it seems to be stable.&nbsp; I had ccc.exe crash but that is the video card interface and it does this when&nbsp; you exit windows sometimes.&nbsp; That is really a small issue that has
 nothing to do with my previous crashes.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8.1 is running on a 9+ year old Seagate drive I bought with the computer that this new one replaced.&nbsp; I had shelved the drive a couple of years ago in protected and controlled environment.&nbsp; Runns great so far!&nbsp;&nbsp;Darn slow compared to ssd but the computer
 has yet to crash.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am going to keep testing this change and see what results I get.&nbsp; I hve installed NOD security suite and that is running fine now also.&nbsp; It never seemed to cause crashes in windows before.. nor was a contributor to the dump files above.&nbsp; The audio driver
 I installed is rock solid so far (from asus), I choose not to touch the LAN driver.&nbsp; I want to see if this one is okay or not.&nbsp; It is fast to call websites and loads quick so I don't see&nbsp; a need to change unless it starts crashing specifically after a windows
 update.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>I would like an explanation of your analysis of the files...I pry should learn some of this debugging... but it would help if I knew what all the windows service files did and how they helped each other etc...to understand what I am looking at.&nbsp; None of
 the dump files mentioned much about the&nbsp; harddrive specifically... but my suspicion was that the swap file was where the corruption was happening.&nbsp; There was still a swap file and the small driver files might have had too many errors to load correctly.&nbsp; who
 knows.</p>

            <p>We have two bug checks:</p>
<p>
<br />
<em>This indicates that the kernel has detected critical kernel code or data corruption.</em><br />
<br />
<em>There are generally two causes for this bug check:</em><br />
</p><ol>
<li>A driver has inadvertently, or deliberately, modified critical kernel code or data. Microsoft Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1) and later versions of Windows for x64-based computers do not allow the kernel to be patched except through authorized
 Microsoft-originated hot patches. For more information, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=50719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Patching Policy for x64-based Systems</a>. </li><li>A hardware corruption occurred. For example, the kernel code or data could have been stored in memory that failed.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">WORKER_INVALID (e4)</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>This indicates that memory that should not contain an executive worker item does contain such an item, or that a currently active worker item was queued.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is usually caused by a driver freeing memory which still contains an executive worker item.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Please enable Driver Verifier:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Driver Verifier:</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<strong>What is Driver Verifier?</strong><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8/8.1, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows
 kernel-mode components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</strong><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<strong>How to enable Driver Verifier:</strong><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
<strong>5.</strong> Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
<strong>6.</strong> Check EVERY box that is <strong>NOT </strong>provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
<strong>7.</strong> Click on Finish.<br />
<strong>8.</strong> Restart.<br />
<br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD. To expand on this a bit more for the interested, specifically what Driver Verifier actually does is it looks for any driver making illegal function calls. When and/if this happens, system corruption
 occurs if allowed to continue. When Driver Verifier is enabled, it is monitoring
<em><strong>all </strong></em>3rd party drivers (as we have it set that way) and when it catches a driver attempting to do this, it will quickly flag that driver as being a troublemaker, and bring down the system safely before any corruption can occur.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will detect it in violation almost straight away, and
 as stated above, that will cause / force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <strong>not</strong> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
If your OS became corrupt or you cannot boot into Windows after disabling verifier via Safe Mode:
<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
<br />
-- Note that Safe Mode for Windows 8 is a bit different, and you may need to try different methods:

5 Ways to Boot into Safe Mode in Windows 8 &amp; Windows 8.1</a><br />
<br />
<strong>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</strong><br />
<br />
I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier. I will usually say whether or not I'd like for you to keep it enabled any longer.<br />
<br />
<strong>My system BSOD'd with Driver Verifier enabled, where can I find the crash dumps?</strong><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />
<br />

            <p>All the info and suggestions above I have already read through and attempted some of them.. without any real feed back that pointed to an issue from any of the testing.&nbsp; It all seemed like random driver and "other" issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do believe at this point I have solved the problem with the hard-drive swap.&nbsp; the computer has both 8gb mem modules back in it now (16gb) and I am still running Windows 8.1 64bit from that same 9 year old hard-drive.</p>
<p>Right now I have a lot of perflib and perfnet errors, but i am thinking this is maybe the crappy amd driver for the legacy video card i am using</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to readyboost, esent, bitsperf....</p>
<p>
</p><p>event 1008:</p>
<p>The Open Procedure for service "BITS" in DLL "C:\Windows\System32\bitsperf.dll" failed. Performance data for this service will not be available. The first four bytes (DWORD) of the Data section contains the error code.</p>
<p>event 1023:</p>
<p>Windows cannot load the extensible counter DLL rdyboost. The first four bytes (DWORD) of the Data section contains the Windows error code.</p>
<p>event 1008:</p>
<p>The Open Procedure for service "WmiApRpl" in DLL "C:\WINDOWS\system32\wbem\wmiaprpl.dll" failed. Performance data for this service will not be available. The first four bytes (DWORD) of the Data section contains the error code.</p>
<p>event 2004:</p>
<p>Unable to open the Server service performance object. The first four bytes (DWORD) of the Data section contains the status code.</p>
<p>event 1008:</p>
<p>The Open Procedure for service "ESENT" in DLL "C:\WINDOWS\system32\esentprf.dll" failed. Performance data for this service will not be available. The first four bytes (DWORD) of the Data section contains the error code.</p>
<p>The Open Procedure for service "Lsa" in DLL "C:\Windows\System32\Secur32.dll" failed. Performance data for this service will not be available. The first four bytes (DWORD) of the Data section contains the error code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am thinking the above is due to the AMD driver for my video card.&nbsp; I had to force windows 8.1 to use the video driver.&nbsp; The computer does not BSOD or crash in any way that I can tell, but still these erroe about every 10 minutes..</p>

<h3> bobbee25  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 freezes when applying updates</h2>
                    <p>Every time the PC restarts it freezes during the update at 32%.</p>
<p>I have tried everything solution that I've found without any luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my PC is now on 24/7, but it still does an occasional restart so I have too spend an hour or 2 restoring the system file from a may 2nd backup.&nbsp; Then reset any recent programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone mentioned that updates <strong>can be prevented with the pro version, is this correct ?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>C<strong>an they be blocked with the firewall or services?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am willing to go without any future updates from Microsoft, better to have a PC that works even if it isn't up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Up until this problem I thought that Microsoft had produced a nice o/s, but at this point I am leaning toward going back to Windows 7.&nbsp;
<strong>Can updates be turned off with window 7 ?</strong></p>

            You do not need a serial if you have first upgraded AND activated win 10.&nbsp; Should you need/want to do a clean install from ISO you can simply skip the step where it asks for a serial/key and it will check with the activation servers to verify the install
 is genuine.

    <title>Disk Management Cannot Assign Drive Letter to OEM Partitions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thelegacy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disk Management Cannot Assign Drive Letter to OEM Partitions</h2>
                    Greetings.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've searched through this site and Google to find out about OEM partitions and their incompatability; in all situations, Microsoft technical specialists have been unable to pinpoint the cause.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, during my own struggle, I was able to both reproduce the problem, and found a workaround. In posting this, I hope I can help others with a similar situation, and perhaps for Microsoft to post a fix for Disk Management.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>The Problem</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>I have an old Lenovo laptop with a hard drive that I wanted to swap hard drives with, in the hopes of getting a larger capacity for it. However, it has three partitions; IBM_Preload [Healthy (Active, Primary Partition)], and IBM_Service [Healthy (OEM Partition)].
 However, whenever I right click on the drive, this happens:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><a href="http://img59.imageshack.us/img59/5391/diskmanagementbug1.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://img59.imageshack.us/img59/5391/diskmanagementbug1.png</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>(Note that the hard drive is missing a label, and there is nothing listed except "Help")</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>The Testing</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After some research, I discovered that this is an issue that has occurred a few times on this site. With an empty external hard drive to play with, I decided to try to access the drive somehow else. After cloning the OEM Partition to the empty external
 drive using a hard drive cloning program, I was able to copy the hard drive perfectly, including the&nbsp;modifiable&nbsp;OEM Partition format. This new copy also has the same flaw in that I couldn't right click the partition to change its parameters, as shown here:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><a href="http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/9229/diskmanagementbug2a.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/9229/diskmanagementbug2a.png</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>(The Active part was added later, though it made no difference on how it responds)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>The Solution</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Using a tool called <a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
TestDisk</a> that I came across <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/hard-drive-partition-has-disappeared/1e062634-1a78-4097-b833-6832819a45d9">
thanks to another thread here</a>, I did a scan, and using it, I found out that it is running a "Compaq Diagnostics" partition, or some variation of such. Using the tool, I changed it to FAT32. After this change, it revealed its name, and showed up as this:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><a href="http://img198.imageshack.us/img198/3649/diskmanagementbug3a.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://img198.imageshack.us/img198/3649/diskmanagementbug3a.png</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>(Note that although I clicked on the lower part of the screen this time, this bug happens whether I click at the top of the page, or the bottom)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>At this point (as shown), I had the drive letter changed to I, and I was able to access the drive. With the opportunity to test this without risking data, I wanted to share this troubleshooting with everyone, in the hopes that this gets fixed in the future,
 in case someone's drive ends up somehow switching to "OEM Partition", or they have a recovery drive they want to access. And Microsoft, please look into this as soon as possible, as I believe this affects all Windows operating systems since Windows XP!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For those who need to use TestDisk, it's very simple to use, but be absolutely certain you have the right drive selected; having the wrong drive selected may damage your data! I recommend leaving it to an IT Professional if you don't have a strong grasp
 on using DOS-styled IT tools such as TestDisk.</div>

            Thank you, however, why are the OEM Partitions&nbsp;modifiable&nbsp;in any way? This is separate from listed Boot petitions, like the screenshots show. Will this be fixed in a later release?

            Hi,<br />
just made the same "recovery" u did, actually due to time pressure my approach to this method was a bit confused... from an original NTFS 150 GB HD suddenly had no data access and the partition said it's a OEM FS. Tried to restore the HD using a FAT32 but I
 couldn't, cause the conversion NTFS -&gt; FAT is not possible.<br />
Finally had to fix this problem re-installing NTFS, but I had some troubles rebuilding the boot-sectors (suggested from test-disk form HD analysis). I dodn't know exactely how, but finally was able to fix the BS and write NTFS back into HD.<br />
<br />
Well... took me roughly 3 hrs but it worked.<br />
<br />
I heard NTFS can give some troubles cause the device is not readable from all systems. It's not the 1st time I get troubles with this HD, so guess NTFS is not the best format to chose for compatibility. With a 150GB FAT32 external HD never had troubles !!<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your input and looking forward to catch u with next debug !! :)<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

            A much simpler solution is to use the diskpart command line tool. A task similar to the one described by @Aronne75 took 5 minutes, including figuring out the commands that `diskpart` accepts. Just use `diskpart` in the run dialog (Win+R), type help, and
 figure it out!<br />

            Thanks, found it. Seems as though since upgrading to Win10 I have had Bluetooth errors everyday. Will need to check the forums for any current issues they are working on.

<h2>            Issues with the WiFi connection in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: WiFi problems with Windows 10</p>
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently facing a quite interesting issue with a laptop PC:</p>
<p>After upgrading the device to Windows 10, I have WiFi issues from time to time.</p>
<p>(Btw: I already tried various things like "disable/enable WiFi adapter", "update driver", "enter correct WPA2 passphrase", "reboot", "disable hybrid shutdown" and similar). I'm not a complete newbie. I have been working in software development tasks for
 20 years, so I guess that it's not really a very simple trick I am missing or so...</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now to my problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I'm visiting my neighbour and connect to their WiFi network, everything is working pretty fine at first. As soon as I disconnect from the network (either by putting the PC into standby, restarting the PC, activating airplane mode, or similar), I cannot
 reconnect to this network anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The network is still visible and it still seems as if I would be able to connect, but when entering the WPA 2 passphrase (yes, I enter it correctly), there's a message saying that a connection to this network is not possible. There's also another message
 saying: "Since your last connection, some information have changed." and "Enter network key."<br />
Please note that the wording might be slightly different, but I'm working with a German copy and I manually translated the messages...</p>
<p>
</p><p>- disable/enable WiFi adapter does not help</p>
<p>- sleep and wake-up does not help</p>
<p>- reboot does not help</p>
<p>- shutdown and restart does not help (with and without hybrid shutdown)</p>
<p>- most current driver is now installed, but no change</p>
<p>I did not yet restart the router, as it's my neighbour's one and this should definitely not be the solution...</p>
<p>When connecting to the same network after some days (or a week or so), the connection can be established without a problem - until I disable the connection once...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have an idea on what could go wrong here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some additional information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my networking environmnent, this issue does not occur:</p>
<p>I have:</p>
<p>- Router: AVM Fritz!Box 7270v3 + Fritz!Repeater</p>
<p>
</p><p>My neighbour has:</p>
<p>-Router: TP-Link TL-WR710N(EU) Ver:2.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think, there's a similar issue with this AP and another Windows 10 PC, but I am not sure...</p>
<p>
</p><p>WiFi-Adapter in my Notebook:</p>
<p>Intel(R) Centrino(R) Advanced-N 6230.<br />
<br />
OS: Windows 10 (10.0.10586)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be highly appreciated :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,<br />
Tom</p>

            <p>Hi Anup,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your quick answer.</p>
<p>Please find my answers below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Are you trying to connect the network being at neighbors place?</p>
<p>Yes, I'm physically located at the neighbor's house.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Are you getting any error message?</p>
<p>At first connection attempt, everything is working fine, but after one disconnect from the WiFi, I am not reconnected to the network, when trying to reconnect manually, I have to re-enter the security key (WPA2 passphrase). In addition to the default text,
 there's also some text in yellow color saying that some settings had been changed since my last login to the network, but there had been no changes to the network in that time. After entering the WPA2 passphrase, an error message is shown saying "Unable to
 connect to the network".</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Did you make any changes in the Wi-Fi settings prior to this issue?</p>
<p>No, I did not make any change in the Wi-Fi settings prior to this issue. (My neighbor didn't either...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try the options you suggested as soon as I am back to his house and then get back to you.</p>
<p>In the meantime, thanks a lot for your support!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your hint: "If you are facing issues with the neighbor’s network I suggest you to contact them and ask about their ISP&nbsp;provider and check if it helps."</p>
<p>Please note that this is not a network which is connected to the Internet. This is LAN only. There's no uplink or any connection to some ISP. It's a purely local network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Thomas</p>

<p>Its generally controlled using your graphics card software. On compatible ATI cards its generally called Overscan/Underscan in the Catalyst Control Centre software. On nVidia cards go to 'Adjust DeskTop size and Position' in the&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">nVidia</span>

<p>It's controlled by the graphics card drivers, some&nbsp;unfortunately&nbsp;don't offer such settings. &nbsp;If that is the case, you might check your TV for "overscan" settings, which is the name of the phenomenon you refer to.</p>

(î-pç spoof´ing) (n.) A technique used to gain unauthorized access to computers,<br />
whereby the intruder sends messages to a computer with an IP address indicating<br />
that the message is coming from a trusted host. To engage in IP spoofing, a<br />
hacker must first use a variety of techniques to find an IP address of a trusted<br />
host and then modify the packet headers so that it appears that the packets are<br />
coming from that host. Newer routers and firewall arrangements can offer<br />
protection against IP spoofing.<br />

<h2>            SFC &#47;scannow Found but could not fix some Corrupt files, How do i remove them &#47; find them&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, so i did the sfc /scannow in the Command Prompt for Windows Vista. <br />
<br />
I got the message saying:<br />
<br />
Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them<br />
Details are included in the CBS.Log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.Log. For example <br />
<br />
C:\Windows\system32&gt;findstr /c"[SR]" xwindirx\logs\cbs\cbs.log &gt;sfcdetails.txt<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok so i got no idea how to check this, or get rid of the files that couldnt get fixed, Apparent to the info given by the scan.<br />
<br />
SO yes. How do i check the log for this? step by step where do i go? Is there a way to rid of fix these corrupt files?<br />
<br />
I have a bad time on my internet, It loads slow, Games i play are showing me having a enormous latency / ping. Pages load 3x slower then usual. i have done lots of scans, in safe mode and in regular mode with different types of Antifvirus programs, All come
 up clean with nothing, So i was thinking maybe its something with the registry? <br />
<br />
Thanx in advance.

<p>Hello Vars,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Since&nbsp;you are still having problems after a SFC scan with corrupt files it couldn't fix, then&nbsp;you can try a
<strong>In-Place Upgrade</strong> which will do a repair of the operating system.&nbsp;You will need to have the DVD installation disc from the PC manufacturer.
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">BACK UP</span></strong> all of your data&nbsp;you want to save just incase something goes wrong!<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Note:</strong> After performing In-Place Upgrade, your personal data and installed programs will not be removed but&nbsp;you may need to run Windows Update to install all the available updates for your system to update these
 system files to the current version. This troubleshooting process is time consuming and may take several hours to complete.
</span></p>
<p><span>If your DVD installation disk is prior to Sp1, and you have SP1 installed on your computer, you will need to uninstall SP1 to complete the in-place upgrade and then reinstall the necessary windows updates.
 This applies if you have SP2 also.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you would like to perform the In-place Upgrade, let’s refer to the following steps.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Start the computer by using the current Operating System.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. Insert the Windows Vista DVD in the computer's DVD drive.
</span></p>
<p><span>3. Use one of the following procedures, as appropriate:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>• If Windows automatically detects the DVD, the
<strong>Install Now</strong> screen appears. Click <strong>Install Now</strong>. </span>
</p>
<p><span>• If Windows does not automatically detect the DVD, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click <strong>Start</strong>, click
<strong>Run</strong>, type <strong>Drive:\setup.exe</strong>, and then click <strong>
OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Note Drive is the drive letter of the computer's DVD drive.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click <strong>Install Now</strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. When you reach the "<strong>Which type of installation do you want</strong>?" screen, click
<strong>Upgrade</strong> to upgrade the current operating system to Windows Vista.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you. Let us know either way. Make it a great day!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

                    My Sony Vaio laptop mouse keeps dragging as if I'm clicking down and trying to highlight something. Or if the mouse is over certain spot it will just automatically click. What can I do to fix this? It just started doing this.

            <p>Hi Kaylyn<br />
</p>
<p><span>Because the Keyboard / Touchpad&nbsp;is integrated into the Laptop Case, just the vibration caused by typing can cause the touchpad to move the cursor or initiate a click, depending on the sensitivity settings.</span></p>
<p><span>You need to disable the touchpad when typing. Most modern laptops will provide an option or keyboard shortcut to accomplish this.</span></p>
<p><span>There are a variety of touchpads available that have different settings. If you have a Key that looks similar to the following, this is the key that disables the touchpad.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi196.photobucket.com%2falbums%2faa86%2frvmv%2fTouchpadLock.png" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the following keyboard shortcuts are used on various laptops.</p>
<p>Press and hold&nbsp;the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">F</span><span><strong>n</strong></span> key and one of the following keys,
</span></b>to disable/enable the Touchpad.</span></p>

<h2>            Apps Issue - Windows 8 Apps are &#34;Pending&#34; and Not Installing&#47;Downloading</h2>
                    I have bought a new Windows 8 laptop (Sony VAIO Touchscreen Ultrabook) and I am having a problem downloading apps from the Windows 8 app store. Whenever I try to download an app, it stays in the installing list as "Pending". The downloading progress never
 changes and the problem occurs for any app I try to download. Any suggestions on what I can do to fix this issue?

<h2>            Error while creating a database</h2>
                    <p>I am running an application that creates a database. The app requires that I run Server 2008R2 SP1 and SQL 2012 SP3 along with SMO and CLR. I have 2012 Express installed.</p>

    <title>Cannot install Windows 10 on SSD using AHCI - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slsmphys  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot install Windows 10 on SSD using AHCI</h2>
                    <p>I'm having some major problems with this and have tried all the possible solutions that I have found in various forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to install Windows 10 on a new SSD (Crucial BX100), but it is not detected by the Windows installer when the BIOS is set to AHCI. If I change the BIOS setting to IDE, the Windows 10 installer can see the SSD and install windows to it. Just to
 be clear, the BIOS detects the SSD when set to IDE and AHCI - It is only the Windows 10 installer that cannot detect it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an aside I decided to take a backward step and install Windows 7 and with the BIOS set to AHCI (not IDE), the Windows Installer can see the SSD and install Windows 7 without any issue. I then thought that I could run the Windows 10 upgrade and install
 it that way, but as soon as the PC restarts after Windows 10 installs - I get a blue screen telling me that the BOOT DISC IS INACCESSIBLE - On restart, the disc/boot-sector&nbsp;has been corrupted and requires reformatting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my web research, Windows 10 uses a different AHCI driver to Windows&nbsp;7 and this must clearly be a major culprit in the problem. Is there any way to install the Win 7 driver and override Win 10 driver installation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;need to install Windows 10 on this&nbsp;SSD and&nbsp;cannot leave the BIOS on IDE (because the SSD&nbsp;seems to be running slower than a conventional&nbsp;rotating disc drive), so switching to AHCI is a must.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As said above, I have tried many of the possible solutions available on the web such as:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Installing as IDE and using safe mode to switch to AHCI (doesn't work, because I still get the blue screen before safe mode boots up).</p>
<p>2. I've tried the registry hacks</p>
<p>3. I've tried upgrading from Windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's got to be a way, so if anybody has found a solution please let me know.</p>

            <p>Thank for your reply NC,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am afraid that the solutions you have suggested have not worked. However, they did help to provide more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the automatic repair tools which then provided the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot configuration data does not contain valid information for this operating system with code 0xc0000098</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking this up on google, it looks like a fairly common for Windows 7 &amp; 8 and could be fixed easily. I found a reference to the Windows cmd tool Bootrec.exe, which I tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>sometimes it would see the ssd and other times it wouldn't (I had to restart the PC several times in between).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I did manage to see the SSD, I tried the FixMbr and Fixboot switches and was led to believe there was some success - but the system still fails to boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received another error:</p>
<p>Boot configuration is missing or contains errors with code 0xc000000f</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm beginning to think that this problem will never be solved. I've installed Windows 10 on an SSD in an Acer laptop, but cannot install on a similar SSD on a HP Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Processor on my computer is an Intel J1800 (services on chip). Could this be the problem? I don't trust Intel chips or HP computers (and to be honest I am regretting purchasing it).</p>

            <p>It seems you've tried everything short of clearing all code on the SSD by running<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/52129-disk-clean-clean-all-diskpart-command.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Diskpart Clean Command</a> from Win7 disk Command
 Prompt.&nbsp; But that most common fix for Installation failures is not necessarily indicated when the disk cannot even be seen when correctly attempting install in AHCI mode.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case I'd contact Crucial Support since the SSD is new and you're entitled for a year to their Support or replacement.&nbsp; In numerous cases I've seen over the years new SSD's have proven to be bad and needed replacement.&nbsp; Having Crucial supervise the
 attempted install and needed testing with their preferred tools sets it up for smooth RMA.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to use the Diskpart tool, but it can't see the SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure its not the SSD's fault and is something to do with Windows 10 installation with SSD's for the following reasons:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Windows 10 installs with AHCI enable on a 1TB conventional rotating disc hard drive (which is too slow for my needs).</p>
<p>2. When I purchased the PC, it didn't come pre-installed with Windows, it was supplied with FreeDOS - I successfully installed FreeDOS on the SSD with AHCI enabled yesterday (no drive failure and booted several times for test).</p>
<p>3. Windows 7 installs and boots properly from the SSD with AHCI enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything seems to point to the Windows 10 AHCI driver and the way it communicates with the SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tried Crucial support yet, but I used their&nbsp;hardware scanner to identify an SSD which is compatible with my system before purchasing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your advice and I really hope that someone has experienced this before and knows a solution.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I studied the Manuals for that model from the HP Downloads page but see nothing helpful, nor are there any web search results for installation problems at all I can find.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any chance this is UEFI BIOS?&nbsp; The literature doesn't say.&nbsp; If so fully enable UEFI and boot the installation media as UEFI only, delete all partitions on the drive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
The boot level errors you grappled with earlier are all normally resolved by either deleting all partitions down to Unallocated Space, or wiping the hard drive to clear boot code and partition table.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming back to me on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a rule which was NEVER, EVER, BUY HP and I broke that rule and am now paying the price. They are truly awful machines and they just dump them out to market without having any basic support in place (as you have already discovered).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did I buy it? Because it was cheap and it looked attractive - which brings me onto another old saying "Buy Cheap, Pay Twice". This machine is only 6 weeks old and as soon as I know what my budget after Christmas is, I will be buying a "proper PC" and
 looking forward to bouncing this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, rant over and getting back to your advice. The computer has an American Megatrends BIOS (version released September this year) with UEFI support for some bootable devices. All other advice relating to this issue had told me to disable the UEFI support,
 but I thought I'd give it a go with UEFI support enabled and disabling the Legacy support. Unfortunately, this made no difference. The SSD was still picked up in the BIOS, but not in the Windows 10 installer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not been able to get in touch with HP yet (as I work during the week) and Crucial have not come back to me yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it looks like I have bought a dud and will now look at potential replacements (and most certainly not a HP and if I find a way to warn anybody off this PC in particular, I would).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your support, but I think this machines days are numbered and a replacement is just a couple of weeks away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a Merry Christmas!</p>
        </p>

            <p>But did you then boot the installation media as a UEFI device?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back pictures or report back the settings choices in BIOS setup for UEFI, EFI, CSM, Legacy BIOS, Secure Boot and BIOS Boot Priority order.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also is there a newer BIOS update on the HP Downloads webpage?&nbsp; Nachappa had asked about this early on, but I don't see the reply.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>These can all be critical.&nbsp; HP hardware is not normally that bad, it's the OS install that's worst in the industry due to bloatware.</p>

<h2>            I forgot my Xbox Live email, how can I get it back</h2>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; A few months ago, I purchased the Xbox One S. As time went by, I was able to buy a PC, so I sold my Xbox. I realized that Xbox and Windows 10 have a "play anywhere" feature where I can use games that I bought on Xbox, on my PC. I forgot my email,
 and I've been trying to recover it all day. Is there any way for me to get the email back? I know the account Gamertag, the account password, account purchase history, the payment options on file, all the answers to the security questions, basically everything
 besides the email.
