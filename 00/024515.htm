Please install SP-1 to Project 2010.&nbsp; The removal of font colors is one of the fixes listed in the downloadable Excel file at:<br />

<h2>            Publisher 2016 - Edit Wrap Point function not working</h2>
                    <p>The Edit Wrap point function in Publisher 365 (2016) is not working.&nbsp; In Publisher 2010, I can cut the corners off images after I overlap 2&nbsp; (or more) images to create a transition between the 2 images.&nbsp; I've done this by using Edit Wrap Points, holding
 down the Control Key to define a new point on an existing edge of the top image, then defining another point on an adjacent edge, then Control Click on the original corner point, between these new points then the corner point disappears along with the corner
 section of the upper image and I have a nice sloped corner on both images.&nbsp; In 2016, all this works the same - EXCEPT the corner doesn't disappear after Control clicking on the original corner point.&nbsp; The point disappears but the section of the upper picture
 I'm trying to cut off doesn't.&nbsp; This appears to have been An issue in Office 2013 , with a Hotfix issued, that didn’t work.&nbsp; Is there a&nbsp; fix for the 2016 bug yet?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks David</p>
<p>I'd found the link before which is why I understood that it didn't work in 2013 version either.</p>
<p>Best that I can work out is that the Edit Wrap Points icon and function is a waste of time because you can move/delete/insert points around the image as before but these changes have no effect of the image.</p>
<p>I've added a shape, filled it with the second image and can get something like what I (and lots of others apparently) want, except that then the image inside the shape cannot be cropped, nor can the outline shape of the shape be altered, even though the
 Wrap Points can be moved/deleted or inserted, with no actual effect on the shape.&nbsp; A triangle shape is always a triangle shape. Also the image cannot be moved in the shape so thats not a work around.</p>
<p>Any suggestions from anyone on a workaround would be much appreciated,&nbsp; I used this function a lot in 2010 and earlier versions.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Given it apparently hasn't been available in Publisher for some time, suggestions of other programs that use it would also be welcome</p>

<p>Solved it!!! in a very retro way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the back of my software drawer, I dug up a copy of Office Pro 2003 that I had bought with what turned out to be a very slow laptop back about 2003.&nbsp; It went to computer heaven after only a couple of years but the SW package, complete with instruction
 booklet, went in the drawer.</p>
<p>So I started the install from the 2003 disk, selected&nbsp; Custom Install and only loaded Publisher.&nbsp; It ran under Win 10, asked to be validated, validation went well so I now have Publisher 2003 on my desktop.&nbsp; The Icon for Publisher 2016 disappeared but the
 program is still on the computer and will run.&nbsp; It's interesting getting used to those old xp style icons on the tool bars, but they all work.</p>
<p>So far everything about the app that I use is working under Win 10 fine.&nbsp; And a bonus, the Snap function works just like it used to, so thats two functions that worked then but Microsoft chose to make unwork in current versions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infact, I cant find a single function in 2016 version that I have used&nbsp; not being available in 2003.&nbsp; To me it seems that the only changes between 2003 and 2016 versions have been the icons in the toolbars and the ribbon. And of course, the 2 functions that
 work well in the 2003 version but dont in 2016.&nbsp; Now thats not progress at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is anyone from Microsoft listening to their customers?&nbsp; Who knows?</p>

<p>Thanks for posting back. FWIW I also run Publisher 2003 along with other versions of Publisher and prefer the traditional menu to the ribbon that was introduced with Pub 2010. I think there are numerous advantages to running the older versions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though Office 2003 is not 'supported' by MSFT, it will run on Win10. In fact you can run Publisher 2000 on Win10.
</p>
<div><span>Reference: A look at running older versions of Microsoft Office on Windows 10:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/a-look-at-running-older-versions-of-microsoft/6faf72ea-254a-4c8e-9982-2c36cdb1936c">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/a-look-at-running-older-versions-of-microsoft/6faf72ea-254a-4c8e-9982-2c36cdb1936c</a></span></div>
<div><span>- Andre Da Costa found all versions back to 2000 would run with the exception of Outlook 2000.</span></div>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have Publisher 2000, 2003, 2007, 2010, 2013 installed and have never had a problem. I refused to install Pub 2016 as too buggy, too cloud centric and too hobbled by reduced functionality. (Besides you can't run Office 2013 programs at the same
 time as Office 2016...MSFT has decided that backward compatibility a bad idea.) In my view I don't see much risk in running unsupported versions of Publisher as Publisher has never been a target of malware or hacking like Word or even Excel. I have been answering
 Publisher questions since Pub 2000 and have never read of an occurrence, though I suppose it is possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest that you download and keep a copy of the <em>Office 2003 compatibility pack.
</em>It is not going to be available for much longer. Reference: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that this might not directly impact Publisher files but it could affect your ability to import newer Word files. You can install the pack if you do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note too that the pack comes with the Office 2003 SP2. I would also suggest that you download and keep copies of Office 2003
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23424" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SP2</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SP3</a>. I chose to not install SP3 because of a file compatibility problem. Honestly I don't remember the details but the discussion at the time in the NNTP Publisher groups was that SP3 could create some problems for Publisher. Whatever you decide to do it
 is good to have copies of these service patches as MSFT will eventually quit providing them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PDF functionality was not added to Publisher or Office until the Office 2007 PDF Add on. I discovered and started using the freebie Primopdf at the time and continue to use it today as it will work with any program from which you can print. It also has
 the advantage of having the ability to append a PDF file which is not available with the Office PDF tools. If you decide to install it I suggest that you do a custom install and opt out of any extra toolbars or junkware that sometimes comes bundled with these
 freebies. Here is my favorite trusted download source: <a href="https://filehippo.com/download_primopdf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://filehippo.com/download_primopdf/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Among the other advantages to running Pub 2003 is it does not choke on large pictures like the newer versions of Publisher tend to. If you go to View &gt; Pictures you will get a Picture Display dialog. Choose the
<em>fast resize and zoom</em> option which has been removed from newer versions of Publisher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other major difference is that if you open an old Publisher file that you created on a Win7 or older machine, with Pub 2013 or 2016 on a machine with Win8 or Win10 you will find the text boxes render text differently; you will get ~5% more text which
 will require you to tweak your layout. This does not happen if you use Pub 2003 or 2007 on the Win10 machines. You might find if you jump back and forth between Pub 2016 and 2003 that you will have that problem. There are lots of posts and discussions about
 this but here is a good one for you to get the basic idea:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>July 2015 - Reference: Publisher 2007 and Publisher 2013 paginates differently:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-publish/publisher-2007-and-publisher-2013-paginates/2ff3812a-5874-46dd-8c57-87aa3f86a321">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-publish/publisher-2007-and-publisher-2013-paginates/2ff3812a-5874-46dd-8c57-87aa3f86a321</a>&nbsp;- Well tested and documented thread showing the text rendering issue continues in Win10, but is
 limited to Pub 2013 and probably 2010. If you install Pub 2007 or 2003 in Win10, Win8, Win7, WinVista or WinXP then the files still render text the same and are cross OS compatible.</span></p>
<p>While most people will not have the option to install and run older versions of Publisher I support your decision to do so. And for those who are running older versions of Publisher and thinking of 'updating', I hope this discussion
 will remind them that sometimes if it ain't broke, then don't fix it.</p>

                    I have just found years of work from the 90's which I'd like to access. I have latest updated version of Office for Mac 2011 running on a macbook pro with latest Lion OS. I also have the original lotus suite disk somewhere I think. Thanks

            <p>The straight answer is "You can't.". Word (for PC &amp; Mac, both) hasn't been equipped with AmiPro filters for several versions. There is a filter available for the Windows version of Word which you can download from here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://gmayor.com/downloads.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://gmayor.com/downloads.htm</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also still be able to obtain a copy of MacLink Plus (by DataViz), although the product was discontinued quite some time ago. It does convert AmiPro to .doc although it was withdrawn before .docx came along. IIRC, it may also do batch conversions
 rather than one file at a time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only other options I can suggest are online services that do such conversions for a fee or use the Word feature [<strong>File&gt; Open - Enable:</strong>]to "recover text from any file". Neither of those provide any guarantee but may be able to recover
 enough usable text to make it worth a try. You'll most certainly have to do a fair amount of reformatting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Problems with Lumia 710</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm long time user of Nokia Phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love Nokia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, i bought Nokia Lumia 710. (<strong>1600.3015.8107.12070</strong>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I faced the following issues</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I can only transfer MP4 videos thru Zune software. I cant able to transfer 3gp,avi and asf videos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I use Nokia Drive 2.0.0.2148. GPS is not calculating my exact location. When i use offline maps, it is showing message like 'Looking for GPS...' after a long time it connects. &nbsp;It shows accuracy of about 3000 metres (data from GPS Info app). Only Online
 maps works. Also, it is not finding exact location. I think it uses A-GPS in open spaces also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. There is No Bluetooth File Transfer options. Even the normal feature phone support this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. No USB Modem or Bluetooth Modem to connect inetnet with PC. (No USB tethering) (even the S40 OS support this)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. No WiFi tethering (No Hotspot) (even the low cost android support this.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Facebook app is hanging sometimes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. No backup option for cantacts, messages, notes,etc as in Nokia Suite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. No File Manager. We cant able to transfer document files from PC. Instead we need to upload it to SkyDrive and download that via Phone. What a new technology??? having PC nearby.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Still discovering bugs.......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With all these bugs, how would i recommend this phone to my colleagues or others.????</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>is there anyway to fix these bugs????</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Awaiting your positive response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            Hello<br />
<br />
I can answer some of your questions, or atleast try to answer them.<br />
<br />
3. There is 2 main reason for this. First of all, the windows phones file system is not accessible for nirmal user. I guess,they don't want us to mess with it. Second, this way they prevented the sharing of non-free mp3s. i'm not sure about this, but sounds
 a good reason. (It's not my duty to judge about this:-))<br />
4&amp;5. Wifi tethering is on its way. Wp has this feature,but the lumia series will have it later.<br />
6. The fb app is pretty messed up,i suggest you to use a browser,and the fb mobile page. I use the fb app for the notifications only.<br />
7. Wp stores all your contacts on your live account, and maybe on your gmail too. I don't know anything about nites and messages,but when your phone is updating,zune makes a backup,so you should check zune for this feature.<br />
8. Check my first answer.<br />
9. In my opinion wp7 is a little beta like. A lots of important features are missing now,but patches are coming almost every month, so we have to be a little patient. I'm focusing on the good things (extreme fast os,and such).<br />
I hope,i helped you.<br />

<p>i also agree with sithick, nokia lumia 710 is the worst phone ever i had. i m big supporter of nokia i used lot of phones like htc wildfire, nokia n8, samsung galaxy.. etc, but lumia 710 is horrible.dont purchase lumia now. just check all those problems
 is solved in the latest updated software or not and then purchase. as of now it is worst than a local phone.</p>

<p>I'm like what an OS this phone has. All I can say is that if you own MS stock dump it fast as the OS on this phone is so bad its not even funny.</p>
<p>I think what they are trying to do here is a last ditch attempt to capture the online services market but it isn't going to work, because they have made this OS to weird.</p>
<p>I'm a pretty seasoned user and I generally am able to get gadgets to work but dudes this puppy is something else. I have 14 days to exchange it so Im going to give it my best shot for another couple of days and see where it goes.</p>
<p>The phone itself is pretty decent otherwise I would have returned on the 2nd day. Its pretty fast and the screen is nice and bright and if not some major concerns I wouldn't be a complaining.</p>
<p>1st} There is no way to import your bookmarks into the phone without using a online service.</p>
<p>2nd} I haven't been able to successfully export my old contact list from my LG P500 Android.</p>
<p>The 710 seems to only use contacts that are stored on online services even though I have imported my contacts using the Contact transfer function on the phone.</p>
<p>3rd)The phone won't shut off while charging even if you shut the phone down , plug it in and it turns on no matter what you do.</p>
<p>The Zune software is all glitter and no meat too unfortunately.</p>
<p>I really wanted an alternative and the phone is such good value and a local new Provider has a 27 $ a month unlimited everything, but luckily they have a 14 day phone exchange policy.</p>
<p>I'm going to keep for a few more days&nbsp;and see if I can get it to work the way i want it to.</p>

            Regarding your Q.2<br />
I got my Lumia 710 a month back, and regret the decision now. I too face the same problem with Nokia drive app not able to access GPS, as most other people who got the Lumia 710 in the recent months.<br />
I tried doing everything possible on the software side from updating the app and the OS version to re-installing the app. Nothing works. I called the Nokia helpline and they were of not much use, except for the advice of going to Nokia care centre.<br />
After going through many forum discussions, I see this issue is pretty common and is related to hardware. The only solution that worked is replacement of the motherboard.<br />
I wonder why Nokia is not addressing this issue, since its quite clear that the problem is quite widespread.<br />
I used to be a big supporter of Nokia earlier. But lately, Nokia really sucks.

<p>If you believe your Lumia 710 may not be functioning correctly you should visit a
<a href="http://nokia.com/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia Care Point</a> to have it examined. As this appears to be a hardware related case there is not much the Nokia Care line or your fellow forum members can do to help you with this.&nbsp;</p>

            I think Nokia has already manufactured the worst phone ever available in the market that is Nokia Lumia 710.<br />
Problems I discovered till now (two months use)<br />
<br />
1. You can't switch off it while charging.<br />
2. You can't set your favorite song as ringtone.<br />
3. You cant send/receive any file with the help of Bluetooth.<br />
4. You cant watch online TV.<br />
5. You can't take backup of your data stored in your phone.<br />
6. You can't add music/video in your phone if you don't have latest windows software installed in your pc as zune can't be installed in your pc if there is no service pack 3 with internet connection.<br />
The list of bugs continues..........

<p>Hi <span>asif_67213</span>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your feedback, I'll try and answers the points you are making in your post. Let us know if you have any further queries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>While some phones will go into a sleep mode when connected to a charger while being off, Windows Phone will turn on. Could you explain why this would be such an issue for you?
</li><li>You actually can, although some limitations apply. Ringtones can be upto 40 seconds long, be 1MB large and can't be copy protected. In general your ringtone would not sound for more that 40 seconds so would seem to be a trivial issue.
</li><li>This is true, but not unique to Windows Phone. </li><li>This is not correct, there is a number of apps which will allow you to watch live TV on a Windows Phone such as
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-GB/apps/5bfafc1b-c9f4-4e85-b89f-3947d650c382" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Plex.</a> </li><li>With the exception of the contents of the messaging hub you can backup any personal data through a choice of options. Important messages can be copy/pasted to OneNote if so desired.
</li><li>You are saying you find it strange that <a href="http://zune.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Zune</a> requires a version of Windows released April 2008 or later to work and you also find it strange that in order to fetch information , data or updates you need an internet connection on your PC?
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            I have an issue with links not working in Internet Explorer 10.</h2>
                    <p>Somehow, we are now using IE 10. (No one here will "fess up" to loading it) Immaterial....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, a large number of links will not load or open. In fact I was on the Company IE10 Help page and wanted to ask this question there but the "Ask a Question" button at the bottom of the page didn't react. Most of the time a chosen link or button will open
 a new tab but nothing will be loaded and I end up copying the link and pasting it in the address bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This frustrating to the point of madness. How do we fix this or go back to IE9?</p>

<h2>            No subject, or no sender - no thank you.</h2>
                    I get spam junk mail, all day, with no sender, or no subject. They are completely different each time.&nbsp; I keep blocking them, which might not do anything at all.&nbsp; What I really need to know is if there's a rule I can create that includes putting spam into
 the junk mail folder if there is no visible sender, or no subject.<br />
<br />
It drives me crazy that the spammers are winning with this method.&nbsp; Whether I like it or not, I am forced to 'touch' each message in order to block them - which doesn't do any good, because I just get more and more spam delivered to my inbox.<br />
<br />
It's only a problem with my hotmail acct - I rarely have problems with my gmail acct and outlook.<br />
<br />
Thank you. :)<br />

<h2>            I was hacked &#58; may have seen a remote http connection between system and server ending in flops.ru&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Firewall, Security and Antivirus are useless: My home Network was hacked and my Win 10 PC "hijacked".<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure where to post this? It's a problem but I'm not looking for help yet in how to recover my computer...&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I will be honest that ever since all those Win 10 Feature&nbsp; updates my computer was acting oddly.<br />
On top of that I found out today that my home router was hacked and my PC along with it.<br />
I had to pull the plug to stop the router.<br />
It's to the point that I cannot access the general settings&nbsp; despite being the admin. I couldn't even turn off the WiFi&nbsp; through control panel and barely managed to do so through the device manager.<br />
Quite a few of my files and logs have disapeared! I barely recall when looking at the network connections during this that there were a lot of connections but this seemed pretty consistently&nbsp;
<strong>established</strong> between my "system" processes a remote https server-#-#...- flops.ru I can't recall the numbers for remote server!<br />
<strong>Any ideas on this remote https connection to server ending in flops.ru ?</strong><br />
I wish that I could post some logs or some more details but I can't access much until I can access everything.<br />
My Norton Antivirus and it's&nbsp; firewall didn't even detect this! I would like to know if anyone else knows what/ who&nbsp; is/are this external remote https server ending with&nbsp; "flops.ru" and because I couldn't find any info about it other than the flops term . I'm
 not an expert so I don't really know what to think.&nbsp;<br />
I didn't have file sharing or remote access connections on. And recently only accessed and downloaded from Microsoft, Adobe, Dell, Intel, Nvidia, Norton, Malwarebytes ... Making sure the pc was up to date.<br />
But I'm surprised upon noticing the oddities, I had run several scans from Windows Safety Scanner previously, scanned with Malwarebytes and Norton as well... Nothing showed up.<br />
I had been using Microsoft Edge during this hijacking of my computer. Does anyone have any ideas?&nbsp;<br />
I have no clue what is going on things keep getting messed up with each update and so called security measures!<br />
I'm pretty sure that I will have to start fresh and reset and reinstall everything to recover.</p>

<p><span>Hi </span>HmmOK<span>,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For now, we recommend turning off your physical WiFi to avoid online incoming threats. Viruses, malware, and other threats can affect the performance of your computer. It can also damage your files or steal your important files,
 and worst, make most of your programs not to work properly and even the whole <strong>
Windows 10</strong> operating system.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Windows 10</strong> has an anti-virus called <strong>Windows Defender</strong>. This program is very essential for your computer since it has defensive measures that keep viruses and malware away from your PC by scanning and detecting it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To ensure that we can provide the appropriate resolution for your concerns, we’d like to ask you a few questions:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Which version or build of Windows device are you using? To know, press <strong>
Windows + R</strong> to open the <strong>Run</strong> window. Type <em><span style="color: rgba(0, 176, 80, 1)">winver</span></em> and press
<strong>Enter</strong>. A new window will open showing the version and build number of your Windows device.</span></li><li><span>What were the other recent changes made on your computer besides visiting the "</span>flops.ru" website<span>?</span></li><li><span>Are you aware that this is a dangerous site in the first place or not? If not, why did you encounter this website? What do you need from it?</span></li><li><span>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</span></li><li><span>Did you receive any error messages?</span></li><li><span>When was the last time that you scan your computer manually </span><span>for viruses and malware threats</span><span>?</span></li></ul>
<p><span>In addition, we recommend performing a full system scan for your computer to see if there are viruses, malware, malicious programs or script that prevents your computer to work properly. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Step #1:</span></strong><span> Perform a <strong>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows + S </strong>to open <strong>Search Box</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Type <strong>Windows Defender</strong>, then click it.</span></li><li><span>In <strong>Home</strong> tab, select <strong>Full</strong> under <strong>
Scan options</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Scan now </strong>to begin the thorough scanning of your computer.</span></li><li><span>Wait for the process to finish.</span></li><li><span>If there are any findings, send us the results through screenshot.</span></li><li><span>Before closing the application, make sure that <strong>Windows Defender</strong> is always turned on.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Step #2:</span></strong><span> Set a schedule on
<strong>Windows Defender</strong> to perform periodic scans. Visit this link: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026132/windows-schedule-a-scan-in-windows-defender-antivirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you have additional questions or concerns, or if the issue persists after the troubleshooting steps above, please let me know by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can.</span></p>

<p>1) My Windows 10 Version is 1803 (OS Build 17134.245) it doesn't state Windows 10 Pro but that is the OS</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I have never visited the following&nbsp; website "flops.ru" . I only saw this through network connections onThe Resource Monitor because I noticed files disapearing.</p>
<p>-recent visits were to microsoft websites, and other external windows forums recommended through here to try and figure things out. Only a Network Monitoring tool was downloaded through here. I also downloaded driver and bios updates from dell website recently</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) The first thing I did was to try and shut off the WiFi. When I did through the desktop, the connections were still active. I then tried going into settings and disabling the adapter but I couldn't at the time because there was a message saying I was not
 authorized... I have admin controls, but I didn't have any authorization to access the controls. I did somehow manage to get into Device Manager and disabled all network/wifi devices and did unplug the router and disconnected the modem from their power sources&nbsp;
 because I no longer could access them either!</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) I make sure to scan my PC everyday, but there were and still arlle not able to detect anything. And definitely do a full scan atleast once a week. Did another scan it&nbsp; didn't detect anything!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No malicious scripts, malware, viruses.... and such were detected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Some issues I noticed this week were:&nbsp;</p>
<p>- My antivirus was not updating on it's own</p>
<p>- I checked with windows defender and norton but they couldn't detect anything.</p>
<p>- Prior to that I had to keep using the "Windows Update Troubleshooter" because I was not getting updates - and every time it said the database was corrupted.</p>
<p>- I also ran a DISM and sfc scan through CMD and PowerShell as an Admin... everything&nbsp; is normal and it found no corruption or violation of integrity...</p>
<p>- I also stopped using chrome and uninstalled it just to be safe and and limited myself to Edge and IE browsers.&nbsp;&nbsp;My browsing history has also disapeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- My local admin password is changed as well without my concent. luckily I can use my pin to access general personal&nbsp; documents and pics and media files but can't&nbsp; get into admin&nbsp; safe mode either due to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>-I also noticed high cpu usage and found the system idle process was the culprit I don't remember how&nbsp; but I saw that NT Authority \SYSTEM was running "ntoskrnl.exe!KeSynchronizeExecution+0x2620 utilizing ) 0to7 CPU</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have contacted Norton and Netgear so far will be contacting my internet provider as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will not be connecting my pc to the internet as I can tell it is compromised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The only thing I can do at this point is to reset and reinstall and start fresh as I don't trust the recovery points and settings...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't access any controls and logs on the computer so I can't give&nbsp; exact info but this was everything I had managed to jot down on paper before I lost even more access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a precaution I reset my email and other account passwords and already had setup 2-step verification for all online&nbsp; accounts.</p>

<p><span>For now, we recommend rebooting your computer in&nbsp;<strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong>&nbsp;to
 return&nbsp;<strong><span>Windows 10</span></strong>&nbsp;to a basic state. It can help you to allow troubleshooting most issues on your computer. Since you can still boot your computer, you can also reboot in&nbsp;<strong><span>Safe
 Mode</span></strong>. To do this, you can visit this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Start your PC in safe mode in Windows 10</span></a>&nbsp;and look for steps under the
 “<em><span style="color: rgba(192, 0, 0, 1)">From the sign-in screen</span></em>” section.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When you successfully performed a&nbsp;<strong>Safe Mode</strong>, your next step is to clear the bad applications that can
 potentially cause issues listed on your&nbsp;<strong>System Configuration</strong>. This method is called&nbsp;<strong>Clean Boot</strong>.

<p>If it were that simple:</p>

</p><p>1) I need an admin password to login to safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) My admin password no longer works and I was the only user.</p>

    <title>iOS Skype forced Call Integration - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaysyn  say:</h3>
<h2>            iOS Skype forced Call Integration</h2>
                    <p>This is not asking about "How to enable/disable", because there is no option rather than logout and login every single use or completely uninstalling the app, even your device has Skype Notification off, Not running in background it would still force skype
 call as a normal call and ring the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally doubt the intention, as well as what will that actually benefit on Microsoft-side aside from forcing user to find alternative applications. This is a bad idea, it would nice to see the kind of statistics backing this move for example n% of the
 census are using call integration with the knowledge of it being a toggle option, but I guess the majority of the non-business users do not require a ring from a skype call, as few would call somebody on skype for emergencies.&nbsp;</p>

            Dear David,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />

<br />
<br />If still you will not be able to activate your Office, you can contact Microsoft phone support in your region <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/405170...</a> or you can contact them via chat <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/contactus/office/activation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/contactus/o...</a>

            Hi David
<br />
<br />Due to the amount of users reporting the same thing, it is possible Microsoft may have pushed an update that is causing this . .. 
<br />
<br />Click this link and run through the Office activation troubleshooter:

<p>Hi Johnny,<br />
<br />
You can follow the workaround in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2750229?ver=15&amp;app=excel.exe&amp;ss-src=featuredhelp&amp;ss=0b1d0a5b-06c0-4674-b2aa-cdc4327d3025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a> to remove identities and credentials, and then sign into Office applications on the Surface with your work/school account to check the outcome.<br />
<br />
Moreover, please add that SharePoint Online site as trusted site on Surface referring to A<strong>dd your SharePoint Online sites to trusted sites</strong> section in
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2616712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this KB article</a>. <br />
<br />
If the issue persists, to better understand the situation, I’d like to confirm the following things:<br />
1. For "having this issue on his surface, he can open files on the desktop without issue", do you mean that you sign into Office portal with your work/school account on that user's Surface, but the Office applications on it is signed in with his work/school
 account or only that user himself encountered this issue on Surface? When we open a file from SharePoint Online, we need to sign in the Office applications with the same account for signing into the SharePoint Online.<br />
2. Do you encounter this issue with both local files and the cloud files (files in SharePoint Online) or only with the cloud files? If you change to another computer to open the same files, will the issue occur?<br />
3. The related screenshots for this issue (Open files with Surface and capture the screenshots for the error message or pop-up). We appreciate it if you can provide us with the screenshots of the detailed steps.<br />
4. Are you the internal user or external user for this site?<br />
5. What is the edition of the Office applications on this surface? Is it Office 365 ProPlus 2013 or other Office edition? (Open one of the Office applications&gt;<strong>File</strong>&gt;<strong>Account</strong>&gt;capture a picture under<strong> Product Information</strong>)<br />
6. Your work/school account and the URL which you want to open files from SharePoint Online.<br />
<br />
To protect your privacy, you can upload the screenshots and a Word file to the workspace in my private message. To find the private message, access the URL
https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

            Yes, but if the cells contains dates already, then you are one step to late.<br />
<br />
As you (should) know a date in Excel is a number. Your SAP exports the data as text, but if you import that text into Excel, it is converted into a number.
<br />
<br />
And know you have a problem, because it is possible that some of the dates are recognized as "DD/MM/YY" and some as "MM/DD/YY", but all dates are numbers afterwards. So we have no chance to identify which of them came from which format.<br />
<br />
But if you import the "dates" as text, I can give you some code to convert a date string into a date, from any format you like.<br />
<br />
<span><span>Are day and/or month names included in your date strings?</span></span><br />

            <p>Hello, Andreas,</p>
<p>Actually, this is a report generated from within a document management system which is an SAP product, but runs outside of SAP on our intranet.&nbsp; The report itself has the date field formatted as such and when I download the report to Excel, it is not the
 date number that Excel recognizes, it is the format from the report itself.&nbsp; The report has the format of DD/MM/YYYY but as I stated above, some of the dates in the cell itself are D/MM/YYYY or D/M/YYYY, or DD/M/YYYY but appear on the report as DD/MM/YYYY.&nbsp;
 I have tried using formulas to divide it up and format correctly, but they don't work on every line.&nbsp; Reformatting the column also does not work.&nbsp; They don't seem to be imported as text; if they were I could work with that.&nbsp; The month and day names are not
 included in the date string.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Valerie</p>

            In you first post you said you want to convert dates from the format Day/Month/Year to Month/Day/Year, as the topic header shows.<br />
<br />
But what you are telling now confuses me totally.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that if a cell shows a date in D/M/YYYY and I doesn't work if you apply the format DD/MM/YYYY, then the cell value must be a text.<br />
<br />
Make a new file and execute this macro and explore the cells afterwards:<br />
<br />
Sub Test()<br />
&nbsp; Range("A1:A5") = 1234<br />
&nbsp; Range("A2").NumberFormat = "D/M/YYYY"<br />
&nbsp; Range("A3").NumberFormat = "DD/MM/YYYY"<br />
&nbsp; Range("A4").NumberFormat = "MM/DD/YYYY"<br />
&nbsp; Range("A5").NumberFormat = "YYYY/MM/DD"<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Important note: Any cell contains 1234 as value!! The numberformat only change Excels interpretation of the value, means the visible result on screen.<br />
<br />
I would like to see a sample of your data, the data file before import if possible and an Excel file with the data directly after import and a manually filled column with the dates that you expect instead.<br />
<br />
Please look in ym profile for my email address and instructions.<br />
<br />
Andreas.

            If the data is truly text, and not numbers, and if the format is consistently like "Day/Month/Year" as described, then this formula will convert it to an actual date in Excel, which you can then format as you wish. &nbsp;Assumes your data is in column A starting
 at row 2.
<div><br />
<div>=DATE(INT(RIGHT(A2,LEN(A2)-FIND("/",A2,FIND("/",A2,1)+1))),INT(MID(A2,FIND("/",A2,1)+1,FIND("/",A2,FIND("/",A2,1)+1)-FIND("/",A2,1)-1)),INT(LEFT(A2,FIND("/",A2,1)-1)))</div>

Let me elaborate, run this sub and look into the immediate window:<br />
<br />
Sub Test()<br />
&nbsp; Dim S As String, D As Date, i As Integer<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; S = "2/3/4"<br />
&nbsp; GoSub Show<br />
&nbsp; S = "2/13/4"<br />
&nbsp; GoSub Show<br />
&nbsp; S = "13/2/4"<br />
&nbsp; GoSub Show<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Range("B:B").NumberFormat = "0"<br />
&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Show:<br />
&nbsp; D = CDate(S)<br />
&nbsp; Debug.Print D, CLng(D)<br />
&nbsp; i = i + 1<br />
&nbsp; Range("A" &amp; i) = S<br />
&nbsp; Range("B" &amp; i) = S<br />
&nbsp; Return<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
In my German Excel the output in the immediate window is<br />
02.03.2004&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 38048 <br />
13.02.2004&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 38030 <br />
13.02.2004&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 38030 <br />
<br />
but the sheet shows<br />
03.02.2004&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 38020<br />
13.02.2004&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 38030<br />
13/2/4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13/2/4<br />
<br />
I'm facing this issue often when someone from the USA posts dates in this forum, if I copy &amp; paste the dates into Excel, the dates are wrong (the month and day values changes sometimes).<br />
<br />
This issue occurs every time when the OP has a different date order as I, see Application.International(xlDateOrder)<br />
<br />
In this cases I have to copy &amp; paste the date string as text and run a special macro to convert them to dates.<br />
<br />
So if we already have dates, there is no change to identify that the date value (in A1) 38048 should be 38020 afterwards.<br />
<br />
If we know that this date is wrong, then you are right, we can exchange the day and the month:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Range("A1") = DateSerial(Year(Range("A1")), Day(Range("A1")), Month(Range("A1")))<br />

            <p>Thank you all for your suggestions.&nbsp; The Macro below from macropod works great if all dates are text - does nothing to the dates formatted as dates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I found out when I download the report to Excel is that Excel interprets what it can and converts it to a date&nbsp;but treats it like a US date format - 2/4/2013 is actually 4/2/2013(US) but Excel converts to 2(mo)/4(day)/2013 which is incorrect.&nbsp; Other
 cells in the column that Excel cannot identify as a date - 25/11/2012 (which is 11/25/2012 US) Excel leaves as text so I have a mixture in the date columns.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Easiest solution I found:</p>
<p>in download file itself (before copying into my workbook) I insert 2 columns to the right of the date column and use the text-to-columns feature choosing "/" as my delimeter, then I can copy into my workbook&nbsp;that contains&nbsp;a column with the formula to piece
 them together how they need to be for the date. :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you again for your input!!</p>

            Paul, I know that it works in this special case, but that doesn't matter if you read the last reply from Valerie, how she has solved the issue. That is basically the same way as I do.<br />
<br />
Below is part of my solution to parse a date from any format. If the date string contains date or day names, then I have other routines that prepare the date string for this routine.<br />
<br />
Of course, the code is a lot more extensive, which not everyone likes.<br />

<p>Hello Sir, I am very thankful for your amazing formula. I have a date as given below in cell A1. But expected result must be like 03/07/2013 but what we can see excel is converting its year to 1913 instead of 2013. Please help.</p>

                    <p>I resend emails to myself and update the subject line so I can organize my email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office365 is not keeping these updates in some cases, if there is a minor change the subject line reverts to the original subject line.&nbsp; Can anyone help?</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply - I read the article and did not know about the "resend" option, so thanks for that info!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made some more attempts and here is what I've found.&nbsp; I'm using Office365 Outlook exclusively, and what I'm seeing is that when I forward a message, the "FW:" is being removed automatically in my inbox display, so if I change or remove the "FW:" those
 changes do not keep, but anything I change AFTER the "FW:" is updated.&nbsp; I wondered if this may be due to how my inbox is being displayed - so I did some research &amp; turned off Conversation view and now I see all subject lines displayed accurately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my issue is specifically with Conversation view and how it groups emails into a "conversation" - I would expect this grouping to contain messages that have the EXACT same subject line, but it seems Office365 is grouping messages together with SIMILAR
 subject lines and removing the actual subject lines of each individual email, which does not work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help, I will stop using Conversation view from now on as I do not want Office365 to alter how subject lines are displayed.</p>

<h2>            Finding way around Skype</h2>
                    <p>When I log on to my Windows 10 Skype I get a screen with two different vertical panels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The left panel is headed by a "plus sign", a "picture of me" and then a "keyboard symbol"</p>
<p>Below is a search box followed by a symbol which pulls up all my contacts</p>
<p>Below is a list of recent actions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The right panel (mostly blue) Says "Hello David", "Invite Friends" etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are icons etc that allow me to go to any other screen so I cannot set up devices, test video etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I move to other screens?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Why is the new Skyoe so much less user friendly than the eralier versions?</p>

<h2>            Cannot access Outlook.com Premium Mail</h2>
                    <p>I am an Outlook.com premium subscriber and have been using my new email address with personalised domain name for over 6 months. However I now cannot access my emails either via an app on iPhone or via Outlook 2010 or 2016 on a PC or via a web browser.</p>
<p>I can go to the Outlook.com log in page and enter my customised email address and password and the authorisation appears to be accepted and the mailbox starts to open. The progress bar moves to around 80% and then I get a website error message</p>

<p>Many thanks Brian,</p>
<p>Yes am aware that Microsoft have discontinued Premium Mail. Its a great product(when working) so not sure why they dropped it so quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I have now managed to contact Premium Mail support. The reason I could not see the Contact Us link at the bottom of the dashboard was because I had logged in as the primary alias (personalised email address) rather than the original mailbox email
 address which automatically becomes the Admin account.</p>
<p>After logging in to my email using the Admin account I can now log in using the personalised alias on any device and any browser. This seems to have "unclogged" something.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However all new mail being sent to my personalised address is not being received but redirected to another Microsoft account mailbox which was used to purchase Office 365. This is obviously a internal mail routing or DNS issue which Support will have to
 hopefully figure out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft have some great ideas but I think they over complicate it. i.e. why does
 dashboards and billing information.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Sign in to OneNote 2016 Free from Desktop</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've been trying sync my OneNote files across my devices and I downloaded the free version of OneNote 2016 from the Microsoft website. I start the program, and it tells me to sign in. So I enter my details and click Next, but then it just takes me straight
 back to the window telling me to sign in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This question has been posted before but none of the solutions offered there worked for me. I've tried reinstalling/repairing the program, loading my OneNote files in the browser and then launching them in the app, but nothing has worked. It always loops
 back to the sign in prompt when I try to sign in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit if that helps.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2007-Forwarded Mail Not Shown In Sent Folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> todd hoatson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2007-Forwarded Mail Not Shown In Sent Folder</h2>
                    <p>I opened an e-mail in my Outlook 2007 and I see a message at the top that this message was forwarded on a certain date. When I click on the message, I am given the option to find related messages, but the forwarded message is not shown.<br />
</p>
<p>So I manually went to my Sent Items folder, and there was no record of the forwarded message!<br />
</p>
<p>Here's the screen shot: https://cldup.com/b0nWM-vPoI.jpg</p>
<p>(I have blurred out sensitive information in the screen shot.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The open e-mail message is from my Inbox, but if you'll notice at the top it says, "You forwarded this message on 7/28/2015..." If I forwarded it, why is it not in my Sent items? That is the question...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not in the habit of deleting items from my Sent Items folder...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried checking the settings, but I had&nbsp;already checked the option to save forwarded files in Sent Items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone see this kind of problem before?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any suggestions!</p>

                    I asked Skype to look up my user name and found 8 id's from all over the world associated with my email address.&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I delete them as it does not give me the full user name so I can request a password change and delete them. Who can I talk to that
 can make that happen.&nbsp; It seems really strange in this day and age that new accounts can be created without verifying the associated email address which verification I would never give.

They are not my old accounts.&nbsp; One is from Turkey&nbsp; and others are from other parts of the world.&nbsp; My problem is that I can't gain access because I&nbsp; don't know the user names for those accounts and when I request user names using my email address they are blanked
 out for "security".&nbsp; Any other ideas&nbsp; on how to get rid of them and keep them from coming back???
