    <title>Desktop Background Clarity - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Desktop Background Clarity</h2>
                    <p>This is a problem I have only recently noticed, but my desktop background appears slightly blurry. It seems that my background's resolution is being decreased, for whatever reason. To test, I set this image as my background:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://fujitem.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/final_wallpaper.jpg</p>
<p>
</p><p>When viewing it on chrome, I can zoom in very far and still see very crisp lines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this is what happens when I position it as "fill" (or any other background position):</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://i.imgur.com/8uHHyG7.jpg</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice the drastic decrease in clarity. Is this Windows' problem? It's not a graphics card problem since I can view HD images in Chrome without a problem. I've double and triple-checked my monitor settings. I'm using an Acer S232HL Monitor with a GeForce
 GTX 760 connected via HDMI, though I doubt it's any hardware issue. I'm running Windows 8.1, latest updates on all the relevant drivers.&nbsp;</p>

            This is a known issue with how the background drawing engine processes JPEG-compressed picture files.&nbsp; To avoid the issue, you can use a PNG picture file instead.&nbsp; To convert a picture from JPG to PNG, you can open it in Paint (right-click the file and
 "open with"), and then use File/Save As to save it as PNG instead.

</p><p>getting sick of this happening i come here to get help post what is asked for and still NO help what so ever. sorry but i need help from someone from Microsoft i have update all the drivers that needed to be and had updates for. so either i get help from
 someone who works for Microsoft or they can fork over a New PC as it didn't do this crap before upgrading to windows 10 as i had windows 8.1 and had No issues like this what so ever and i can't go back to windows 8.1 as i do NOT have a copy of it and it will
 not let me use the dvd/cd's i made when i had it. i don't have money to go out and buy a NEW PC either so either Microsoft help's fix this crap or replace the pc as it is there fault it is happening as i take very good care of my pc i clean it out weekly with
 an Air Cleaner made for doing so. and it is not over heating either as i have cheaked that with programs to do so.

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><em><span><span>and why uninstall Advanced Systemcare?</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Advanced System Care 10 is a composite software bundle containing a number of undesirable components. The claims by Iobit are all spin to get your cash.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Using a registry cleaner makes negligible difference to system performance and has the real potential to create difficult to resolve system errors that can only be fixed by reinstalling
 Windows. The optimiser interferes with the way Windows is designed to run. Running the software continuously in the background takes available resources, thereby slowing down the system to the detriment of other things you want the computer to do. The security
 component introduces a source of conflicts with other installed security software. McAfee is not tolerant of other security products. Overall the installation of this type of software is bad news!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Please remove Advanced SystemCare.
</span><span><span>Select the keyboard shortcut </span><strong><span>WIN+X,</span></strong><span> select Control Panel,
</span><strong><span>Programs and Features,</span></strong><span> Place the cursor on
</span><strong><span>Advanced SystemCare,
</span></strong><span>right click and select </span><strong><span>Uninstall
</span></strong><span>from the drop down menu.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you play Guild Wars 2 often? You need to be aware that this software is very demanding. My daughter plays it a lot and we had to upgrade hardware to overcome overheating issues causing
 crashes. Your Speccy report is not showing overheating but was your computer being subjected to the demands of software like Gild wars 2 at the time you obtained the Speccy report.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The presence of
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Advanced SystemCare and McAfee at the same time on your computer suggests that it would be prudent to check for malware. Conflicting software lets in unwanted guests.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I recommend that you run Disk CleanUp or cCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software. cCleaner comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this tool
 as like any registry cleaner it can lead to the creation of very difficult to resolve system errors</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only -not the Trial version –watch the checked boxes whilst installing), update definitions and run in normal mode.
 Disable other security software whilst you are doing scans.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/confirm/</span></span></a><span>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please make certain you
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please upload a copy of the report on what it found as a shared file to your OneDrive and a post a link here.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please download ADWCleaner to your Downloads or Desktop folder, right click select
<strong>Run as Administrator</strong> and upload a copy of the report produced to your OneDrive. Remove all that it finds.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Before running ADW Cleaner close all open programmes. When ADW Cleaner is run four options are offered. Click
<strong>Scan.</strong> You can review the results by clicking <strong>Log File</strong> or each or any of the Results tabs. To remove all items, click
<strong>Clean</strong> and reboot the computer. On restarting an ADW Cleaner window opens. Select Log File, and click File, Save As to create a report of what has been removed.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span>Hi profilli,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>We would be able to assist you better if you may tell us the exactly what you do when you get this error message?
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There are specific reasons for this error which I could get to. The Description of the common situation where you
 may see this error:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>OS runs out of memory for TCP buffers -</span></strong><span><span>
 Winsock throws the error WSAENOBUFS</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Using /3GB will cause the OS to have only 1GB memory for system use.&nbsp;The paged pool and non-paged pool size will be half the
 default size.&nbsp;These memory pools are&nbsp;used by OS to store network buffers, etc. Thus, when /3GB is turned on, it is more likely that OS will run out of non-paged pool and be unable to serve socket calls.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>For this Remove the /3GB switch from c:\boot.ini.</span></strong><span>
 The root problem in this case is memory pressure on the OS, so removing the /3GB switch will give more memory to the OS and will alleviate this problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer to the below mentioned link for additional guidance on the issue –</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/sqldataaccess/thread/efb0c4bd-389f-45d6-88eb-b2403e36d3b3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/sqldataaccess/thread/efb0c4bd-389f-45d6-88eb-b2403e36d3b3</span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also there is an article, this mentions to uninstall any unnecessary network adapters installed.

            I'm just wondering why Skype is garbage now. Does anyone have any ideas? In the last year it has gone from a totally reliable VOIP to absolute crap that their techs don't support at all. You can't navigate to the chat support feature on their website.
 And when you email them your issue, they don't respond.<br />
<br />
My company is switching VOIPs this summer. We support Deaf and hard of hearing college students using Skype. Skype doesn't care about this. I have explained this to them a few times. Their account setup criteria have changed, making it nearly impossible for
 us to keep using them. Their messenger feature often doesn't show that we are sending our supported students a link to their real-time transcript. So they can't respond. I get that it's free but it's absolutely terrible now, as is their customer service. Complete
 joke.&nbsp;

<p>The first problem is that I have to go on a public forum and call the product garbage to get any response. Any other time I reach out to tech support, I am ignored. That's the first red flag.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The issue is quite simple and contrary to Kennth F's reply, that issue with messages being sent and received is NEVER resolved. It has happened to my team and me innumerable times. That chat feature is our LIFELINE for what we do. Add to that, Skype took away
 the feature that allows us to see when our students log in and are online in Skype.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue has happened on Windows 10 machines. But it could just as easily be Windows 8. The OS doesn't really matter because it happens so often and across so many of them that I am left no choice but to switch my company's VOIP platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thing is that we used to be able to create an account/user name without having to enter an email address. Now, we have to go through a two part authentication process. In any given year, I have to generate 20 new accounts for our students. And
 when Skype tells me that my phone number has been used too many times and I can't authenticate using it anymore, I am left with no more options.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It would be nice if Skype would ADD features during a new version release instead of handcuffing its users into using absolute crap features that don't work. It's not lost on me that it's a free service but if it's worth releasing to the public, it should be
 better quality. We've seen this slow degradation over the last year or so and it is frustrating. I'm betting the next major release will be just a picture of a big dumpster fire.&nbsp;</p>

            You need to post more details about your problem for a proper analysis but the most likely cause is that your game attempts to write data to files in system folders. In other words, your game is not Windows 7 compatible. Here are your options:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Get a Windows 7 compatible version.</li><li>Tweak the game so that it writes its data in folders other than System folders.</li><li>Turn off UAC (not recommended).<br />
</li></ul>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If you are saying you tried the same disk on two different computers and both then open and say<br />
asks to insert a disk then the disk is defective or both machines have the same alignment issue.<br />
Try the disk on other computer to see if the issue continues with that disk.<br />
<br />
(I hope in this line "......Tried the same disk on a different laptop running XP and same error, cannot<br />
detect the disk." that you meant disk and not "drive". So you tried the same DISK in two different<br />
computers which had two different CD/DVD drives and neither recognized a disk was already inserted.)<br />
<br />
If you meant something else please explain with careful working.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>Thanks for the quick response...&nbsp; in the past, the disk is auto-detected and played without having to go to Media Player, etc.&nbsp; Now it doesn't get detected,</p>
<p>So, I tried to use Media Player and also Media Centre to play it (on the Windows 7 machine).&nbsp; Both software&nbsp;cannot detect the disk.&nbsp; The drive can be seen as E:, but for example,&nbsp;Media Centre says "cannot detect DVD".&nbsp; I then went to "my computer" and tried
 to read the e: drive, and then disk drive pops open, asking to insert disk, which was already in it.</p>
<p>So, I tried the disk on my work laptop which runs XP, and the disk is not auto-detected but I can play if I click on e: drive in "my computer" (Media Player launches).&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a DVD disk (I tried with audio CD and VCD too, same problems on the Windows 7
 machine).</p>
<p>Hope this clarifies the problem.&nbsp;</p>

Sounds like Autoplay is not set properly, the disk does not contain the information for Autoplay,<br />
or the disk is defective. Do other disks still work?<br />

<h3> douglasryan_792  say:</h3>
<h2>            disk i&#47;o in task manager 100&#37; when search indexer running &#40;windows 8&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft Windows Search Indexer routinely uses about 1/3 of my cpu (I have quad core 1.7GHz) and, from time to time, uses almost 100% of disk I/o according to the task manager. (Currently it is registering 6.0 MB/s, but I've seen it much higher).&nbsp;&nbsp; And
 it seems to run all the time.&nbsp; Is this normal?&nbsp; (I just bought the computer one week ago).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently had to restore 120GB of files.&nbsp; Could this be the source of the issue?&nbsp; If so, How long should it take the indexer to finish indexing that and settle down?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The indexer consistently seems to use about 175MB of RAM.&nbsp; While not an issue (machine has 12GB RAM), is this normal?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appreciate any insights anyone can shed.</p>

<h3> petar17  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse and keyboard randomly freeze after latest Windows 10 update &#40;version 1809, KB 4494441&#41;</h2>
                    <p>After recent Windows 10 update (I'm on version 1809, update&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=4494441" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB 4494441</a>)
 - occassionally, mouse and keyboard simultaneously freeze. The image keeps moving (e.g. mouse cursor is showing loading, or browser tab shows loading), but I cannot move/use either. I have looked at Event Viewer under system logs, and there are no outstanding
 messages at the time of the freeze. I found no dump files. Keyboard/mouse, GPU drivers are the most recent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setup (may or may not be relevant):</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyboard: Logitech MK710</li><li>Mouse: Logitech G402 Hyperion Fury.&nbsp;</li><li>CPU: AMD Ryzen7 2700x</li><li>MB:&nbsp;ASUS TUF B450-Plus Gaming</li><li>GPU:&nbsp;GeForce GTX1060 Asus 6GB DDR5&nbsp;</li><li>RAM: 16GB&nbsp;Kingston HyperX Predator DDR4 3200MHz</li><li>OS: Windows 10, version 1809, on update&nbsp;KB 4494441 (meaning build 17763.503)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>One more thing I've noticed after that update, is that it seems to have corrupted most of SysWow64 - which I've managed to repair with sfc /scannow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: this is a custom built PC, but I didn't have these issues until recently (timeline compares to when the update was installed). I still haven't tried updating chipset and BIOS to latest.</p>

<p><span>Hi Petar,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I appreciate your efforts in trying to fix the issue and bringing this issue to our notice. Since you have already tried updating the keyboard/mouse and graphics drivers, and you could not find any dump files or logs in event viewer related to this
 issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, we have not come across this issue to be known. I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try troubleshooting the keyboard and mouse as per the articles provided by manufacturer. Since the mouse you are using is a gaming mouse, you can refer the article
<a href="https://support.logitech.com/en_us/article/Troubleshoot-gaming-mouse-button-and-key-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<a href="https://support.logitech.com/en_us/article/Delay-when-typing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><span>If this did not fix the issue, please try the next method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you have mentioned that you have not tried updating the chipset. I would suggest you to update the chipset drivers and check if that helps. You can download the chipset drivers from the
<a href="https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/TUF-B450-PLUS-GAMING/HelpDesk_Download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><span>If this did not fix the issue, try following the next method and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to check and install the latest Windows updates, as the update installed on the PC was released on 14<sup>th</sup> May. Here is
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/311047/how-to-keep-your-windows-computer-up-to-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, we will keep a check on this and I would also suggest you to submit a feedback on

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting mouse/keyboard did not help - it's not the issue there. I have installed latest Windows 10 update (KB4497934), and still haven't updated bios/chipset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>however, the issue reoccurred (before KB update) and I have tested a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>mouse and keyboard are frozen. Changing USB port does not help.</li><li>Inserting a USB drive/phone in the USB drive does not pop up on desktop (I have power on my phone, but see no connection to PC). So, USB has power, but PC is not responding</li><li>network icon in the taskbar, usually connected to LAN, shows a yellow exclamation mark, as if network got disconnected.</li><li>Only restart helps. As soon as I restart, phone pops up a dialog showing that it's connected to PC</li></ul>
<p>I'll see if this windows update resolves the issue. If not, I'll try with bios and chipset update. If that doesn't help either, I'll try with tweaking some bios config (e.g. RAM voltage), because maybe that's the issue (since, as I've said, this is a custom
 build PC).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, I'll reply with more findings. Any further ideas are highly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

    <title>Control Key Randomly Locks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> artwny  say:</h3>
<h2>            Control Key Randomly  Locks</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp; am&nbsp; running&nbsp; Windows 8.1 on a HP P6-2310 desktop.&nbsp; During the past month, the Control key&nbsp; has randomly locked with the result that when I type something such as an "r", the computer performs the "Control r" action..<br />
<br />
The only&nbsp; way that I have been able to&nbsp; cancel the control lock is by restarting the computer. So far&nbsp; I have found no combination of keystrokes to undo&nbsp; do this&nbsp; via the keyboard. The behavior&nbsp; cannot be cancelled by doing anything with "sticky&nbsp; keys."<br />
<br />
My&nbsp; first question is "what could be causing this&nbsp; in the first place?"&nbsp; The second question is "has anybody else&nbsp; seen this problem?"&nbsp; Finally, are there are any high probability&nbsp; actions that I&nbsp; can take to undo this short&nbsp; of restarting the computer?"<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

Usually just tapping the opposite Ctrl- key to the one that is stuck fixes it.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can see this in the On-Screen Keyboard (osk.exe).<br />

            Thanks for the suggestions.<br />
<br />
I have run the&nbsp; troubleshooting and the&nbsp; keyboard comes up as healthy. There are no HP&nbsp; up dates&nbsp; available for&nbsp; the keyboard.<br />
<br />
After looking&nbsp; at anything that has been posted anywhere&nbsp; on the subject, I settled&nbsp; on going&nbsp; to the on screen&nbsp; keyboard and locking the left&nbsp; hand CTRL key there whenever I get the&nbsp; annoying behavior. As soon as I go&nbsp; back&nbsp; to the&nbsp; regular keyboard, everything
 is normal. I have then gone&nbsp; back to the OSKB, and&nbsp; the CTRL key is not locked.<br />
<br />
Now that I know that doing something with the LH CTRL on screen&nbsp; key is beneficial, I&nbsp; will try the same key on the regular keyboard the next&nbsp; time I have the problem. However, I have the recollection that I&nbsp; tried&nbsp; this previously and did not accomplish anything.<br />
<br />
Once again, thanks for the suggestions.<br />

i have the same thing happening on a surface pro running 8.1 and i have the new backlite typing keyboard. both the control key and the shift keys will lock if held down long enough. i have tested and had it happen in outlook, windows explorer and i suppose
 i could try other programs but why bother. i can get out of it by hitting the control or shift key again.
</p>
<p>is this some secret feature that MS just did not bother telling us about?</p>

            <p>i have done more testing on other brands of computers running 8.1 and i can duplicate it on every one. hold the control key down for 7 seconds or more and the control key locks. to get it out of lock is simple. Just hit the control key and it unlocks. i
 am not sure this is a error or a feature. but it is annoying. </p>
<p>
</p><p>i am not sure why so few people are mentioning this issue. i found it happens a lot when i am using the control key and selecting emails to move in Outlook or files to move and i am holding the key down for a long time.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Freezing on Spinning Dots - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Freezing on Spinning Dots</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
My wife and I have custom-built PCs with the following parts: </p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
MB: GIGABYTE Z97X Gaming 5 <br />
CPU: Intel i5-4690k <br />
GPU: GIGABYTE GeForce GTX 760 2048MB GDDR5 <br />
RAM: 4x4GB Corsair Vengeance 1600MHz 9-9-9-24 <br />
OS: Windows 10 (x64) with latest updates (since it forces them on you)</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Both PCs are the same parts aside from PSUs, HDDs, cases and peripherals. On Monday we left for a short trip. We had both used our PCs Sunday night without a problem. On Wednesday when we returned I booted my PC up and it worked fine. She tried to boot hers
 and it just powered on for 2-3 seconds and then powered off, in a loop.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
In trying to test the issue I disconnected everything from the MB except the primary HDD, the power switch jumper, the MB/CPU power cables and the CPU itself. I even removed the RAM and disconnected all peripherals. I tried using one stick of RAM from her set
 and then again with one from mine, each time trying in two separate slots. The problem remained. We even tried putting both PCs next to each other so I could use my PCs PSU to power her PC. The result was the same. So we knew it was a problem with either the
 MB or the CPU.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
To try and narrow it down so as not to have to buy both parts I took my MB and her CPU and tried it in her case. (Note that every test of mixing CPU/MB was preceded by cleaning the CPU and cooler with isopropyl alchohol and re-applying thermal paste) It had
 the same symptoms of 2-3s of power and restarting in a loop. So then I tried my CPU and her MB and tried it. It booted and ran for about 5 minutes. So we know her CPU is fried at least. However, at the 5 minute mark (approximately) Windows just powered off
 and restarted with no warning. After the restart, the system would no longer boot past the Windows logo with the spinning dots. It freezes there. After restarting from that state the Windows automatic failure recovery starts but also freezes.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I tried resetting the BIOS to the "optimized defaults" and resetting CMOS by removing the battery for 20m. We also flashes the BIOS to the latest version. The behaviour was the same in all cases. So we decided to just at least try and put my PC back together
 at this point. I put my CPU and my MB back into my case with the rest of my components and powered it up to discover it, too, now had the freezing at the spinning dots. I tried the same steps on my PC as hers (removing components, disconnected peripherals,
 RAM tests, etc.).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I did find the behaviour changes if I remove the GPU. It no longer freezes at the spinning dots but immediately after. The screen flashes off and on and the powered black screen just sits there, presumably frozen. if I forcefully restart from that state the
 Windows failure recovery can get through diagnosing the PC and I get options. I've tried all of them at this point except restoring to a previous build. From the command prompt I ran "sfc /scannow" but no errors were found. I'm trying chkdsk /r on c: and d:
 currently. C: ran clear and D: is working on check for bad sectors in the free space. I really don't expect the hard drive to be bad, though.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I checked the Windows Event Viewer by running eventvwr from a command prompt in Safe Mode and only found errors related to services not starting due to being in Safe Mode. I also tried uninstalling my nvidia drivers since it freezes earlier in the boot process
 with the GPU attached.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I ran system recovery to a previous point and it completed but the problem remains. I even tried "reset PC" which is supposed to reinstall Windows. It progressed to 31% installed and restarted but came back to a black screen again with no indication it was
 doing anything for several minutes. After a forceful restart it said "undoing changes" and then froze again on the next restart. After that, it popped up a message saying the previous boot didn't complete successfully and to restart. So I did and then saw
 another 'undoing changes" for much longer that time, followed by yet another automatic restart. &nbsp;Now it appears to have completely undone the "reset PC" process.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I'm completely out of ideas at this point. I know we need a new CPU for the one PC but my PC was fine. The only things that were done that would impact my system are 1) it was booted up on Wednesday (so maybe some Windows updates were installed), 2) the MB
 BIOS was reset, 3) BIOS updated to the latest version, 4) the MB and CPU were cross-tested with a broken CPU and a matching MB that seems to be working the same way. I thought about trying to build a recovery drive using my Windows 10 laptop but it needs a
 32GB USB drive, which I don't have.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
After checking other posts in this community I did try a clean boot and disabling anti-virus but neither helped. Is there any way to get more information about what part of the boot process is running when it hangs?<br />

            This was caused by the motherboard reset. It defaults to UEFI but my PC is Legacy since it was installed as Windows 7 and then upgraded to Windows 10. &nbsp;Switching back to Legacy for all pertinent options got it to boot without the GPU.<br />
<br />
To get the GPU problem solved I had to enable to XMP memory profile for some reason. Not sure why but it fixed the issue. Found the suggestion for doing it here:&nbsp;https://hardforum.com/threads/poor-performance-after-cold-boot.1821875/

<h2>            OneDrive iOS App Photos Tab Showing All Photos Rather Than Just My Just Pictures Folder</h2>
                    <p>In the iOS OneDrive app photos are displayed in the Photos tab from all folders in my OneDrive collection, not just photos from my Pictures folder.&nbsp; In Windows 10 i have the option checked in the photos app to only show photos from my Pictures folder.&nbsp; I
 realise this is a different app.&nbsp; When I log into OneDrive through a browser on a PC and then navigate to the Photos tab only the photos from my Pictures folder are displayed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore both my PC through the Windows Photos App, also the OneDrive website through a browser operate correctly displaying only photos from my Pictures folder int the respective Photos tab's.&nbsp; But when I use the iOS app for OneDrive I see a plethora of
 photos from my music library, other folders etc which are not part of my Pictures directory directory folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do set the OneDrive app (iOS) only to show photos from my Pictures folder in the app.&nbsp; OneDrive is not functioning the same across all platforms as one would expect.&nbsp; I'm assuming there is setting I'm not seeing....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>I have recently transferred all my personal data from other cloud storage provider onto OneDrive. And, now, I am also experiencing this very annoying issue on my mobile devices. I can't filter thousands of irrelevant pictures in the photos tab. I can't sort
 or group them either. The only solution seems to be creating albums, but it doesn't solve my&nbsp;problem either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use the web interface, everything works fine. However, it is 2019, and who wants to use primarily the web application to see, share and manage personal photos and videos?</p>

<h2>            Desktop does not respond</h2>

Recently I've got a problem from Windows 10. The issue is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The desktop does not respond at all, neither left click nor right click works. And if I focus out an application and want to focus on it again by clicking it, it doesn't work either. Seems the mouse event doesn't emit any signals so the system won't respond.
 But I can use ctrl + Esc to open the task bar and I am able to open apps by clicking the icons on task bar or start menu. It's only the desktop, looks just like something is overlapping the desktop.</li></ul>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
I've searched the internet and all of them are either right click doesn't work or double click doesn't work. And I've also tried restart explorer and sfc /scannow, but no luck. Restart fixes it sometimes.</p>

 2 days, I got my laptop back because they said the problem is caused by Windows. So, I decided to upgrade my OS to Windows 7. After upgrade, I had still no sound. Still no tab in device manager. However, I got my sound back two times when I played with windows

I tried hibernating, installing the driver, stopping and starting audio in services. But still nothing.<br />

==================================================<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : <br />
<br />
Run DriverView -&nbsp;set&nbsp;VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without <br />
Dump in their names (and&nbsp;update BIOS and chipset).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p><br />
====================================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<p><br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable</p>
<p><br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. <br />
Also check with&nbsp;MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can <br />
analyze it.<br />

Hope this helps. <br />

    <title>Sniper only TDM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bohmoon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sniper only TDM</h2>
                    
<p>I recently played the objective games after level up like 9 time just to get my ninja pro. I like TDM and a little FFA. I'm such an idiot I played like 10 games of S&amp;D to get bomb plants and didn't get one. Finally, someone told me to play one of the other
 mindless objective games and got the 10 plants in an half hour. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My point is, there are only a few people playing these games and most play TDM. I don't understand why there aren't more variations of TDM, like snipers only. I hate using the sniper rifle because it's too hard with all the weapons out there. When I try
 to use a sniper I get blasted in the back with a shotgun or mowed down by a AK I just think...idiot. I actually admire the few players who kill me with a sniper...true skill!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think a TDM sniper only would be more popular that any of the objective matches, what you think?</p>

<p>I don't know if it would be more popular than regular TDM or even Barebones but I could see them adding that maybe, they have mixed around the gametypes a couple times already. Sniper rifles are not difficult to use, you just have to go by their strengths
 and weaknesses. Anything chest up is usually a kill. If you are ten feet from someone with an assault rifle don't shoot for the legs with a sniper and expect a kill. Switch to your pistol or shoot them high or run to a better location if you can. You also
 cant expect good results right away but do use the snipers regularly, while you are ranking up pick one or two maps and commit to using only the sniper rifle on those maps. My favorite one was Array and also Cracked. No attachments at all either, I'm 87% sure
 it reduces accuracy with any of them. I'm &nbsp;not great at it but those are my tips.

<p>regular TDM agree, but barebones disagree. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yeah ........... this game isnt really geared toward snipers. The new maps are a little better for it than the old ones, but even though treyarch was against quickscoping, they have a better chance than the straight up snipers..</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Just remember that sniping isnt a high volume tactic, and you can still have fun with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; You are also better in hc mode, but if you arent real good at it, dont try hc ffa, ....... too many spectators.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I believe they have a limited number of slots for game modes, but dont forget, you can always set up a private match and make your own rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I play mostly ffa and its pretty common to play a ranked match where most of the people in the lobby agree to certain rules ......... usually shottys and pistols ..... but snipers is common too.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Note that I said MOST ............ you almost always have at least one person who goes for an easy win using an ar or smg, but if you are in it for the fun, thats not really a big deal.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Its actually kind of surprising the willingness by most players, it usually just takes someone to suggest it and most of the time, the majority will agree.</p>

<p>About a week ago, a buddy of mine invited me to a private quickscoping match. &nbsp; I thought "Eh, not really going to enjoy this, but I'll give it a shot." &nbsp;It wasn't until halfway through the first match that I was made aware of the rules. &nbsp;</p>
<p>-Gold L96A1's only </p>
<p>-no tacticals, lethals, or equipment</p>
<p>-no killstreaks</p>
<p>-score limit set to 2500 (25 kills)</p>
<p>-last kill has to be executed after doing a 360 spin &nbsp;(&lt;~~~funny when you actually see it)</p>
<p>At this point, I have limited experience with a sniper rifle, but I had a blast. &nbsp; It wasn't about how many times I died or how many kills I had, it was just about the sheer fun of it all. &nbsp;And you could tell we were having fun, because everyone in the game
 was laughing uncontrollably the whole time. &nbsp;Good times. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you, Bravox. &nbsp;I don't really like the sniper while playing matched TDM random games. &nbsp;I played a few with friends and it was fun. &nbsp;Maybe there are only a few slots available 3arc to set up for public game play.</p>
<p>I think it would be better to replaced some of the mindless objective games for a sniper only TDM game. &nbsp;Look at the number of players who are playing S&amp;D, Demolition and the other one that is stupid. &nbsp;And they not even playing to win...not sure what they
 are trying to do. </p>
<p>Really, Snipers only would be a better slot. &nbsp;I don't even think the most hardcore objective gamer could argue with that. They have at least 3 already.

            Hi Akhilesh Das,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Microsoft Windows forum.<br />
<br />
<strong>You may try the following steps and check if it helps.</strong> <br />
<br />
1. Click Start &gt;&gt; type "Run"<br />
<br />
2. In the "run" command Type "services.msc"<br />
<br />
3. Then right click properties Windows Management Instrumentation service. <br />
<br />
4. Make sure that all the dependency services are started and then try starting the Windows Management Instrumentation service.<br />
<br />
If that does little help, try <strong>System File Checker (SFC) scan</strong> <br />
<br />
SFC scan describes how to use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7.<br />
<br />
If a Windows Resource Protection (WRP) file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected. For example, some Windows functions may not work, or Windows may crash. The System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) scans for missing or corrupted system
 files and repairs them.<br />
<br />
MORE INFORMATION<br />
<br />
Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password,
 or click Allow.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Type the following command, and then press ENTER:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sfc /scannow<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope it helps. <br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

                    <p>I own an Acer Aspire Computer 4315-2963.&nbsp;&nbsp; It contains Windows Vista Basic edition. This blue screen of death (as I learned it's called) popped up recently when I was using my Logitech Pro Quick Cam 9000.&nbsp; The beginning message regarding a problem being
 detected is basically the same as others posted with this exception:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check with hardware vendor for BIOS updates.&nbsp; Disable BIOS memory option such as caching or shadowing.&nbsp; Press F8 to select Advanced Startup options, and then select safe mode.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The camera&nbsp;works fine for a half hour to 45 minutes and then the blue screen appears.&nbsp; My AVG virus software detected a Trojan Virus which was placed into the vault box.&nbsp; I thought that took the care of the issue, but I was mistaken.&nbsp; I tried the Windows
 Repair option, but Vista was preloaded on my computer which I purchased in 2008.&nbsp; Point being, there is no disc/CD/DVD. The restore points I thought I had were not there as well.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice or guidance would be appriciated.&nbsp; Thank you in advance.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Praseetha K,</p>
<p>First, thank you for your response.&nbsp; However that didn't solve the issue.&nbsp; I upgraded the chipset as you directed but the BSOD still appeared.</p>
<p>However, it now shows PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>***lvuvc.sys - Address B54ABFD4 base at B5406000, Date stamp 4e4e2bao</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I researched this forum for solutions to that techincal issue, and that is what I am now working on.&nbsp; I was attempting to reinstall my webcam since that appears to be the heart of the issue. There seems to be something strange with uninstalling my Logitech
 Quickcam Pro 9000 software.&nbsp; Even though I've uninstalled&nbsp;Logitech&nbsp;from my Program list via the control panel, the icon and software folder are still on my desktop, and&nbsp;All Programs (from the START menu)&nbsp;respectively. I'll research that as well and see where
 that leads me.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is certainly puzzling to say the least.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
