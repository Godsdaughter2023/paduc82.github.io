            <p>You must login to your Yahoo email account through webmail.&nbsp; If you wish to DELETE your account, I would first delete the contents of all mail folders. Then delete all contacts.&nbsp; Then go to the Account section and delete the email address.&nbsp; It the Yahoo
 system does not let that happen, change the password to something complicated.&nbsp; You will have nothing at risk for the future, even if the account remains open.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, this is an over-reaction on your part.&nbsp; This hack occurred some years ago.&nbsp; As long as you have changed the password to a strong one in the last 2 years, you are not likely any longer at risk.&nbsp; Changing passwords more frequently than that is advised.</p>

<p>Caution if you laptop is under warranty do not remove the screws on the back of the laptop in my suggestion I will be making::::::::::::</p>
<p>
</p><p>Relation to rest of Windows 10 with your email: </p>
<p>
</p><p>"""Word of advice the reactivation does not happen immediately it depends on what was record on Microsoft system and what apps and files are to be reinstalled back on your system from Microsoft servers that can take from 1 minute to 24 hours ok.""""</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is my favourite issues hardware related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is dead give away (installer.exe- Bad image ) its always related to issue with updating hard ware driver but due to application being outdate like Adobe flash player its has been blocked from continuing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You state you got other issues going on which suggest to me you got hardware&nbsp;problem like something needs to be&nbsp;reseated correctly inside the laptop to failure piece of hardware like a fan etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As&nbsp;for system restore your really do have issues cause system restore would in this case would be good place to start,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>the only option is reset of windows operating system that in itself can also lead to issue with activation without a good registry back up and or external back up of your computer system with system image at time of activation was recorded you can be in
 trouble there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if you are using Windows 10 and at one staged used your email to activate your windows 10 you have a chance of doing reset of windows 10 with keeping your folders and apps only,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is like a refresh of windows 10 except you keep your current folders and apps, you then use your email account to reactivate windows 10 and hope to god Microsoft has record the information on there system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now from what I can see in&nbsp; your message you have multiple issue that suggests to me you do need to check first that your laptop
</p>
<p>
</p><p>-ram is firmly in its slot, </p>
<p>-cables are corrected to the hard drive and </p>
<p>-that your computer fan is&nbsp;working and staying&nbsp;on. </p>
<p>
</p><p>that requires manual, and screw drivers for removing the tiny little screws. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After you check that then proceed with checking third party software is up to date if you can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and just check to see if you get error message again if you do you make a hard decision on doing reset of windows 10 with keeping your apps and files and using your email to reactivate hope to god windows still has it recorded on there systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that is your best choice here forget all the other diagnostic and replacing files that creates more issues and if concern files require special permission you could totally lock your self out of that folder if you set the permission incorrectly. just
 do a reset of windows 10 prey for activation. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This will get you back to position you can determine if its truly failing hardware or software related hardware issue which appear to be case of hardware software related issue not update correctly corrupting other area's of the system files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck. just remember this even without activation of Windows 10 if you can get rid of those errors then you have 30 days to get reactivated a pain but a good place to be in after reset of Windows 10 it give you fresh start.</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back with some suggestions, the computer is a desk top Cyberpower pc only 3 months oldd</p>
<p>I was thinking it could be DLL file corruption I got a scan and that's what it came back with...But this is over my head.. But the installer error could I upload that from another computer and install that file in place of the error installer file, not from
 the same windows application tho... Also could I get a copy of the windows for free from Microsoft if I have my code, because it isent on the desktop anymore, restore point is gone all applications gone the only thing I thought to do was either buy a new windows
 10 package on a USB (if they have ) and upload that way, because downloading ofline its not letting me...Thanks any info would be a great help.. Thank you..</p>

<p>Hello John_Smith3,</p>
<p>Delphi 9 and Delphi 2010 are compatible with Windows 7, but are not manufactured by Borland. Delphi 4 seems to be an older version that is not compatible with Windows 7. You can try in Compatibility mode as Marcelo suggested.<br />
<br />
<span>If the program is not compatible, then you may try to install and run the program in compatibility mode.
</span></p>
<p><span>Use the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click on the Program</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Properties</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Compatibility tab
</span></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select Run this program in compatibility mode and select Windows Vista or whatever operating system the program was running successfully.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link here: Make older programs run in this version of Windows</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the compatibility is not successful, then try and run
</span><span>the</span><span> Program Compatibility troubleshooter:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the Program Compatibility troubleshooter by clicking the
<span>Start</span> button.</span></p>
<p><span>Then click <span>
Control Panel</span>. In the search box, type <span>troubleshooter</span>, and then click
<span>Troubleshooting</span>. Under <span>Programs</span>, click
<span>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</span>. </span>
</p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the instructions in the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>If you cannot install a program, insert the installation disc for the program and, using the troubleshooter, browse to the program's setup file, usually called Setup.exe, Install.exe, or something
 similar. The troubleshooter is not designed to work on programs that have an .msi file name extension.</span></p>
<p>You can check with Borland and see if they have any updates to your version to make it compatible.</p>
<p>Another option would be to use Windows XP mode and Virtual PC if you are running Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate.
<br />
(<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx</a>) and execute your software in Windows XP.</p>
<p>If you run Windows 7 Home Premium, try VirtualBox (<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.virtualbox.org</a>)&nbsp;or VMware Player (<a href="http://www.vmware.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.vmware.com</a>) and install a separate copy of Windows XP (either Home Edition or Professional)
 for that purpose.</p>
<p>Hope this helps to answer your questions.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Lan Realtek Issue&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new Compaq CQ58-214SL laptop. It came with preinstalled system (Windows 8). Afterwards I installed Windows and HP updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I have is with the Realtek PCIe FE Family Controller (Ethernet). In the device manager it is shown with a yellow triangle with an exclamation mark. In the device state it is stated:&nbsp;<span>Your computer's system firmware does not include enough
 information to properly configure and use this device. To use this device, contact your computer manufacturer to obtain a firmware or BIOS update. (Code 35).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Laptop has all system and hp updates installed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I tried the following to resolve the problem:</span></p>
<p><span>-</span><span>- several add/remove/reinstall of the Realtek drivers</span></p>
<p><span>- 2 different versions of Realtek drivers:&nbsp;<span>8.3.730.2012 and 8.20.815.2013 (from Realtek site).</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Wifi is working ok after Driver's update!</span></span></p>
<p>Realtek MUST release a new Driver version compatible with Windows 8.1! Or Windows must release a patch!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span><span>Any suggestions or solutions to the problem?</span></span></p>

<p>I would suggest that you try to update your BIOS to the latest version. As I unfortenately cant find you specific model when I do the search from Sweden I cant provide you with a direct link but visit
<a href="http://www.hp.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.hp.com</a> and try to browse to your models drivers page and upgrade you BIOS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After this try to reinstall your driver again for your Realtek.</p>

<h2>            Camera App Low resolution - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My camera is Logitech C920.</p>
<p>Last week, I could use the Camera app just fine. But in the last few days, the Camera app starts having problem.</p>
<p>It seems like the camera is zoomed in, and I have tried to zoom all the way out and it didn't work. So I'm thinking it's the resolution problem. I also have tried to uninstall and reinstall the device software, driver. As well as reinstalling the Camera
 App from app store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the Logitech Gaming Software, you can see the preview.<br />

            <p>I've had XBL for nearly 10 years.. For the first time ever I was banned for 2 days, and I wasn't given an exact reason why. I said one bad work via message, but I've never been banned in the past. There's no way it could've been anything else because all I've been playing is Siege and RL.. It was such a pathetic reason to ban if that was the case. I started out as a kid on Xbox 360 and I played multiplayer and was talked smack to.. But I personally didn't care about it and just let it be. They definitely should be spending more time looking at worse offenses that just a simple curse word or two every now and then.</p>

            <p>it isn't the problem playing nice, I play by the rules but games like overwatch and others have just a toxic community that get you banned. Some players get blocked so you don't have to play against them again because you rolled them or you got a teammate who did bad and block him and they get penalize and that ends up being Avoid me. It's not the person but the people on the game. This enforcement is too overpowered and needs a heavy nerf because it gives too much power to the player</p>

            Anybody that leaves Xbox solely because of the Enforcement system will be in for a rather rude awakening when they learn that PlayStation Network and Switch Online have very similar policies set up to protect their networks from toxic players. I understand
 the desire to defend oneself, but if your method of defense is to merely hurl insults back at the other player(s), you would be no better than they are. Rising above is preferable to escalating the fight.

<h2>            Microsoft Visual C&#43;&#43; Runtime Library error on startup or when I start Firefox after installing 2 windows updates.</h2>
                    This application has rewuested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way.<br />
Please contact the application's support team for more information.<br />

This error started recently after installing 2 Microsoft updates.<br />
It occurs either on startup or when I start Firefox.<br />

Why on earth doesn't it say what application is making the request?<br />
I have no clue as to what the application is.&nbsp; So how can I possibly fix it?<br />

            <p><span>Hi Henry,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Which updates did you try to install?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These errors can be mostly caused by two factors:</span></p>
<p><span>&gt; Runtime components of Visual C++ Libraries are missing.
</span></p>
<p><span>&gt; Software problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>Try installing the latest Microsoft Visual C++redistributable package and check for the issue. First, you may want to see
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>For 32 bit:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=a7b7a05e-6de6-4d3a-a423-37bf0912db84" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download details: Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86)</a></span></p>
<p><span>For 64 bit:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=bd512d9e-43c8-4655-81bf-9350143d5867" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download details: Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x64)</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span>You can also try performing a clean boot and check for the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer the following KB article to put the computer in clean boot:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot
 in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span></p>
<p><span>After the trouble shooting steps please refer to clean boot link to put the computer back to normal start up mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

<h2>            Computer Management will not run in Windows XP Pro</h2>
                    I am constantly getting the error box that states "Computer Management is not&nbsp;available&nbsp;on this system" no matter if I run the command line, use administrative tools or right click on "My Computer" and select manage from the list of options.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The computer has been scanned for viruses (negative results) with MalwareBytes, Avast and an online scan from McAfee with all showing a clean bill of&nbsp;health.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am running Windows XP Pro with service pack 3. &nbsp;The computer has 1gb of memory and an 160gb of hard disk with a dual core cpu. &nbsp;It runs well with other OS&nbsp;versions&nbsp;that boot from CD (live disks) without issues, but continues to have problems with "users"
 under XP trying to view / change anything from Computer Management or the Control Panel "Users and Groups" applet.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have three users (Admin, User1 and User2) with only the Administrator having full administrator&nbsp;privileges, the others have limited user status that is further defined under "users and groups" in the management console. &nbsp;The users have quite a bit of
 data stored on the disks so a re-install is not a favorable option if it turns out to be destructive.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am open to suggestions / comments that are helpful and constructive in nature.</div>

    <title>Best Format &#40;AVI vs WMV&#41; to Stream Movies to XBOX 360 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> insub  say:</h3>
<h2>            Best Format &#40;AVI vs WMV&#41; to Stream Movies to XBOX 360</h2>
                    
<p>Although, I have been able to get movies to stream to my Xbox 360. I would have thought that the WMV format would work best since it is streaming from a Win 7 PC wired LAN (360 also wired) to a Microsoft product. But, while the image looks better in WMV
 the video playback has a slight stutter every 3-5 seconds. On the other hand, my AVI files look pretty good and seem to stream without a problem.</p>
<p>I am using Freemake to encode the video files. Surround Sound is essential to me, because I could always put the DVD disc in, so I want my streaming experience to be the same (or nearly) as watching directly from disc.</p>
<p>Freemake AVI setting: Frame Size (Original), Video Codec (MPEG4), 30 fps, Bitrate (Auto), Audio Codec (AC3, 5.1, Original Sample Rate, 320 Kbps)</p>
<p>Freemake WMV setting:&nbsp;Frame Size (Original), Video Codec (WMV3), 30 fps, Bitrate (Auto), Audio Codec (WMA Pro, 5.1, Original Sample Rate, Auto&nbsp;Bitrate)</p>
<p>Do you have the same experience?</p>
<p>What is the best encode settings you have found (must support 5.1 surround)?</p>
<p>Do you use another video converter (preferably free or cheap) that you believe gives better results?</p>
<p>I have watched my files using Windows Media Center and the System Video Player via Zune, Plex, and directly from PC and haven't noticed any advantages to one over the other regarding playback quality. I prefer Plex as it shows the movie artwork automatically,
 but I think I have the settings for it wrong and it is trying to transcode on the fly which makes the playback horrendous (have had excellent results with MP4s but only with stereo audio). I like the playback controls of the System player much more than in
 WMC.</p>
<p>Do you know a way to get WMC to find movie artwork automatically?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help!</p>
<p>BTW: If you are reading this and thinking of trying Freemake, then I must warn you that it will attempt to install adware (AdLoad OpenCandy) with it's program installer. AVG Free was able to stop it in its tracks and Freemake works fine without the adware.
 Otherwise, Freemake appears to be an excellent converter. It is capable of many more formats than Handbrake (also fantastic free software). But, Handbrake is incapable of creating AVI or WMV files.</p>

<p>The video stutter in my WMV files appears to be induced by the conversion by FreeMake. I put the WMV file onto a USB flash drive and it performed exactly the same as when I streamed it. The stutter is more like every 1-2 seconds. The video quality is fair-poor
 especially on scenes where the camera is panning.</p>
<p>The AVI files from FreeMake do not have the stutter, but the quality is mediocre as well. Almost identical to the WMV files it makes. There is very noticeable compression blocking during fast moving and especially panning camera scenes. Scenes where the
 camera is mostly still look acceptable, but not as good as watching the DVD itself.</p>
<p>Also, FreeMake adds a FreeMake.com logo screen to very end of your file. It's not really offensive, but it is there at the end for 5 seconds or so.</p>
<p>I noticed that DVDFab's video preset for Xbox 360 uses H.264 video in the AVI container, which is not identified as a compatible format on Microsoft's page:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/system/audio-video-playback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../audio-video-playback</a> . I am going to give that a try in FreeMake to see if a better quality AVI file results and will still play.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 blue screen with HYPERVISOR_ERROR after changing hardware</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please read everything I'm about to write before jumping to any conclusions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been running Hyper-V for years on my computer without any issue. I use it to run a Vagrant VM that handles a Docker environment.</p>
<p>Yesterday I changed my hardware and I'm starting to experience BSOD with the message HYPERVISOR_ERROR.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My new hardware is the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel core i9 9900k</p>
<p>Asus Prime Z390-A</p>
<p>Kingston Hyper-X DDR4 16GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>My windows edition is up to date. I don't use any other antivirus than windows defender and this machine is basically running on a DMZ.</p>
<p>Intel VT-X is obviously enabled because the system works for some time and just ends up in a BSOD seemingly randomly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My CPU has an average temperature of 30C to 40C, it never jumps any higher than 50C so it does not seem to originate from any sort of overheating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't provide any minidump as the bluescreen itself just hangs doing nothing and being stuck at 0%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm all open to help and suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot in advance!</p>

<h2>            iTunes will not install Error &#34;HRESULT&#58; 0x80073715</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if you guys could help me out with an error that not Windows Support or Apple Support have been able to fix for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I install iTunes I get this error&nbsp;https://imgur.com/edit?deletehash=JysOiter4ZyyIch . I understand it is iTunes, but it is not a Apple related issue, I can promise you that. I really don't know what to do at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated,</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>I had the same problem on a clean install of Windows 10. None of the suggestions I found worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disabled my antivirus, installed every 2005 run-time I could find.</p>
<p>Ran a registry cleaner.</p>
<p>Ran CCleaner</p>
<p>Installed .net framework.</p>
<p>Updated my system.</p>
<p>Tried unpacking the iTunes installer and installing it there.</p>
<p>The problem remained.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tech support for both Apple and Microsoft ARE correct. The problem IS the 2005 run-time libraries being properly installed.</p>
<p>However, simply installing the new ones does not fix it. You have to uninstall the old ones and ONLY install the newest 2005 runtimes. Otherwise, iTunes will use the older versions installed and fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is how I fixed it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Add/Remove programs and uninstall ALL the 2005 Visual C++ Runtime libraries. I had like 7 I had to uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, install ONLY these two files:&nbsp;</p>
<p>vcredist_x64.EXE</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>vcredist_x86.EXE</p>
<p>
</p><p>from</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=26347</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, when I ran the vcredist installer it never actually said it finished installing. It just showed a progress bar and after a few seconds disappeared. But I saw the installations appear in the Add/Remove programs list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, iTunes installed perfectly.</p>

            <p>Both versions of EW4, the discontinued paid and free, work in Win 8.0 and 8.1 without issue. The requirements listed on the MS link was created prior to Win 8 and since it has been discontinued has not been updated. I don't believe you can remove Super Preview
 as it appears on the one system that only has ever had the free version installed. The online component of SP is no longer available, but the local appears to still work. Haven't used SP in ages as it's faster to just preview in browsers installed on the local
 machine.</p>

            Thanks, Iv'e found that if I don't have any devices plugged into the USB 3.0 ports then the PC doesn't crash. Could this just be a simple driver issue?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand, the computer freezes after you plug the USB devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply to these questions, to understand the issue better:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Does it happen with any particular USB device?</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Have you tried with different USB ports?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us try the following methods:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Try with different USB ports, to know if any of the ports is causing the issue.</p>
<p>You may also try the USB device on a different computer and see if the same thing happens there as well.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong><span>Steps to place the computer in clean boot and check:<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>a) Press the <strong>‘Windows + R’</strong> key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the <strong>‘Run’</strong> windows type <strong>’MSCONFIG’</strong> and click
<strong>‘Ok’</strong>.<br />
c) Click the <strong>‘Boot’</strong> tab and uncheck <strong>‘Safe Boot’</strong> option (if checked).<br />
d) On the <strong>‘General’</strong> tab, click to select the option <strong>‘Selective startup’</strong>, and then click to clear the option
<strong>Load startup items</strong> check box.<br />
e) On the <strong>‘Services’</strong> tab, click to select the <strong>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</strong> check box, and then click
<strong>‘Disable all’</strong>.<br />
f) On the <strong>‘Startup’</strong> tab, click ‘<strong>Open Task Manager’. </strong>
In the<strong> Task Manager window </strong>under<strong> startup tab, </strong>right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<strong>Disable’.<br />
</strong>f) Click <strong>‘OK’</strong>, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:<br />
<br />
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.<br />
a) Press the <strong>‘Windows + R’</strong> key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the <strong>‘Run’</strong> windows type <strong>’MSCONFIG’</strong> and click
<strong>‘Ok’</strong>.<br />
c) On the <strong>‘General’</strong> tab, click the <strong>‘Normal Startup’</strong> option, and then click
<strong>‘OK’</strong>.<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click <strong>‘Restart’</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps, let us know the status of the issue.</span></p>

I have not found this feature. it was nice to run IE as an app then use the "play to" feature to watch on my Samsung TV as well as other media apps. It seems to be missing entirely or replaced by screen mirroring which doesn't work on Samsung TVs

            <p>I like to do a similar thing onto my Xbox but when I click connect to connect to device only my Bluetooth speaker shows up and nothing else.&nbsp;The cast to device does work from file explorer but I want to be able to play to my Xbox from an app or from internet
 and I cant. I can't even play from my OneDrive to Xbox as I can't see my online only folders.</p>
<p>There are quite a few things wrong with win10 </p>

            <p>i got the mouse to work by installing a new driver -the MS Fix - it popped up while trouble shooting -the pop up msg said MS Fix-it was not supported by Windows 10</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem. USB mouse not working. I have tried 3 different models and&nbsp;</p>
<p>non work. When first plugged in the notification acknowledges it and it will even load a&nbsp;</p>
<p>driver if it is a new device but as soon as it recognizes it is a mouse the usb port will drop power</p>
<p>to the mouse( lights will go off on mouse). The mouse I was using when this all started has&nbsp;</p>
<p>lost its driver and windows cannot find the driver with the look online or windows update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is almost like it is not looking at all because it is almost an instant cannot find driver&nbsp;</p>
<p>message. This is insane...... All other usb devices work fine, it is only affecting usb pointing devices.</p>
<p>my keyboard and touchpad are working fine. I have uninstalled the mouse and restarted my pc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have done all the steps to fix this and nothing is working. Reading online forums that a full</p>
<p>windows install is the only thing to correct this. You have got to be kidding me........</p>

            I had no choice but to reset the system and reinstalled a few apps. This works for me instead of having all the headaches trying to solve the problem&nbsp; without losing my apps. It's not necessary to reinstall window which takes much longer.<br />

    <title>ASUS windows 10 no audio devices installed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fishhorizontal  say:</h3>
<h2>            ASUS windows 10 no audio devices installed</h2>
                    <p>Hello guys, a few days ago I plugged in my mic to my laptop and there was some strong background noises, so I kept plugging and unplugging the mic from the laptop. After like 2 or 3 tries, the mic went soundless completely, I clicked 'troubleshoot sound
 problems', then the system said audio device is not functioning properly or something along that line and recommended me to uninstall the audio device, I clicked yes then my audio device&nbsp;was uninstalled,&nbsp;after which with or without mic and earpiece, my laptop
 went completely soundless :( </p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I googled online for solutions and they suggest go to 'device manager' - 'sound, video and game controller' -&nbsp;disable and enable your audio device again but it didn't work, my audio device 'Intel(R) Displayed Audio' is still there not uninstalled under
 device manager, but why when I click 'sound' it still says no audio device installed? What should I do now? Do I uninstall 'Intel(R) Displayed Audio' and reinstall again? Where to download it again if I uninstalled it? I didn't save any system backups so I
 can't recover my laptop too :(</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for providing us the opportunity to assist you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per the issue description you are facing issue with sound&nbsp;on your&nbsp;Windows 10 computer. This could be if the drivers get corrupted or not installed properly. This could also be if the audio service is not running properly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue could have also occurred due to these reasons:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>If dependency services are not running.</span></li><li><span>Corrupt audio drivers.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try the steps listed here and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Let's run Audio Troubleshooter and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
a) Press the ‘<strong><span>Windows + W’ </span></strong>key on the <strong><span>keyboard</span></strong>.<br />
<br />
b) Type <strong><span>troubleshooter </span></strong>in the <strong><span>search box
</span></strong>and then press <strong><span>enter</span></strong>.<br />
<br />
c) Click <strong><span>hardware and sound </span></strong>and click on ‘<strong><span>Playing Audio’</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><span>If the issue persists, I would suggest you to check if the audio dependency services are started and their
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Press <strong><span>Windows Key +R.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>b. Type <strong><span>Services.msc</span></strong> and hit <strong><span>Enter</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Scroll down through the list and find the following services.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Plug and Play</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Multimedia Class Scheduler</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows Audio Endpoint Builder</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>d. <strong><span>Double-click</span></strong> on the services one by one and check if the services are
<strong><span>started</span></strong> and startup type is <strong><span>automatic</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try to update Audio drivers from the computer manufacturer website, I would suggest you to try the same. Check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>An audio driver is a type of computer file used by a computer’s operating system (OS) to recognize and properly interact with an audio device. It usually refers to a driver used for sound cards within a computer, but can also be used in reference to
 drivers necessary for especially complex sound systems or audio input devices as well. An audio driver may come with a piece of audio hardware or may be downloaded or updated through the Internet. T</span><span>ry to update the Display drivers by following
 the steps provided in the article mentioned below.</span></p>

 </blockquote> <p>I've done that already, numerous times, and it's still not working. I'm on a brand new PC (literally bought it 5 days ago), with the highest internet connection my ISP provides, and nothing else in my house, from our phones, to our TV's and even my son's ps4 is having a problem connecting. Nothing else on the PC has trouble connecting, its literally just bingo, which would suggest the problem is not on my end at all.</p>

<p>
</p><p>What version of windows 10 do you exactly have? In my case, the problem is that my Windows10 version (Home Single Language) doesn't include virtualization capabilities. You need a Professional o Enterprise version for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check if this apply in your case.</p>

<h2>            windows 7 backup, I&#47;O error</h2>
                    I've been trying to backup my windows 7 computer and each time I do it I get an I/O error. I read other posts, and so I've run chkdsk and I have no restore points. Anything else I can do? My laptop is a lenovo laptop that's only 6 months old.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 2016 Server Error 0x00000003 when connecting printer to workstation</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Windows server 2016 has two printers installed VIA TCP/IP.<br />
Workstations include Windows 7 and Windows 10 machines all x64 bit.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
1st printer is a Xerox Work Centre 7830 with a Work Centre 7830 PostScript Driver installed.<br />
The printer is installed on the Windows server and prints from the server.&nbsp;I have shared the printer on the server and have listed it in the directory. There are additional drivers that should allow the printer to connect to a x64 device.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I try and connect
 to the printer through the directory it finds the printer,&nbsp;<br />
starts to look for a driver and then fails with error code 0x00000003. This happens on all x64 bit machines both Windows 7 and Windows 10.<br />
<br />
The 2nd printer, is a SHARP MX-C300P that is installed on the 2016 server, and shared over the directory. It has a generic Microsoft PCL 6 driver. When I try and connect the printer to a windows 7 machine,I get the same 0x00000003 error. When I try to connect
 the printer to a Windows 10 machine the printer connects just fine. I have looked over all of the settings and everything seems to be working.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I have Googled this error and nothing has worked to fix it. I can provide more information but really need this fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Thanks</p>
