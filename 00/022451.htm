<h2>            I can&#39;t type in the text field boxs in internet explorer 9 on Windows 7</h2>
                    I just bought an Asus laptop and it has windows 7. When I open internet explorer 9, it won't let me type (letters or numbers) in any of the field boxes.
<br />
It only allows me to type into the URL field box. I just downloaded Firefox and It is allowing me to type in all the text fields. Which means my keyboard is perfectly fine. This problem is only occurring in internet explorer 9. I have searched for a solution
 on this website, but got no luck. <br />
Also, I wanted to say I do not have Constant Guard installed.<br />
Please help me get this resolved I really enjoy using Internet Explorer.<br />

            Hi,
<ol>
<li>Were you not able to type anything outside address bar for a single time? </li><li>Have you installed any third-party toolbar?</li></ol>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong><br />
<br />
Boot into safe mode with networking and check.</div>
<div>Some options, such as safe mode, start Windows in a limited state, where only the bare essentials are started. If a problem doesn't reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers and services as possible
 causes.<br />
<br />
Follow this below provided link to start your computer in safe mode.<br />
<br />
<strong>Advanced startup options (including safe mode)<br />

<br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
<br />
If it works fine in safe mode with networking then perform a clean boot.<br />
<br />
To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.<br />

            Have the exact same issue here. Asus computer, IE9 Windows 7 and can't type into the fields on a web page (Im using chrome to type this now)
<div><br />
<div>The information above is not helpful. This is a brand new computer, nothing has been installed on it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The problem does disappear on a reboot, however it then happens again after a few minutes browsing. I do not know what triggers the issue but suddenly it will not be possible to type anything into a webpage.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Performing a reboot is not a viable solution. If there is not a solution I will need to return this computer despite how much I like it.</div>

 I ever saw. I will try running in safe mode and see if it still happens. By the way, is it possible that I am accidentally typing a keyboard shortcut that locks browser fields? Does Win 7 have that as an option?<br />

<p>Which anti-virus software are you using?</p>
<div><span>I would also suggest you to download and run the latest Microsoft Safety Scanner on your computer and check if it helps:</span>

<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>

<p>no - this isn't helpful.</p>
<p>anytime you reboot it will work for a few minutes - so you don't need safe made or reset.</p>

            We have an ASUS UX31A. Less than a month old with all the Windows patches installed and running MSE. My wife has the laptop and she is out of town, but I got her to reboot in safe mode w/ networking and she reported that the problem didn't happen. We suspected
 the touchpad and my wife tried a few things and now is able to unlock the IE fields without rebooting. You'll have to fiddle with the touchpad, but try this: Start with one finger on the left side of the touchpad and one on the right side. Then slide them
 together to the center and back out. That's what works for her. Also, in light of this, I would recommend upgrading to the latest version of the touchpad driver.<br />

<h2>            Office Activations, over limit yet.....</h2>
                    I currently have three machines showing in my account as activated yet with&nbsp;two activations available I try to add a fourth&nbsp;and I get the message "you have reached your limit, you must deactivate a machine before you can activate this one". Maybe not exact
 wording but the message is clear, when I do deactivate one of the three machines in the list I am able to activate the newer machine. So it would seem I have more machines activated than are being listed as activated on the 365 webpage. Has anyone seen this
 before and know of a working solution besides the obvious call to MS and waste half a day with someone on the phone? Ah the world of Windows and it's ability to keep me employed with sixteen years of flaws.

            As stated the website shows 3 machines activated. When I try to activate a fourth (which I just&nbsp;did this morning), I now get a popup that I have activated 10 machines and I need to deactivate one to continue to activate the current machine I am on. How
 can I deactivate a machine that is not in the displayed list of activated machines? The ones that are listed I want to keep activated and I don't know what the other 7 machines are. And why if I have a license for 5 max, why am I seeing 10 machines as activated?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Can&#39;t format shape using inches&#47;percent in the format shape dialogue in PowerPoint 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using PowerPoint 2013.&nbsp; I created a table and want to edit the table width.&nbsp; I can do this by just dragging the edge of the shape.&nbsp; But what I'd like to do is change the table height and width using the text entry under "format shape" (this&nbsp;is useful
 for making sure all&nbsp;my tables are exactly the same size).&nbsp; However, I can't do this.&nbsp; I see the numbers, but when I click on the arrow to change the number or try to type in a new number, the number just blinks and doesn't change.&nbsp; The number does change if
 I drag the table to alter its size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think this might apply to other shapes too, but right now I'm just dealing with tables.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<div>Sub SetRowColSizes()</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim oTbl As Table</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim oSh As Shape</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim oCol As Column</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Set oTbl = ActiveWindow.Selection.ShapeRange(1).Table</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; With oTbl</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ' make each column 1" (72 points) wide</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For x = 1 To .Columns.Count</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Columns(x).Width = 72</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Next</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ' or give individual columns special treatment:</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Columns(2).Width = 144</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Can&#39;t copy a graph from excel to word</h2>
                    <p>First, I can copy the graph to a new word document I just created. The problem is that I have to copy my graph to an existing word document that I downloaded from my school and I won't appear fully. Only a part of the graph is visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see on the ScreenShot, only the very bottom of the graph is visible and It can't be moved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched the web for several day and even contacter the microsoft support but they told me they don't support this request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using word for mac 2011</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>I believe the problem is that your chart was created using the newer tools provided by Office 2008 &amp; later, which make it a Microsoft Office Drawing Object. You're pasting it into a document which is saved using the old .<em>doc</em> file type which doesn't
 support the requird level of graphics sophistication.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have at least several options;</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <strong>Edit&gt; Paste Special</strong> in Word to paste as a <em>Microsoft Excel Chart Object</em>,
<em>Picture</em>, or <em>PDF</em>, <em>or</em></li><li>In Excel, select the chart, hold <strong>Shift</strong> while you open the <strong>
Edit</strong> menu, then choose <strong>Copy Picture</strong>, <em>or</em></li><li>In Excel, <em>right-click</em> the chart, choose <strong>Save as Picture</strong>, then in Word use
<strong>Insert&gt; Photo&gt; Picture from File</strong>, <em>or</em></li><li>In Excel, select the chart &amp; choose <strong>Edit&gt; Copy to Scrapbook</strong>, then in Word select the item in the
<strong>Scrapbook</strong> pane of the <strong>Toolbox</strong> &amp; use the <strong>
Paste</strong> button below the list of Scrapbook items, <em>or</em></li><li>In Word, before pasting, use <strong>File&gt; Convert Document</strong> to update the file type or use
<strong>Save As</strong> to create a new version in the document using the current .docx file type. [IMHO, this is the preferable alternative for a number of reasons.]</li></ul>
<p>Note that each option may render a somewhat different level of quality, so you may have to experiment with several in order to determine which you like best.</p>

<h2>            Issues editing cells containing large amounts of texts</h2>
                    <p>Hi all here comes my strange issue.</p>
<p>We have a large excel 2010 document that is giving us some issues.</p>
<p>Im now making some assumptions that i think have been filtered out during many trial and error sessions, but if there is some question you have i will get back to you asap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are intending to edit one of our cells that contains a lot of text.</p>
<p>In this text "<span>Verify that: base value =&nbsp;</span><strong>2300</strong><span>.</span>"
 we want to change 2300 to 23400</p>
<p>
</p><p>We enter the cell and place the marker after 23 and press 4</p>
<p><span>result: "value =&nbsp;</span><strong>244300"</strong><br />
</p>
<p>Press enter</p>
<p>result: <span>
"value =&nbsp;</span><strong>24300"</strong></p>
<div>
<p>As you can imagine it can be a task to edit text when you dont know where the text will end up and not even sure what text is actually in the cell util you press enter and then you
 always need to try and fix all the new issues you have created.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment we have to copy out all the text to change them in any text program and then copy in all the text in the cell again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope any of you can help us get rid of this issue</p>
<p>//Joshen</p>

</p><p>The best way for us to help is to get you to upload the file (or a file with confidential data removed) to a file share site like OneDrive and tell us the link</p>

            <p>Glad it was an easy fix!</p>
<p>
</p><p>One concern I'd have is that every table should - I'd almost say MUST - have a required Primary Key field. If your table had such a field, then it would not be possible to have a totally blank row. And that's only one minor reason among many more important
 ones to require a primary key!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck with your database and don't hesitate to come back with more questions if you have problems.</p>

    <title>Excel Macro with Media Player - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hard_ware_guy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Macro with Media Player</h2>
                    I’m running Windows 7 with Excel 2007. I’ve created a simple macro that plays and audio wav file that is an embedded object within the worksheet.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the macro runs, Media Player opens and plays the embedded audio file just fine.&nbsp; However, when the
 macro is done, Media Player stays in the foreground covering the Excel worksheet.&nbsp; I already have the Media Player option “Keep Now Playing on top of other windows” un-checked, but Media Player only moves to the background when the user intervenes with a keyboard
 entry or mouse click.&nbsp; How can I get the macro to re-establish the Excel worksheet in the foreground?

 a screen pops up saying sync now tap that

<p>Hi DeeJay,<br />
<br />
This can be caused by a folder in the mailbox that contains an ASCII code that is smaller than 32 (for example, a tab, a carriage return line feed (CRLF) break, or a new line). Use either one or both of the following methods:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 1: Empty the Deleted Items folder.</strong></span> </p>
<ol>
<li>In Microsoft Outlook or Outlook Web App, right-click the&nbsp;<strong>Deleted Items</strong>&nbsp;folder.</li><li>In the drop-down menu, click&nbsp;<strong>Empty Folder</strong>.<br />
<span><br />
<strong>Note</strong></span>&nbsp;If you use Outlook in Cached Exchange Mode, make sure that Outlook synchronizes before you try to synchronize your device again.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2: Rename the problem folder</strong></span> </p>
<ol>
<li>In Outlook or Outlook Web App, locate and right-click the problem folder.</li><li>In the drop-down menu, click&nbsp;<strong>Rename</strong>.</li><li>Type a new name for the folder, and then press Enter.</li><li>Repeat steps 1 through 3 for any folders that meet the criteria that are described in the "Cause" section.</li><li>On the Windows Phone 8 device, tap&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>, tap&nbsp;<strong>email + accounts</strong>, and then press and hold the account. For example, if your Exchange Server account is called&nbsp;<strong>Contoso</strong>, press and hold&nbsp;<strong>Contoso</strong>.</li><li>Tap&nbsp;<strong>sync</strong>&nbsp;in the drop-down menu that appears.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to get back to us if you have other concerns.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Jean,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community!</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When exactly do you receive the error message?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does this issue occur while accessing particular content on the webpage?</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Step 1:<span>&nbsp;
</span>Run Internet Explorer in No Add-Ons mode to check for the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click Start. Click All Programs.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click Internet Explorer (No Add-Ons). Internet Explorer opens without add-ons, toolbars, or plug-ins.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Test to verify that it works correctly.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Step 2:<span>&nbsp;
</span>If it works fine then use the Manage Add-ons tool to determine which add-on is causing the issue</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click Tools, and then click Manage Add-ons.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the Show drop-down menu, select All add-ons to display all add-ons that are installed on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For each item in this list, select the add-on, and then click Disable in the Information window.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When you have disabled all the items in this list, click OK.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Exit and then restart Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If issues do not reoccur, repeat steps 1 through 3.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>h.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click Enable for a single add-on.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Refer: Internet Explorer add-ons: frequently asked questions</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Internet-Explorer-add-ons-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Internet-Explorer-add-ons-frequently-asked-questions</a></span></p>
<p>Also applies to Windows XP</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2:
</span></p>
<p><span>a) You may uninstall Java completely from your machine.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/uninstall_java.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.java.com/en/download/help/uninstall_java.xml</span></a></p>
<p><span>b) Thereafter, download &amp; install the latest Java software from this link and check if the issue persists.</span></p>

<h2>            I wish I had never heard of 10. I want my windows with word 7 back and I want my task bars to stay put.</h2>

 fine but this my computer and I pay the bill. I use my word to write my books, poetry and it helps me fill up my day. You have taken all my pleasure out of using my computer. I have lost almost all of my pictures and my poetry' Also if I find a poem I can't
 print it because&nbsp;it is some weird unreadable mess. I think they put it in hml. Somebody have a heart. I surely don't have a lot of years left but please let me enjoy what I have left . I paid for a home and school office 7. You took it off and I still have
 the program and you want let me put it back in. I realize that many people, especially the young folk, wants all of theses up dates but I am sure there are just as many seniors who feel like I do. So Please Help, Kathryn

<p>If you suspect you have malware, or something else uninvited. &nbsp; use these tools from bleepingcomputer (they are relatively quick): &nbsp;<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/</a>&nbsp;(the
 other two (2) suggested tools are on the bottom of that page), like rkill (1), jrt (2), and adwcleaner (3) (run all of them, in that sequence)(i put them on the desktop, and run them from there)(as administrator (right click)). &nbsp;Uninstall adwcleaner, after
 running it and the system has rebooted, by opening the program, and choosing the uninstall button, or its quarantined files may set off your antivirus. The other tools from bleepingcomputer can be safely deleted, after running them; they are updated often,
 so the old versions are not necessary. After running the tools, if they found anything, you need to reset your browsers to default, then check for any unfamiliar plugin/addins within the browser. then run malwarebytes &nbsp;again.<br />
</p>
<p>in a lot of instances, &nbsp;you have to remove the malicious activity one layer at a time, so you may not want to delete the tools after the first run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run Malwarebytes (Free):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/</a><br />
</p>
<p>uncheck the box at the end of the install for trial, or convert to free at the end of the trial.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Malwarebyes is a good addition to your antivirus software.&nbsp;<strong>Make sure in Malwarebytes the 'Scan for rootkits' box is checked-&gt; Settings-Detection and Protection</strong>. &nbsp;Free means manual, so, you have to open it, and run it occasionally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>geek uninstaller can help to uninstall programs that are unusual, it works on 32-bit and x64 programs (and it stays free)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.geekuninstaller.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.geekuninstaller.com/download</a></p>
<p>only get the free version.</p>
<p>right click on the program in geek, will let you force uninstall, without running the apps native uninstaller (only use the force method, if the installed program is malicious, or will not uninstall normally).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Try HerdProtect (free), &nbsp;<a href="http://www.herdprotect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.herdprotect.com/</a>&nbsp; ,be watchful of false positives, only remove unchecked items at the end (by putting a check in the box), if they reside in a
 temp type folder or you are sure about them, remember to run it again in a few hrs(per mfg instructions). &nbsp;I generally uninstall HerdProtect after a few weeks, as it's cache gets large fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>***Pre-installed or user previously installed antivirus may inhibit the current antivirus, use the mfg removal tools to completely remove them, if they were ever on your system.***<br />

 On); &nbsp;or network harddrive can be used (make a 'FileHistory' folder on the Network Harddrive to connect the app to).... If you keep things in non-standard places, make new Libraries, and add the folders to your custom Libraries. Check to see where quicken
 , printer scan-to folders, or any other user installed software is saving data. &nbsp;(You can backup quicken/intuit programs to a OneDrive folder, but&nbsp;<em>do not</em>&nbsp;let database files reside in OneDrive; &nbsp;although, they can be included in Libraries (and probably
 already are), they will not backup when open. &nbsp;(some (other) databases can not be restored easily from raw data alone).</p>

            Under File &gt; Import select Entourage information from an archive or earlier version.<br />
Select Entourage archive (.rge)<br />
<br />
However, I suggest you use the option "Entourage 2004" to get all your data including your accounts, rules, sigs and categories for calendar events, tasks and notes.<br />
<br />
If your Entourage 2004 data is corrupt you won't get a complete export.<br />

<h2>            The random blue screen of death</h2>
                    <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4b0bc237-1eb9-41d6-9f49-eb3d11150f93" />&nbsp;My motherboard is a Gigabyte 990FX-UD3 and a 3 gig graphics card&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My question is i have randomly gotten this blue screen twice now and it has done it randomly i have been unable to recreate it the first time was when i was watching Netflix a week ago and the last time was yesterday when i was playing titian fall. I looked
 up why computers get blue screens and most cases it is the RAM but i do not believe that this time it is my ram but the OS i am running windows 10 i actually have never had this problem before with any other computer. This PC is brand new i just made it 2
 weeks ago all brand new parts as well, now i am not saying that it cant be the RAM there is a chance that it is but i have high doughts and think it is more likely windows 10 it self. &nbsp;I also think this because if it is a RAM issue i do not think that i would
 get the blue screen because of Netflix i mean come on it is Netflix.<br />
So my question is, can i confirm&nbsp;this? and has anyone else had this problem on OS 10?

                    <p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I am having trouble presenting PowerPoint (15.18) presentations on my MacBook Air (Early 2015). When I go to Slide Show -&gt; Play from Start, or when I click on the shortcut presentation button at the bottom of my document, I get presenter's view on my mac book
 but no slide show on the external display. My background image DOES display on the external display. So the computer and monitor are communicating appropriately. My computer is selected as the controlling display. When I go to Slide Show -&gt; Set up show, the
 external monitor is selected for display. The only way I can figure out how to display the presentation is to select "Swap Displays" from presenter's view, and then go to the external display and select swap displays to switch them back. One other weird thing.
 If I mouse over the main presentation slide while in presenter's view on my laptop (nothing but the background image showing on the external display) the presentation gets confused and tried to show the presenter's view AND the presentation both on my laptop.
 Help! PowerPoint slides are an important part of my job, and this is really getting annoying.</p>

    <title>When is Microsoft going to enable two-way synchronization between - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> user_333  say:</h3>
<h2>            When is Microsoft going to enable two-way synchronization between Android and Outlook.com&#39;s &#34;People&#34; module&#63;</h2>
                    Two way sync presently exists for Email and Calendar, but not Contacts (i.e. Outlook.com's People module). &nbsp;Why not?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>Based on my experience, here's what you can/can't do with your Outlook.com account on an Android device:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- Receive/Read/Compose/Send/Forward Email - yes (Hotmail or Outlook.com app preferred)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- View Contacts* - yes</div>
<div>- Edit Contacts* - no</div>
<div>- Add Contacts* - no</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- View Appointments* - yes</div>
<div>- Edit Appointments* - yes</div>
<div>- Add Appointments* - yes</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- View To Do Items* - no</div>
<div>- Edit To Do Items* - no</div>
<div>- Add To Do Items* - no</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tested this with both Gingerbread and Jelly Bean using the Outlook.com app with auto synchronizing enabled. &nbsp;Actions denoted with an asterisk ("*") were tested using the native Android contact and calendar apps, as applicable.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If the intent is to provide a genuine alternative to Google, then this is going to be a big issue for most converts who want to use the new Outlook.com.</div>

            I found a work around to my own question. &nbsp;Instead of using either the Hotmail or Outlook app to manage my account I setup my Outlook.com account as an Exchange Active Sync account in the systems settings on my Android devices. &nbsp;When I did that, the stock
 android apps for email, contacts and calendar all function with true 2-way sync capabilities between my devices and Outlook.com.
<div><br />
<div>Here's how to do it:
<div><br />
<div>1. Uninstall the Hotmail or Outlook.com app, as applicable.</div>
<div>2. Follow the instructions in the link provided below.</div>
<div><br />
<div>http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-access-hotmail-and-outlook-com-on-your-android-device/</div>
<div><br />
<div>PS &nbsp;I did encounter some issues synchronizing contacts from Outlook.com to my Android devices. &nbsp;More specifically, not all of my contacts appear on my device. &nbsp;I'm still trying to resolve that issue.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>UPDATE: To resolve the contact sync issue, I exported all of my contacts from Outlook 2013 to an Excel CSV file, deleted all contacts from Outlook 2013, trimmed any unnecessary columns/data from the CSV file, then imported the CSV file into Outlook.com's
 contact manager, which is called "People" (i.e. I did not import into Outlook 2013). &nbsp;I also deleted then re-set up my Exchange Active Sync account on my Android devices. &nbsp;When everything had completed synchronizing, all of my contacts were available to me
 across all of my devices/platforms, including Android, Outlook 2013, Windows Live Mail 2012 and Outlook.com's People manager.</div>

            I'm wondering if I missed something. &nbsp;This still doesn't appear to give two way synchronization. &nbsp;If you add a contact on Android, it's a regular phone contact not an MS Exchange contact, so &nbsp;it doesn't sync to Outlook. &nbsp;Please let me know - thanks.

<div><br />
<div>Check/change the settings for the People/Contacts app.</div>
<div><br />
<div><u>Long Answer</u>:</div>
<div><br />
Hard for me to say without seeing your setup, but I suspect that you have to tell it which address book to save new contacts to. &nbsp;By way of example, on the Nexus 4 running Jelly Bean 4.2, I'm presented with a dialouge box that requires me to select the account
 before I enter the information for the new contact. &nbsp;I seem to recall that previous versions of Android work the same way.
<div><br />
<div>After&nbsp;I changed my settings to show only those contacts in my Exchange account, it started defaulting to that account. &nbsp;Even then (with Jelly Bean 4.2) there's a drop down selector at the top of the new contact entry form that allows me to change the account
 if I want to.</div>

            many thanks. &nbsp;I'm just using the "regular" contacts manager app as provided on my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (on Jelly Bean). &nbsp;I assumed it's the default Android contacts manager, but perhaps not as there is no facility to choose the account type for new contacts.
 &nbsp;I can change "Contacts to display" in settings to show only the Exchange contacts, but the newly added contacts are still created as Phone contacts.

            It's possible that the contacts manger you're using is the Samsung branded version and not the default Jelly Bean app. &nbsp;On my version of Jelly Bean, the default contact manager is called "People." &nbsp;I'd be shocked if it wasn't pre-installed on your device
 too.

            It probably is yes - I checked and there's no "People" app. &nbsp;But anyway - I can change the contact type to Microsoft Exchange, so all is well (thanks to you!)

            <p>I have been trying for more than 1 year to sync contacts 2 ways between outlook on desktop and android. &nbsp;IT works flawlessly and effortlessly on my old iphone, but My google Nexus has been sitting in my drawer for a year because I cant get contacts to work.
 &nbsp;I have spent more than 40 man hours on this, and have got nowhere. &nbsp;All my contacts are in my homail account. &nbsp;Recently, MS "upgraded" hotmail to use exchange protocols for synchronization, rather than the hotmail connector. &nbsp; So I tried again. I did exactly
 what was in the link provided above.</p>
<ol>
<li>start off with no contacts in the phone app, outlook for android installed with no accounts.</li><li>Add hotmail.com email as an exchange account in outlook for android.</li><li>Wait</li><li>Now I see
<ol>
<li>all my contacts in outlook for android, but they are not editable, they are read only. &nbsp;If I change a contact in outlook on my desktop, I see the change in outlook for android. But no way to get changes or new contacts back the other way. Unfortunately,
 contacts in outlook for android are largely useless as I don't use email on my phone and would rarely use outlook for android, I only installed it to try to get contacts to sync. I need the contacts in the phone's phone book.</li><li>All my contacts appear on the android phone app, but its a one off one way sync only. If I change a contact on the phone, the change is not reflected or saved anywhere. &nbsp;If I add a new contact, its not synced or saved anywhere. &nbsp;If i updated a contact on
 the pc or in hotmail web browser, this change is not synced back to the phone. &nbsp;Its a one off "import" so again is useless.</li></ol>
<p>
</p></li></ol>
<p>In short, there seems to be no way to do a two way sync of contacts still. &nbsp;It is very very frustrating.</p>

<p>I have been trying for more than 1 year to sync contacts 2 ways between outlook on desktop and android. &nbsp;IT works flawlessly and effortlessly on my old iphone, but My google Nexus has been sitting in my drawer for a year because I cant get contacts to work.
 &nbsp;I have spent more than 40 man hours on this, and have got nowhere. &nbsp;All my contacts are in my homail account. &nbsp;Recently, MS "upgraded" hotmail to use exchange protocols for synchronization, rather than the hotmail connector. &nbsp; So I tried again. I did exactly
 what was in the link provided above.</p>
<ol>
<li>start off with no contacts in the phone app, outlook for android installed with no accounts.</li><li>Add hotmail.com email as an exchange account in outlook for android.</li><li>Wait</li><li>Now I see
<ol>
<li>all my contacts in outlook for android, but they are not editable, they are read only. &nbsp;If I change a contact in outlook on my desktop, I see the change in outlook for android. But no way to get changes or new contacts back the other way. Unfortunately,
 contacts in outlook for android are largely useless as I don't use email on my phone and would rarely use outlook for android, I only installed it to try to get contacts to sync. I need the contacts in the phone's phone book.</li><li>All my contacts appear on the android phone app, but its a one off one way sync only. If I change a contact on the phone, the change is not reflected or saved anywhere. &nbsp;If I add a new contact, its not synced or saved anywhere. &nbsp;If i updated a contact on
 the pc or in hotmail web browser, this change is not synced back to the phone. &nbsp;Its a one off "import" so again is useless.</li></ol>
<p>
</p></li></ol>
<p>In short, there seems to be no way to do a two way sync of contacts still. &nbsp;It is very very frustrating.</p>
</blockquote>
<div>I found the solution last year, there are two levels of password.&nbsp; If you change the master password, it all syncs up.&nbsp; I saved the link to the solution on someone else's computer, I'll post it on here later today.</div>

<h2>            Win 10 anniversary update features are there</h2>
                    <span style="text-decoration-line: underline; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows 10 Mobile Anniversary update New Features &amp; Massive Changelog:</span>

<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><strong>Upcoming
 / Planned / Incomplete features:</strong></span>
<ul>
<li>
Apps for websites: You will soon be able to redirect certain websites to open with an app instead. This is a new capability so apps that support this are still in progress. In preparation for their availability we have added a new page at Settings &gt; System
 &gt; Apps for websites where you will be able to manage them. Stay tuned for more on this.</li><li>
A very important feature is about to arrive and its settings are already seen on Mobile Build 14371 now. We are talking about the Apps roaming or Handsoff feature that We told you to expect coming with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nokiapoweruser.com/tag/redstone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows
 10 Redstone.</a>You can read our Redstone features &amp; release date article&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nokiapoweruser.com/new-features-windows-10-mobile-redstone-updates-may-bring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">by
 clicking here.</a>&nbsp;Though it is still not clear how it will work but we may come to know soon. Go to Setting—&gt;Privacy to check it.</li><li>
<a href="http://www.nokiapoweruser.com/soon-windows-10-mobile-pc-will-allow-dismiss-on-one-dismiss-on-all-notifications-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Universal
 Notification Dismiss feature</a>&nbsp;though revealed by Microsoft as coming is still not available on latest insider builds.</li></ul>

<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><strong>System
 / Settings UI Changes :</strong></span>
<ul>
<li>
New Tile Re-sizing animation with Fade-in/out effect.</li><li>
Icons for individual settings pages: All pages in the Settings app now have individual icons associated with them. These individual icons will also be shown when you pin a settings page to Start. And a dropdown flyout with page suggestions that will appear
 as you type into the Settings search box. These changes are designed to make it easier to find the settings you are looking for.</li><li>
Glance screen settings have moved: As part of our work to make settings more discoverable and user friendly, we’ve simplified the Glance settings options and moved the page out of the Extras section in the Settings app. These settings can now be found via Settings
 &gt; Personalization &gt; Glance screen. With this change, Glance settings no longer need to be downloaded or updated from the Store.</li><li>
Camera button on the Lock screen: When your phone is locked, the back button on the navigation bar is now replaced with a camera button. Press and hold this button to launch the Camera app from the Lock screen.</li><li>
Media controls show on top of the Lock screen: While you are listening to music, you will now be able to control the music you are listening to right from the Lock screen! If you turn on your phone’s screen, the media controls will now be shown embedded right
 on top of the Lock screen.</li><li>
Navigation bar settings page and vibration setting: We created a page for the navigation bar at Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Navigation bar. You can now use this page to configure preferences for vibration and double tap the navigation bar to turn off the screen.</li><li>
Device Encryption has moved under “Update &amp; Security” in one more unreported change.</li><li>
There is new “Your Info” section under Accounts Settings</li></ul>

<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Action
 Center / Notification UI &amp; other Changes:</span></strong>
<ul>
<li>
Visual changes to Action Center: Individual app notifications in Action Center no longer show the app icon repeated for each notification and will only be seen in the header that groups together all the notifications specific for that app. This change allows
 for more space in Action Center to show more content.</li><li>
Visual changes to Notifications: We’re making Action Center richer with support for notifications with more flexible layouts similar to the richness of Live Tiles. Notifications with images will now display larger than they did previously. Notifications can
 have “hero image” for content that is an even bigger image size to make content in notifications pop even more.</li><li>
Cortana notifications in Action Center: We have also added new insights from Cortana to ensure you are not missing anything important, such as a meeting conflict or anything she needs to remind you about.</li><li>
Notification prioritization in Action Center: You can manage the notification settings for individual apps by going to Settings &gt; System &gt; Notifications &amp; actions and prioritize which app notifications are more important to you. You can prioritize its notifications
 to be in one of 3 levels: Normal, High, or Top. You can also adjust how many notifications are visible per app. The default is now 3 per app. If an app has more than 3 notifications, just click or tap to expand and see all notifications for that app. This
 feature is also available on PC starting&nbsp;<a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/InsiderTeam/Shared%20Documents/Blog%20Posts/blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/04/06/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-14316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">with
 Build 14316</a>.</li><li>
Customize your Quick Actions in Action Center: You can add, remove and re-arrange the Quick Actions that show up in Action Center. To customize your Quick Actions, just go to the Settings &gt; System &gt; Notifications &amp; actions. In this settings page, you will see
 a replica of your Quick Actions as it appears in Action Center, and with a simple press and hold you can move the Quick Actions to the place where you want them to be. Then to add or remove a Quick Action, there is a link below the grid that will allow you
 to turn on or off the available Quick Actions.</li><li>
Notifications can be disabled from appearing in Action Center only, but still can show banners and other notifications</li><li>
if you long press on notifications &amp; group name of notifications in Action Center you get a context sensitive menu with useful options like,
<ul>
<li>
Make this app high-priority</li><li>
Turn-off notifications from particular app</li><li>
Go to notifications settings directly</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
App update notifications are back in Action Center now</li></ul>

<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Phone
 related Changes:</span></strong>
<ul>
<li>
Audio Routing options are new and useful. You can choose between Automatic, Bluetooth device and Phone Speaker when you make or receive a call. Also you can toggle on the option of “while making a call, turn on the speaker when I move my phone away from my
 ear”.</li><li>
Missed call and voicemail waiting indicators to the tabs inside the Phone app. Once you navigate to a tab with a missed call or voicemail – the indicator goes away.</li><li>
Advanced Settings allows one to get call transfer button in the call UI</li><li>
Visual Voicemail for dual-SIM devices such as dual-SIM Lumia 950 XL</li></ul>

<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><strong>Change
 in Screenshot / Camera sounds:</strong></span>
<ul>
<li>
If you check you will hear new Screenshot capture and Camera sounds.</li></ul>

<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><strong>Multitasking
 Improvements:</strong></span>
<ul>
<li>
Now you can have up to 16 Apps cards open in Multitasking UI on devices with 2 GB and higher RAM</li></ul>

<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><strong>Notification
 Mirroring:</strong></span>
<ul>
<li>
Microsoft has revealed&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nokiapoweruser.com/notifications-mirroring-brings-notifications-sync-on-windows-10-mobile-android/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Notification
 Mirroring as the way</a>&nbsp;to sync notifications on connected Windows 10 PC and Mobile devices. Users would be even able to opt out of notification mirroring for particular apps. The settings to opt out of the notifications mirroring will be listed in Cortana’s
 Notebook. Go to Cortana Settings–&gt;Edit Sync Settings.</li><li>
Cortana will now also surface your phone notifications and critical alerts, including low Battery alerts, messages from messaging services, SMS or social media as well as missed calls from any Windows 10 phone or Android device to your PC, so you never miss
 a beat while staying focused on your PC.</li></ul>

<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><strong>Cortana
 Changes:</strong></span>
<ul>
<li>
Send a photo from your phone to PC: If you need to quickly transfer a photo from your phone to your PC wirelessly – just ask Cortana “send this photo to my PC” and see what happens. This feature is currently exclusive to Windows 10 phones.</li><li>
New listening animation: When you tap the mic icon in Cortana, there is a new animation that shows Cortana is listening to you as you speak.</li><li>
With this build, we are enabling Cortana for the Spanish (Mexico), Portuguese (Brazil) and French (Canada) languages for Mobile (<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/03/04/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-14279/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">available
 previously in PC builds</a>).</li><li>
You can change the Cortana language right in Cortana Home all thanks to a new option provided in its Settings. Cortana keeps working on your device even if you change its language to available options English UK, US, Australia or Canada.</li><li>
More ways to create Cortana Reminders: We are making it easier and quicker to set a reminder in Cortana with 2 new exciting ways to create reminders. You can now create a Photo Reminder by taking a picture of something you want to be reminded about, like that
 beer you just tried and want to pick up next time you’re at the store. You can also now set reminders on content from UWP apps that utilize the share contract in Windows, like Microsoft Edge and the News app, so you don’t forget to read that article your friend
 sent you. You can share an article from the News app to Cortana and have her remind you to read it at a later time. This even works with photos from your collection in the Photos app! Give it a try.</li><li>
Search for music easier in Cortana: We have made it easier to invoke music search in Cortana by adding a music search icon to the top right of Cortana. You can now open Cortana and&nbsp;tap on the music search icon to have Cortana listen and search for the song
 that’s playing.</li></ul>

<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><strong>Messaging
 Improvements:</strong></span>
<ul>
<li>
Here is one of the unreported features which allows one to delete test messages by simply swiping left. Once you have deleted the messages you are also presented with the option of “undo” you action.</li><li>
Not only swipe to delete has been added to messaging with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nokiapoweruser.com/tag/build-14327/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Build
 14327</a>, there is one more feature that has made a comeback. You an again tap left to any of the messages and multi-select or select all of them. This was again a much used feature that went missing on Windows 10 Mobile.</li></ul>

<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><strong>Microsoft
 Edge:</strong></span>
<ul>
<li>
Swipe navigation in Microsoft Edge: Since the release of Windows 10 Mobile, our top feedback request for Microsoft Edge has been asking for the return of the swipe gesture to navigate back and forward. With this build, you can now swipe from anywhere on the
 page to get back to your previous page.</li><li>
Microsoft Edge has “Account Settings” and “Device Sync settings”shortcuts. The purpose seem to be easy accessibility of these settings from Microsoft Edge itself.</li><li>
Better tab behavior: Microsoft Edge keeps your tabs under control when you use it with apps on your phone. If you tap on a link in an app that opens a new tab in Microsoft Edge, pressing the back button when you’re done will close that tab, then take you back
 to the app. Your tabs list stays lean and relevant, by smartly closing tabs you’re done with.</li><li>
Word Flow now works in the address bar in Microsoft Edge on your phone: For fans of Word Flow, we heard your feedback, and we have re-enabled the ability to use shape writing in the address bar in Microsoft Edge on your phone!</li><li>
Open InPrivate tabs more easily in Microsoft Edge on your phone: We take the need for private browsing seriously, and InPrivate has been a feature of Microsoft Edge in Windows 10 Mobile from day one. However, we received feedback from Windows Insiders that
 the InPrivate feature was either hard to find or missing on their phones. As a result, we’ve moved the button to create a new InPrivate tab to appear right next to the new tab button. The next time you need a private tab in Microsoft Edge, you’ll find it right
 in your tabs view. Try it out on your phone and let us know what you think.</li><li>
Improved Download Prompts in Microsoft Edge: Microsoft Edge will now show a prompt when you start a download, allowing you to cancel unwanted downloads.</li></ul>

<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><strong>Software,
 OS Update &amp; Restart changes:</strong></span>
<ul>
<li>
Insider Preview Ring Selector has drop-down selection of ring instead of slider. Windows Insider App no more required. You need to go to Settings–&gt;Update &amp; Security—&gt;Windows Insider Program to check this.</li><li>
Updated Windows Update Settings: You can now also set the time in which you are most active on your phone just like on your PC by adjusting active hours under Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update. Windows Update will avoid automatically installing
 updates during your active hours on your device.</li></ul>

<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><strong>Wi-Fi
 / Mobile Data Changes:</strong></span>
<ul>
<li>
Wi-Fi Hotspot 2.0 feature is here now as can be seen in the first screenshot. You need to go to Settings–&gt;Network &amp; Wireless—&gt;Wi-Fi—&gt;Manage.</li><li>
Insider Preview Ring selector has also landed and it presents similar slider to change rings, as seen in Windows 10 PC builds.</li><li>
New only 4G or 3G option apart from existing 3G only option</li></ul>

<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><strong>Battery
 Saver Changes:</strong></span>
<ul>
<li>
Updated Battery Settings and Battery Saving Experience: Just like what was seen in last week’s PC build, there is now a single entry point for all battery related settings in the Settings app – including Battery Saver. This also includes the updated the Detailed
 Battery Use page so you can now manage the per-app background settings inline without going to a second page.</li><li>
You can also adjust the percentage in which Battery Saver turns on (which is at 20% by default) – something we had with Windows Phone 8.1 that Insiders wanted to see us re-implement as we merged Battery Sense into the Settings app for both PC and mobile.</li><li>
New option of “Managed by Windows” to handle apps running in background</li></ul>

<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Typing &amp; Keyboard Changes:</span>
<ul>
<li>
Updated emoji. This build brings our new emoji to your phone. As part of this work, the emoji section of the keyboard has been slightly reorganized to better align with the newly available emoji. It’s now arranged as follows: Favorites, Smileys and Animals,
 People, Celebrations and Objects, Food and Plants, Transportation and Places, Symbols, and ASCII emoticons.</li><li>
Better copy/paste: We’ve made a couple of improvements to copy and paste on the phone. When you are typing into an edit box on a web page, you will now be able to use the paste button above the keyboard. Also, if you select text on a web page the copy button
 will appear immediately near the selection.</li><li>
Movable Keyboard and one-handed keyboard mode now available on more 5-inch devices like Lumia 640 and Lumia 830</li></ul>

<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><strong>Major

</li><li>
<strong>Updated Maps app:&nbsp;</strong>This build includes a updated Maps app for Windows 10 that brings a more lightweight, scalable, and
 consistent UI as well as underlying architecture improvements and new features for you to try!
<ul>
<li>
One-tap access to search and directions from anywhere, even on your phone. This is great especially for one-handed use.</li><li>
You can view multiple searches and directions at the same time, on the same map as they are layered on top of each other and you can use tabs or the map to switch between them.</li><li>
You can now minimize search results, directions, and location info to enjoy more of the map, while keeping them in easy reach.</li><li>
You can see labels for your search results directly on the map. No more numbers to match between the map and the list.</li><li>
Cortana will give you turn-by-turn directions (if Cortana is enabled).</li><li>
We have improved the logic for nearby searches so you should see better (closer) results.</li><li>
We have added the ability to search for your favorite city in the 3D cities list so no more scrolling forever to get to the city you want.</li><li>
You can now access your favorites offline and add notes to them.</li><li>
We have updated the turn-by-turn design to improve glanceability and landscape layout.</li></ul>
</li><li>
<strong>Updated Alarms &amp; Clock app:</strong>&nbsp;We have pushed out an update to the Alarm &amp; Clock app that introduces a new inline time picker
 and improved design for creating and editing alarms and timers</li><li>
<strong>Updates to Outlook Mail &amp; Calendar:</strong>&nbsp;Yesterday, we released an update to the Outlook Mail &amp; Calendar apps that introduces
 some new features and improvements.
<ul>
<li>
In Outlook Mail, you can turn off the message preview text in the message list (Settings &gt; Reading &gt; Conversation and turning “Show preview text” off).</li><li>
You can also quickly get rid of junk email in your inbox by pressing down on a message to bring up the context menu and choosing ‘Move to Junk’.</li><li>
In Outlook Calendar, you can now let others know “I’ll be late” directly from meeting notifications.</li><li>
Send email from&nbsp;<span>Outlook.com</span>&nbsp;aliases</li><li>
Open &amp; save Calendar .ics attachments in email</li><li>
See multiple upcoming events on the wide Calendar live tile</li><li>
Drag and drop calendar events to reschedule them (PC only)</li><li>
Print Month view in Calendar</li><li>
Use Mail and Calendar on HoloLens</li></ul>
</li><li>
<strong>Update to the People app</strong>&nbsp;that brings back the history feature. For a given contact you communicate with, you can view
 the interaction, whether by today, yesterday, last week etc. Right now, your Skype messages won’t show up in history yet but we’re working on enabling this in a future update. Also – we’re tracking a bug in which opening an email item in history&nbsp;might not&nbsp;take
 you to that specific email.</li><li>
<strong>Update to Store app</strong>&nbsp;brings redesigned UI and some cool features including information about when the app was updated
 last on your devices. It also makes updates apps accessible from Downloads &amp; Updates Page. Everything including individual apps page, Store Home and even Downloads progress bar and UI gets revamped.</li><li>
<strong>Update to Groove app</strong>&nbsp;brings&nbsp;<strong>Your
 Groove</strong>, the place for music that is centered around you, what you like, and your listening habits. This is where you’ll not only find your recently played items, but also brand new automatically curated recommended playlists built just for your taste.
 They update often to always give you fresh recommendations, but you can save a copy any time to edit, download or just save to listen to later. Some design improvements to make Your Groove and Explore more colorful and vibrant.</li></ul>

<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Feedback Hub improvements:</span>
<ul>
<li>
Introducing Feedback Hub: The Feedback Hub carries over all of the best things from the previous two apps plus a few new things. When you open Feedback Hub for the first time, you will see a search box at the top so you can quickly find and upvote feedback
 items from other Insiders or submit new feedback. You will also notice that Announcements and Quests show up together in a single feed under “What’s new”. When you submit new feedback to us, we have added a new description field so you can explain in more
 detail the feedback you are sending to us.</li><li>
We’ve heard from you that it can sometimes be hard to find which category your feedback belongs in. Now when you create new feedback, the Feedback Hub will suggest categories and subcategories based on the title and description you entered. If you see a suggestion
 that looks right, just click it to fill in the menus and get your feedback to the right engineers quickly.</li><li>
Commenting in the Feedback Hub. Just like on PC, you also have the ability to comment on feedback inside the Feedback Hub on your phone in addition to the responses from our engineering team you have seen in the app already (we call these “sticky comments”).
 So in addition to up-voting on feedback, you can now comment on feedback too.</li></ul>

 Depreciated:</strong></span>

Share Wi-Fi networks with your contacts removed: Just like&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/05/10/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-14342/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">we
 noted for Build 14342 for PC</a>, we have removed the Wi-Fi Sense feature that allows you to share Wi-Fi networks with your contacts and to be automatically connected to networks shared by your contacts. The engineering effort to keep this working great, combined
 with low demand for the feature made it not worthwhile to keep investing in it. Wi-Fi Sense, if enabled, will continue to get you connected to open Wi-Fi hotspots that it knows about through crowdsourcing.</li><li>
Removed Messaging-Skype Integration from the messaging app.</li><li>
Kid’s Corner gets depreciated</li><li>

“Messaging everywhere” feature in Windows 10 that allows you to send and receive text messages from your phone directly from your Windows 10 PC’s.</li></ul>

<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Adapter support:</span>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>USB Ethernet Support with Continuum (Mobile).</strong>Continuum-capable phones now include support for most USB Ethernet adapters.
 If you connect a USB Ethernet adapter your Lumia 950 or Lumia 950 XL via the Microsoft Display Dock for example – you will have network connectivity through an attached Ethernet cable. A few notes on this feature:
<ul>
<li>
You may see an error message the first time you connect. There is nothing wrong with your adapter, and the message will be eliminated in a future update.</li><li>
Not all adapters are supported yet – more will be added in a future update.</li><li>
In this update, you will not see a visual indicator that you are connected, so if you want to double-check that it’s working you can turn off Wi-Fi and cellular data.</li><li>
Windows 10 Mobile supports proxy configuration for Wi-Fi and VPN connections. Proxy support for LAN connections will be available in a future update.</li></ul>

Windows Hello enables you to easily sign into your device with enterprise-grade security. Yet, studies show over 80% of people use the same password across multiple web sites, managing around 20-30 different accounts requiring passwords. So with the Windows
 10 Anniversary Update we’ve made it possible for you to use the same easy, yet strong, security of Windows Hello* with Windows apps and Microsoft Edge, the first and only browser to natively support biometrics, with supporting sites.</li><li>
Windows 10 is the best place to have a conversation with Cortana, with nearly 1,000 Cortana-enabled apps already available. Today, we’re launching a&nbsp;<a href="http://aka.ms/Upqz0y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">new
 Cortana Collection in the Windows Store</a>&nbsp;to make it easy for you to find great apps with Cortana. And in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, Cortana** has learned how to proactively make suggestions for you through-out your day, like offering to buy you
 lunch or arrange transportation. Cortana will be available above the lock screen, giving you quicker access to your personal assistant for common tasks across all types of devices without unlocking your PC. And only Cortana works across your devices – you
 can complete certain notification-based tasks on your Windows or Android phone, such as receiving and sending text messages, on your PC. Developers now have full access to Cortana’s proactive intelligence through proactive actions, allowing your apps to perform
 tasks based on user context by linking existing actions in your deep-link enabled apps and websites.</li></ul>

    <title>Templates Unable to connect to Office.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marksl5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Templates Unable to connect to Office.com</h2>
                    We are having problem downloading templates from within Office 2010 Professional Plus applications.&nbsp; It is only happening at a couple of the libraries we support. It happens on Windows XP, 7, and 8 with all Office apps. I suspect the firewalls as the issue
 only affects machines on those particular networks and does not when a machines is moved to another location.
<br />
However, if I use a machine at our main office to access the templates and then take that same machine to the affected libraries and log in the same way as the main office but on their network it WILL work.&nbsp; If you log off that profile and log in with a profile
 that was not used successfully at the main office access to the templates will NOT work again.&nbsp; It is very confusing.<br />
I have completed all updates. I have tried repairs to the installation, as well as a full uninstall and reinstall. I have completely reset Internet Explorer options to default.&nbsp; None of these has any effect.&nbsp; Which leads me back to the firewall.<br />
Office.com and office.microsoft.com are both fully allowed. But, seeing as how I can get to Office.com and download templates through a browser, I don’t think that really has anything to do with this issue.&nbsp; I could use this as a work around but in our situation
 it would be much better to be able to download the templates directly from the application.<br />
I would think that if the firewall was preventing access it would always prevent access.&nbsp; It is as if the currently logged in profile has a saved cookie(or something like that) from a previous successful session it will be allowed but not if that profile does
 not have that cookie.&nbsp; Perhaps, I need some more specific application rules on the firewall.&nbsp; If so, would you have any suggestions?&nbsp; I haven’t found much.

<h2>            Can Skype for W10 remind me I have unread messages&#63;</h2>
                    When I receive a message, I get a notification. If I do not act on the notification, it will go away and Skype will not remind me again that I have a new message. In the desktop app, this used be solved by the application flashing in the taskbar. The app
 for W10 does not do that.

    <title>Brazilian Banking BHO and Internet Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Brazilian Banking BHO and Internet Explorer</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I am infected with a BHO that was installed by a relative trying to access their Brazilian bank account. It is called "GbIehObj Class" in the Manage Add-ons menu of IE.<br />
<br />
I have two copies installed and that menu shows that load times are about 1 second each and navigation times about 3 seconds.&nbsp; This is what I experience in IE. A new page takes about 5 seconds to load.&nbsp; Mozilla loads the same page instantly.<br />
<br />
I don't know what that program is doing for 5 seconds but it worries me.&nbsp; Also, I will never need to use the program so I want to uninstall it.<br />
<br />
My understanding is that the installer for this program removes the registry entries needed to uninstall this BHO by normal means.<br />
<br />
Please Microsoft, can you publish a malware removal tool for this BHO.&nbsp; There are many hits on this subject and most of them are sites that recommend you install further malware to deal with the problem.&nbsp; Please, I want a certified Microsoft fix for this.&nbsp;
 Microsoft created this BHO idea and should provide a solution.<br />
<br />
Internet Explorer is unusable in the present state.<br />
<br />

            <p>I have an update on this BHO malware.&nbsp; I have read some Brazilian posts on the subject that indicate this BHO trojan has the ability to modify your boot sector. Often it renders your system unbootable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have experienced this quite a few times after accidentally starting Internet Explorer.&nbsp; I use "bootrec /fixmbr" and "bootrec /fixboot" from the recovery shell to get going again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beware.</p>

<p>Since this is a peer supported forum and we do not work for Microsoft I suggested you contact Microsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on information in your followup post I've got a couple of ideas for you but my ideas will not be a "certified Microsoft fix".&nbsp; If you want a "<strong>certified

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You insisted on certain&nbsp;prerequisites in your original post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want <strong>my</strong> ideas on&nbsp;combatting your issue&nbsp;I'll give them to you and let you try them otherwise you need to contact Microsoft.&nbsp; But&nbsp;my suggestions will not be a
<strong>certified Microsoft fix</strong> which you said you wanted in your original post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or if you'll be patient maybe someone else will give you some suggestions.</p>

            <p>My thoughts are that to say you are&nbsp;frustrated is putting it mildly and you'll probably never let your relative near one of your computers again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've conducted the same research you have...it's evidently a very tough one to remove.&nbsp;

<p>Your observations about rebuilding the MBR indicate this is a rootkit that may require a reformat/reinstall to fix.&nbsp; Assume that's your last resort or you would have already done it.&nbsp; And it also makes me suspicious that you might have a version of Alureon
 on your computer...see the post of GreginMich in this thread: </p>

    <title>I organized my email in outlook, but it remains disorganized in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jadsaid  say:</h3>
<h2>            I organized my email in outlook, but it remains disorganized in outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>I access my hotmail account through Outlook 2010. &nbsp;I retain a lot of old email in my hotmail inbox, which I have organized into subfolders. &nbsp;I had a backlog of unfiled emails, some of them more than a year old. &nbsp;I spent a while on Outlook yesterday, filing
 these old emails away in the proper subfolders. &nbsp;Unfortunately, when I tried to access my email on outlook.com I noticed that most (if not all) of the old email was still there, sitting unsorted in my inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried repairing Outlook Hotmail Connector. &nbsp;That didn't make any difference. &nbsp;I tried to tool around with my account settings but couldn't figure out what to do. &nbsp;I have hotmail configured as a MAPI account and I have my Outlook Data File (with a .pst
 extension) set as the default data file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to have to re-sort 16 pages of old email into subfolders on Outlook.com. &nbsp;Is there any way to sync Outlook 2010 and outlook.com so that I don't have to re-do a day's worth of organizing?</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, it doesn't look like there is another way then renaming the ost-file for your Outlook.com account to .old (when Outlook is closed)&nbsp;and have Outlook recache the Outlook.com mailbox. Removing the account, restarting Outlook and re-adding the
 account should do the trip as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To prevent you from needing to resort everything, you can first export your Outlook.com mailbox to a pst-file. When it is then reconfigured and reached, you can renaming your original subfolders to -old and copy the sorted folder from the pst-file to the
 Outlook.com mailbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To connect to your exported pst-file use: File-&gt; Open-&gt; Open Outlook Data File</p>
<p>Don't use the Import function to restore as you want to prevent ending up with duplicates. Also, wait for folder changes to sync back to the server before you start with the next so that you remain fully in control and can easily locate any possible upload
 issues.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">I followed your advice.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it has not worked out so well. &nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the situation is worse.&nbsp; There are three principal problems:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">None of the changes I make in Outlook to my Hotmail inbox are reflected in outlook.com.&nbsp; If I delete or move an email in outlook, the changes are not reflected on the server. &nbsp; The same is true with respect to the calendar. &nbsp;None
 of the events I create in Outlook appear in my calendar online.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">I lost an untold amount of information from my contacts folder and from my calendar</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">My email folders now contain duplicate copies of most emails</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">To make the situation even more frustrating, the original problem was never solved.&nbsp; the hundreds of unread and unsorted emails in my inbox are still in my inbox.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">To clarify: new email does appear in my Outlook 2010 inbox. &nbsp;Sent mail does go out, but that's it. &nbsp;Outlook.com doesn't even produce a record of mail sent from Outlook 2010.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">I really don’t know what to do.&nbsp; I bought a duplicate remover.&nbsp; We’ll see how that works.&nbsp; I’ll give up on all of my lost information.&nbsp; I just can’t live with this synching problem.</span></p>

<h2>            Ovi Store Update v2.12.043</h2>
                    
<p>A new update has arrived but no changelog.&nbsp; I managed to update but the confusion of the available updates persist.&nbsp; Bug in the long lists where icons and details would disappear is solved (great!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those who can't update, you can download the Ovi Store v2.12.043 here: <a href="https://d.ovi.com/p/d/ovistore_static/s602xclients/212043/ovistoreinstaller_smartinstaller_prd_PROD-P_2.12.043.sisx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
