            Do a google search for "Persian Unicode", ie:<br />
https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=persian+unicode&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a<br />
<br />
As well as enabling a persian keyboard you could type the unicode codes in to create the digits. This may be easier if you are doing just a few characters. ie:

    <title>Inserting paragraph breaks using Replace in MS Word, but paragraphs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrmrrm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inserting paragraph breaks using Replace in MS Word, but paragraphs aren&#39;t spaced out</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to break up a big block of text using Find and Replace to find certain delimiters and insert paragraph breaks to break it into different paragraphs. However, once the paragraphs are broken up, there is no spacing between the paragraphs, even though
 the document template and style specify there must be spacing between the paragraphs. The only way to get the spacing I want is to go in manually, remove the paragraph break, and then hit the enter key manually. Why is the case? What is the difference between
 using Replace to insert a paragraph mark, and hitting the enter key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To show an example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I begin with an unformatted series of questions and answers, broken up by "Q. " and "A. ". For example:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4e1e298e-06b1-4d70-bc6e-b2aeafd6db6e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4e1e298e-06b1-4d70-bc6e-b2aeafd6db6e" /></a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To break this up, I use the following regular expressions: Find "</span>&nbsp;([Q|A]\.)", Replace "^013\1 ". (The quotes don't actually go in the dialog box.) The wildcard box is checked. The ^013 is used to signify a paragraph break,
 since you can't use ^p with wildcards. This returns the following result:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0963afee-2f93-4251-9095-3afdce9c006a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0963afee-2f93-4251-9095-3afdce9c006a" /></a></p>
<p>These paragraphs have no spacing between them. However, with the default template I'm using, normal paragraphs have the default spacing set at 9 points after. Even when I highlight the new paragraphs and click to apply the normal style, though, there is
 still no spacing. However, when I go to the second line, put my cursor in front of the "A", hit backspace, and then hit enter again, I get this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65e51246-23ba-4b66-9ae0-7e0dfdd3f9be" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65e51246-23ba-4b66-9ae0-7e0dfdd3f9be" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)">Finally, I have line spacing between the first and second paragraphs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)">So, why is this the case? Is there something differently I can do to make the spacing work? I am looking to automate a large number of these types of tasks, and I think there must be a way to avoid having to press the enter key
 manually for every paragraph I want spaced properly. Any insights?</span></p>

<p>While you must use ^13 in the find string of a Wildcard search, it is OK to use ^p in the replace string.</p>

<p>Considering this is a "Quarantine" folder perhaps there is good reason it wouldn't be defragmented! Defragging as part of a routine maintenance along with disk cleanup&nbsp;IS a&nbsp;good practice, but unless you are doing such things as video/audio editing ,installing/uninstalling&nbsp;large
 programs etc. it's effect is minimal with respect to performance or health of your hard drive and as such one fragmented folder or file would be insignifigant. In other words there doesn't really seem to be a problem that requires fixing.&nbsp;You didn't mention
 whether you were using Windows defragment utility or third party software(Auslogics, Piriform Defraggler, etc.)which may have been the difference. Since it appears you are consciuos of maintenance, I suggest considering using Onecare.live, specifically the
 Cleanup and Tuneup options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm?s_cid=sah" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm?s_cid=sah</a></p>
<p>The Tuneup will analyze for fragmentation and if greater than 15% will suggest defragmentation but still your option. The Cleanup utility does well to remove most unnecessary files and registry errors(*not all registry errors as some are user/third party
 software erors) Using Onecare bi-weekly should be adequate.</p>

 to the internet (On / Off)'</p>
<p>
</p><p>What was the question you asked (if not personal) that prompted the response?</p>

    <title>Scan ends, but does not display any &#34;Scan Results&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seanchuck  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scan ends, but does not display any &#34;Scan Results&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Recently when I perform a "Quick scan" with MSE, it appears to scan normally, but at some point soon after the scan's progress bar gets past about 85% full, the scan just seems to stop. The thing that raised my concern, was that when the scan seems to stop
 and then the "Home" tab on the MSE display window switches back from the scanning display to the normal "Home" tab's display, there's never a "Scan Results" message anymore. There is never anything displayed above the line, that is located right next to the
 image of a computer monitor, and is written in green, in which it states; "Security Essentials is monitoring your PC and helping to protect it." The display is no different than it would be after initially opening MSE. Plus I do not receive any type of error
 message either. Another oddity is that it still documents the day &amp; time I start a scan as the "Last scan:" under "Scan details on the bottom left of the "Home" display...</p>
<p>I don't know if this is related, but the "Quick scan" also seems like it might be ending in a lot less time then it normally would...</p>
<p>The final thing that seemed strange is a "location" that comes up under "Item:" as the scan is running -&nbsp;
<strong>\\.\C:\ </strong></p>
<p>The scan seems to get hung on this location for almost a whole minute, before continuing the scan. After it starts to continue though, it only scans a dozen or so more "Items" before the scan stops completely, without displaying the scan results...</p>
<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Thank you for your time,</p>
<p>Sean</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: I thought that I should mention that the "other anti-malware" that I have installed on my computer is just "Malwarebytes Anti-Malware" and that it is the free version which doesn't provide automatic scanning, automatic updates, or real-time protection...
 I just run it manually every so often for some additional scan coverage.</p>

            <p>Please answer <em>each of the following diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):
</p>
<p>1. Always state your Internet Explorer version (e.g., IE8; IE9) as well as your Windows version (e.g., WinXP SP3; WinXP 64-bit SP2; Vista SP1; Vista 64-bit SP2; Win7; Win7 SP1; Win7 64-bit; Win7 64-bit SP1) when posting in a forum.&nbsp; Please do so in your
 next reply. </p>
<p>2a. Was&nbsp;Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) offered &amp; installed via Windows Update or did you intentionally
<em>choose</em> to install it?</p>
<p>2b. In <em>Windows</em> Explorer [<strong>WinKey+E</strong>], navigate to &amp; right-click on</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>C:\Program Files\</strong><em><strong>Microsoft Security Client</strong> &lt;=this folder</em>
</p>
<p>Select <strong>Properties</strong>: What is the <strong>Created</strong> date displayed on the resulting
<strong>General</strong> tab?</p>
<p>3. What anti-virus application was installed <em>before you installed MSE</em>, was your subscription still current, and did you uninstall it before you installed MSE?</p>
<p>4. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>5. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [PICK ONE] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>6. What Java version is currently installed?&nbsp; TEST HERE =&gt; <a href="http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp</a></p>
<p>7. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>8. Has MBAM ever detected &amp; removed anything?</p>
<p>9. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; Advanced
 System Optimizer; TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; CCleaner)?</p>

            <p>We've had a few other reports of the same behavior. A reinstall of MSE might resolve it.</p>
<p>The faster Quick Scan is true of version 4 of MSE.</p>
<p>The stalling briefly at the entry you listed is also normal. We had heard that they were going to fix that display issue, apparently they didn't.</p>

            <p>Sorry Robear,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I forgot about that stuff...&nbsp; Here is the information you asked about:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp; IE8,&nbsp; Windows XP Professional 32-bit SP3.</p>
<p><strong>2a.</strong>&nbsp; I intentionally&nbsp;chose to install MSE,</p>
<p><strong>2b.</strong>&nbsp; The Created date of the "Microsoft Security Client" folder is Tuesday, February 01, 2011, 9:47:28 AM.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp; I used "MS Win Live One Care", and then briefly "A squared", before MSE.&nbsp; Both were un-installed and had no active subscription when MSE was installed.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp; I don't believe that either Norton or McAfee have ever been installed on this HD.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp; This is not the original&nbsp;HD that came with the computer, so the answer would be NO.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Java Version 6 Update 32 &nbsp;(1.6.0_32-b05)</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp; Yes, both Firefox &amp;&nbsp;Chrome are installed, but&nbsp;almost never&nbsp;used.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp; The only things MBAB has really detected&nbsp;were the files from the adware "anti-virus 360" which was&nbsp;over 3&nbsp;years ago, and more recently: "Real Vegas Online\miniprocess.exe (Adware.Casino) -&gt; Quarantined and deleted successfully." which
 was back on 2/9/12.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp; No...&nbsp; I have used CCleaner to scan registry files, but never allowed it to make any modifications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for your time,</p>
<p>Sean<br />

            <p>Robear,</p>
<p>Sorry that it has taken me so long to reply!..&nbsp; I have just had a lot of other things going on recently, and I actually haven't been staying at the home of the computer in question for about 4 weeks...</p>
<p>However, I still greatly appreciate your assistance, and I have finally had a chance to find the information you requested about this computer...&nbsp; Here it is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp; </strong>Yes, my OneCare&nbsp;subscription&nbsp;had <em>already expired</em> by the time&nbsp;I replaced it with the a-squared application.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; </strong>Yes, I did uninstall&nbsp;OneCare AND THEN reboot, BEFORE&nbsp;I installed the a-squared application
<em>and/or MSE.&nbsp; </em>Unfortunately,&nbsp;that was a very long time ago, and&nbsp;I possibly&nbsp;did download/run the
<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/c/b/4cb845e7-1076-437b-852a-7842a8ab13c8/OneCareCleanUp.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
OneCare cleanup utility</a>&nbsp;first, but I am not certain.</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp; </strong>Yes, MSE v4.0.1526.0 installed now.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp; </strong>Yes, ALL of the updates you mentioned were listed...&nbsp; I don't know if it matters, but I figured that just in case it does, I would let you know that only one (1) of them (<em>KB2675157</em>) was&nbsp;displayed as a
<strong>Security Update for Windows Internet Explorer 8</strong>, instead of there being two (2) displayed that way, like you mentioned.</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp; </strong>I didn't have any type of Instant Messages with webpage links to use for testing to see what browser they would open in, but every link that I could find in other programs, applications, or documents, all use IE8 to open them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for your time,</p>
<p>Sean<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PS:&nbsp; </strong>I am still going to wait&nbsp;and&nbsp;see what follow-up advise you have, but I am seriously considering to just uninstall and reinstall MSE, to see if that fixes the problem.</p>

 as a Netbook, particularly on XP.</p>

<p>Hopefully that will save you some time...</p>
<p>I should also mention that I found some left over folders from "OneCare"&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;"a-squared Free", that have some quarantine files in them.&nbsp; I also have some folders within a single folder from "McAfee" (<em>it was my first anti-virus suite before Onecare</em>),
 but they are all empty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well as always I really appreciate you assistance, and am looking forward to your next reply!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            <blockquote>I also have some folders within a single folder from "McAfee" (<em>it was my first anti-virus suite before Onecare</em>), but they are all empty.</blockquote>
<p>More than two months ago, I asked if&nbsp;McAfee application (or a Norton application) had EVER been installed and you told me: "I don't believe that either Norton or McAfee have ever been installed on this HD."</p>
<p>Even though the computer appears to be fully-patched at Windows Update right now, please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>1. When (approx. date) was the new hard-drive (HDD)&nbsp;installed?</p>
<p>2. Was OneCare ever installed <em>after the new HDD was installed? </em></p>
<p>3. Did you (or the tech) use the discs that came with the computer to do the clean install of WinXP
<em>after the new HDD was installed? </em></p>
<p>4. Have you EVER downloaded/run the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool<em> since the new HDD was installed?
</em></p>
<p>5a. Is Java Version 7 Update 5 (or higher) installed now? TEST HERE =&gt; <a href="http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp</a></p>
<p>5b. And have you removed ALL previous Java versions (e.g., Java Version 6 Update 31; Java Version 5 Update 12; etc.)?</p>

<p>it would appear the screenshots are unavailable. could you please try re-inserting them?</p>
<p>to insert a screenshot, please click use rich formatting &gt;&nbsp;<a href="http://community.office365.com/tiny_mce/plugins/insertmedia/img/insert_image.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcommunity.office365.com%2ftiny_mce%2fplugins%2finsertmedia%2fimg%2finsert_image.gif" /></a>
 insert/edit media &gt; browse... &gt; insert.</p>
<p>and to further clarify the situation, please also,</p>
<p>1. share the screenshots of the page you had "the admin button",</p>
<p>2. let us know the url you use to access "the admin page".</p>
<p>in the meantime, you can currently turn to, if there are, other global administrators in your organization to check the admin role has been assigned to you.</p>

            <font>Emails sent using the Samsung or Sony mail app&nbsp;will duplicate in the Sent folder.<br />
The emails duplicate every time the&nbsp;Samsung or Sony&nbsp;mail app&nbsp;syncs.<br />
The Sent folder&nbsp;can grow so much that&nbsp;the account&nbsp;may be&nbsp;blocked.<br />
You will have to fix the duplicating problem.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
There is an update to the Samsung mail app.&nbsp; It fixes the Sent folder&nbsp;duplicating messages.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Or remove the account from the phone app.<br />
Download and install the outlook.com app.<br />
Add the account.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Or you can setup the account to use 'Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync'.<br />

FIXED ON SAMSUNG GALAXY S2? <br />
&nbsp;<br />
I had the same problem with hundreds of duplicated emails in my outlook sent mail folder. I have a Samsung Galaxy S2 and I use the native email app (which I prefer after trying many alternatives). I cleared the problem using the native email app on my phone.&nbsp;
 I deleted the outlook account [open app; settings; bin in top right corner; delete] then added it back selecting 'Manual Setup'.&nbsp; When the app then asks 'What type of account?' I selected 'Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync'.
<br />
<br />
The settings needed are as follows... <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Domain\user name: \[Your outlook email address]<br />
Password: [Your outlook password]<br />
Exchange Server: s.outlook.com<br />
Use Secure connection (SSL) [Tick yes]<br />
Use client certificate: [Leave blank]<br />
<br />
All your emails will be back in place on the phone within a few minutes once you have worked through a few more settings which are all ok at their default values.
<br />
<br />
I can now send emails from my Samsung with only one instance appearing in my outlook sent folder :)<br />
<br />
If I get any further problems I will report back.<br />
<br />
I got the Exchange ActiveSync settings from the following <br />

<h3> cathyis  say:</h3>
<h2>            change &#34;more blank page sizes&#34; in Publisher 2013 to inches</h2>
                    <p>How to I change the measurement units shown on the "more blank page sizes" page to show the measurements in inches not cm. &nbsp;I have already changed the ruler to display in inches. &nbsp;But when creating a new document and choosing "more blank page sizes" all
 the images show in metric. &nbsp;EG It shows: Letter (landscape) 27.9 4 x 21.50 cm &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want it to show: Letter (landscape) 11 x 8.5 in</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also noticed that the change to the ruler is only temporary - the next time I open a new document, it is back to cm. &nbsp;How do I permanently change the default measurement to be in inches? &nbsp;I don't want to have to change the ruler every time I start
 a new document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Thank you David. I had tried changing my region to US and this did not work. &nbsp;But to be sure I took another crack at it. &nbsp;I have discovered that the change is buried under "additional settings" in the Change Date Time or Number formats section. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. open Control Panel</p>
<p>2. Select Clock Language Regions</p>
<p>3. Select Change Date Time or Number Formats</p>
<p>4. Select Additional Settings</p>
<p>5. Change measurement system to U.S. (from metric)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that region is still set to Canada.</p>
<p>

    <title>Unable to attach an Excel file to an Outlook e-mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> susanduecy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to attach an Excel file to an Outlook e-mail</h2>
                    <p>I have updated my Windows 7 computer to Windows 10 and things seemed to be running smoothly until the past two days. &nbsp;In the past two days, I have been unable to attach Excel files to outgoing e-mails. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have entered the recipient's e-mail addresses, and clicked the paperclip icon at the top of the Outlook e-mail screen. &nbsp;The prompt takes me to locate the file(s) &nbsp;I want to attach and I have clicked on the first of two that I want to send. &nbsp;I select it
 by double clicking, or by highlighting and choosing "Insert." &nbsp;The file does not appear on the outgoing e-mail as having been attached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I double-checked the e-mail I sent and the attachment was not attached. &nbsp;I have been doing this for YEARS, so I am not inexperienced at this. &nbsp;What is going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: &nbsp;I re-booted my computer. &nbsp;Now everything works as it should. &nbsp;Duh.</p>

<h2>            Footnote numbers keep changing - Word 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    I have a word doc created in Word 2016 for Mac. &nbsp;The footnotes keep renumbering themselves after I change them and save the doc. &nbsp;I have figured out a way to right click and select update field to make them return to what they should be, however there
 must be a problem somewhere in the footnote formatting. &nbsp;Does anybody have a clue what I need to do to stop this once and for all? I should mention that some of them are footnotes and some are cross references to other footnotes. &nbsp;

            <p>Most likely, it's Tracked Changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have tracked changes in the document, the footnote numbering will treat all deletions as "still &nbsp;there" (because they are!) and number accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you resolve the changes, the deleted text will be removed, and the numbering will then be correct.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Open command hangs Word when Mac dictation setting are on and maybe after wake from sleep --OS Sierra &#38; 2016 MBPro</h2>
                    <p>Working on 2016 MacBook Pro 15" with touch bar and OS 10.12.3 Sierra. &nbsp;Recently purchased MS Office 2016. &nbsp;Worked fine for about a month. &nbsp;As of 3 days ago, each time I put the MBP to sleep, on waking I cannot use the Open command from the File menu without
 hanging Word (must force quit). &nbsp;I need the Open command to open older MSW docs, which I initially thought were the cause of the problem until the same thing occurred without opening old docs. &nbsp;Double click on .docx is OK. &nbsp;Open recent and new document commands
 are OK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Spent hours troubleshooting with Microsoft. &nbsp;They did the usual plus uninstalled and had me reinstall Office. &nbsp;Starting Word from a pristine user account worked, so they concluded it is Apple's problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Spent more hours with Apple: &nbsp;normal troubleshooting (restart, safe mode, etc.). &nbsp;confirmed that when opening Word in a clean User Account, it functioned normally at first (only tested initial performance). &nbsp;This pointed to corrupt preference files, so I
 restarted with clean prefs. &nbsp;This worked until I quit Word and let the MBP sleep overnight. &nbsp;First action in a.m. was open Word. &nbsp;Beachball hang and force quit. &nbsp;I had not changed anything since successfully using Word to open and save over 60 old documents
 the night before. &nbsp; Called Apple. &nbsp;They insist it is Microsoft's problem (corrupting prefs). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 2 hours trying to talk to Microsoft level 3 (and 2 disconnects), I gave up and wiped the preference files again so I could work. &nbsp;Word worked like a charm until I put the MBP to sleep again for an hour. &nbsp;First action after wake was open Word doc from
 file menu. &nbsp;Hang (spinning beach ball and force quit).</p>

</span></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>I've installed Microsoft Office version 15.30 on my MacBook Pro running Sierra. I can boot up all of the programs, Excel, Word, Power Point and it boots up fine. When I go to the File-&gt;Open menu and click on Open I get the spinning rainbow wheel of death
 and I have to force quit the program as it has become unresponsive. This happens every time.&nbsp;</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<div>However, if I go to my drive and double click on the file I want to work on, it boots up the programs and opens the file with no problems. This also doesn't happen when I open the program directly and choose New or Open Recent.&nbsp;</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<div>
<p>My Software update says that 15.30 is the latest update. So what can I do to resolve this issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>________</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have not found any resolution to this problem. &nbsp;It is serious enough that I am considering asking for a refund (problem started 4 days after my 30 day guarantee period ended, of course) and resigning myself to use of Pages
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>after 30 years of MSW.</span><span>&nbsp; It is not worth repairing my system several times per day--impossible to work.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to anyone who has an answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>_____</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: &nbsp;After many hours of troubleshooting on my own, I located the problem. &nbsp;It remains unresolved in spite of log files having been sent to the last of the Microsoft tech support reps who had contacted me. &nbsp;This is the problem, confirmed by Apple. &nbsp;When
 I turn on the Mac's dictation settings, MSW Open command behaves as above (hangs). &nbsp;I had been experimenting with dictation, turning it on and off and changing settings, thus the confusion re: wake from sleep (I think). &nbsp;This happens whether I turn dictation
 on before or after launching MSW. &nbsp;It does not happen with Excel. &nbsp;I have not used PowerPoint enough to know. &nbsp;It happens, so far, only when using the Open command (not double clicking a document or choosing one from the Recent menu. &nbsp;Apple guided me through
 steps to replicate the problem and retrieve the log files that pinpoint the problem. &nbsp;They said they do not have ability to see what is happening in Word and suggested forwarding log files to MS engineers. &nbsp;It has been weeks--no word from MS. &nbsp;Please refer
 to the conversation below.</p>

<p>1. Please provide your Word version, you can check it in Word &gt; About Word.</p>
<p>2. You mentioned you cannot use open command to open old documents, what if you open a recent file after the sleep?</p>

            <p>HI Tisky,</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span>My current Word version 15.32 (170309). &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>MacBook Pro 2016 15" with&nbsp;</span><span><span>touch bar, 16G RAM, 2.6 GHz Intel core i7. 68GB free space on internal hard drive. &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>I responded at length via email as follows (note that my initial question contains quite a lot of detail):</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<blockquote>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">
<p>2. You mentioned you cannot use open command to open old documents, what if you open a recent file after the sleep?</p>
<div><br />
<div><span>As stated, I can double click on a newly saved .docx and it will open. &nbsp;I can open docs from the recently opened menu. &nbsp;I can create new documents. &nbsp;I cannot double click--I need the File&gt;Open command to open OLD MSW documents. &nbsp;The File&gt;Open command
 does not function (hangs/force quit) after waking from sleep. &nbsp;I must then reset all preference files back to scratch by deleting and restarting my OS in order for MSW open command to function again. &nbsp;This means losing and resetting ALL my preferences each
 time. &nbsp;I have replicated this numerous time, including with Apple. &nbsp;They say it is not possible that the problem is with the OS, since all other applications are NOT having issues.</span></div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, I refreshed my preferences yet again and the open command again worked. &nbsp;I opened a few documents, quit and deliberately put my computer to sleep via the Apple menu then immediately woke it. &nbsp;MSW was OK. &nbsp;I put it to sleep again and waited about
 an hour before reopening. Launched MSW and went directly to the Open command. &nbsp;Hang and force quit ensued immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened MSW again in a clean user account. Open command worked (but I mistakenly quit MSW without cancelling the Open dialog box and that caused a hang). &nbsp;I reopened Word and it worked fine. &nbsp;I quit and put the computer to sleep with the clean account active.
 &nbsp;After an overnight of sleep, MSW still worked. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have taken screen shots and compared the 2 preference files and there are differences. &nbsp;When the Mac re-creates preferences from scratch in my main user account, they are different from those in the "clean" user account (I did not add or change anything
 in the clean account other than opening Word, creating a test doc, and taking screen shots of the Library prefs folder). &nbsp;One version works after sleep, the other does not. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot duplicate this issue in any other software (Excel, Quicken, TurboTax, etc.). &nbsp;I have used process of elimination to identify problem prefs and remove &nbsp;them, but the problem re-creates itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I also cleaned with ONYX.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone will make a real effort to resolve this. Please advise re: how to get a refund if this cannot be resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>UPDATE 3/18/17</p>
<p>Apple uploaded my log files and examined them. &nbsp;They claim all in the OS is functioning as designed. &nbsp;They see the MS Word hang incident but cannot see MS code, so don't know what is causing this. &nbsp;Tisky, you appear to work for Microsoft. &nbsp;Apple says this
 must be escalated to the developer level to resolve.</p>
<p>Again, I would like to discuss uninstalling MS Office and getting a refund, please.</p>

            <p>Hi Ichriste2,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understanding your feeling. </p>
<p>Now we know that the Word worked fine for almost a month and the issue happened a few days ago. As&nbsp; we test from our side&nbsp;in the same OS version and Word version with no issue, we&nbsp;would like&nbsp;to investigate more and we will contact the related team if it
 is necessary. We would like to collect information below:</p>
<p>1. As the Word worked fine before, what did you do before the issue occurred? For example, did you update or install something?</p>
<p>2. It seems you have contacted our Microsoft support, please provide the service request number and we will check the service history about the issue. You can navigate &nbsp;to the Office 365 Admin Center&gt;Support&gt;Service Requests, then give us the screenshot
 of the page. To protect your privacy, I have sent you message via Private message. You can access the link below:</p>

            <p>UPDATE: &nbsp;I started with clean preferences again. &nbsp;Set system preferences to no sleep. MSWord functioning fine. &nbsp;Opened numerous older docs and saved them in .docx. &nbsp;Quit and restarted Word. &nbsp;Restarted Mac OS. &nbsp;All OK. &nbsp;Restored my com.apple.dock.plist-related
 preferences by dragging from old saved preferences. &nbsp;Restart. &nbsp;All OK. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Put my screen to sleep briefly. &nbsp;Woke up. &nbsp;All OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restored my com. apple.systempreferences file from previously saved prefs. Restart. Hang. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Deleted old System Preferences pref to allow fresh to load. &nbsp;Restart. &nbsp;All OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re-set all system prefs a few at a time. &nbsp;Restart. &nbsp;OK twice, then hang.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Long story short, I turned off dictation in keyboards and accessibility. Restart. &nbsp;All OK.</p>
<p>Reset sleep commands and put computer to sleep for around 10 minutes. Wake up. All OK so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may all be due to a bizarre random issue, but it appears that dictation preferences ON has some part in it. Sleep may or may not be an issue if dictation is off. &nbsp; If this is so, this is pretty clearly a Microsoft issue. &nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Again, please advise whether you will fix it. &nbsp;Dictation is something I use frequently, so not willing to simply not use it. &nbsp;If my experimentation with Pages, etc. &nbsp;shows it is sufficient for my use and MS developers do not respond to this issue, I will
 still expect to uninstall MS Office and get a refund. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the updated information.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For further investigation, could you let us know whether you ticked the option ‘Use Enhanced Dictation’? Please capture two screenshots about the dictation settings in keyboards and accessibility
 for us.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Ran,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I did tick the option Use Enhanced Dictation after turning Dictation on in the Keyboard prefs. &nbsp;I then &nbsp;Enabled the Dictation Keyword Phrase in the Accessibility prefs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the issue is with the Keyboard prefs, since I do not recall turning on the Accessibility portion of Dictation until just before I spoke last with Apple (just before my original post).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would rather not interfere with my current status quo by actually checking boxes in System Prefs. &nbsp;So no screen shots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise if this will be fixed (and please inform your sales staff and Apple re: what you find so no one else wastes 2 weeks troubleshooting).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Active Sync Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> herbert joei  say:</h3>
<h2>            Active Sync Problem</h2>
                    
<p>Active Sync in Windows XP is saying that synchronization cannot be completed, disconnect and try again then start the troubleshooter. I did all of that and yet it still gives me the same thing. I can browse the phone's contents though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an HP 512 smartphone and this used to connect to my Work PC on Windows XP with active sync 4.5. I then synched this device with my mobile device center in Vista at home and then when I get back to work, I cannot sync with my work PC anymore.
 When I was at home, it worked perfectly and even synced with our MS Exchange at work. By the way, I only sync calendar, contacts and ultrasoft money with my home PC while I sync everything except Ultrasoft Money in my work PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is syncing with 2 PC (1 with active sycn 4.5 and 1 with Vista and Mobile device center) not advisable?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anybody have any idea how I can resolve this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>You won't lose data when doing a soft reset or restart. Simply power it down and up again and connect to see if that fixes the problem.</p>

            Let's try something else. On your device, go to Start - Settings - Connections - USB to PC and enable or disable Advanced Network Functionaility. Connect your device again.

<p>I have Mobile 6 standard. Under Connections, i can only see USB. When I go there the option is USB Device: Activesync or USB disk. Under the USB, there's an actiev sync setting menu which has either USB serial or RNDIS. USB serial was selected here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Btw, on my work PC (windows XP) i have exchanged configured in outlook (all contacts, tasks, calendar and&nbsp;mail are in exchange)&nbsp;while at home (vista) my outlook connects via IMAP. The phone retained the exchange setup but synched the contacts,
 tasks, and calendar on the Vista.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried restarting my PC and still the same. I even removed the exchange configuration on my phone already to see if it was the one giving me problems but the same error happened (i'm assuming it supposed to make a new partnership since
 exchange was removed on the phone already).</p>

<p>I also use WM6 Standard and the USB to PC option is the same to the one you described. You might want to try to switch to RNDIS to see if it works.</p>

<p>If the above does not help, try disabling email in the items to sync on your Home PC.</p>

Did RNDIS and still same thing.. i don't think i was able to set the email in outlook at home to synchonize with the phone because it said exchange is already configured that is why i was only able to sync contacts, calendar and tasks.. mails are being synched
 via the intenet&nbsp;at home&nbsp;when mobile device center connects.

            I'm getting this error code: 0x8502000e
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's saying that the phone is off even though it is perfectly working. I used to sync with my wireless network turned off so i don't know why it's doing this now. besides, i did not allow wireless connections when connected to PC. I enabled
 wireless network as well as allow wireless connections when connected to PC and still same problem

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also confirmed from my phone's active sync options that email is not being synced on my home PC. There are two groups and I can see exchange with contacts, calendar, tasks, email having checks while Windows PC2 with only contacts, tasks, calendar,
 ultrasoft money and favorites have checks on them.</p>

    <title>WM6.1 synch with WMP - why is all music synching - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lotusroom  say:</h3>
<h2>            WM6.1 synch with WMP - why is all music synching</h2>
                    I have an AT&amp;T Tilt WM6.1. I am using WMP 11.<br />
<br />
I opted for the default synching configuration to allow synching the phone (SD card) to synch with my music library and pictures library. And that's where the problems have started.<br />
<br />
All my music is synching. It's driving me nuts. I thought I would be able to select what to synch to my phone. Oh, I can select what to pick, but the system has automatically selected all my music. I thought I would opt out of automatically synching any music
 at all. Which it no longer does. But now I have added music to my library I want to synch it to my phone. Well, guess what? We are back where we left off. I can see the selection of music I have selected to synch, plus I see other things like "already on device"
 and "skipped" and other music waiting for synching - which once again I did not select.<br />
<br />
So, how do I stop this madness? I just want to synch my selection, not what WMP wants to synch. Once I can stop the auto synch all, I want go back and unsynch, I know not the word, the music I did not want. Is this simply a matter of deleting it from my phone?<br />
<br />
Next issue is pictures and videos, I don't believe they are being synched. How do I go about do synching pictures and movies on the SD card?<br />
<br />
Thanks all.<br />
<br />

            I stopped syncing media to my windows mobile devices a long, long time ago because it is just so slow and there's really no reason for me to do it.
<br />
<br />
The only reason you'd ever be required to sync music to your device is if you bought the music online and the music is DRM protected.&nbsp; Then, if you want to play this kind of music on your Tilt, you'd have to sync it in order to get the DRM rights transferred
 over to your device.&nbsp; But if you are syncing music you've ripped from your own CDs, there is no reason to sync and you will find it is much easier and faster to just copy it to your storage card.<br />

<h2>            Outlook calendar times seemingly change at random</h2>
                    Hi All,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm using Office 2011 Home and Business along with Lync 2011. What I'm seeing is this:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I set up an online Lync meeting using Outlook (create a new meeting and choose Online Meeting in the ribbon)</li><li>Set the times for, say, Wednesday from 1:00pm - 2pm Eastern</li><li>I invite some colleagues - some east coast, some west coast</li><li>Set up a recurrence of "Once a week"</li><li>Send it off</li></ul>
<div>Now, my colleagues report that the meeting shows up in their calendars at the right date, time and recurrence. However for me the time drifts and expands in my view. By this I mean that for this weeks occurrence, it's showing 7:00am - 1pm Eastern.... next
 week it's showing as 8:00am - 2:00pm Eastern...</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Has anyone seen this before?&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hello NickToone,</p>
<p>There are two occurences that I have seen this. </p>
<p>One is when there is a delegate that is in a different time zone than a manager and it managing the meeting request. This can cause some strange behavior in the meeting time.</p>
<p>The other is when there is a device that is synchronizing with Outlook and the device is changing the time on the meeting request.</p>
<p>Do you have either of these?</p>
<p>Tammy.M</p>

            Unfortunately that is a problem that happens quite often...<br />
<br />
The reason is that your phone (or better the phone with your product code) does not have Russian language natively installed. And the place you bought it installed it afterwards, that installation is lost when updating the phones firmware... :(<br />
<br />
Since language packs cannot be installed by yourself, help should be provided by a
<b>Nokia</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Point</b> to add languages to your phone. There may be a small charge for this service, depending on country and warranty regulations.<br />

    <title>Embedded Content Warning during PowerPoint Slideshow using LiveWeb - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Embedded Content Warning during PowerPoint Slideshow using LiveWeb Add-In</h2>
                    <p><span>I need to display a live website in my Powerpoint 2007 slideshow.&nbsp; It is a secured (https)&nbsp;site page&nbsp;displaying a live heatmap of our products.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'm using LiveWeb add-in from </span><a href="http://skp.mvps.org/liveweb.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://skp.mvps.org/liveweb.htm</a><span>&nbsp;which uses IE Web Browser control.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I use this add-in in PowerPoint for regular www.*.com sites, it works
 fine.&nbsp; When I try to use it for my heatmap site, the slideshow stops and prompts me to acknowledge that I recognize the content....etc.&nbsp; My slideshow is intended to loop continuously and uses timings to advance slides.&nbsp; I'm displaying this on a large screen
 in our lobby so needs to work without manual intervention.&nbsp; It does work, except for the slide with the heatmap site link that interrupts the slideshow with the warning popup (below).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I basically want to disable this warning during my PowerPoint slideshow.&nbsp; I have tried adjusting trust center options and even adding the site URL to trusted locations.&nbsp; Neither worked for me.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've opened a ticket&nbsp;with the software company that provides us with the heatmap capability to see if there's anything on their end that's causing the embedded content warning to pop up&nbsp;in my PowerPoint slideshow when LiveWeb tries to open the web page.&nbsp;

    <title>Can I run skype and powerpoint to present to a room and a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peterschexnayder  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I run skype and powerpoint to present to a room and a telecommuter&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a presentation which involves presenting to a room full of people via powerpoint and a smart tv as a peripheral. A key member will not be present and wants to telecommute. My question is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use an external webcam, secondary monitor, and smart TV as peripherals, can I present the Powerpoint on my laptop and Smart TV screens (2 screens for Presenter Mode), run Skype through the external monitor and external webcam (so that the telecommuter
 can see the table and they can see him) and share the Smart TV screen through Skype so he can also see the presentation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would allow me to look at my laptop screen to present and see my notes, allow everyone in the room to see the presentation on the Smart TV and also see the telecommuter, and allow the telecommuter to see everyone at the table as well as the presentation
 on the Smart TV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be using a Dell 7567 gaming laptop, running Win10, with an integrated GTX1050 TI, Intel i7 700HQ, and 8Gb of RAM run in 2 4-gig sticks (series).</p>
