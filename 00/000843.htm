                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously I groped all my skype accounts with some list (Work, Home,&nbsp;etcetera) but after&nbsp;I updated to the latest version all my lists disappear&nbsp;and I don't know how to create new one, or how to add contact to the list.<br />

</p><p>In the new Skype version, there's no option to create a list and sort your contacts to those lists. You can only create a group chat and then add people to those existing groups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wish to create a list for your contacts, you can install the classic version of Skype. To install it, please refer to the steps below:</p>

    <title>Problem With Contacts&#47;Email in Outlook 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chicago.irish  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem With Contacts&#47;Email in Outlook 2007</h2>
                    When I create an email and click on the "To:" button to select a recipient, I see their entry - but no email address (however, if I look in their contact record their email address is there). If I right-click on such a contact - which is currently about
 95% of my 1,000+ contacts - and click on properties, I receive the following message: "The Properties dialog box cannot be displayed. An invalid ENTRYID was passed in."
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've searched and been unable to find the resolution to this. Does anyone know?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>BTW - <b><u>AND I AM VERY HESITANT TO INCLUDE THIS</u></b> - this occurred after syncing with an HTC Thunderbolt smartphone, which I had for three days before jettisoning it in favor of a Droid Bionic. After that sync my contacts display in Outlook also
 switched from [<b>Last Name</b>, <b>First Name</b>] to [<b>First Name Last Name</b>]. PLEASE don't play the game of blaming this on HTC - clearly it's their fault but they ain't gonna fix it. I need one of you Office brains to please tell me how to fix it.</div>

    <title>new Hotmail interface - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> antonioaltamura  say:</h3>
<h2>            new Hotmail interface</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I just noticed the new outlook interface is now definitive.</p>
<p>I have a question: do you noticed it is ridiculously unusable with a low-res laptop (1280-900) in case of Windows set to have 125% dpi font?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beside the overall&nbsp;discomfort (I can see 4-5 email at a time without scrolling), the red arrow points to area to write a mail. As you can see I almost cannot use it.</p>

            You can pop it out into a new window - click the little icon expander icon at the top.

(It really should be down in the editor area too. And yes, the new interface isn't all that great in the opinion of many users.)<br />

            Not to my knowledge. You can vote for it at uservoice - I'm not sure this is the best suggestion already submitted, but it had the most votes of the suggestions i found and more votes means they will consider it. 
<br /><a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/601444-new-experiences-in-outlook-com/suggestions/31152913-seperate-window" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/601444-new...</a> 
<br />
<br />You can turn off the date grouping in Settings &gt; Layout - that can free up a little more space.  Using the reading pane on the right would help too, but probably not by much on a small screen - you trade more lines and more space for the reply either a narrow reading pane or the folder list hidden by default.

<h2>            Unable to upgrade to built 10130</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Updates May 29th - Not 10130</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, saw the 3 regular updates for May 29th.&nbsp; Did my thing and they installed without calling for a Re-start.&nbsp; Since I already had 3 of the last 4 updates messaging that they needed a Re-start, I pulled the trigger on a Restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The results are not good.&nbsp; I had an Windows Update Icon calling for C:\Windows\System32\wuapp.exe and this no longer works.&nbsp; I get a blue window for Settings and that is it.&nbsp; Settings now looks dead.&nbsp;&nbsp; I then called for Settings and I get the same blue Settings
 screen and that is it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also a Start10 and this is severely screwed up.&nbsp; Now looks like a mix of Start10 and the W10 interface.&nbsp; Reduced to junk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot tell if the updates are now messaging correctly or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, at a crossroads.&nbsp; I now see Build 10130 may now be available.&nbsp; Since I am a happy Start10, this could be causing interference with these updates.&nbsp; Rather than screw around, I am going to delete Start10 and see if I can install 10130.</p>

            I had the problem of the three and 10130 but the download was not moving.&nbsp; Went to Advanced options and moved to slow and then the 3 downloaded and installed. After reboot went back to Fast and waited on the screen until the drive activity light started
 to flicker and then arrowed back and there 10130 was downloading.&nbsp; My system toot a long time for the first of my 5 downloads to end and got to preparing to install.<br />

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Delete 200&#43; Slides I Created Accidentally</h2>
                    I was making a PowerPoint for a school project, and I somehow created about 270 blank slides (by blank, I mean that I did not type anything into them). I do not want to delete each one individually, and I did press "Ctrl" and selected several slides, but
 I kept messing up and my selecting progress deleted. Is there a quick and easy way to delete HUNDREDS of slides? I need to know ASAP! Thanks!&nbsp;

            Ciao,
<br />
<br />1) select the first slide you want to delete
<br />2) press and hold shift
<br />3) select the last slide you want to delete
<br />4) press del on keyboard
<br />
<br />Please let me know if this works for you.

<p>An alternate way, which isn't as easy but still works, is to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. go to "View" menu at top</p>
<p>2. select "Slide Sorter"</p>
<p>3. hold down the left mouse button and move your mouse up to select slides</p>
<p>4. once you select all slides you want to delete, right click on one of the selected slides</p>
<p>5. choose "Delete" from the drop-down menu</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may take a few moments to delete slides. If it says "Not Responding", give it some time and it will be fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

                    The option to manage skype's v8 updates and notification is removed, this is important for us, we have 100s for users around the world logged in to their computers as a standard user (not able to install apps), when a skype update is available my users
 are blocked from using skype until the admin credentials are used to update the app, we understand apps need updates to apply security and features, but we should have the option to do that at our pace and not being force

</p><p>If you are using the Skype version 8.xx there is no option to disable or to turn off the automatic update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system will be rolling out the updates and will ask you to install the latest version of Skype to ensure we&nbsp;&nbsp;introduce new features, improve existing ones and fix bugs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regarding the notification, if you are referring to your chat and call notification, you have an option to turn it off.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To turn off: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Sign in to Skype application </li><li>Tap your profile icon &gt; select <strong>application settings </strong></li><li>Under <strong>notification, </strong>toggle off <strong>chat notification </strong>

            Dear LSSUKu, 
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users using my experience with Microsoft products. 
<br />Thanks for your question!
<br />Can you clear the browser's cache and try in different browser?
<br />
<br />Let me know if it worked.

            I thought you are talking about Outlook on the web.  When you work with Outlook client I would suggest you to recreate the profile. This should solve the issue.

            Hi,
<br />To clear your brower Cache Hold the CTRL AND SHIFT KEYS and Press the DELETE Key Leave defaults checked and click on Clear Data. I would then Restart my computer to free up any memory held by other programs. 
<br />When your back up open browser and go to <a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/owa/</a>
<br />This should help resolve the search problem. Also check your search Filter by clicking on Search and to the right in the search field you will find filter select All will search all Folders.

    <title>Windows 7 Windows Explorer Preview pane - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Windows Explorer Preview pane</h2>
                    <p>Windows Support Engineer has requested I post this issue on this forum. I personally feel it is a&nbsp;Windows Explorer issue and not a Word issue, but I am doing as he requested.....:-)......<br />
</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>My&nbsp;<span>Windows</span>&nbsp;<span>Explorer</span>&nbsp;Preview pane&nbsp;<strong>lost the ability</strong>&nbsp;to view&nbsp;<strong>.doc</strong>&nbsp;files in the&nbsp;<strong><span>Windows</span>&nbsp;<span>Explorer&nbsp;</span>preview
 pane</strong>.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Windows</span>&nbsp;<strong><span>7</span></strong>&nbsp;Home Premium 64-bit</li><li>Office&nbsp;<strong><span>2003</span></strong></li><li><span>I have no problem whatsoever </span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">opening, viewing, editing, saving, copying, moving, converting, sending, etc. doc files any place other than in&nbsp;Windows Explorer.&nbsp;</span>The
 message "No preview available" appears in the prev pane when a doc file is selected. I used to be able to see the full contents of the document in the preview pane.</li><li>I&nbsp;<strong>CAN</strong>&nbsp;view&nbsp;<strong>ALL&nbsp;</strong>kinds of files in the preview pane&nbsp;<strong>EXCEPT&nbsp;</strong>.doc. I can view pdf, graphics (vector) files, and all kinds of usual and unusual image files.</li><li>I always&nbsp;<strong>used to be able to view .doc 2003 previews in the&nbsp;<span>Windows</span>&nbsp;7&nbsp;<span>Windows</span>&nbsp;<span>Explorer&nbsp;</span>Preview pane</strong><strong>!!!</strong>&nbsp;(Contrary to many old posts
 which say this is not possible.)</li><li>I have Sage Thumbs, DM Thumbs, and Pictus installed. I have already run the Repair Sage Thumbs utility, which usually fixes any problems with the Preview pane, thumbnails, and file icons.</li><li>Please do not suggest returning the system to a restore point.</li><li>Please do not suggest possible solutions which are not relevant to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Word 2003</span> and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows 7</span>....:-)....</li></ol>
<p>I assume some setting has changed somewhere (perhaps from some Windows Update?).</p>

            <p>I upgraded from 10586 to 14316 and the problem followed. I then imaged back to 10586. After upgrading to 14316 I&nbsp;did refresh in place reinstall of&nbsp;14316 , but no change. I removed everything from the registry related to Symantec, and SnagIt. I searched the
 local drive and removed all remints of both programs. Still shows in the notifications after rebooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know Symantec has problems with 14316 and it was uninstalled prior to upgrading to 14316, but the notification entries failed to be removed. and upgrading to 14316 did not remove them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There appears to be a major problem with the Show notifications from these apps section. I never messed with those setting in 10586, so I'm not sure when the problem appeared. I'm guessing with the new Notification section with 14316 there will more users
 paying closer attention.</p>

<h2>            Combining Skype Accounts</h2>
                    I have had a Skype account for years. Somehow, I accidentally opened another Skype account. I was about to close it, but there was a warning that it was necessary to communicate with Microsoft.&nbsp; This new account has hotmail&nbsp;or live domain in the name.
 Is that necessary, or can I use my old account, which has no domain name in my handle?

            <p>Greetings Ronaldreeves,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the Microsoft Support forums. I understand that you are receiving the error code: “<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">0xc101a053 (0xc101a053)” when attempting to play a movie.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I’m not sure if this was something you were able to download on your new console, but if so, and if you have enough licenses, you might try deleting the movie and re-downloading it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are streaming the movie, try deleting and re-downloading your profile and/or deleting and re-downloading the Xbox Video app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For information regarding <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/system/free-up-hard-drive-space" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 again it showed preparing to install. Like this, it happened about 7 times and every time after showing installing 7% or 25%, it starts showing preparing to install. What can I do to solve this issue?</p>

    <title>Weird problem in a formula in Excel. Never seen before, and can&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marywisdom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Weird problem in a formula in Excel. Never seen before, and can&#39;t fix it. HELP&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have an excel spreadsheet I have been working on for about a year, accumulating data for a grant application. It is basically about 10 columns wide and endless in length. So far I have data in about 3000 rows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several months ago, I had to produce some numbers for the grant app. I put in a simple COUNTA formula, to get the number of clients and not count the blank rows. It was =COUNTA(B3:B2991) and it worked fine. The formula is in the formula bar, and the answer,
 148, is in the cell where I put the formula.&nbsp; Now the weird part happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the last few months, I have inserted more rows as I had to add data from additional clients. So, today, I went to the formula, clicked on it, backspaced over the 2991 and changed it to 3535 to cover the added rows with data. Now the formula shows up in
 the cell as well as on the bar, and I CANNOT get it to display the number, the answer to the formula. I have even gone to a different area on the spreadsheet and&nbsp; entered entirely new formulas; they all show the formula in the cell, and won't give me the numerical
 answer. I even just changed the current formula range by 1 number, and it gives me the formula, not the number. But when I "undo" back to the original, lo and behold, the number(answer) is visible, not the formula.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the website and tried the tricks I saw there for seeing and hiding formulas. None of them make any difference. I would appreciate it if someone could please tell me what to do!&nbsp; I really need this and other formulas to work so I can get this report
 done!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And so I won't feel like I'm suddenly a complete lunatic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!!</p>

            <p>It sounds like the formula cells have been formatted as text. If so, you can select the cell with the formula and go to Format Cells (Ctrl+1) &gt; Select General, then hit F2 &gt; Enter on the cell to coerce the format to change.</p>

    <title>What use is Excel for iOS&#47;iPad&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sedge1955  say:</h3>
<h2>            What use is Excel for iOS&#47;iPad&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So far I haven't had a lot of use for the MS office products on my iPad. Today I found one, or so I thought.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Excel spreadsheet that I created with Excel for windows. It isn't a particularly complex spreadsheet. It has multiple tabs, numbers and text in columns and rows, some named cells, some &nbsp;simple BODMAS calculation and some sum() operations, borders
 and colours. The most complex thing about it is that it has one reference to another spreadsheet. It is a budget spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to change a few numbers. Don't need to start my computer! I can use Excel on my iPad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem #1: The spreadsheet is on google drive. Excel iOS can't work with files on google drive without making a copy. What a great way to get my budget muddled, having multiple copies. I don't think so!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So so I figured out a work around. My QNap NAS has cloud sync so I synchronised the google drive to my NAS and the NAS to OneDrive. Now I can get direct access to my spreadsheet from Excel for iOS via OneDrive. Not so fast!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem #2: When I try to load the spreadsheet on OneDrive into Excel for iOS it says the macros or functions used in the spreadsheet are not supported in this version of Excel, and it wanted to make a copy. Not even anything specific to identify what wasn't
 compatible. Back to square one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence my question! What use is Excel for iOS? &nbsp;I'm not about to start using an iPad to develop spreadsheets but I was hopeful it would be useful for maintaining them without having to go to my computer for every change.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Great question! This is a somewhat confusing topic. As you found out, macros are not supported in Excel Online. Currently there is no way they can compile or run VBA code living in a spreadsheet. Could this be made to work? Yes, of course it can. The only
 thing limiting us and our technology is us. However, the time it would take to make that happen is severely offset by what we can do, and that is to use a web-based language to leverage the power of automation in a browser-based application, i.e. Excel Online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the above info means Microsoft decided it would be a better direction to take Excel Online automation via Javascript instead of VBA. When you think about it objectively it's a smart move. Javascript is much more powerful and robust in a web-based
 app, and VBA is a very old COM tool and can't work across all endpoints. The transition between the two is proving difficult, as VBA is the industry standard in Excel automation. While it will be continued to be supported in Excel desktop, the same cannot
 be said for other Excel endpoints. There is a great many things you can do with Excel for iPad. Just look at the feature description in the
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-excel/id586683407?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
iTunes store</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you must have macros in your file, you basically have two options.</p>
<ol>
<li>Stay in desktop Excel</li><li>Translate your VBA solution to a Javascript one</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The latter is going to prove somewhat difficult, and in some situations impossible. The Javascript API isn't nearly as developed as VBA is. That being said, it's current release (v 1.4) is fairly robust, and Microsoft has been adding to it at a very regular
 cadence. Their commitment to expanding the API is inspiring towards future development. More information about the API can be
<a href="https://dev.office.com/docs/add-ins/overview/office-add-ins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
found here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure this isn't what you were looking for, but it is the current landscape for Excel and her automation story.</p>

            If you see that error message it is because your spreadsheet has them, regardless if you know it or not. Bottom line is VBA doesn't work on the web (i.e. Excel Online), and you can't load files into the client app with them. The only workaround is to open
 a copy without any macros. The recommended solution is to only open XLSX files in Excel Online. It's not optimal, I know, but it's what we have.

            I have had problems from the start with my machines (4) being seen on the network.&nbsp; I run Windows Home Server 2011 and it shows the computers as off line even when I log into the server with the machine that is shown as off line.&nbsp; I recently could not
 see the network with a W 10 machine and found network discovery was turned off.&nbsp; Turned it on and the network was visible.&nbsp; Note most of the time the launch pad can not find the server, yet I can open the shared folders, but do need to add my credentials before
 it will let me into&nbsp;the server.&nbsp; I have removed the server connector software and reinstalled, but still have the problem with not being able to find the server some of the times.&nbsp; Nightly backup is tenuous some times working and sometimes not.&nbsp; Think&nbsp;this
 is a&nbsp;wakeup issue where the W 10 machine will not wake up for the backup usually around 12:30-1:30 AM.&nbsp; I'll place an in-depth analysis later.

<h2>            Import timelines in Visio from MS Project shows different start date than it is in MS Project &#33;</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Hi Experts,</p>
<p>I have a project created in MS&nbsp;Project 2007.&nbsp; For graphical&nbsp;view, i normally import project data from MS Project 2007 to Visio. I'm doing this for sometime now and works fine.</p>
<p>But this time around, i'm facing a very strange problem. One of my projects created in MS Project 2007, start date is 28/10/2010 and end date is 31/5/2011 as can be seen in the top row in MS Project. Now when i go to Visio and do "Import Timeline Data" and
 select High level tasks and Milestone only, it is showing me start date of 5/2/2010 and end date of 31/5/2011.</p>
<p>In MS Project, despite of all my best efforts, i could not find this date any where. And if this date was their, it surely would have affected start date of the project in MS Project itself which is not the case.</p>
<p>Need your expert support and opinion on it.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Atiq</p>

    <title>Cant add person to existing Skype Call. When I try to add the Skype - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cant add person to existing Skype Call. When I try to add the Skype software window reboots</h2>
                    <p>If anyone call help I would REALLY appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having done this for over a year having this happen in the lat two weeks 96% of the time is very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The scenario:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get a landline or cell phone call into our Skype number, check that audio is fine and then click to add a Skype member to the call, who is a contact and has been called many many times before. I click on add, find there account name and click on them,
 hit add and the window that the software is in in Skype goes blue and looks like it restarts and I lose both people. It has happened say 15-20 times now trying to connect it. It has worked about 3 times when testing within my network (I call in on cell phone
 to the main account, start another Skype account on a different computer, dial into that account and all three connect just fine) and has worked once with two other people outside of the local network in my office. I did one yesterday for example and it worked
 like a charm, then 45 minutes later went to do it again and it kept having the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am on&nbsp;Skype version 8.32.0.44, on a Mac with El Capitain OS X 10.11.6, using a Yeti Mic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And again this has worked for at least a year.<br />
<br />
Obviously I dont know the situations for the other people, however it has happened with 4 different people on cell phones/landlines and 3 different people trying to use their Skype account.<br />
<br />
So yeah.. Not happy about this since we can't even replicate it to try to trouble shoot it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is welcomed. Skype Moderators I am looking at you :D<br />
</p>
<p>Side note.. You would think that Skype might have a phone number to talk this through since you know they provide call services and such.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />
Wes</p>

<p>
</p><p>Checking all the updates on Skype. The latest release should be on 8.33. I would highly suggest to uninstall the outdated version and install the latest one by these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Finder and search for “Skype” using the search feature in Mac OS X. Move all of the results returned to the trash.</li><li>Click <strong>Ctrl</strong> and the trash icon, and select <strong>Empty Trash</strong>.</li><li>Restart your computer.</li><li><a href="http://www.skype.com/go/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Download and install the latest version of Skype</span></a>.</li></ol>

<p>Bennie,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know you are trying to help, but that was 4 steps ago that I tried. I have done all sorts of experiments and configurations and nothing. This morning I had 4 failed attempts to add someone into a call that was already going with a cell phone. 4 times it
 dropped it. I tried on two different computers. They each have different versions of the OS And different versions of Skype and it still did exactly the same thing for 4 times. Then after we stopped trying with that person I tried it with my own cell phone,
 and the two computers and it worked fine. I even tried to call in a 4 source and it dialed them in as well and did not repeat the error. So I am totally at a loss here for all of this and really would like some real support from someone at Skype. We pay for
 a call in phone number so it's not like we are a free customer either, and yet I can't get anyone to connect with me to try to walk me through issues until we solve it. Would really like to keep using Skype since we have for over a year and it worked correctly
 until two weeks ago. Please let me know what can be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to let you know that if you are trying to merge an incoming call to an on-going call, this is not possible and this is probably the cause of the issue you are experiencing. But since you mentioned that you are using the Add People option. I
 will be forwarding this concern to our engineering team&nbsp;for them to further investigate&nbsp;and I will post back immediately to this thread once I&nbsp;have the&nbsp;updates.

<p>Benjie,<br />
<br />
No I have never had any illusions about merging a cell phone with a Skype account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have however done this for the last year or so at least once a week: A person calls in on a cell phone. I then add a Skype member to the call via them being on the Skype app on their end. I have done this literally dozens of times and have never had an
 issue. NOW when I get the cell phone or landline person on and go to add a person to the call through my contacts, the Skype application box resets and goes all blue then reboots to the main screen and all people are hung up on. I have had about 12% success
 with it over the last two weeks and most often it has worked where I call in with my cell phone to the main Skype account on my main computer and then add my personal 2nd Skype account running on a laptop in my office and they all connect and are fine. So
 I am very mush confused as to what changed. And for what it is worth. I have the latest SKYe on OS X Capitain running on the main computer and Skype version 8.32.0.44 (and Skype says it is the latest version and will not update within the app) running on macOS
 High Sierra 10.13.6.</p>

<p>Look at this page:<br />
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/language/office-language-packs-2010-faq-HA101828857.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/language/office-language-packs-2010-faq-HA101828857.aspx</a><br />
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/language/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/language/</a><br />
If they become available you can buy them there, I guess.</p>
<p>No, Office 2007 proofing tools will not work with version 2010 as far<br />
as I know.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t see messages from webmail after Outlook 365 setup</h2>
                    Yesterday I installed Microsoft Office 365 for the sole reason that I need access to emails over 90 days old that my webmail drops off post 90 days. However none of my messages are appearing within outlook. Even when a new message arrives, the little envelope
 pops up on the tool bar, however no message is visible. I can see it in webmail, can even send emails from outlook, but then nothing appears in the send folder. Some help appreciated?

<p>I guess that what you mean is the your mail provider has a limitation in only storing 90 days of mail?</p>
<p>If that is the case and the mail account was created in MS Outlook as an IMAP type, then that is a copy of what is on the server. And if OL is not functioning with new mail then either there was a problem in your setup of the mail account or you are using
 a filtered view of the inbox/sent folders.</p>
<p>If your mail provider only stores 90 days of mail then you need to setup the mail account in MS Outlook as a pop type, and in that case all mail is downloaded from the server to be stored on the local PC in the *.pst data file</p>
