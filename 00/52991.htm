    <title>Windows 7 does not assign drive letters to removable drives - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 does not assign drive letters to removable drives</h2>
                    <p>I recently removed Linux from one of my internal hard drives and resized the remaining windows partition to use up the space that was released. &nbsp;Since then windows will not assign drive letters to flash memory in my Akasa card reader and USB drives in are
 also not seen. &nbsp;I have tried all the solutions suggested:</p>
<p>1 diskpart automount enable</p>
<p>2 safe mode</p>
<p>3 assigning letter with Disk Management which showed the flash drive but without a drive letter - which give error message:</p>
<p>'The operation failed to complete because the Disk Management console view is not up-to-date. &nbsp;Refresh the view by using the refresh task. &nbsp;If the problem persists close the Disk Management console, then restart Disk Management to restart the computer.'</p>
<p>Needless to say I tried all that and the problem persisted.</p>
<p>USB drives do not even show in Disk Management</p>
<p>4 In device manager there are 4 generic volumes with a ! against them. When clicking on properties I get the message: 'Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware. The driver may be corrupted or missing. (Code 39)'. &nbsp;Tried updating drivers but
 it says they are up to date.</p>
<p>5 Ran the Windows trouble shooter which just went round and round trying to reinstall the generic volume drivers.</p>
<p>6 Tried a system restore to when the flash drives were visible - before I resized the disk (which showed up without a drive letter but disk manager quickly put this back). &nbsp;No luck with the removable drives though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tried anything in the registry yet. &nbsp;What should I try next?</p>

<p>nvlddmkm.sys STOP: 0x00000050 BSOD following me to the darkest ends of the earth, I need help!</p>
<p>My problem seems to be quite unsolvable, and no one seems to be able to give me a strait answer.&nbsp; Hopefully someone here has had the same problem I've been struggling for months with.</p>
<p>My home built computer has been problem free for a couple of years until now. I have an nvidia 9400GT video card and nForce 940 SLI chipset with 4GB SLI ready RAM, and an AMD 64 Athlon X2 6000+ CPU.</p>
<p>It started with windows XP, the infamous blue screen of death pointing to various nvidia drivers each time.&nbsp; A few months ago I upgraded to windows 7 64 bit, and a new hard drive.&nbsp; Upon installation, windows installed the drivers for my nvidia 9400GT video
 card by itself.&nbsp; A few months later I randomly got my first windows 7 blue screen error saying, STOP: 0x00000050 page fault in nonpaged area, and pointing to a file called nvlddmkm.sys.&nbsp; The same type of blue screen I was getting with windows xp. This led
 me to believe I had a memory leak.&nbsp; I ran tests, I FOUND NOTHING wrong with the memory!! AAHHH!!!&nbsp; These crashes seem random, and only happen maybe twice a month or less.</p>
<p>I have done weeks of research and tried almost everything suggested for this problem, I've tried:</p>
<p>-diskcheck on all drives.</p>
<p>-windows memory diagnostic 2 times, along with memtest86 with no problems listed.</p>
<p>- uninstalled all anti virus and gone with microsoft security essentials.</p>
<p>-updated video drivers.</p>
<p>-and I have stopped all start-up programs and disabled all non-Microsoft services.</p>
<p>-I also disabled any bios caching-shadowing.</p>
<p>-all fans are functioning, nothing is overheating.</p>
<p>The file responsible according to the blue screen was nvlddmkm.sys, an nvidia windows kernel mode driver version 196.21.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone can help I would really appreciate it.&nbsp; I'm almost to the point of junking my home made computer.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You can read and post the minidumps with the BlueScreenView utility (free) which is easy to use.<br />
It also avoids you having to upload them and saves time since all that see the thread can read the<br />
postings.<br />
<br />
Have you added any hardware lately? Have you updated any driver just before these started? (Check<br />
Control Panel - Windows Updates to see if any drivers were updated there about the time this started)<br />
Main likely culprits are Video driver, other major drivers, memory, and antivirus/antispyware/security<br />
products could be at fault as well as drive issues.<br />
<br />
Would be a good idea to remove all power and remove and reseat all cards, memory, and cables (on<br />
both ends) - do not just snug - actually remove and reseat. Of course if a laptop all you can do is<br />
reseat the memory.<br />
<br />
Use the troubleshooter below and refer to the next message for drivers and memory when you get to
<br />
those sections and then return back to the troubleshooter as needed.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000050<br />
<br />
Cause</strong><br />
<br />
The BCCode&nbsp;50 usually occurs after the installation of faulty hardware or in the event of failure of
<br />
installed hardware (usually related to defective RAM, be it main memory, L2 RAM cache, or video
<br />
RAM).
<p>Another common cause is the installation of a faulty system service.</p>
<p>Antivirus software can also trigger this error, as can a corrupted NTFS volume.</p>
Resolving the Problem
<p><em>Resolving a faulty hardware problem:</em> If hardware has been added to the system recently, remove
<br />
it to see if the error recurs. If existing hardware has failed, remove or replace the faulty component.
<br />
You should run hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer. For details on these
<br />
procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a faulty system service problem:</em> Disable the service and confirm that this resolves the<br />
error. If so, contact the manufacturer of the system service about a possible update. If the error<br />
occurs during system startup, restart your computer, and press F8 at the character-mode menu
<br />
that displays the operating system choices. At the resulting Windows <strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu,
<br />
choose the <strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> option. This option is most effective when only
<br />
one driver or service is added at a time. <br />
<em><br />
Resolving an antivirus software problem:</em> Disable the program and confirm that this resolves the<br />
error. If it does, contact the manufacturer of the program about a possible update.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a corrupted NTFS volume problem:</em> Run <strong>Chkdsk /f /r</strong> to detect and repair disk errors.
<br />
You must restart the system before the disk scan begins on a system partition. If the hard disk is
<br />
SCSI, check for problems between the SCSI controller and the disk.</p>
<p>Finally, check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help
<br />
pinpoint the device or driver that is causing the error. Disabling memory caching of the BIOS
<br />
might also resolve it.<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen
<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other
<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />

<strong>This is an excellent tool for posting Blue Screen Error Information<br />

<br />
<br />
Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however
<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />

<br />Click Identify... this will tell you what number your monitor is that you want to fix. 
<br />Click the box that corresponds with that number. 
<br />Then scroll to resolution and change the resolution to make it the size you want.
<br />Basically different monitors different resolutions can change the size of content sometimes.
<br />See if that works.

            PDF is adobe product not Microsoft. 
<br />So the only thing i can suggest is remove and reinstall the product.
<br />

            I would say that gaming is a hobby that takes you into different worlds for every type of game. Gaming can not only help you create friends through online modes, but it can also help learn more about real life situations, at least depending on the type
 of game that is. I can understand why it could have a bad influence on the young population, as it's harder to differentiate what you should do and what you should not do. But in the end, it is just a hobby for everyone to enjoy.<br />

<p>Gaming has helped me make friends (good friends) over the years and has also been a get away from the day to day (sometimes we all need to get away!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It has also later in life brought me closer to my son and daughter as we play together with games both digital and board games!</p>

<p>In my opinion games are the ultimate media product which combines talents of many artists including writers, designers, musicians, directors etc. This is why in an ocean of video game titles are go for those with a heart where talent is felt and the atmosphere
 palpable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issues raised by outsiders to the gaming community mention desensitization to violence, yet that is a very individual point of view that by no means should be generalized. The same was said about action movies and rock n'roll yet subjectively the problem
 is within each individual and own level of education.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My suggestion: take gaming for what it is, entertainment, and make the best of it be it in single or multiplayer. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Computer gaming trains different areas of the brain. It has a positive effect on the eye hand coordination. Some new studies show gaming helps on dementia and alzheimer's and so on. But critics don't want to hear that.</p>

<p>For me Gaming has given me some great memories.&nbsp; I remember playing Pong, Atari, and later Super Mario with my Dad.&nbsp; I remember Playing Zelda and my friends making Home made Maps.&nbsp; As the technology changed the friends and the memory spanned it's reach.&nbsp;
 &nbsp;I had some epic Races in PGR with friend in England,&nbsp; Some crazy Battles in Rainbow Six with friends in Florida.&nbsp; Now It's given me some great Family time.&nbsp; Playing mario Party with my kids, or watching them build things in Minecraft.&nbsp; &nbsp; I look forward to
 seeing how gaming will contribute to my future memories.&nbsp;</p>

            Gaming has been there for me be it building up a social network of friends who have supported me through bad times or just being an escape from real life. Its an important part of my identity and i like that it is becoming a more acceptable pastime and
 not just viewed as childish or a waste of time.

    <title>NOT ENOUGH HARD DRIVE CAPACITY FOR WINDOW UPDATE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karimalibay  say:</h3>
<h2>            NOT ENOUGH HARD DRIVE CAPACITY FOR WINDOW UPDATE</h2>
                    <p>I have been asked to update my Window to the 2018-03 cumulative update for Windows 10 version 1703 for x64 based systems (KB4088782).</p>
<p>Unfortunately the update could not take place because there was not enough memory in my hard drive (total capacity 104 GB 3.69 free).</p>
<p>I have been asked to free some space, removed all apps and some programs and also backuped all my files (picture, movies etc). Nothing is left in the drive except essential programs. Even with the help of an external hard drive to process the update there
 is still about 1.5 GB of free space needed on my internal hard drive. Update is still hanging and do not stop of asking for updating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I solution this issue? can I delete previous updates? should I reformat my drive? my computer has come with an old Window 8 that has been upgraded to Window 10. So a help is definitely needed and welcome. Thanks in advance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Kelly slater,</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Have you made any recent changes on the computer?<br />
•&nbsp;Do you have any third party CD\DVD burning software installed on the computer?<br />
•&nbsp;What is the exact error message you receive?</p>
<p><br />
This error message basically occurs due to software application installed on the computer.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p>Check if the issue persists in the safe mode.</p>
<p><strong>Start your computer in safe mode</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></p>
<p>Restart the computer to get back to the normal mode<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p>If the issue does not persist in the safe mode then perform clean boot procedure and check.<br />
To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>

<p><strong>Reset the computer to start as usual</strong><br />
After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
•&nbsp;Click <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>msconfig</strong> in the Start Search box, and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>.<br />
•&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
<strong>Continue</strong>.<br />
•&nbsp;On the <strong>General</strong> tab, click the <strong>Normal Startup option</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.<br />
•&nbsp;When you are prompted to restart the computer, click <strong>Restart</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 3</span></strong></p>
<p>Check in the event viewer to know the cause of the error message and post back with the details from event viewer.</p>
<p><strong>What information appears in event logs? (Event Viewer)</strong><br />

<h3> erneline lucille  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Upgrade to Windows 10 Black Screen and still in Windows 7 start up</h2>
                    Hello! I really need you help. I upgraded my Windows 7 netbook to Windows 10, but sadly, it did not work, only a&nbsp;<strong>black screen</strong>&nbsp;keeps on appearing whenever I&nbsp;<strong>restart</strong>&nbsp;it. I already watched tutorials on how to fix it, but
 all of them are already on Windows 10 start up&nbsp;<strong>when you click Ctrl+Alt+Delete, mine is still in Windows 7 and the Task Manager Option won't open</strong>, do you think the Media Creation Tool installed in a USB will help my problem or is this problem
 of mine will be fixed? I also tried&nbsp;<strong>rebooting the netbook, but F8 is not working because I'm using an external keyboard</strong>, my keyboard is already broken. I really don't have an idea that Windows 10 will turn out like this, I expected it to be
 smoothly installed. I hope someone can help me. Thank you very much!

<p>There can be many reasons for booting to a black screen. These screens may appear with or without the mouse pointer. The main causes observed are:
</p>
<p>Problems with the driver for your display adapter; </p>
<p>The video output is being sent to an unexpected port; </p>
<p>Please try these steps first if you’re booting to a black screen:</p>
<p>Blank or black screen <strong>before sign-in:</strong></p>
<p>Check your connections</p>
<p>Try connecting to different video outputs on the PC. Sometimes a change in driver can cause the video to be sent to a different display adapter or different output (such as from HDMI to DVI, or DisplayPort to VGA).
</p>
<p>If it is a desktop PC, try connecting to a different display adapter. If you are connected to an add-in video card, try connecting to the built-in video from the motherboard.</p>
<p>If you have a TV connected, make sure it is turned on and set to the input for the computer. Video output may be going to the TV.
</p>
<p>Or try projecting the output to a different monitor by pressing the Windows logo key and the P key at the same time, and then press P again and hit Enter. Repeat this 4 times to cycle through the screen options.
</p>
<strong>
<p>Use Safe Mode</p>
</strong>
<p>Try to boot into Safe Mode with Networking or Enable low-resolution video to fix the display adapter driver.</p>
<p>Turn off your computer 3 times while booting. Windows should automatically boot to the Recovery Environment after 3 unsuccessful attempts in a row.
</p>
<p>Once you are within the Recovery Environment, select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>, and then
<strong>Advanced options</strong>, then <strong>Startup Settings</strong>, and <strong>
Restart</strong>. When it restarts, you should see a number of options. Press 5 or F5 for
<strong>Safe Mode with networking</strong> (or try Low Resolution Video).</p>
<p>Open <strong>Device Manager</strong> and expand Display Adapters. </p>
<p>If you see 2 items under Display Adapters, right-click the integrated video card (e.g. Intel HD 4000 or AMD Radeon HD 4200), select
<strong>Disable</strong> and then restart your computer. If that doesn’t work, return to the Display adapter, re-enable the display adapter, and then disable the other adapter.</p>
<p>If you only see 1 item under Display Adapters, rollback the driver or uninstall the display adapter in Device Manager, and enable the option to delete driver software.
</p>
<p>4. Check the display adapter manufacturer’s site for an updated driver. We are seeing updated drivers from all of the major video chipset manufacturers. So the best driver will often be only days old.</p>
<strong>
<p>Black screen after sign-inand you can see a mouse cursor:</p>
<p>Unplug your external devices</p>
</strong>
<p>When you are at the black screen, try unplugging any peripherals you have plugged in at the time, and wait for a moment. If your screen becomes visible again, plug the peripherals back in one at a time.
</p>
<strong>
<p>Use Safe Mode</p>
</strong>
<p>If unplugging peripherals not resolve the issue, for each of the troubleshooting steps below, you will need to use Safe Mode to troubleshoot this issue. To enter Safe Mode:</p>
<p>1. Reboot the PC, and when you reach the sign-in screen, hold the Shift key down while you click the Power button and select
<strong>Restart</strong>. </p>
<p>2. When the system reboots, you will enter the Windows Recovery Environment. Select
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>, and then <strong>Advanced options</strong>, then <strong>
Startup Settings</strong>, and <strong>Restart</strong>. When it restarts, you should see a number of options. Press 5 or F5 for
<strong>Safe Mode with networking.</strong></p>
<strong>
<p>Reinstall your graphics card driver:</p>
</strong>
<p>1. Once you’ve entered Safe Mode, right-click the Start icon and select <strong>
Device Manager</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Expand <strong>Display Adapter</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Right-click your display adapter and select <strong>Uninstall</strong>. Then reboot your PC.</p>
<strong>
<p>Check the registry</p>
</strong>
<p>You may also see a black screen after signing in if the user interface has been replaced with software that is incompatible with Windows 10. You can check this in the registry.
<strong>Warning:</strong> This solution will modify the registry. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Prior to attempting these steps, you should
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span>back up the registry for restoration
</span></span></span></strong></a><span>in case problems occur. </span>
</p>
<p>1. Once you’ve entered Safe Mode, right-click the Start icon and select <strong>
Run</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Type <strong>regedit.exe</strong> into the <strong>Open</strong> text box and click
<strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Navigate to the following registry key: <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon</strong></p>
<p>4. Click to select the <strong>WinLogon</strong> key, and then, in the right pane, click
<strong>Shell</strong>. The value of Shell in the Data column should be <strong>explorer.exe</strong>. If the value of Shell isn't
<strong>explorer.exe</strong>, double-click <strong>Shell</strong>, and then, in the
<strong>Value data</strong> text field, enter <strong>explorer.exe</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Close the Registry Editor and then restart your PC.</p>
<strong>
<p>Check for a corrupted user account</p>
</strong>
<p>There could be a problem with the user account. To test this, create a new administrator user account and check if the new account also boots to a black screen:</p>
<p>1. Once you’ve entered Safe Mode, right-click the Start icon and select Command Prompt (Admin).
</p>
<p>2. In the Command Prompt window, type the following commands (changing "&lt;password&gt;" to something of your choice):</p>
<p><br />
<strong>net user test &lt;password&gt; /add</strong><br />
<strong>net localgroup Administrators test /add</strong></p>
<p>3. This will give you a test user to try to sign into. If you’re able to sign into the new account successfully without encountering a black screen, you may have a corrupted user profile.

 (The article is written for Windows 7, but the steps are the same in Windows 10, with the exception that "My Documents" is now only called "Documents".)</span></p>
<strong>
<p>Check for High Contrast mode</p>
</strong>
<p>You may be encountering a problem with High Contrast Mode. Once in Safe Mode, press the Windows Key + I. Then click
<strong>Ease of Access</strong>. Check <strong>High Contrast</strong>, and make sure it’s turned off.</p>
<strong>
<p>Shut down the RunOnce Processes</p>
</strong>
<p>There may be a problem with one or more RunOnce processes. To shut them down:</p>
<p>1. Once you’ve entered Safe Mode, right-click the Start icon and select <strong>
Task Manager</strong>. (Or press Ctrl + Shift + Esc.)</p>
<p>2. Check both the <strong>Processes</strong> tab and the <strong>Services</strong> tab, look for any instances of
<strong>RunOnce32.exe </strong>or <strong>RunOnce.exe</strong>. If you find any that are running, stop the process, cancel the application, or end the service.</p>
<p>3. Restart the PC.</p>

            Ditto... My notifications frequently show in the icon, but show as empty when I open the pane.&nbsp; And focus assist won't turn on and crashes when I try to open it in settings. This has been happening for about two weeks now. The notification problem fixes
 itself after reboot, but I'm not sure about the focus assist problem. Regardless, it always comes back after a few hours. There clearly seems to be a bug in the most recent update.

<h3> creziosuper  say:</h3>
<h2>            DLNA fuction &#40;&#34;Play to&#34;&#41; to show pictures in &#91; FULL SCREEEN &#93; mode.</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I'm using windows 8.1 pro x64 to replace my prior OS windows 7 pro x64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used DLNA function to see pictures on my HDTV(samsung HDTV F8000), which&nbsp;linked with&nbsp;"Play to" menu in Explorer.exe.</p>
<p>When I see large picture which has&nbsp;4000*3000 resolution in windows 7,&nbsp;TV shows the picture in Full Screen mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, when I switched into windows 8.1, even though I choose and "play to" photo(4000*3000)
</p>
<p>it only showed in small size photo. (4000*3000 picture&nbsp;turns into 400*300 small sized picture.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Is there any way to make it fit the whole size of TV screen like windows 7 does?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I saw&nbsp;WMPDMC.exe is the program of DLNA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems the program is making photos compressed for fast viewing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I can't find any setting adjust button to fit the screen in windows 8.1 or windows media player.</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>It´s NOT a solution refering to the link in Geethu´s answer, as there are NO settings available.. Picture show on TV, but it´s like a miniature picture in 640 x 426 even though the original picture is much bigger.</p>
<p>The link Geethu is refering to regards the general settings to be able to use Play To.</p>

<h2>            Phone call saying that I am entitled to a refund&#63;</h2>
                    I recieved a phone call today from a man with an indian accent calling himself Andy Smith. He said he was calling from the 'Windows Service Centre', his ID number was WT0208 (WT standing for Windows Technical) He told me that I was entitled to a refund
 of $241 AUS and and I'm thinking scam? But I went along with it, he got me to get this link off www.teamviewer.com and open it and then tell him the ID and password, then got me to go to Western union and click on send money. At this point I was thinkin 'wow
 now hold up a minute, why am I sending money when I'm the one getting the refund?' He says that because I was connected to them through teamviewer for them to send it I had to make an account and have at least 300 pound in my account. At this stage I got really
 over it and told him not to call me again and hung up. <br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure it was a scam but just wanted to check, has anyone else had the same thing?<br />

            Hello &nbsp;This message comes from the Netherlands. My mother in law received a call from the same "gentleman" an indian sounding man named Andy, who told her that she couldn't use her laptop,but that he was going to help her through the difficulties. Luckely
 my mother in law had the sense to tell ; I'll call my son in law and you can call in 5 minutes back. I arrived within a few minutes and the "gentleman"called again, he talked to my mother in law and she said ; here is somebody for you. So I told the man I
 was from the dutch police,cubercrime and wanted his full name and company's name. No No he wanted to talk to mrs.... ???? . He didn't know the name of my mother in law. So I asked him again for his name and company and the he stopped the call. His name was
 Andy from Microsoft and he was calling from a number in Holland 0243840015. When I tried to call that number it didn't repond. I think the number is used as a decoy. Maybe someone can do something with this information.

No, Microsoft would not call you unsolicited. Nor would they know if any errors <br />
existed on your computer. So those are frauds or scams, to get your money or <br />
worse to steal your identity. <br />
<br />
Avoid scams that use the Microsoft name fraudulently - Microsoft does not make <br />
unsolicited phone calls to help you fix your computer<br />

                    <p>Pressing windows + PrtScn does nothing. There also no screenshots folder in Pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They would save on one drive but i want them to save on my computer in pictures. Uninstalling one drive did nothing now screenshots wont save at all. I tried moving the old one drive screenshots folder into pictures but windows + PrtScn still does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a desktop PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: I tried using the on screen keyboard to take a screenshot and it worked and i remembered my keyboard has a windows key lock so i disabled it and it works</p>

    <title>How can I stop the Windows 8 magnifier from switching to fullscreen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christof christopherson  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I stop the Windows 8 magnifier from switching to fullscreen mode&#63; How can I stop it from blocking the task switcher&#63;</h2>
                    On Windows 8 I use the magnifier in docked mode at the top of the screen. Any time I use a modern UI app or the start menu it switches to fullscreen. This is very frustrating! Modern UI apps and the start view are difficult to use when I can only see a
 portion of the screen (this is especially a problem since most Modern UI apps are filled with wasted space containing no information).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also have a problem where the task switcher for modern UI apps is unavailable in the top left corner. This is because the magnifier blocks it. Hitting Win + Tab doesn't help because the top app is also blocked (meaning I can't right click and close it).</div>
                </div>

Looks like you should learn the Magnifier keyboard shortcuts then.&nbsp;&nbsp; Start with Win-Esc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Turns it off.&nbsp;&nbsp; But why use it docked?&nbsp;&nbsp; That's like XP's Magnifier?&nbsp;&nbsp; What about using the Loupe instead, when you need it?&nbsp;&nbsp; Ctrl-Alt-L.</p>

            It's a matter of personal preference in terms of usability which way I use the magnifier. I primarily use it in docked mode because it allows me to see the whole page and then read an entire line by putting my mouse over it. Lens mode is laggy and only
 shows a small section of what I want magnified so it's no good. Hitting Win+Esc is no good. If it's turned off I can't see small things and then I'd have to manually turn it back on again.
<div><br />
<div>I have come to a small compromise however. For anyone wanting to know how to make it less annoying...</div>
<div><br />
<div>To solve the problem with the start menu automatically going into full screen:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Option 1: If you want to keep the new start menu but keep magnifier on.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Open the start screen</li><li>Hit ctrl + alt + L</li><li>This will activate lens mode. It isn't great but at least the start screen + modern UI apps are usable</li><li>When you return to desktop it will automatically switch back to docked.</li></ul>
<div>Option 2: If you just really don't like the new start menu.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Install <a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Classic Shell</a>. This will allow you to go back to the old start menu so you don't have to deal with this issue at all.</li></ul>
<div>To solve the problem with not being able to close modern UI apps using the task switcher.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For this, I've just gotten into the habit of hitting Alt + F4 on a modern UI app. This will close it so that you wont have to manage it using the task switcher.</div>

<div>
<p>To my knowledge, there is no way to get docked magnifier to work when using windows 8 modern / metro apps.</p>
<p>The windows accessibility team in complete disregard to the visually impaired community decided to discontinue support for docked mode.</p>
<p>I’m working with a group to file a class action law suit against Microsoft, and ask that anyone affected by this will contact me.</p>
<p>Docked mode magnifier has been supported since windows 95, and no commercial alternative exist, since Microsoft made sure you can’t “dock” in the modern
 shell.</p>
<p>For people like me, who use X1300 (try it) full screen or lens magnifier is not an option, since you can’t see any usable amount of the screen.</p>
<p>Docked mode magnifier allows us to keep the screen as is, while having an area that magnified a large portion of the mouse/keyboard focus.</p>
<p>Full screen or lens magnifier are useless in factors above x1999. Furthermore, the full screen nature of windows 8 apps makes it extremely hard to navigate
 with limited eye sight.</p>
<p>And the windows 8 start menu with the large useless graphics is a painful experience. How about a text mode alternative for people who need it ?</p>
<p>Be ashamed Microsoft. It is not too late to show that you care. Fix it.</p>

<b>That was answered further up the thread.&nbsp;</b>

<div><br />
<div>I don't see how your responses help resolve the issue. As a software developer who has had to work with Windows 8 for the past 9 months I can tell you the accessibility is so bad that I will breath a sigh of relief when I delete the partition it's installed
 on.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've always held Microsoft products to high acclaim. I love office, Visual Studio and even liked vista (because I had a PC with hardware that could support it) but Windows 8... I wouldn't even waste my time to download it from MSDN never mind actually
 paying money for it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Back to the topic at hand. I recently came across another product which should help with the modern UI apps issue.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://www.stardock.com/products/modernmix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ModernMix</a>&nbsp;is another program (which unfortunately costs a small fee) which will put modern UI apps inside a window. This should mean that the magnifier will remain docked and provide other revolutionary
 features such as resizing applications!</div>

            I got the same problem except I like it in lens mode but when I switch to full screen it switches to docked mode at the top of the screen which is very annoying bc I like the lens mode!, I wish Microsoft would work the bugs out of their magnifier!

            I use lens mode and move the box around where I'm reading I just need it to read printing I can see pictures (I'm just near sighted so it's just hard to read words but I can see pictures) anyway I move the lens around the screen over the words I read,
 my problem is when I switch an app to full screen it switches the magnifier to docked at the top of the screen.

<h3> drsk1lzz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stereo Headset Adapter Mic Monitoring </h2>
                    
<p><span>Alright everyone, I need some help. I have the Turtle Beach Sandtrooper Headsets and there is no mic monitoring (hearing yourself through the mic) control on the headset unit itself, so I have to use the mic monitoring volume slider in the settings
 tab of xbox one. I like the stereo adapter because it makes the normal volume easy to control, so I use it. But once it is plugged in, the sliders in settings go away and I cannot adjust my mic monitoring on the adapter (or in the settings now that the volume
 sliders are gone) so it defaults to "Off" and trying to talk without being able to hear yourself is very difficult. So if anybody else has had this issue or knows a fix PLEASE let me know.

<p>If you use the adapter from xbox you will not be able to have mic monitoring. you can buy an adapter from turtle beach that allows mic monitoring. Xbox is being really dumb not letting people use mic monitoring with the xbox adapters</p>

    <title>Temporary Profile in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> earlzier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Temporary Profile in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 was functioning okay, but I was having problems with "scan to computer" with an HP wireless printer.&nbsp; The problem was apparently with a program running in the background, and since I did not have this problem in win7, Thought it might be due to
 a Logiteck webcam beta program that popped up and I installed; the only added program since the conversion to win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to uninstall the webcam program it hung up and would not clear, so I restarted windows.&nbsp; When my account came up I received and alert that I was in a temporary profile, and the message was obscured by the task bar, so the message is unclear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I return to my original profile?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that a recovery point would have been set when I installed the webcam program, but apparently the win10 conversion did not carry through the settings for my back-up drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE:&nbsp; I solved the problem by creating a new account and copying over all of my old folders into the new account.&nbsp; After making sure that I had all that I needed, I deleted the old account.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only annoyance was that I could not use the identical account
 name for the new one.</p>

            <p>August 11th was very scary - but the 12th was much better! On the 11th, I started the Windows 10 Upgrade on my wife's computer - all went smoothly until my wife logged in. All the data had disappeared - except for some Desktop shortcuts, and the Recycle
 Bin (!). &nbsp;Restarted, tried again, realised I had missed the quickly disappearing 'Temporary profile' message, searched for the data, looked in Windows.old - hopeless. Of course I had not done a back-up. All my wife's work for years back had been apparently
 destroyed, by me. She was very calm about it, but I was extremely depressed.</p>
<p>Then the next day, she logged on again - and there was everything was there,as it should be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you, thank you, Microsoft - but why did you not tell me how the process was going to work? Tell everybody? I can just imagine an episode of our daily radio soap 'The Archers' with Tony yelling at Robert Snell &nbsp;"But where the hell are all the farm records?",

<p>Commiserations! It seems scandalous that Microsoft has failed to reply to this - everything I have read misses the point entirely. There is not even a reassuring noise. I do hope your data reappears, but the evidence so far suggests the solution will not
 come from Microsoft.</p>

            <p>In Windows 10 MOST PC's startup with temporary profile, after an 'unexpected' shutdown.</p>
<p>(unexpected shutdown=power failure, program crash or shutdown by holding the 'power' button pressed for more than 5 sec.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot access your data when logged in with this profile, but your data and settings are still present on the hard disc.</p>
<p>A normal 'shutdown'-'startup' (=fast startup) will keep starting with the 'temporary' profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However a FULL restart (=slow startup) should solve this behaviour.</p>
<p>On the START menu, click the power icon <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres1.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2f6.2%2fmain%2fb6520ebc-1730-4dd9-9eea-71790654dfaa_5.jpg" />&nbsp;and click Restart.</p>
<p>

            <p>I have the same problem. I have two brand new machines with factory-installed Windows 10. On one of them&nbsp; whenever I shut down (not sleep) and then later power the machine back up again, Windows 10 will do one of two things after I enter my PIN:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) it goes into a seemingly endless sequence starting with (a) "Preparing Windows" - it does this for perhaps 15 minutes, followed by (b) a totally blue screen with the circular "waiting" indicator saying "Just a moment"; it stays in this mode indefinitely
 until I forcibly power down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp;or it&nbsp;logs me in with a temporary profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is intermittent. It happens on only one of the two machines, first of all, so it may be hardware related, but otherwise both machines seem to work flawlessly so that seems weird. Also it is more likely to happen when the one machine (the one
 that fails)&nbsp;has been shut down for several hours. If I power cycle the machine fairly quickly, the problem does not seem to recur. Both of my machines have solid state boot disks so this cannot be a problem with disk "spin up" because nothing is spinning up.
 Nonetheless I will do some experimentation with maybe waiting longer before I try to log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember having this same problem with Windows 7 (on another machine)&nbsp;but it lasted only a brief time and I cannot remember what fixed it. It is as though Windows cannot access&nbsp; your profile just after a restart, due either to some disk failure or some
 other failure; it is probably some timing thing. I was starting to think maybe my machine has a bad disk, but then I read your complaint here where you upgraded a formerly working machine to Windows 10, suggesting that you are not having disk problems because
 you are using a machine that formerly worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here we are again. I guess I will comb through the complaints about this same thing in Windows 7 to see if there are answers there. Meanwhile, it is just one of the seemingly endless annoyances of owning complex systems that seem endlessly to have problems.</p>

            An update: my problem just went away after a couple of restarts. I've had so many other problems with Windows 10 that have caused me to waste so many hours that I've not revisited this problem that seemed to solve itself. I have no idea why my machines
 are both working now. As with most Windows problems, the total silence of Microsoft on this issue is extremely disturbing.

            Thanks for the offer to help, S. Sengupta. I tried the suggestions in the link you posted, but to no avail. The first suggestion showed a message saying the exe could only apply to Windows XP and Vista. I am Windows 7. The second suggestion, I followed
 the map to Windows on the data folder, opened Windows folder but there was no DRM folder to update. I was smart (lucky?) enough to have burned all my music downloads to CD for back up. I ripped them to the music folder, they showed up as unknown. So I did
 a web search for the album info and was able to edit the unknown album for title and songs. Only one of my downloads was not copied to cd, so I will re-download it. &nbsp;Thanks again.

            We appreciate your response. As an alternative option, if you have a friend and/or relative who are residing/lives in an official launch/released country, he or she will be able to set up the service (repair/replacement) request on your behalf. Then he/she

<br />
Please be advised that in this scenario, sending the device to and from the non-launch country to friends or family in a launch country and then to the exchange center and back is a customer's responsibility. Microsoft will only pay for shipping to and from
 the exchange center and an address in an official launch country. The option to ship directly to an exchange center from a non-launch country is currently unavailable.

<p>
</p><p>After installation, I find that the PC could not detect the mouse. I could not use the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I know how to restore the mouse function when I could not even use the mouse?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Win 10 have a good driver for this device?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
To address your concern, we suggest that you temporarily use a wired mouse to be able to install your software.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

            <p>I managed to get into Advance Start Up by using the Window Key + Shift + TAB key and Restart &nbsp;Button on the Keyboad. From there I go to System Restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this process, the mouse is working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

 all I see is regular wolfs do I have to wait in one area or look around? Also what is the fastest way to level up&nbsp;( I try to google it but its posts from a long time ago and don't apply anymore) &nbsp;If anyone plays and wants to add me to help me out Id appericate
 it also. </p>

<p>Rabbits are all over the plains. Just ride around and you'll come across one. For the wolf boss, you must kill all the regular ones first, then the boss will show up. This is the same for all the legendary animals. Fastest way to level up is to wait until
 there is a triple XP event which they normally announce on facebook and twitter. Then grind your way through Pike's Basin gang hideout.</p>
<p>I hope that helps!</p>
