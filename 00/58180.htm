<h2>            Can&#39;t sign into any of my accounts on my xbox one s</h2>
                    I was playing fortnite and i restarted my xbox really fast because the game was being laggy, when i try to sign back in to my account or any of my brothers or familys accounts, it says "THERE WAS A PROBLEM, We couldn't sign you in. Try again in a few minutes,
 or check your account by signing in to account.live.com. Sign in: 0x800488FC" and so i look up the link and i get a white screen that says "bad request" so i have no idea what to do. if someone could help that would be wonderful. i can not sign in to any of
 our accounts or play any games or do anything past the home page. how to fix?

<p>Question is Hardcore player, casual, Motion control hardcore, or motion control casual?</p>
<p>Actual question: Should&nbsp;developers&nbsp;spend more time talking about&nbsp;games for hardcore or casual or should it 50/50. Can Developers or Companys promote all the categories or is it fair ti shine more than the other. Do you think&nbsp;motion control gaming is the
 next Hardcore or will controllers all ways be&nbsp;first even 20 years from now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Its hard to say really, Motion control is better and more entertaining for casual players like children and family's. But for hardcore players the tech is just not there yet. The one problem I see is that FPS is the biggest format for any system and motion
 control cant yet exceed in this area.&nbsp; And some players prefercontrollers because that's what&nbsp;they are used to and in some games its the only choice.</p>
<p>If you look back about 20 years ago, alot of systems used about 3-4 buttons and ran at&nbsp;about 8-16 bit graphics. 10-15 years l8r controllers have moved on to about 14-15 buttons. So yes I can see in about 20 years controllers will be replaced but motion control.
</p>
<p>But motion control needs to be&nbsp;improved and also remain simple to use. If motion control becomes easier to use then a controller, then I think hardcore players may make the switch, however&nbsp;it isnt&nbsp; for everyone so company's need to make sure they continue
 to develop games&nbsp;with still supports controllers. Or hardcore players may move onto a format with does support their play type.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response Imo I feel like motion control is feared. With every announcement like Graw's E3 demo or Fable alot people we turned off. I saw potential and I saw it being easier to use for some disabled people even ones wheel chair bound. I just
 don't want to have to stick with the controller now that I see the conrtroller is not important as it used to be.</p>

<p>I really don't see it lasting too long in the general gaming community, at least not as a replacement for traditional controllers. Look at the Wii... It sold ridiculously well, and now the majority of them collect dust. The ones that don't are pretty much
 limited to little kids, the handicapped &amp; retirement homes. Move isn't exactly moving off shelves, and Kinect... Well, yes, it is selling, but so did Wii. There isn't much outside of fitness programs, some sports games (like bowling), and a few other very
 specific genres/games that controllerless control is really appropriate for, even if done well. I hate the terms casual &amp; hardcore, and try to stay away from them, but motion control is only really well suited to casual type play. Maybe it will catch on, but
 as successful as the Wii has been, even Nintendo isn't continuing with it (at least not&nbsp;primarily) next generation. If Kinect is to become any new kind of standard, Microsoft is going to have to ram it down their player's throats &amp; really give them no other
 choice.</p>

<p>TC, or anyone else interested in this subject, check out this book, recently read it myself-
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Casual-Revolution-Reinventing-Video-Players/dp/0262013371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.amazon.com/.../0262013371</a></p>
<p>I would consider myself hardcore-- though I don't have nearly as much time to play as I'd like, I get very deeply invested in my games, and have been playing since very young. I'd say my knowledge of gaming and the industry is above average, at least for
 an adult woman. Also, I do not like motion controls. First, the games I enjoy (RPGs and open-world do-anything games) really do not need them, second, I have plenty of hobbies that keep me active, and after a long, stressful day at work, I just want to plop
 back in my comfy papasan chair with a regular control and veg out. </p>
<p>I do see casual-hardcore as a spectrum with a lot of gray areas, though I do think that the one thing developers should NOT do try to appeal to both extremes of the spectrum with the same game. It never seems to work. Try to go after part of the spectrum,
 but not all. That said, I want them to develop both. I may not be into "casual" games as much (easy-to-learn games that require little time investment per session-- simple puzzle, games, solitare, ect.), though I admit I love ones like Tetris and Mah Jong,
 but I know the importance of the audience. Because of such games, gaming has become more the norm than NOT gaming.

<p>I still have no idea how playing games can be considered 'hardcore.' Is it the amount of time you spend doing it? If so, then why are there 'types of games' that are supposed to cater to types of players. It really makes no sense. If a game is great, I'll
 &nbsp; buy it, regardless of what it is supposed to cater to.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if you were answering what hardcore is xPlayBoyMagicx. I appreciate the attempt, if you were. I come from way back video games days, so I see all the breaking into groupings as a purely subjective idea. If there are some actual guidelines to
 all of it, I would find it interesting. I guess you may be saying that people who mainly use controllers, and to my experience, everyone fits that. So confusing.

            The easiest way is to log a support case on the website.&nbsp; You can go:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/devices and select the device from there.&nbsp; If you do not see it listed, you will want to add the device and you can initiate a warranty repair request
 from there.

<h2>            Windows 10 Photos App - Unable to add a specific folder</h2>
                    <p>Trying to use the Windows 10 Photos app but it only sees the Picture folder and the OneDrive folder on MY PC.&nbsp; When I go to the Photos app settings to add manually a folder and I click on the Add a Folder button,&nbsp; nothing happens.&nbsp; I do not get an explorer
 screen that I can use to browse to the Z drive which contains my Pictures I want to view in the Photos app.&nbsp; I also do not get an address box where I could manually type in the folder address, the Add a Folder button does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried resetting the app using the App advanced option in settings with the same results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I manually add a folder that the app does not find? Is there a config file I can manually edit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Windows 10 Pro version 1709&nbsp; - 16299.248</p>

            Hi Charles,
<br />
<br />Is the Z drive a network drive, if not the only thing I can think of is in Windows the  Z drive letter is usually reserved for a network drive and maybe this is causing a conflict . . .

            <p>Hi Arul,</p>
<p>Thanks for replying. Its only 1 computer I am trying make the HP Officejet 4680 printer to work correctly from. I cannot scan from the "HP Solutions" icon on my desk top. Each time I try to use the icon and select "scan a document" a "cannot find scanner"
 message comes up with a "8,[(1,0,-2147221164)]" error code. The printer used to work fine with Windows 7 (my previous operating system) I can do all the usual print functions barring the scan from the desk top icon. I have also tried all of the suggestions
 you have offered earlier but to no avail.</p>
<p>To answer your Qs&nbsp; 1 I have a USB connection to the printer. The second computer, a laptop, prints ok via wireless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 I can print anything that appears on screen, on either computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 The exact message is: "This tool has detected a problem with the printer front panel scan settings. Start HP solutions Centre, choose Settings, scan settings, scan to setup, and add available scan shortcuts to printer front
 panel list to resolve this problem."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This I have tried a few times now and it all turns to rats when I select "scan to setup. An additional error messge I get is: "The HP imaging device was not found.Try the following steps. After each step, try scanning again. 1 Turn off and unplug device,
 wait 60secs, and plug in and turn on the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2 Make sure cables and cords are correctly attached, and device is turned on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3 Reboot computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4&nbsp;Reinstall Photosmart software that came with device."</p>
<p>It then goes on to show the number error code I have given you.</p>
<p>I hope you can still help .</p>
<p>Thanks Tony</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today being 21st August, I'm going out to purchase a Windows 10 compatible printer. It will save a lot of frustration on both my part and yours. Thanks for your help thus far. I'll flog this HP piece of **** and wish good riddance to it.</p>

            <p>The problem still exists. I went to my local PC World store to seek a replacement printer and 1of the knowledgable assistants explained that W10 had teething problems like any other Microsoft updates/upgrades.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;He said I had 3 options. &nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Wait until a driver update comes out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Uninstall the HP driver and use the &nbsp; &nbsp; W10 basic scanner driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Buy a new printer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am operating the scanner from my desktop screen currently using the W10 installed basic scanner driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not ideal, the scanner is getting on a bit, and I've seen a good deal for a Brother printer in Costco.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your interest and help. You can mark this query up as answered but not resolved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.&nbsp;</p>

            Consider the problem fixed. I have been working with a new brand of printer for about a week now and it works just fine and just how the other one used to. The answer for me was to dump HP if you want to stay with Windows 10.

<h2>            Skype for Business Online Missed Conversations time wrong &#47; mobile devices</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other threads with this topic, and it seems to be a known issue for a long time already.&nbsp; I wanted to add my own thread to get it documented that we would like a solution to this problem as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have many different mobile devices (Windows 10 phone, iOS phone, Android phones) and multiple Windows 10 desktop clients.&nbsp; It seems that if a mobile device is logged in to Skype for Business and is running in the background (while I am not using the device),
 if someone messages me and I am away from a PC that I am logged into Skype, I will get a message about 2-3 minutes after someone IM's me with a subject of Missed conversation with ..., and it has an incorrect time stamp of 2 hours before the IM was actually
 sent.&nbsp; We are in Central time.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have had an issue that I verified all of my Skype for Business mobile clients were completely shut down, but still received the Missed conversation with ... email.&nbsp; This normally doesn't happen if I am not logged into any of my mobile devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desktop clients that I use are Outlook 2016 and Skype for Business 2016.&nbsp; We have others still using Outlook 2013 and Skype for Business 2015.&nbsp; Our mailboxes and users are in Office365 for both Exchange &amp; Skype for Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The time of these conversations are correct when viewed in Skype for Business and it’s only the missed conversation emails that are incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, please fix whatever is causing this from the mobile device side, and contact me for any troubleshooting that needs to be done.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks<br />
Dean</p>

            <p>Hi Dean,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your post. I would like to know if the time on your PC (applies to Outlook client), Mobile phone and OWA have the same time zone. You can refer to this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/time-zone-and-language-settings-in-outlook-web-app-5565cc28-bc5c-47f1-849d-b57f1ffdfb53" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> on how to set the correct Date and time zone in Outlook on the Web (OWA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next try to minimize the Skype for Business that is currently logged on to PC and mobile devices. Try to test 1 mobile device or 1 desktop sign in on Skype for business and check if there is any improvement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Paul,<br />
<br />
Downgrading from a pre-installed <strong>Windows 10 Pro</strong> (OEM) to Windows 7 is possible.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>" </em></strong><em><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/learn-more/brief-downgrade-rights.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">For Windows 10 Pro licenses acquired though an OEM, you may downgrade to Windows 8.1 Pro or Windows 7
 Professional.</a></em><strong><em>"</em></strong><br />
<br />
If your system came pre-installed with <strong>Windows 10 Pro</strong>, you’d need to download or borrow a Windows 7 Professional disc.<br />
To learn more, read through Andre Da Costa's response on this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/windows-10-pro-downgrade-to-windows-7-pro/af75eaa2-c86d-4686-b33e-8a86cdfd9957">
thread</a>.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, if the pre-installed OS is not Windows 10 Pro, you will have to purchase a Windows 7 license.</p>

<p><span>Hi summer lady,</span></p>
<p><span>You need to press Shift key and then press underscore key on the keyboard to place an underscore. Ctrl and plus (+) key increases the size and appearance
 of page, file and folder icons and similarly Ctrl and minus (-) key decreases the size and appearance of page, file and folder icons.</span></p>
<p><span>Have a look at the following article link or more information on Keyboard shortcuts:</span></p>

<h2>            IrreparableSolidities.dll error on Startup-Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I followed the instructions on the Internet and ran an Administrator command prompt &nbsp;(sfc /scannow) and it scanned my mum's computer. (she is constantly getting an "IrreparableSolidities.dll" error on startup. I removed all programs that I didn't
 recognize, then did a full McAfee scan (paid up-to-date) and restarted). I cannot even find this .dll error doing a Google search!<br />
It found nothing; however, when I did the command prompt thingy, I got a message to check the log file and here's what it said:</p>

<p>This is what the error looked like when Mum restarted her computer (I was helping her with TeamViewer from my house). I can't figure out this one. I did a search on her computer for this .dll file, but nothing was found. I checked what runs on startup,
 and nothing is "weird", just the usual stuff. I googled this .dll file, but Google actually found NOTHING! Very bizarre. I was hoping at least one person in the world had this .dll error on startup. Thanks. Mitchy.</p>
<p>Now I don't know what to do with the error log. Please help!</p>

<h3> aflyingcougar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hardware Causing Windows 10 to Freeze&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am having random complete freezes happen on my pc where the computer is entirely frozen - no response to any input. The only way to fix it is to long-hold the power button to restart the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 Pro with the following hardware:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel i5-6500</p>
<p>Asus GTX 1060 6GB</p>
<p>Mushkin Triactor 3D 512 GB SSD</p>
<p>16 GB DDR4-2133 G.skill RAM</p>
<p>Gigabyte H270N-WIFI Mini-ITX Motherboard</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a suspicion that it's the SSD. I can see the crash in the Windows Reliability History. What files would I need to provide (if any) to help figure out which piece of hardware is the culprit??</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Hi CjTulowiecki 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />
<br />Expand the IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers section
<br />
<br />Right click the device you find in there and choose Uninstall
<br />
<br />Restart your PC, Windows will then load a new driver for that device
<br />
<br />Check  to see if your system still freezes
<br />
<br />If it does:
<br />
<br />Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc)
<br />
<br />If necessary choose the Processes Tab
<br />
<br />Leave that window open to monitor your system
<br />
<br />When these freezes happen, is your Hard drive, CPU or RAM overly busy at that time?
<br />
<br />If so, if you can, click on the appropriate column header, so the arrow faces down
<br />
<br />What are the top 5 processes at that time?       
        </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link to my onedrive upload of some of the event logs. There were several (maybe 50) around 11:17 am, which is when the crash happened most recently. I saved ones that looked suspicious. Let me know if this helps. Thank you!</p>

<h2>            &#34;Sorry, we couldn&#39;t connect to Microsoft services right now.&#34; message pops up when I try and add my account onto my Windows 8 computer</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently got a computer from someone, with&nbsp;their Microsoft account still signed in on the computer. I have another&nbsp;laptop signed into a&nbsp;Microsoft account&nbsp;and would like this computer to be synced with it. I have tried&nbsp;several times to sign into my account
 under 'add account'. I&nbsp;entered my email address, and hit 'next', and a message&nbsp;popped up saying, "Sorry, we couldn't connect to Microsoft services right now." I am able to browse the internet, and my computer shows that I&nbsp;have a wireless network connected
 to it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really appreciate any help I could get on this problem, because I only have trouble signing into my account on my computer's 'add an account' setting, and can sign into it on the internet fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>I've been experiencing a problem since I bought my Windows 8 computer 10 days ago. When I initially set up the computer, I did so using a local account. I've since created a Windows account and have tried many times to create a new user
 with that Microsoft account, but each time I get the error message; "Sorry, we can't connect to Microsoft services at the moment.................." I've tried almost on a daily basis to create a new user, but each time I get the same error message.</p>
<p><br />
I'm also unable to go to Windows Store to carry out any downloads because I never get a connection. All I get is a green screen with the revolving disc. Exactly the same with other Apps. (Music, Games etc.)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have looked at other similar errors reported and have tried a couple of the resolutions suggested by support staff, but to no avail. (e.g. Apps.diagcab, microsoftaccounts.diagcab.) I've also disabled installed programmes in start-up,
 but again, to no avail.</p>
<p><br />
I'm hoping to upgrade to Windows 8.1 to resolve the problem, but the only way for me to do that is through Windows Store, so I'm in a catch 22 situation, as I can't gain access.</p>

Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have exactly the same problem in a PC that I have just reverted to factory status (what Windows 8 calls "Full Reset)!!! I have not even installed any program yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried the 4 "solutions" stated by Wandrille, and also tried with "sfc /scannow" and a "refresh" of the PC (despite the fact that I just had done a Full Reset).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of all this worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please, can someone from Microsoft answer to this question?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Nicolas</p>

First of all, thank you for answering...
<div><br />
<div>My&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Microsoft Account Sign-in assistant service was already set on automatic and was running. But for the sake of it I stoped it and set it manual then restarted, still same problem, then I set it back to automatic and restarted,
 nothing changed still got the same message -&gt;</span></div>
Sorry, we can't connect to Microsoft Services at the moment...
<div><br />
&nbsp;
<div>What to try next?</div>

            <p>I have been living with this problem for more than 1 year and tried all options (except reimage which I don't want to do that as I have data and s/w) and nothing works. I don't know how many hours spent searching for the solution and no luck till today.
 The problem started as soon as I switched to "local account". I am not able to switch back to MS account to connect to store. Not worth it :-(( Looking for new OS which is simple (like Windows-5 or XP or older version) and easy to use instead of wasting lot
 of time/money with advance technology with no use :-(&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any how thanks for keeping me busy!!</p>

<p><span>I have been having the same issue and the whole situation is incredibly frustrating. I had to reset my surface tablet because it spontaneously started deleting some of my apps like music, video etc. and wasn’t allowing me to reinstall anything. I think
 it was doing this because my C drive was running low on space, even though I never save anything to it; I save everything to a mini SD card. I had this same problem 2 years ago and had to do the same thing.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However this time after I reset it, it made me set everything up with a local account. So I made up some random name and password. Then I had to go through setting everything up again; backgrounds, pinned to start, device setting. Everything except
 my apps which I couldn’t access without my Microsoft account. All throughout this process, I kept trying to switch from the local account to my Microsoft account in my settings and I got the same message “Sorry we can’t connect…“. I tried constantly over a
 48 hour period&nbsp;without success&nbsp;and after setting everything up, I found this forum page.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The services.msc thing looked promising. Mine was on manual, I switched it to automatic and restarted the device. Same problem, nothing changed. I had to have my apps back, so I went to the store, tried signing into my account.
 I tried again to switch to a Microsoft account, which didn’t work. So I used the option at the bottom which says “Sign into each app separately instead (not recommended)”. This at least allowed me to see and reinstall all my apps one by one. Although it had
 not saved my progress in a game that I had for 2 years&nbsp;which was disappointing. It’s not ideal, but at least I can used my device the way I used to before.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I’ve have always used Windows products, but it’s very disappointing when stuff like this happens. I’ve read about people who have had this problem for years and not received help.</span></p>

<p>And I've tried the steps recommended. It's very frustrating cause I can't use the One Drive App that I use a lot. I had a problem with my hard-drive, bought a new one and reinstalled the laptop inbuilt windows 8 but from there on it wouldn't let me sign
 into my own account with the message: "Sorry we can't connect to Microsoft services at the moment. If this problem persists, search for "network problems" on the Start screen.</p>
<p>There were no Network problems</p>
<p>I also tried to switch the "Microsoft account sign-in assistant" from manual to automatic. That didn't change anything.</p>

<h2>            Missing My Messages</h2>
                    As many people I was required to upgrade my Skype the other day and now I am constantly missing because the "bubble" is coming up and then disappearing.&nbsp; Is there a way to keep the pop up open so I can see it if I am away from my desk?&nbsp; Or if the window
 can open and stay open.

            Hi Jeff
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows are you running Skype on? If its Windows 10, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />
<br />Scroll down then click in the list box and choose 'Show notifications for' 
<br />
<br />and choose how long you want it to display on screen.

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like we do not have much information regarding the printer in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Lexmark%20X6575%20All-In-One%20Printer&amp;vendor=Lexmark&amp;Locale=1033%2C3081%2C4105%2C16393&amp;BreadCrumbPath=lexmark%20x6575&amp;LastSearchTerm=lexmark%2Bx6575&amp;Type=Hardware&amp;tempOsid=Windows%208.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Compatibility Center</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After searching the driver support page from Lexmark, we could not find the driver for Windows 8 operating system. Since it is not compatible with Windows 8, I would suggest you to install the printer in Windows 7 compatibility mode and check.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download the driver from the articlr provided. </p>

    <title>Cannot adjust my screen brightness in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> franzrebs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot adjust my screen brightness in Windows 10</h2>
                    I upgraded my Lenovo IdeaPad S200 to Windows 10 and it's not allowing me to adjust my screen brightness either via hotkeys or through the display settings. It's maxed out and ruining my eyes.<br />
<br />
I tried going to Device Manager, right clicked on the Display Adapter (which was Microsoft Basic Display Adapter) and chose Update Driver... &gt; Search automatically. I got "The best driver software for your device is already installed."<br />
<br />
So I tried searching online for the relevant driver, and downloaded Intel Onboard Graphics Driver for 32-bit Windows &nbsp;from http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/downloads/ds027774<br />
<br />
After installation, my laptop kept rebooting and would only show the desktop for like 3 seconds before crashing. &nbsp;I was actually able to adjust the screen brightness during the brief times that it showed the desktop, it just kept leading me back to the BSOD
 with VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE igdkmd32.sys. It doesn't crash whenever I boot up in Safe Mode though.<br />
<br />
I spent hours (almost a full day) trying to remedy this. I ended up having to do a clean install of Windows 7, downloaded all updates then upgraded again to Windows 10. Though I'm still not able to adjust my screen brightness nor use the built-in webcam, I'll
 just have to bear with this until I find a compatible driver.<br />
<br />
If there's anybody who can help and point me to the right direction, that would be awesome.<br />

            <p>Thank you so much for the prompt response and thorough directions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went ahead and ran the driver setup in compatibility mode for Windows 7. In the middle of the installation, the screen brightness actually lowered and I was able to adjust it using the hotkeys. However, upon completion of the installation, the system rebooted
 and I was then faced with the BSOD loop again. I had to do a system restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks again.</p>

<h2>            Battery stuck at 80&#37;</h2>
                    <p>A window popped up when i first started the computer, telling me about power plans and which one was recommended.</p>
<p>I was stupid enough to pick the balanced plan and now my battery is stuck at 80%, plugged in and not charging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to change the plan back so that I can charge the laptop back to 100% but I cannot find a way to do so. lease help. This is pissing me off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the power options and tried changing plans but the battery won't go pass 80%</p>

<ul class="message-user-info-affiliations-list">
    </ul>
            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />Check if its working...
<br />
<br />Other things you can try....
<br />
<br />1. Run Windows 10 Battery Diagnostics
<br />
<br />If your battery isn’t fully charging, the first thing you can try is the Battery troubleshooter in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />    Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />    Scroll down then click Power
<br />    Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Complete the wizard then restart your device to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />Most laptop computers include their own factory diagnostics utilities, too. It is recommended you also use those to test your battery. Accessing the diagnostics will vary by manufacturer, so, consult the documentation that came with your computer. Before you run a test, you might need to first fully charge the device to 99 or 100 percent, disconnect the AC adapter, boot into the diagnostic utility then run the test.
<br />
<br />2. Check if Your AC Power Supply is Properly Connected
<br />
<br />Sometimes the power cable connected to your AC power supply brick might be loose. Check to make sure it is fitted and secured properly.
<br />
<br />3. Try a Different Wall Outlet and Check for Low Voltage and Electrical Issues
<br />
<br />The other day, my house had some serious electrical issues going on. You would be amazed how much voltage issues can affect the performance of your system. Plugging in my laptop into an outlet within my room dimmed the light, while an outlet in the living room caused it to wink.
<br />
<br />Another room it remained constant but charging was horribly slow. This, of course, meant I had low voltage issues and with so many appliances competing for the little bit of faulty energy, it made it even worse. Ultimately, I ended hiring an electrician to sort out the issues. After fixing it up, my laptop started charging normally.
<br />
<br />4. Test with Another Charger
<br />
<br />I mentioned the AC power adapter earlier. It’s possible your charger might be the culprit. If you have a working spare laying around the home, give it a try to see if it charges. You can also borrow one from your work colleague if you don’t have any. If you don’t have access to another charger, try yours on another laptop to see if it charges the device.
<br />
<br />If you are mixing and matching laptop power adapters, make sure you choose the correct power supply (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=outlet+tester" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=s...</a>). Read the brick and make sure it has the same polarity and voltage as the adapter for your laptop.
<br />
<br />5. Remove All External Devices
<br />
<br />If you keep external devices such as a smartphone, a USB external drive, mouse, printer and anything else attached to your system while charging, it will take longer for your battery to reach 100%. Make sure you disconnect all of those devices so your system won’t be competing with all the other electronics.
<br />
<br />6. Check Your Connectors for Dirt or Damage
<br />
<br />If your laptop has a modular battery, remove it then check for any damage or to see if it needs cleaning around the contacts and inside the battery compartment. Also, check if there are any dust particles inside the charging port that might be preventing the battery from charging.
<br />
<br />7. Check for BIOS and Chipset Driver Updates
<br />
<br />Sometimes your system might be overdue for an update for components such as your BIOS and Chipset. Updates can help resolve bugs that might be preventing the battery from charging efficiently.
<br />
<br />8. Press and Release Power Button Reset
<br />
<br />Sometimes unknown glitches can prevent the battery from charging. An easy way to fix it is to power down your computer, hold down the power button for 15 to 30 seconds, plug in the AC adapter, then start the computer.
<br />
<br />9. Disable Apps and Check Battery Usage in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Going back to Windows 10 a bit, recently, I noticed my Surface Pro was taking an unusually long time to charge and the fans started to rev up. Little did I notice the culprit was right there on my Taskbar all along. Slack’s Windows client was waiting in an attempt to connect to the Internet. So, checking your apps to determine whats running in the background can help you not only conserve battery life but limit what prevents it from charging faster.
<br />
<br />There are a couple ways to do that. Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps. Scroll down then toggle off the apps that might be preventing your device from reaching a full charge.
<br />
<br />Still in Settings, open System &gt; Battery &gt; Battery usage by app. This will tell you which apps are using the most battery and you can make a decision what to do, whether to let Windows decide if it should run in the background while not sacrificing battery life.
<br />
<br />10. Replace Charger or Battery Module
<br />
<br />Ultimately, if you don’t see any improvements after trying all the above, then it’s maybe best that you replace either the charger or battery itself. This will require contacting your laptop manufacturer and placing an order. Batteries and the chargers are not necessarily cheap, especially if its an older system. But, if you have no choice, its something you will just have to do to get your system back in working order.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We are happy to know you are extremely delighted with our new <strong>Spotlight</strong> feature on Windows 10 operating system.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I would like to inform that <span>Windows has released a new feature on the operating system called
<strong>Windows Spotlight</strong> for the customers delight. <strong>Windows Spotlight</strong> feature is available only when your PC is connected to the internet. The pictures on the lock screen changes automatically everyday day, if you are connected to
 the internet. <strong>Windows Spotlight</strong> automatically shows images from
<strong>Bing</strong> or promotes some <strong>Windows Store</strong> applications and shows their images.</span></p>
<p><span>For example:<strong> Fresh paint</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The pictures may or may not have been photographed in a particular location. The location of the pictures taken from are unknown.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You will find the <strong>Spotlight</strong> feature in the <strong>Settings</strong> page under
<strong>Personalization</strong> option.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have turned on this feature eventually, you should see a '<strong>Like what you see?</strong>' dialog on the lock screen in the upper right-hand corner. Selecting this brings up an '<strong>I like it!</strong>' and '<strong>Not a fan</strong>' menu
 choice where you can register your vote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you click <strong>I want to more option </strong>when the lock screen background picture was of nature, Windows 10 will show more pictures of nature on lock screen in the future. That said, it will occasionally show other types of pictures or pictures
 from other categories as well, but you can click <strong>Not a fan option </strong>
if you like to stop Windows from displaying those kind of pictures on your lock screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Hope it helps. Kindly get back to us for further assistance on Windows Operating System, we will be happy to help you further.</span></p>

<h2>            replacement service for skype out &#47; skype number&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I use skype in 2 ways:&nbsp; for free I use it as a video chat for family and friends, but my main use is as a paid-for computer based VoIP phone, which I use for business 5 days a week and spend a considerable amount to do so, and have been for ten years or
 more.&nbsp; Generally, this has worked well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it looks like the desktop skype / skype 8 is making the usage as a phone harder and really sidelining this service in favor of being another online community FB look-alike, e.g. by removing the ability to directly dial contacts from outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is there to be another service that is going to focus on this functionality - either from Microsoft or from someone else?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
