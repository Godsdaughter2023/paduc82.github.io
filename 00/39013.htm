            Hi Michael
<br />
<br />Do you want to use that as a data drive on the new PC?
<br />
<br />If so, this should not be a problem
<br />
<br />Connect that old hard drive to your new PC, your new PC will still boot form Windows 10 on the proper drive
<br />
<br />Once that is connected to the new PC, if you want to wipe that old drive:
<br />
<br />Open Disk Management (Accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />
<br />For each partition on that drive, right click and choose 'Delete Volume'
<br />
<br />Then when there is just 1 unallocated space on that drive, right click the unallocated space and choose 'New Simple Volume'
<br />
<br />Accept the defaults and that drive is ready to be used as adata drive . ..

<p>How 'old' are we talking about?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the old hard drive uses the PATA bus, and your motherboard doesn't have a PATA connector, you ain't installing your old hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With respect to boot problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the motherboard, hard drive connectors are numbered, starting with '0,' so the connectors are called SATA0, SATA1, SATA2, etc. The motherboard's firmware (EFI or the older BIOS) will first check the hard driver connected to SATA0 for a bootable operating
 system. If none is found, it will check the hard drive connected to SATA1, SATA2 ... and so on until it finds a bootable operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your existing copy of Windows is connected to SATA0 - if you haven't moved the hard drive since you got the computer - it will boot from that copy of Windows, so you needn't worry if another copy of Windows is on a different hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. By any chance are you related to a presidential candidate?</p>

<h2>            HP Pavilion x2 rendered useless by Windows 10 &#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Hello All . . . I have an HP Pavilion x2, Bought new from Currys/PCW with Windows 10 already installed and 3yrs McAfee. In the past few months it has been getting slower and slower and everything I do is constantly interrupted by requests to install updates
 and to make space on the C drive etc. After looking at the obvious things, Photos, emails etc I soon realised deleting or storing them elsewhere was going to make little if any improvement to the situation, as 8GB approx. would be needed and the machine is
 only 32GB and already virtually full from all the previous updating etc. After trying to do what I could, I thought I should contact Microsoft to help me try and install the new 8GB update. They took control of the system remotely and were polite and helpful
 and managed to download it into my system, though it transpired this did not install it. I contacted them again in case I had not done something properly to activate it and they said no, I had not. They did some more tinkering

Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

Old battery? Unplug power to computer - remove battery and clean the contact with a pencil<br />
eraser (do not use this if you battery has thin slots just clean the knife edges that fit into<br />
them and be careful). Batteries do wear out if old, or it could be a problem with the computer.<br />
Check with the support of system maker and many have on line forums.<br />
<br />
I use the free version of BatteryBar to monitor my battery. Click the Green button on the Yellow box on<br />
right side of page to download latest stable version 3.1 build 60<br />

Does it actually charge, but it is not reading correctly? Try unplugging and see how long it lasts.<br />
<br />
Also, there are quite a few threads on dells community about this same problem, might want to check them out.<br />

All I can tell you something is wrong which could be the computer, the battery, or both. Easiest method<br />
to check is with another battery which a Laptop shop might have to test your system.<br />
<br />
Hope you sort it out.<br />

<blockquote>thanks for the reply..<br />
i installed battery bar and it also shows&nbsp; me battery as 9 %.<br />
My concern here is that how all of a sudden the battery can drop from 100 % to a mere 9% ?????</blockquote>
<p><br />
Using BatteryBar, hover your mouse over it and look for the line "Battery Wear". That will show you how worn out the battery is.&nbsp; As batteries age, they lose the ability to hold a charge.&nbsp; Dell batteries are good at reporting the current capacity they can hold
 versus their designed capacity.</p>
<p>You can try recalibrating the battery by running the battery all the way down to 0% and then charging it again with the computer turned off.&nbsp; Wait until it says it's stopped charging and then run it down again.&nbsp; That may help reset the battery's memory.</p>

            Hi Chris,<br />
the battery wear shows 1.5 % of 86,580 mWh.<br />
does this mean that the battery wear is only 1.5 % ?<br />
when i try to deplete the battery my system will do a automatic shutdown ?

            <p>Hi Dhruv,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you can’t connect to wireless network on Windows 10, the possible problem may be with your wireless adapter. We suggest you to uninstall the drivers and let the Windows 10 to reinstall it. To do that, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press Windows Key + X and choose Device Manager from the list.<br />
2. When Device Manager starts, locate your network adapter and right click it.<br />
3. Choose Uninstall. If asked, check “Delete the driver software for this device” and click OK.<br />
4. After the driver has been uninstalled, restart your computer and Windows 10 will automatically install the new driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance. </p>

<h2>            Windows XP Not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi, i am running a windows xp and my games (And basically everyting else) do not work. Every time i click on roblox studio, It says something like "Bla bla bla OpenGL bla bla bla". And not only does it show a error msg, but it opens a trillion times! I has
 to open task manager to close all of the error messages. And i only clicked it one time! So then i go to microsoft website and try to download directx driver but that
<em>also</em> has a error. And after that, it keeps prompting me to download a "bing bar". Whenever i open Mine Craft it says: requiers Jqava runtime software.</p>
<p>But, when i download it and click on the download wizard, it shows a loading timer for 2 seconds and then after that it NEVER opens! Mine Craft Wants me to run Java 8 but windows XP clearly does not! I also use the computer for school projects, so i need
 office 365, but it wont let me get it! Is there a way i can get a office that WORKS on windows XP through my school account for free? When i click "download office apps" on my account homepage, It only lets me download office 2016 for free. But there are no
 2003 or 2007 options. Also <em>another</em> error is that the windows update app on windows xp is not working. It says there is a html error. I tried clearing my history and cookies like it said on the website but that did
<em>not work.</em> Is there a way i can make my windows XP acctually cooperate without having to upgrade to newer windows?

<p>Unfortunately, XP is 17 years old and no longer supported by MS. And a lot of software has left XP behind as well. All the errors you're seeing are due to programs no longer supporting XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do everything you want to, you may simply have to get a newer OS, and likely a new PC as well.

<p>That doesn't make it a good idea. XP isn't supported, unless the particular business pays for updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's 17 years old. I can see ATMs or other older system with an embedded copy still using it. But for most purposes there's no reason to still be using a 17 year old OS. If a software vendor refuses to update their programs for new systems (which means the
 hardware as well!) then personally I'd be researching new software. (But why wouldn't a developer want to update their stuff - that would mean an upgrade sale!)</p>

<p>Many businesses are paying support to MS to keep get updates for Windows XP. Others are just running other safe guards to keep using a system that works for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some ATMS run on Windows 2000 if you are not aware of that. This is mostly why you have not hack into one to get free money.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"A majority of ATMs installed worldwide still run either Windows XP or Windows XP Embedded. Some of the older ATMs run Windows NT, Windows CE, or Windows 2000. Microsoft," said the report."

<h2>            Windows 10, Mouse Problems</h2>
                    <p>Never ran into a problem like this before. When the computer turns on my mouse seems to work fine. I can manipulate the desktop like normal but the taskbar wont respond to the mouse (my keyboard keys work just fine though, Windows key oping the menu etc)
 After opening Edge or Firefox to get online my mouse wont be able to click on anything because my mouse will still only respond on the desktop. after 5 minutes of messing around in the window it starts to work now but the mouse will not work on the Desktop
 now, but works fine in the Edge/Firefox window. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to only work on one pane at a time, if i keep it in the taskbar for long enough it will start working in the taskbar but then any programs and desktop will both not respond to the mouse. (not just clicking the little 'highlight' that happens when
 you mouse over something will not work either when a section stops responding) </p>

            Thanks for your reply. However the F8 key would not start my HP all-in-one computer in safe mode, after several tries. It opens in normal mode even after pressing and holding down the F8 during the reboot. I finally used the msconfig mode to start in safe
 mode. Now in safe mode, my Resource Monitor works perfectly. When I restarted in normal mode the Resource Monitor just freezes. What do I do next? Thanks.

            I have not attempted the Clean Boot as suggested, as I doubt it would fix this problem of the missing Resource Manager. However, I reduced my font size from 150% to 100%, and now the Resource Manager instantly shows up, with all its information.&nbsp;But the
 font is too small for my screen. The R.M. did work previously at the 150% font size, so an update may have affected it. I don't know what else to do!

</p><p>Clean boot process&nbsp;takes care of&nbsp;any software conflict in Windows. You may want to adjust the resolution to 100% as it works fine. However I would suggest you to perform clean boot and check if it helps.</p>

            OK, I finally did a clean boot, which is similar to Safe Mode, after which the Resource Manager page became available. After I restarted the computer in Normal mode, I tried to access the Resource Manager. The frame of the new window opened up but it was
 blank. So this did not help. As I said earlier, reducing the font size to 100% does make the RM available, but this is not a functional solution as the fonts are too small. I wish Microsoft fixes this problem, because I know I am not the only one with it.
 Thanks for trying to help.

<p>I'm having none of those problems so there might be something going on with your setup or settings that might be causing this. One thing I notice is if your having trouble with something always try a hard reboot to see if that fixes the problem.

<p>The problem is that the native frame rate of the Xbox One is 60Hz, but the United Kingdom and Europe use a 50hz broadcasting system, which is the result of the historical use of PAL and SECAM analogue broadcasting systems. To display a 50Hz video signal
 on a 60Hz system, a process called frame rate conversion (FRC) needs to take place, which at the best of times will incur some judder. Depending on the implementation and also the original resolution (720p or 1080i), viewers may notice dropped/skipped frames
 or stutter especially during panning shots in fast-action sports material such as live football broadcast.</p>

<p>Since I discovered resource manager it has really taken the fun out of using my computer.&nbsp; I'm seeing things that I don't understand and they are making me crazy. Hopefully someone out there can answer my questions and put the joy back in computing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. How come I'm seeing file names and their paths in all capital letters and others in lowercase? What does that mean?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Under CPU ,the associated handle section, Type is "mutant".&nbsp; What does that mean?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Piece of cake, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanking you in advance,</p>
<p>Sueb&nbsp;</p>

            <p>1. Why would this worry you? Windows is case insensitive as far as file names go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Mutant is an internal Microsoft term for a Mutex. That is an abbreviation of Mutually Exclusive. In a multitasking system it's used to serialise access to a resource. If a task holds a mutex, other tasks that seek to acquire the mutex have to wait until
 it's released.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I share my screen any more&#63;</h2>
                    I have been tutoring on Skype, and sharing my screen with students for 6 months. Now I can no longer share my screen.&nbsp; When I click on share screen, I get a pop-up message which says, 'Invalid monitor handle.' I am using the latest version of Skype which
 I only installed a couple of weeks ago. I was able to share the screen successfully last week, but not on Monday or Tuesday this week. I don't have a clue what 'invalid monitor handle' means. I hope someone can help me with this.

<h3> dmd63  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live movie maker works on short clips, say 2 minutes, but locks up and crashes the video card on long ones...say 20 minutes.</h2>
                    <p>Specifics:</p>
<p>New windows 7 64 bit computer HP H8-1160t with this video card:&nbsp; 1GB DDR3 Radeon HD 6570 [DVI, HDMI. VGA adapter]
</p>
<p>Latest windows updates and video card drivers installed</p>
<p>Direct x is version 11...could not find information about shader model, but suspect it meets the requirement of "2 or higher"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Put together a short clip around 2 minutes from a Sony HD camcorder whose output in this case is 1920 x 1080 17kbps at 60i.</p>
<p>Added music, transistions etc.&nbsp; Tried output at various resolutions and formats...all work fine.&nbsp; Quality was iffy so I created by own output at 1920 x 1080 17kbps and 60fps.&nbsp; Also made one with 720 output and 17kbps and 60fps...quality was better and acceptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Began work on real project...saved at various points.&nbsp; Tried to output 10 minute clip at 1920 x 1080 17kbps and 60i and got an error at various points during rendering....some were regarding missing video.&nbsp; Went back and found missing clips...movie maker
 was behaving poorly and I closed and reopened it...all video present and accounted for.&nbsp; Tried output again at HD and had same issue.&nbsp; Tried at 720P 17kbps at 60i...worked perfectly.&nbsp; Tried a dvd...worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finished project...approx. 22 minutes long.&nbsp; have 3 mp3 files in the project...lots of splits and trims, but only a couple of transistions, pans etc.&nbsp; Tried to output at 720 17kbps and 60fps&nbsp;and the computer:&nbsp; Locked up hard...no ctrl alt. delete...no nothing...left
 it sit 20 minutes...finally did hard shutoff.&nbsp; Restarted tried repeatedly...saw some weirdness while running task manager...when you click on performance or resource monitor etc. these began to appear in reverse video...very strange...eventually locked up
 again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saw the following 2x times...Radeon video...something...has failed and recovered.&nbsp; I suspect a video card issue.&nbsp; Can you please tell me the next step?&nbsp; Log files?&nbsp; etc.&nbsp; Buy an Nvidia card?&nbsp; Please spec the card if this is the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually want at least the 720p output and maybe a dozen or so transitions.</p>

<h2>            Adding Features to Cortana</h2>
                    <p>I was wondering if it is possible to add features to Cortana, as it would be very awesome for me to have features such as picking a random integer within constraints, closing a process without needing to start Task Manager, or signing in to an online account
 just long enough to fetch current info regarding the account.</p>
<p>Of course, Cortana is such a popular feature that none of my search engines can filter out many irrelevant results.</p>
<p>Is there even an API?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 change C drive user name&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just bought new Surface Book - set it up and somehow it has put in a name under C drive users that I do not want to use - it truncates email name and looks stupid! Very annoying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent ages trying to find a way to change it to the user name I had on my Surface Pro 3 which was my name - simple! &nbsp;I can see there are lots of people looking for an answer to this question and its amazing to see there doesn't seem to be an answer
 that works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's also amazing how irritating such a small silly thing can be - but it is! I almost feel like do a full recovery but I'm afraid it will do the same thing again as now with Windows 10 it just seems to take your Microsoft email name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any new solutions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deborah</p>

</p><p>Re the OCD name comment, I would say judging by my google searcs that there are an awful lot of us out there who do not like the names Microsoft forces us to use. &nbsp;Names are personal. You may not even like it if people misspell your name! :-)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just should be easy. Don't know what I did differently on Surface Pro - maybe because it was Windows 8? Don't know. Oh well.</p>

            <p>I did not say that there were not a LOT of people out there that might want it - but when put beside the number of Windows users, it is likely a small number as most do not know and will never SEE the C:\USERS\&lt;whatever&gt; folder lists, likely never bother
 to see the full path of the files and just assume that their desktop is... their desktop (not a folder inside of another folder, etc.) as well as their documents, pictures, music, videos, etc. folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So - as I see it - your name is not what you are trying to change, but a folder path that represents your name. &nbsp;Honestly, from years of doing this, I would prefer my user profile FOLDER NAME to be as short as possible (a couple of letters, if possible)
 and the VISIBLE parts can be changed to be whatever. &nbsp;This way the file paths won't hit any limits because of *me* and my OCD needs. &nbsp;;-) &nbsp;That was more true when it was under "C:\Documents and Settings\" instead of the much shorter "C:\Users\" - but "c:\users\ss\"
 is still shorter than "c:\users\shenanstanley". &nbsp;hah</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now - in a domain environment as a system administrator, I understand the need to have it make a little more sense *if* a computer will be used by more than one person over its lifetime without being rebuilt.</p>

            Keep that account but create a new (local or M$) one with a name of your choice.&nbsp; Then deactivate (don't delete) the old account: this will keep your Microsoft Account creds on the machine - which is useful - while keeping it out of your hair.<br />

            <p>Hi Shenan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could be right about how often most people see these names. I guess because I'm working on a Surface Book so limited storage, I use OneDrive - for bad or good, but I therefore see this name all the time in OneDrive. And yes - I'm all for short names
 - I just would have liked to be able to pick it! :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feeling too old to keep trying to figure this all out. I'll just live with it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi Rick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for suggestion. I did vaguely try to figure out setting up a new account but it just seemed too complicated. I find often the instructions don't seem to always give the names of what shows up on my computer as to what to really click next so .
 . . I'm going to live with the annoying name for now. :-) Maybe down the road when more time, I will try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            It still happens with explorer too, but sometimes a new tab will open and sometimes it's&nbsp;a new window. After turning off my antivirus it seems to not happen as often but still happens.&nbsp; I can also be working in Word or Excel, not using the internet or
 even a browser window open, and I still get the pop ups.&nbsp; I have only gotten them when actively using the keyboard. It's very strange and I have no idea what is going on.

            I am having the same exact issue. In Edge, or Explorer, the How To Help window continually pops up, sometimes every 3 seconds. Impossible to do anything on the computer. If the computer is in airplane mode, the screen to help connect to the internet keeps
 popping up.&nbsp;

            <p>I am having this same exact problem ever since upgrading from windows 8 to windows 10!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is near impossible to do anything! I don't even have to type anything and STILL multiple chrome, microsoft edge/internet explorer (whichever is set to default) windows will continue to open up to Bing's help and support "how to get help for windows 10"
 window. I've disabled, uninstalled chrome and the same thing happens in Internet explorer! If i am offline or in airplane mode the problem continues to happen EVEN offline, windows continue to pop up and keys begin to shortcut again. It is IMPOSSIBLE to do
 anything because each time this happens it takes me away from what I was currently doing, be it - watching a movie, writing in word, playing games or just browsing the web. It continues to KICK ME out!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My F1 key is not stuck nor is my windows key. I've uninstalled windows 10 and still the problems persist even after system restore and in windows 8 where it has never happened before. In addition to this problem, my CAPS lock LED light no longer turns on
 but the LED keyboard still does, along with other lights on the keyboard. Furthermore, on my keyboard when I hold down Shift + C but nothing appears even though the shift button continues to work with every other letter and the "c" key still operates. I have
 to instead stick caps lock on to get a capital C if needed.<br />
</p>
<p>Lastly, when the window pop up occurs it sometimes messes with my keyboard configuration with some letters not able to work and others opening shortcuts. As soon as I press the "windows key" or "windows + esc" this seems to revert it back to its normal configuration
 only for it to revert back to pop-ups and shortcut keys seconds later.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And this is just the keyboard problems.. don't even get me started on the video playback problems - with gree screens, video delays, freezing etc. Just help me please so that my keyboard can function again! Writing this on said laptop and it has taken me over
 45mins to do so as some shortcut button quits the browser window (4th time writing this over 2 days as I've needed to adjust it)<br />
<br />
My computer is HP Envy 1511</p>

            I am having the exact same issue as Isabella. I need to search for work and apply for jobs and I can't as I can't do anything and by the time I have done one application I am ready to throw my laptop so it takes a whole day to do a few hours of searching
 and with 2 kids and being pregnant this has been an unnecessary burden! I have reformatted and that worked for 2 blissful days! Had to type this on my iPhone as my laptop is going to send me insane!

<br />
The purpose of encryption is to make it impossible for anyone to decrypt the files without a certificate. This is after all the reason why you encrypted them. Unfortunately this is a two-edged sword: It works as much against you as it works against some data
 thief.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The challenge that you are experiencing with Surface Pro 3's fan constantly running might be software-related. This means that a setting may not be set up appropriately, or that a specific driver is not installed correctly. To address this concern, we suggest
 that you run <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027667/windows-update-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Updates</a> and make sure that you install the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=38826" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
latest Firmware and drivers for Surface</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, open the Task Manager and look for <strong>Windows Installer Module (WIM)</strong> and
<strong>Windows Installer Module Worker (WIMW)</strong>. In case they are still running, end their tasks and the system should normalize.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the above steps helped resolve your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi Rocco,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There can be several reasons why the fan constantly runs. Overheating and software-related issues may cause this problem. Have you tried to perform a clean boot and check if the issue persists? Doing a clean boot&nbsp;helps to eliminate any software conflicts
 that might be causing the fan to run excessively. You can go to this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> and follow the steps on how to perform a <strong>clean boot</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, we recommend that you run the <strong>Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</strong>. The SDT resolves common problems with your Surface and the diagnosis may take 15 minutes or less, but can take an hour or longer and depending on your internet connection
 speed and the repairs that the tool needs to do to fix the problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit, click <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We hope this helps, and let us know if you have any additional concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            Hello Justin,<br />
<br />
<br />
We appreciate your response. There are many factors that affect why the fan is constantly running. It can be due to the number of programs running which take up the Surface resources, or the device working to maintain each processes. It can also be a symptom
 of a hardware failure. Please be advised that the fan turns on at 48 degree Celsius (or 114 degrees Fahrenheit). The temperature icon will appear and the device will shutdown at 50 degree Celsius (or 122 degrees Fahrenheit).<br />
<br />
To clarify, can you tell us if you were able to perform a clean boot as mentioned above? Was the behavior the same even when device is on a clean boot state? If yes, we suggest that you run a power/energy report. Here's how:<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong> On the Search bar/Cortana, type '<strong>cmd</strong>' to search for the Command Prompt then press and hold or right-click and select '<strong>Run as administrator</strong>'.<br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong> On the Command Prompt, type '<em><strong>powercfg /energy</strong></em>' and wait for the result.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*In case there's no report generated, exit the Command Prompt and restart your Surface then repeat Steps 1 &amp; 2.<br />
<strong>Step 3:</strong> Once there's a report being generated, follow and open the file location of the said report. (It will appear as 'energy-report.html').<br />
<strong>Step 4:</strong> Once you open the report, kindly send the screenshot with your reply and/or upload the file via OneDrive and share the link so we can check it on our end.<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep us posted on the outcome.
        </p>
