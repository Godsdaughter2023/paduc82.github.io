<h2>            SRS Audio Essentials Error Message 1920</h2>
                    <p>SRS Audio Essentials will not install instead sending Error 1920 "Verify you have Starting Services privilege"</p>
<p>This worked without any problems in XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DTS (the maker) will NOT answer any queries in relation to this matter and I cannot find any web answers.&nbsp; Even bought Error End - USELESS (do not buy this product).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can somebody please help me with this problem?&nbsp; I have purchased this from the company, but they will not answer any any Contact Messages (5 so far).</p>
<p>

            Install .NET Framework before installing SRS. Hope it will work then!

    <title>Profile Picture Verification - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ah brownwoman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Profile Picture Verification</h2>
                    <p>Sooo I contacted Microsoft support AND xbox support and neither could help me with this issue.. I tried uploading an icon I commissioned from an artist which is a picture of me drawn as a video game character. There is nothing provocative in the photo and it didn't get verified. But my friend uploaded the picture and it got verified immediately. Why did my picture get verified on my friends account but not mine? I am very frustrated.</p>

<p>I have the exact same issue as described. Both when opening photos directly from the explorer with Microsoft Photos set as the default photo viewer app and when opening the app itself directly.</p>
<p>The error occurred in <em><strong>KB4338819 </strong></em>(OS Build 17134.165). I have since manually updated to
<em><strong>KB4345421 </strong></em>(OS Build 17134.167) in the hopes of fixing the issue but to no success.</p>
<p>Using <em><strong>SFT</strong></em>, <em><strong>DISM</strong></em>, <em><strong>CHKDSK
</strong></em>and resetting the Windows Store cache via <em><strong>Wsreset.exe </strong>
</em>did not help. Also re-registering the Windows app via the PowerShell command "<em><strong>Get-AppXPackage | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xm</strong></em>l”}" did not work either.</p>

<p><strong>original title: My mouse is uncontrollable</strong></p>

<p><strong>Well... I went on Facebook without no problem or anything. I clicked on this group and was reading something that it said, and I don't know if my cursor was on the adverts at the time, but it clicked on it without me doing anything 3 times (If you
 want to know what advert it was, it was Become A Photographer) and then clicked look at more ads.&nbsp; I&nbsp;think I might have a virus. When I try to move it with my touch pad, it goes REALLY slowly. And when ever it is near something, it clicks on it. I've tried
 what someone said saying try Fn and Num Lock. That only worked for like, 20 seconds. I scanned it with Norton Internet Security 2010, which found 52 cookies but resolved them. After they scanned it (took 3 hours!!) it STILL didn't work. I don't know what I
 did... :( (By the way, if you tell me I'm stupid for not having pop up blocker, well I do! I just disabled it because this stupid group said if you want to find out the answer to this, blah blah blah. Then they said post it to your wall, and to do that you
 needed to disable pop up blocker for Facebook. I did so, but I forgot to put it back on again. I'm so... stupid. I really am actually! D:)</strong></p>

<p><span><span>Try a different mouse.&nbsp; If the problem goes away, replace the defective mouse.&nbsp; I the problem persists, read on.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.&nbsp; Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should
 be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one
 you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;mouse (Start / Control
 Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt starting from C:\Windows\System32).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:</span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>You may be infected with malware</strong>. Facebook is a great place to get infected.&nbsp; Try to run anti-malware programs
 (in safe mode with networking if <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Boot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for
 the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers.&nbsp; Go to Device Manager by going tostart / search box and type device
 manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details
 and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should get them for at least your mouse and any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from
 Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for hardware problems</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:</span><span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></span></a></span><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span><span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE and only if you can stll boot normally).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned
 out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

<p>I encountered this error after somehow magically overcoming the CD/DVD drive device driver error that's killing like half of the Microsoft Windows community, I swear. I'm trying to install Win7 onto a 80GB HDD, after using the RAID tool featured on my SATA

<p>Thoughts? Ideas?</p>

            This problem occurs because Windows 7 cannot distinguish between ambiguous hard disks.
<br />
<br />
Change the BIOs setup from enhanced mode to compatibility mode for SATA controllers.<br />
<br />
Also see this Vista article http://support.microsoft.com/kb/925481.<br />
<br />
The procedure is same for windows 7.

<h3> daughnte  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One basic controller &#40;white&#41; female headphone jack not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I've done all the trouble shooting. It is clear that the female headphone jack on the&nbsp; 6 month old controller packed with the Xbox One S no longer works. Everything else works on the controller. The headset/mic works with the other two controllers
 (an original purchased 6 months ago, and a new one bought yesterday when the store wouldn't do an exchange).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q Does the 1 year manufacturer's warranty cover controllers? If so, do they repair the item of issue a refund? If not does anyone know of a fix for this apparently common defect?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            The warranty should replace it for you free of charge. However, if it does happen again in the future, the only solution that seems to fix this issue permanently is to use the headset adapter. Good luck to you!

<p>Hi Daughnte,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The controller only has a 90 day warranty. There is an item called a headset adapter that plugs into the controller differently that may work. In this case you would most likely need to get replaced. If you can get an adapter may be cheaper than another
 controller. Here is a link on how to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/stereo-headset-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
set up and use an adapter</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<h2>            SPlit Tool is not working</h2>
                    <p>I added a video to Movie Maker. It is displayed on the storyboard, but I can not access the Split Tool. It doesn't light up, it is only gray. The trim tool works, but I wanted to split my movie into several pieces. Any advice?</p>

<p>
</p><p>The trim tool seems to be not working in Windows Live Mail 2012. Even I tried to check in Windows Live Mail, trim tool option has been grayed out.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Do you by chance have another video editing program (free) that you recommend? I am trying to remove chunks of my video to only show the fun parts, so the split tool (or something similar) is critical.</p>

            <p>First, make sure you have selected the clip you want to split. Then make sure you are on the
<strong>Video Tools | Edit </strong>tab. You should see the button for <strong>Split</strong>. Next, make sure you have the playback marker somewhere in the *middle* of the clip. If it is at the beginning or end of the clip, it will be grayed out (because it
 doesn't make sense to split a clip at the beginning; it's already split). Click the button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Barring all that, you can always use <strong>M</strong> on the keyboard to make a split in your clip wherever the playback marker is positioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So do any of those instructions work?</p>

                    Hello all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have seen similar questions asked on other forums but haven't seen any definitive answers anywhere.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am attempting to play a WMV file that I purchased legally and was able to download the rights to. However, the video fails to play unless I disable the built in audio device. I have the latest drivers from the MB manufacturer (Asus), but still not solved.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyone else found a solution to this issue?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

<p><strong>I recently purchased netbooks for my daughters, and the systems came with Windows Live Mail. &nbsp;I've set up e-mail accounts for them, but there is a problem with Windows Live Mail receiving Outlook .ics calendar invitations. &nbsp;Why isn't Windows Live
 Mail able to "read" these e-mail messages and add the "Accept" button so appointments can be added to their Windows Live Mail calendars? &nbsp;I use Outlook on my computer, but their netbooks do not have enough RAM to support Outlook - is there a fix for this problem?
 &nbsp;I've reviewed several forums / posts on this site about it, but all support personnel seem to be dodging this question - will this be fixed or not? &nbsp;Will I be forced to use a third party program (like Thunderbird) on their netbooks just so they can receive
 calendar invites and actually "use/accept" them?&nbsp;</strong></p>

            Plug adapters are perfect. Do not get a converter. Your power adapter is dual voltage.

<h2>            Toshiba laptop running XP is running very slow, how can I speed it up&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an old Toshiba laptop with Windows XP, Version 2002, Service Pack3. It has Pentium R 4CPU, 2.40 ghz with 256 MB of Ram.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It is so slow that it is like watching paint dry. I have deleted all the programs I dare (the ones that I have put on)and I defrag regularly. There appear to be many many programs (particularly Toshiba ones) that are not in use&nbsp;but being a non-techie I
 daren't delete them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I need help to enable it to work faster - if that is possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Any help would be wonderful.</p>

            <p>adding more ram is not a difficult task because ram memory chips simply plug into sockets on the motherboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>however, it can be tricky though, because it requires to open up the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; then it requires an understanding of the motherboard's particular configuratoin needs when it comes to memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>some motherboards have specific requirements for memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so the first step is to review the computer manual on the section for memory configuration and see if you can add more ram to it, or if you need to take out that small 256 chip out and simply use a larger chip, like 1 gig ram.&nbsp;&nbsp; (for regular computer users
 and xp, it is not required to have more than 1 gig of ram installed)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in regards to the safe mode.&nbsp;&nbsp; you can't connect to the internet because it is not permitted.&nbsp; however, in safe mode with networking you can, since the internet is a world wide network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the reason why safe modes are performing better than in normal mode, is due to the fact that non microsoft programs, ie third party programs are prevented from loading into memory and running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as the result of not having additional programs&nbsp;the windwos (by itself) is able to run ok in / with the small memory chip.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>on the other hand, in normal mode, windows + third party programs are loaded into your small memory chip, and it is bogging down the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so at this point, you could try to eliminate some of the programs that are automatically starting and running in memory for normal mode windows to get some improvement in performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the method is known as "clean booting" and here are the steps:&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="http://pcsmarties.wordpress.com/cleanboot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://pcsmarties.wordpress.com/cleanboot/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but the method above plus adding more memory to your computer, is the way to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>incidentally, if you are going to execute a clean boot, be careful not to disable the start up programs for anything that is toshiba, like mouse or&nbsp;keyboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>on some laptops, the drivers for the mouse are loaded at startup and you might have to plug in a regular usb mouse to get some mouse function back until you can re-initialize the mouse driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>also, you mentioned that malwarebytes found some infections.&nbsp;&nbsp; although this is a good thing, it is hoped that the infection didn't corrupt any of your window system files.</p>

<h2>            How to make Xbox Wireless Adapter for Win 10 work now that driver is dead.</h2>
                    <p>Hey got my brand new Oculus Rift last night :D yay. </p>
<p>It comes with an Xbox one Wireless controller with Xbox Wireless Adapter. </p>
<p>First install went smoothly and all was well the controller worked. </p>
<p>Installed Steam VR it said to restart my computer. So I did, because why not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When my computer came back i got the "Ba Ding!" new hardware sound, immediately followed by "Ba Dum!" Hardware disconnected sound. Then "Ba Dum!, Ba Dum!, Ba Dum!, Ba Dum!, Ba Dum!" on repeat until I unplugged the Xbox wireless adapter.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looked at some steam forum and they have seen this before the thing to do was to install an old driver from the Microsoft Update Catalog:
</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td>
Microsoft - Other hardware - Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows
</td>
<td>
Windows 10 and later drivers </td>
<td>

<td>
<span>213 KB</span> <span>
<span>213 KB</span> <span>
218142</span> </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Only problem is it seems as tho Microsoft wants us using new drivers so much so that they appear to have removed this driver from the update catalog.&nbsp;Now when you try to view info on it or download it you get:</p>

<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I don't understand why they would remove the ability to downgrade the driver to a working version and what makes even less sense is the fact that this is even an issue. Like I said Interfacing a Microsoft Product with a Microsoft
 Product. </p>
<p class="contentStandard">My iPhone is more compatible with windows 10 than this POS Xbox controller...
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Spent well over 2 hours last night not playing my Oculus because this controller wouldn't connect.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">3rd Party Sensor, Connects no problem, 3rd Party Headset, connected no problem. Official Microsoft Controller 2Hours+ Troubleshooting no resolution. Although I really shouldn't be surprised EVERY time I have dealt with Microsoft
 Tech Support I get transferred 5+ times GUARANTEED(Last time I was recording my transfers, Had 8 transfers across 6 departments, yes they sent me back to the same place twice... Geniuses at the Microsoft Call Center...).</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">So the long and the short of it, is there a way to fix this?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can connect your Xbox One Controller to a Windows PC either by using a cable or wirelessly. However, to play Xbox games on your PC, your controller must be connected via micro-USB cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many PC games let you play with an Xbox One Controller instead of a keyboard or mouse. The Xbox One Controller can be quickly and easily installed on any PC that has an available USB port and is running Windows 10, Windows 8.1, or Windows 7.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong> This information applies only to the Xbox One Controller. For help with other gamepads or joysticks, or for information on configuring a specific game so that you can play it with a controller, refer to the manufacturer’s website or
 support center. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For Windows 10, the most current drivers are pre-installed with the operating system and are automatically updated through the Xbox Accessories app. See
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/update-controller-for-stereo-headset-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the steps below to update <strong>network adapter</strong>&nbsp;driver from the device manager and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span>I suggest you to </span>
<strong><span>uninstall </span></strong><span>the<strong> network adapter </strong>
driver from the device manager by following the steps below:</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> keys on the keyboard and click on

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Expand the <strong>Network adapter </strong>driver from the list.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Right click on the driver and click on <strong>Uninstall

</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span>Restart</span></strong><span> the PC to install the network adapters automatically and check if the changes are effective.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong><span> </span><span>If the issue persist, I suggest you to
</span><strong><span>update</span></strong><span> the<strong> network adapter</strong> driver from the device manager by following the steps below:</span></span></span></p>
<p>

            <p>Ok first thing I need to inform you of. I am a certified Computer Engineering Technologist That was my first step, not to mention that was the first thing EVERY OTHER forum on the internet said about this problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok so I did all that last night in my 2+ hours of trouble shooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to make sure and to make you happy i did it again, no results. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note:</p>
<p>It does <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>not</strong></span> show up as an unknown device. It shows up as Xbox Wireless Adapter.</p>
<p>It is recognized and then keep disconnecting. In the task bar notification section i can see the "Safely Remove and Eject Media" icon flashing in and out of my notification section.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note 2: </p>
<p>It did work on initial install but functionality was broken when I restarted my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note 3: </p>
<p>Everything on the inter net says the new driver is exactly what break this piece of hardware. According to literally hundreds of people and Dozens of sites the solution is to download the old WORKING driver I have listed above. I cannot do this as it appears
 to have been removed from the update catalog.&nbsp; </p>

            I contacted Xbox support and they said, "Ask the PC support."&nbsp; So please don't try to tell us that a PC driver issue should be addressed on the Xbox support forums.&nbsp; We need driver 20.24.34.491, and we need it now.&nbsp;

<p>I am necroing this thread because I just got an Oculus Rift and went through hell trying to find the correct driver to install for the wireless adapter on Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to&nbsp;https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=PID_02E6</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Click download for the highlighted driver below<br />

<p>3. It will download a .cab file. It can be unzipped with WinRar.</p>
<p>4. Go to Device Manager and find Xbox Acc under Other devices.</p>
<p>5. Right click on Xbox Acc and go to Update Drivers.</p>
<p>6. Browse my computer for driver software.</p>
<p>7. Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer</p>
<p>8. Click Have Disk and then Browse and navigate to where the cab file was unzipped.</p>
<p>9. Select the&nbsp;mt7612us.ini file and click ok</p>
<p>10. It should install the Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows driver.</p>
<p>Follow the normal steps to sync the Xbox controller to the wireless adapter.</p>

<h2>            best place to buy an xbox ONE&#63;  &#40;warranty wise..&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Guys...I am ready to pull the trigger after selling my 360, selling my Day One console for a profit and being without an xbox for 2 months...My question is where?...Costco, with unlimited returns, but a PIA as you have to return everything.....MS with
 MS Complete warranty covering 3 years (which I kind of like as it is transferrable...something that is interesting when you sell the console on EBAY)....Gamestop with the PRP?.....Can I get some opinions..esp on MS Complete?</p>

<p>I did the warranty through Microsoft, like 75 bucks after tax and protects console, kinect and 2 controllers for 3 years (2 years plus the 1 year from purchase. Must be within 45 days from purchase date.</p>
<p>Microsoft Complete - Xbox One - 2 Year</p>
<p>Covers hardware issues for 2 years from date of device purchase. In the event of a device malfunction, plan provides an Advanced Exchange replacement option at no additional charge (no upfront charge; credit card hold required and charges apply if original
 unit is not returned). Also covers up to 2 controller replacements during the coverage period. Exclusions apply. Review contract terms and conditions for detail.</p>

<br />
After further testing, we don't currently support sending files directly to a browser&nbsp;using the
<strong>SendTo</strong> menu as of this moment. We strongly suggest that you use the built-in Mail app for Windows 10 instead and link your Google account to easily attach files and send emails.</p>

            Same problem, and I am once again wondering why Microsoft has taken a nice usable program (after all, who doesn't use that resize option?) and come up with something that requires a huge workaround (which I still haven't figured out). &nbsp;And they wonder
 why they are losing customers. &nbsp;I am writing this on my iPad, from which I do more and more work every day just because of crap like this.

    <title>Laptop screen shows vertical lines on startup, then stays blank - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Laptop screen shows vertical lines on startup, then stays blank</h2>
                    
<p>Computer:&nbsp; Sony Vaio laptop VGN-FE690P</p>
<p>OS: Fully updated XP Pro (SP3_gdr.100427.1636) (was up to date as of 1 week ago).</p>
<p>Problem:&nbsp; One morning monitor stopped working, but still works during startup. When I start the computer, I first see many vertical lines (never have seen that before).&nbsp; Then the Vaio/BIOS screen comes up.&nbsp; Then the Windows screen comes up ok as if it will
 work fine, although there are a couple of vertical lines that were never there before.&nbsp; Then the screen blanks and there is a brief period with a checkerboard of vertical lines, then the screen goes black and never comes back.&nbsp; I hear "start windows" sound,
 and it sounds like the computer is on, but screen stays black.&nbsp; I have tried to connect an external monitor without success (though I'm not sure I'm actually sending the signal to the VGA port).</p>
<p>One thing that did work:</p>
<p>When I F8 during BIOS screen I can get to the Safe startup page.&nbsp; The screen works fine there.&nbsp; I CAN start it in Safe mode with networking.&nbsp; But I don't know what to do once I'm there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So basically the screen works fine in Safe mode, but makes strange vertical lines during startup and stays blank if booted in regular mode.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update: The first time after I started it in Safe mode, when I restarted in regular more it worked fine and I thought I'd fixed it.&nbsp; I then restarted again and had the same problem. So Now I started in Safe mode, restarted regular and once again it booted
 just fine.&nbsp; But this time it gave me two errors that I sent in for reporting:&nbsp; 1: Stop (blue screen) error cause by device or driver and 2) Address a problem with your video device driver&nbsp; (link took me to "STOP 0x00000EA THREAD_STUCK_IN_DEVICE_DRIVER" knowledge
 link.)</p>
<p>So my plan now is 1) full virus scan&nbsp; 2) full disk scan&nbsp; 3) check for drivers with the video card (NVIDIA Geforce Go 7600).&nbsp; I am afraid to restart, for fear it will just fail again.&nbsp; Any other ideas?&nbsp; Did that problem sound like video card&nbsp; (does to me,
 though why work just fine in Safe mode)?</p>

Hi gandrin,</p>
<p>It looks like the video card driver is malfunctioning. The device driver will be disabled in safe mode. To fix this issue, we recommend you to uninstall the existing video card driver and then reinstall it. To do this, try these steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the video card driver for your windows<br />
a. Visit Sony or Nvidia website to download video card driver for your windows.<br />
b. Save the downloaded file on the desktop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If the computer starts in the normal mode by any chance, then uninstall the video card driver<br />
a. Click Start, click Run, type devmgmt.msc and click ok.<br />
b. From the list of items, expand Display adapters.<br />
c. Right click the sub item and click Uninstall.<br />
d. Once it is uninstalled, restart the computer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If the computer does not start in the normal mode, then start the computer in safe mode and disable the video card<br />
a. <strong>See <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/boot_failsafe.mspx?mfr=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Start the computer in safe mode</a></strong><br />
b. Follow Step 2 to open device manager, right click and disable the video card item.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Start the computer in the normal mode and follow Step 2 to uninstall the video card.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Open the downloaded video card driver and install it successfully. Once you've installed the driver, check if the issue persists.</p>

            I did uninstall the driver from graphical device manager (from control panel, then right click on the card properties, then "uninstall"), and when I restarted the computer it installed itself again.&nbsp; The card worked for about 15 minutes then suddenly blanked
 out again.&nbsp; Do you think uninstalling it in devmgmt.msc will be any different, or is the card just dead?

    <title>Is anyone else feeling hurt by microsoft &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is anyone else feeling hurt by microsoft &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello. So after multiple issues with windows 10, countless hours off trying to navigate the internet for solutions, being forced to call for help and being put on hold for hours, i decided to write this post. For future people, the community, and maybe Microsoft
 actually cares i decided to write this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now i can only reach certain sites on my website browser, this problem is the newest of the now 4 -5 bugs i have &nbsp;had with windows 10. Eventually it will get fixed but i started thinking to myself. What did i do wrong? I bought my computer from Best
 Buy, did everything legit, so why am i having problems with Microsoft as if i stole their stuff?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant upgrade because something is wrong. Trouble shooter can't identify the problem. The windows forums really never have answers just techs asking for screen shots or asking some confusing question that they hope will get people off Microsoft's back.
 lol, sadly some geek will answer the tough question, and the problem will still persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After pondering a lot i realized, i really don't like Microsoft. Like i tried, i bought their products, did what their instructions told me to do, and i still get so many problems. These problems are so bad im forced to call and wait on hold for extraneous
 periods of time to finally get my problem fixed. The worst of it is always hearing some infomercial about how convenient windows 10 is, how its appealing, so easy, so this, so that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be honest i feel like a **** a victim. Im always scared my computer is going to have some problem, always scared after a restart or update a new glitch is going to happen, always scared that im not getting my updates, and now a new controversy is how
 windows 10 is causing lag into pc gaming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've lost all confidence in Microsoft. Obviously they will get it fixed after some point, like all big corporations, but i never, never, never, thought Microsoft would ruin their image in my eyes to this degree. I dont know how their going to get my confidence
 back; doubt they care. So now i try to go to sleep wondering how to fix my windows problems, getting ready to go to work, just to have the crappy feeling of knowing when i come home, after work, instead of using my 2 -3 hours of chill time, i will be trying
 to figure out how to fix this new problem i have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank-you Microsoft for being the first company to actually make me extremely depressed. I have my computer to relax and just take it easy from life, and thanks to you even that is too much for an average guy to ask for. Thank-you Microsoft for OS raping
 me. I gave consent for a relationship, but i didn't know id be forced to be doing things i wouldn't like. Thank you Ramsay Bolton, i mean, microsoft.</p>

            <p>I see this post headed..&nbsp; Is anyone else feeling hurt by microsoft?&nbsp;&nbsp; YES I bloody am!. Firstly I do not want to have to get into an online discussion about my angst as I am not equipped technically and intellectually to deal with it. So for that I am soooo
 angry. I am never angry but Microsoft you take the f***in biscuit. After a recent update to my recently upgraded laptop operating system to Windows 10, I ventured to add my sidebar with its gadgets through my desktop shortcut which thankfully remained after
 my upgrade to windows 10 from windows 8. During the failed process of doing so I noticed that a strange vertical bar appeared and instead of my gadgets, my secret, private passwords for programs and apps appeared on screen!!!!!!</p>
<p>WHAT?</p>
<p>You deserve to be sued.</p>
<p>If only I had the money YOU ****. How are they known? I pay for anti-spyware software called Malwarebytes and presumed that I also had Windows defender or summat but hey **** how naive am I now? Can someone at least explain. NEVER IN ALL MY LIFE FELT SO
 ENRAGED</p>

            Ditto people, I too am very frustrated at the mess both my work and diagnostics laptop, and my home pc, &nbsp;have become as a result of these so called upgrades. I never ever thought I would consider going to the dark side, but those gadgets with the little
 apple on them are looking more and more attractive.

<h2>            connecting offline profile to xbox live</h2>
                    
<p>I am having a problem connecting my sons local/offline profile to xbox live. here is what happens</p>
<ol>
<li>I turn on the xbox </li><li>I login as offline user Mason </li><li>I click the XBOX button and select "join xbox live" </li><li>I enter his name "mason" </li><li>I enter an email address for him, note this address does not already have any microsoft account
</li><li>I enter his DOB </li><li>It then asks me to login as parent to complete process, so I select MY user and login
</li><li>It then asks me to enter my address and credit card details, which I do </li><li>error occurs as below </li></ol>
<p>Either I get error 80154058, or it will not let me progress past the credit card validation page because it defeats the country to USA and won;t allow me to change it, thus stopping me from entering a valid address, and the card validation fails.</p>
<p>I have done this 5 times so far, with 5 different email address, same thing every time.</p>
<p>I have already spent weeks dealing with Microsoft support, I have been told I have to create the Microsoft account first, and then join the local user, this does not work, and I have then been told I am doing the wrong thing, even though I was told to do
 this by support. I even had to argue with one of the techs that offline accounts are real as he insisted there was no such thing, and you must have a Microsoft account in order to use the xbox360, I actually had to find the proof of offline profiles on their
 own website and send it to him. I have told that the email address I am using already has a Microsoft account, when it doesn't since I never created one, it is obviously being created by the "join xbox live" process, but they will not accept that and keep
 claiming I am doing it.</p>
<p>Current situation is that I am now being told that Child accounts cannot be joined to xbox live, despite the fact I have 3 other children, all of whomI have previously done this with over the last 10 years, they all started with local profiles, and all joined
 xbox live from that profile.</p>

<p>Actually they are correct that child accounts can no longer be converted from offline to Live accounts. It used to be a possiblity, but hasn't worked that way for the past couple of years. It's even noted in the directions for converting an offline account
 - <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/offline-profile-to-gamertag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../offline-profile-to-gamertag</a></p>
<p>You would have to create a new account via the website and download it through the console.</p>
