<h2>            Backward compatibility, CoD3</h2>
                    <p>We have successfully played COD2 and 4 on xbox1. &nbsp;When we try COD3 individuals can play single player, but we cannot start a multiplayer session. &nbsp;All attempts to issue invites fail. &nbsp;No invite options appear in the game itself and all invite options in
 Xbox1 appear but are not highlighted. &nbsp;We've begun to dig into areas we're not totally comfortable with, i.e. NAT and UPnP. &nbsp;My NAT is strict. &nbsp;I'm reluctant to dabble in things I don't understand well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have suggestions?</p>

<p>Hi Gryphon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming to the forums. Unfortunately having a Strict NAT type will be a barrier when trying to play with others on Xbox Live who have Open NAT type since the Xbox is not connecting to the network securely and a Strict NAT type will prevent the
 network from being able to communicate with the other networks trying to play on the same server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First thing to look into which isn't that difficult is to make sure your router has UPnP toggled on since some routers provided by ISP's don't have it turned on by default. The option is there but you need to log into your router settings and find the switch
 for UPnP that is usually found under the general Networking settings after you log in. Refer&nbsp;to your router manual or look online on their manufacturers support page with assistance in logging into the router settings.&nbsp;Some routers have apps you can manage
 this but mainly you will need to enter the router's IP address into a web browser and then a window to log in will appear. AT&amp;T has been known to give out routers that don't have this setting on by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow this <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/upnp-not-successful" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
guide</a> for basic UPnP troubleshooting on the Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure the UPnP setting is on and let us know if this helps!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>firstly, make sure you're using the 360 mini-guide to send invites, using the Invites options on the Xbox one dashboard won't show up on Xbox 360 titles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, you're going to have to fix the Strict Nat issue your Xbox One if you want to be able send, accept and join games. The Nat Issue is the main reason for your Multi-player issues.&nbsp; For that, you should start

<p>I appreciate the info. &nbsp;It's a bit intimidating but I'll follow up. &nbsp;I have a couple questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- will all players have to have the same NAT and UPnP settings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>-will those setting changes effect other games we've had success with? &nbsp;And in that vein, is COD 3 something unique? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there Gryphon11,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I understand there is an issue with connecting to multiplayer matches due to a strict NAT.
</p>
<p>- The NAT type is established based on the network configuration and connection. Therefore,&nbsp;if the&nbsp;console's NAT is strict it will affect all users on that one console.
</p>
<p>- No they will not affect other games. </p>

    <title>Windows 10 Acting Weird After April 2018 &#40;1803&#41; Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> caffeineswirl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Acting Weird After April 2018 &#40;1803&#41; Update</h2>
                    A couple hours ago, I got the April 2018 Windows 10 update. Now Windows 10 is acting a little weird. For example, some YouTube videos have strange colors that shouldn't be there. Another example is Windows 10 animations. I have the full-screen start menu
 because I think it looks nice. But sometimes upon clicking the start button, the animation glitches and parts of the screen go black for a second. I first discovered the YouTube video color problem on EposVox's Windows 10 1803 review, I thought maybe that
 was just how he made his videos. But then I went to watch a NASA Earth from Space livestream. It was fine for a moment. I went to another tab, came back and found a large green bar at the bottom of the video and one big one a little to the left of the center.
 So now it's starting to seem like a problem with the update since this never happened until the update.

            Hey Swirl.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />For those problems you describe that are occurring in a browser, try another browser to compare. It's always good in Windows 10 to have several in your toolbox. For each browser check the Flash player status, which controls everything that moves in the browser:  <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html</a>
<br />
<br />Next Update the Display driver from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />If this isn't enough then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.   
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Windows photo gallery is gone from my computer</h2>
                    
<p>I have somehow lost my photo gallery from my computer. When I click on it all that appears is a little box that pops up and says ok... I cannot load any photos from my camera. I use to have autoplay pop up, but it does not pop up when I plug in camera. I
 have loaded photos with this camera up until I lost my photo gallery. I have treid downloading windows live gallery. But it will not let me load photos either. How do I get my photo gallery back on and working ??? The computer is a Dell laptop and is only
 9 months old. I have also tried to do a restore when I knew photo gallery was on computer, but the restore did not work, said it had errors and could not restore. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Thank you for posting on the forum.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Quick question, has anything changed on your computer prior to this happening? Is your vista up to date with all the recent Windows
 Update and Service Pack? Do you have any programs running in the background of Vista that manages your photos as well? What could be happening here is, Photo Gallery is not your default program to Auto start when you plug in your camera.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You can try going to your Control Panel &gt; choose Auto Play &gt; and choose Windows Live Photo gallery as your default program to
 open for picture files. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Hope that helps. Please post back and let us know if that worked for you.

<p>
<span>1.Do you have service pack 1 update installed?</span></p>
<p>
<span>2.Have you tried installing the update with Run as administrator?</span></p>

<b><span>Method 1.</span></b></p>
<p>
<span>Check that the copy of Windows is genuine here:

            This is a little confusing because the <i>environment variable</i>&nbsp;%APPDATA% actually refers to&nbsp;c;\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming and %LOCALAPPDATA% refers to c:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local. The folder you want is on the same level as that.

    <title>Windows 10 with Splash Top - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mario-7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 with Splash Top</h2>
                    <p>On my crappy Sony Vaio VPCEB36GM I have the splash top browser. It boots outside of Windows, but reads files stored on the root, C:. It is started using the special keys on the keyboard. My question is, will this continue to work If I choose to update to
 Win 10? I've read that the update destroys the recovery partition, as&nbsp;the splash top reads from this, I believe. &nbsp;I'll sit down and wait for my answer. Thanx b 2 u</p>

            <p>Hi Mario,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Do you have any other OS with the current Windows version in a dual boot mode?</p>
<p>b) What do you mean when you say, "It boots outside of Windows"?</p>
<p>c) Are you able to access the Windows desktop screen&nbsp;having successfully booted your system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade to Windows 10 on a compatible system, nothing will be overwritten, all your programs, games, documents, pictures etc. will be there. You might experience certain compatibility issues with specific devices as manufacturers are in the process
 of updating the drivers compatible to Windows 10. For your specific issue, I would suggest you to throw more light on the issue and provide us the asked information for targeted assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to FAQs related to Windows 10:</p>
<p><em><strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/windows-10-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows&nbsp;10 FAQs</a></strong></em></p>

            <p>In reply:</p>
<p>A) No, Win 7 Pro only</p>
<p>B) Certain Vaio's have a Splashtop browser (it is accessed by a special key on the keyboard) Windows does not boot, but a simple web browser, wifi, and usb drivers load.) It's very convienant. I have read that it will still work, and I have read that it
 will not. Because I have a legacy BIOS, Win 10, I've read, will interrupt this.</p>
<p>C) Yes, windows boots fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still 50-50 on Win 10, the preview, for me, was rotten. Win 7 updates disabled some features. If I have to forgo further uses of my computer, I will not install the update. Your time and assistance is appreciated.
</p>

            <p>most game saves are stored in the cloud and all of your games are available to re-download on the new console after you sign in for the first time.&nbsp; Check out "My Games and Apps" and hit the "Ready to Install" section up.&nbsp; There you will find everything you've purchased for the One console in the past and can re-install pretty quickly and easily.&nbsp; Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 app store downloads stuck</h2>
                    <p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've installed Windows 10 just early in the week and have been using it rather smoothly since then. But a problem has emerged with the store : I had started downloading an app (Fable : Legends) and was well on my way through it, but had to pause and shut
 my computer down. </p>
<p>Today when I booted my computer and tried to get going with the download, it bugged : whereas before it displayed something like "12 Go out of 15", it now goes "11,2 Mo out of 11,2" or something like that and no matter how many times I stop/launch it, it
 doesn't change, it just goes up a couple of Mo and stops again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried downloading other apps, and it does exactly the same thing. I've already tried rebooting the computer and WSreset.exe, nothing has changed so far.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks for the help</p>

            I have not made any changes to my computer since I first installed Windows 10.<br />
<br />
[The download I refer to is "Fable Legends Closed Beta"'s one]<br />
I left the download running for some times and it actually somewhat unlocked, displaying 9,0 Go out of 18,2 Go had been loaded (compared to the previous 11,2 Mo out of 11,2 Mo), so I thought I could let it run through the night. However, 4 hours later and somewhere
 along 18,1 Go out of 18,4 Go (not an inconsistency, the number actually changed) I had to shut down my computer. When I booted it and opened the windows store, the download started again, but once it reached 18,4 Go, the same problem as before occurred : both
 number kept rising at the same time, meaning that it went from 18, Go out of 18,4 Go to 25,0 Go out of 25,0 Go, even though I only noticed a very dismal perturbation in my connection (usually, downloads that are not throttled take up most of our bandwidth).
 Once it reached 25,0 Go, it froze for some times, so I tried rebooting my computer. Once I did, the error code 0x80073CF9 was given to me in the store, and the download was canceled altogether. That was just now.<br />
So I tried going through the steps you gave me and relaunching the download, and I'm now stuck at 10,3 Mo out of 10,9 Mo, also my connection is impeccable.<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate it if you managed to give me any insight on the situation, I'm at a bit of a loss here, I saw people suggesting to check if the AUInstallAgent file was present in the Windows file -it wasn't- and to create it if it was not present -which I did-
 and to then reboot the computer -again, I did it- to see if there was any change. Well, I'm again stuck at 10,3 Mo out of 10,9 Mo.

            <p>After going through the steps you gave me, I tried downloading a couple of lightweight install/updates (twitter and windows photo) and it went smoothly, even if the weigh displayed went up at the same time as the downloaded files, it still went and installed
 perfectly<br />

I'll now launch the download for Fable Legends Closed Beta and will keep you updated as to whether or not it worked (might take a lot of time)<br />

            Okay, so, the download seemed to be going rather well, (it was actually downloading this time, tapping into the bandwidth) but at some point, must've been around 9Gb, it failed again, and gave me again the error code 0x80073CF9

 not be any network fluctuation.&nbsp;Moreover, try&nbsp;not to access or keep opened any application that require network connection at that time.</p>

<h2>            New Video card is struggling to play video as well as other performance issues</h2>
                    <p>Hey all :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to figure out what the heck is wrong with my video card performance (i.e. video playback, Windows 7 performance), some people are saying its PSU, but I'm not sure how much low wattage affects performance. Anyway, &nbsp;I just upgraded my video card
 to a <strong>Gigabyte Geforce GTX 660</strong> from a much older card (<strong>GTS 250</strong>). As soon as this I installed the new GPU, issues started to become more noticeable.<br />
<br />
Here is what is going on:<br />
<br />
1) My video playback (whether it's in VLC or YouTube) is intermittently choppy/low FPS when I'm watching videos (for roughly 3-10 seconds, then back to normal). This usually occurs when I load something from a web browser or when I do some other task on my
 PC; sometimes it does it when I am just watching a video and nothing else. This is did not happen with my older card, which is why it is a bit baffling to me, especially due to my decent system specs, which are listed below. Gaming
<em>seems</em> fine, as far as I know.<br />
<br />
2) Whenever I reboot my machine or turn it on, my monitor shuts off and turns on a few times before loading windows, and sometimes the motherboard logo screen also loads a few times as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Things in general can get a little choppy (like when windows close, or when I move windows around).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempted fixes: Updated my graphics card drivers, installed essential windows 7 codecs pack, enabled/disabled hardware acceleration, increased/lowered fan speed, and checked to see if power is connected to the card. Google has nothing on the subject from
 my searches.<br />
<br />
Here are my specs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating system:</strong> Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit</li><li><strong>PSU:</strong>&nbsp;CORSAIR CMPSU-400CX 400W&nbsp;<br />
(<a href="http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139008</a>)</li><li><strong>CPU</strong>: Intel Core i5 2300 @ 2.80GHz, Sandy Bridge 32nm Technology
</li><li><strong>RAM</strong>: 8.00GB Dual-Channel DDR3 @ 535MHz (7-7-7-20) </li><li><strong>Motherboard</strong>: ASUSTeK Computer INC. P8Z68 DELUXE (LGA1155) </li><li><strong>Monitors</strong>: Gateway FHX2402L (1920x1080@60Hz) (Primary), older Samsung SyncMaster (1680x1050@60Hz) Video Card: 2047MB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 (Gigabyte)</li><li><strong>Storage drives: </strong>
<ul>
<li>232GB Samsung SSD 840 EVO 250GB ATA Device (SSD) </li><li>698GB Hitachi HTS547575A9E384 ATA Device (SSD) </li><li>223GB SSD2SC240GE2DA16B-T ATA Device (SSD)</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>Any advice would be helpful! Thanks!</p>

</p><p>As you have done the usual steps, including disabling hardware acceleration, and</p>
<p>in addition to updating chipset drivers ( as suggested by Srimadhwa) and BIOS -</p>
<p>- While your Corsair psu is a good brand and model, it is 50W below the 450W <em>
minimum</em> recommended </p>
<p>by Nvidia. <em>Minimum</em> being the operative word. Also, Psu's also loose power over time.</p>
<p>Why games would run with no crashing while video run choppy, I can't say for sure, as games use more power than video, and I would think that even when 50W under powered, video should still run without issues... Short term on a new psu.</p>
<p>- It may be due to the graphics card diverting power from the cpu when playing video ?</p>
<p>One other thing you could try when playing video is to go to Nvidia Control Panel Global<br />
Settings and set Power Management mode to Adaptive. This should keep the card from drawing maximum power when playing video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may also help to use only one monitor (at least for troubleshooting), as the 660 will require more power when running two monitors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using the latest drivers try something a bit older, maybe 331.58.</p>
<p>Just to verify - You are uninstalling the drivers via <em>Programs and Features</em> and rebooting</p>
<p>before and after installing the new drivers, yes ?</p>
<p>Also - If you don't use HDMI for audio don't install the Nvidia HD audio part of the driver package.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"some people are saying its PSU, but I'm not sure how much low wattage affects performance. "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The psu is the heart of your system. The importance of which (particularly with gaming machines) is</p>
<p>too often overlooked.</p>
<p>Long term - Get a quality&nbsp;psu &nbsp; with around 500W, especially if you play games that stress the system.</p>

<h2>            Task Manager does not open</h2>
                    <p>Today I tried to open the Task Manager with the Ctrl + Alt + Del but when I click in "Task Manager" it just won't open. For some reason it will only work if I open the taskmgr.exe searching it.</p>
<p>I've tried to enable it in the GPedit than I discovered that I dind't have the GPedit installed, so I've installed. Now the hell starts! When I open the GPedit.msc it says "The MMC couldn't creat the snap-in" with a big Red X. I've searched how to fix it,
 but I couldn't. I've tried changing the x64 AND the x86 line with the %username%:f to "%username%":f didn't worked. I tried to replace the "username" with my very user, but when I try to discover my user I just can't. In the "C:\Usuários\" (I'm Brazilian)
 it just shows 4 folders&nbsp;C:\Usuários\Default.migrated , "C:\Usuários\Owner", "C:\Usuários\Público" and I hidden folder "C:\Usuários\Default". There is no "C:\User\" folder! PLEASE HELP!<br />

<br />2.- Click on Open System Restore.
<br />3.- Click on Next.
<br />4.- Select your restore point, and click Next.
<br />5.- Click on Finish.
<br />

<p>Try running some system file checks:</p>
<p>Method 1: <br />
System file checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</p>

<p>a. Press Windows + X keys and click command prompt (admin). Or PowerShell (Admin).</p>
<p>b. Type the following command in command prompt and press Enter.</p>
<p>sfc /scannow</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it does not help, use method 2.</p>

<p>G'day RANDALL! Unfortunately that link isn't working for me, but let's figure this out.</p>
<p>Did you earn that content on both consoles? If so, have you installed it to your Xbox One console yet?<br />
<br />
<strong>Let's take a look at the game's addons.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In your Games and Apps list, find and highlight Call of Duty: Ghosts. </li><li>Press the Menu button to bring up the game's menu and view all addons. </li><li>The content should appear there if you have access to it on Xbox One. </li></ul>
<p><br />
Let us know what you find!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem, but I purchased the content only on xbox one. &nbsp;I have the new downloads that came out today, as well as the free fall map, and neither of which do I have access to. &nbsp;It says they are installed, but when I go to select them, it

<p>I'm having the same problem, and multiple issues of that problem. Before today, my season pass for call of duty ghosts worked perfectly on xbox one. However, the preorder simon "ghost" riley mask was not. At the same time, my pre order bonuses from gamestop
 for Assassins creed IV Black Flag were also not working (which i've spent literally every day since xbox one came out troubleshooting with ubisoft with no luck). As of today, I downloaded the new christmas camo and wolf skin for call of duty ghosts, and not
 only did those (surprise!) not work, my season pass suddenly and abruptly stop working the moment the content finished downloading.

<p>Ok, guys (and gals?), what I ended up doing is going to the "my games and apps" section of the menu screen. highlighted the "Call of Duty Ghosts" section, and hit the menu button (the three-lined button). &nbsp;It gives you a pop up menu...go down, highlight
 "show all add-ons". &nbsp;Highlight each add on individually hit the menu button again to give you another pop up menu, go down to uninstall. &nbsp;Do this for each add-on that you have. &nbsp;After finishing the uninstall, click the app and re-download the add-on, and it
 should work. &nbsp;This is what I ended up doing. &nbsp;Hope this helps.</p>

is this the exact game that you got</a>? If so, check your My Games &amp; Apps screen for the game. If it's there, select it and see if there's an option to install directly from the game's menu.</p>

<p>Try using the code for Digital Combo on 360 or Xbox.com after redeeming code go to Ghosts on Xbox One and download.
</p>
<p>From a review on Amazon Digital Combo version;</p>
<p>You simply boot up your xbox 360. Go to redeem a code and then download the game. Once that is done. Log onto your xbox one. And go to games and then obviously cod ghosts. And then it says install free. You need to make sure that you use the same gamer tag.</p>

    <title>Why can&#39;t I mark something as spam in windows 10 mail&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> p meister  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I mark something as spam in windows 10 mail&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I get emails to my box from a certain career website. It didn't bother me for a while, but the last week they literally buried me with an avalanche of&nbsp;email and I missed&nbsp;another email that was actually&nbsp;important.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go to unsubscribe on one of their emails and surprise, I can't. Clicking unsubscribe takes me to a web page where there's no option to unsubscribe. Instead&nbsp;I get a huge ad where they try to sell me something instead! That's a 'violation' of email practices/etiquette.
 That makes it spam and an undesirable sender&nbsp;so I won't be dealing with them anymore. Black list them, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay. So, theoretically I should just be able to right click the message and&nbsp;tag&nbsp;the sender or email&nbsp;as spam. I used to be able to do that anyway in Windows live 2012 mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But for some <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">insane, ridiculous </span>
reason (most likely, "how can we be more like Apple?"), the windows 10 Mail developers decided to take out the handy "mark as spam"&nbsp; feature that windows email products have had for over a decade.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Oh, wait, I'm now supposed to do 4 extra steps (clicks) to move it to my junk folder. Really? And "move to junk", a folder that looks exactly the same as 20 of my other folders (had to spend 10 minutes figuring that out). What exactly does that mean? No.
 I want to "mark as spam and block sender". I used to have that option. [Plus I want to be able to send code that nukes their harddrive... now THAT would be something.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Put back the 'mark as spam' right click feature please.</p>
<p>Stop taking useful stuff that we're all used to out for the sake of streamlining. This is an example of Windows 10 design decision over thinking without stopping to ponder why stuff was there in the first place. Stop trying to be Jobs. Be Gates instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>I think you are misunderstanding what is happening.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 Mail app is a total rewrite.</p>
<p>As such it could very well be not that they are making any kind of judgement on if feature A or B is useful.</p>
<p>They are simply not able to put all the needed features in, in the current schedule.&nbsp; New features will surely follow in time.&nbsp; The same is true of Microsoft Edge and other apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime that is of little comfort for people that need to get their jobs done.</p>
<p>And the best suggestion for that is download and install another email program.</p>
<p>Windows Live 2012 mail is still available.&nbsp; There are several threads on&nbsp; here talking about.&nbsp; Some people have problems, but it seems most people can make it work.</p>

            <p>Well, I certainly don't know what the design directive is any more at Microsoft. Who are they making this product for now?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft made its mark as software for business - and you know what? That strategy actually worked. Now I see Microsoft ads featuring toddlers saying, "she'll use her smile instead of a password" and "He'll be able to scribble on the Internet" complete
 with a doodle over the page. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean, how far are they trying to dumb this down? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I upgraded to Windows 10, I've disabled Cortana (who insists on helping me find OTHER people's stuff instead of my own), stopped using the crashy Edge, where you can't even save a file to a folder you choose. I stopped using Mail whose 'simplified'
 monotone blue design is so unclear&nbsp;(so it can&nbsp;make room for&nbsp;a super useful picture of the sky) that I can't see what I've read and what I haven't. Plus I can't right click to&nbsp;manage junk. Bing cannot compete with Google. I&nbsp;disabled all the privacy invasion
 and cloud stuff, removed Gallery (which automatically features every picture I don't need to see)... and the list goes on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean, instead of targeting business enterprises and working to impress the people who run them, Microsoft seems to have decided that a&nbsp;24 year old stay at home mom&nbsp;with no more than a high school education is target number one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing against 24 year old stay at home moms, but they're not exactly running an IT department with a thousand plus users.

</p><p>I too have Windows 10 and it has already taken me 3 days to set it up in an almost functional manner. And setting up is still going. (I dont remember I need to service.msc or group edit policy as soon as I installed Windows to manage very basic things.)</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>I think you are misunderstanding what is happening.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 Mail app is a total rewrite.</p>
<p>As such it could very well be not that they are making any kind of judgement on if feature A or B is useful.</p>
<p>They are simply not able to put all the needed features in, in the current schedule.&nbsp; New features will surely follow in time.&nbsp; The same is true of Microsoft Edge and other apps.</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p><br />
I wonder from when a big enterprise company like Microsoft starts releasing non-functional/ half-functional apps. Being buggy is alot different thing.</p>

</p><p>I feel same when things doesn't work out as expected.</p>
<p>For now, the only thing I can see is to manually delete mails or use different mail program. If you use any office suite, Outlook will be preferred choice (it also has calendar and other contact management stuff, which is good to replace functionality of
 apps). Otherwise, these days browsers have their own mail client.</p>

            <p>There are a few simple ways to control spam, one of which is to stop using the simplistic Mail app which was not intended to be a comprehensive email client.&nbsp; You can use
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Live Mail</a> or<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Mozilla Thunderbird</a>, which I've been happily using for years.
<br />
</p>
<p>The other way is to go to the web interface of your mail provider and use its junk controls.&nbsp; When you see spam in the Mail app, go to the web interface and mark the offending message as junk.&nbsp; This way mail from the same sender will be caught at the server
 and not be seen in the Mail app. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short: Do you intend MS should not improve mail client or like the way it is currently? :D
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long Story:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think any other mail client provides anything extra than&nbsp;what were there in Mail App. It was indeed, intended to be comprehensive mail client. Infact, I never used mail client in Windows until Windows 8 because of its light weight and low effect
 on bandwidth. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is where the problem starts. Duplicate software for almost everything is fed into our Windows system. You should consider other Windows devices too where storage is meagre just enough to hold Windows itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess mail client functionality is not restricted to local system but also to server. If I delete mail from client, it is deleted from server. And so if I select mail as junk, it should also reflect in server. So "This way mail from the same sender will
 be caught at the server and not be seen in the Mail app" was never true. Atleast, till I used other mail clients and Windows 8... I don't know about Windows 10 though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, currently I am ignoring all notifications from Windows 10 mail app. Until mail app matures enough, I will stick to my android for such trivial tasks.</p>

</p><blockquote>I, indeed, appreciate the fact QPW_Test admitted that theres a missing functionality and it may (should) be implemented in future releases.</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I hope everyone here realizes that no one on posting on this thread is from Microsoft, so I'm not sure what you mean about "admitted".&nbsp; I'm stating an opinion based on what I have seen and what Microsoft has stated.&nbsp; As in I can see that even in comparison
 to the Windows 8.1 Mail app some functionality has been dropped.&nbsp; And Microsoft has said that Windows 10 is going be done as a "Windows as a service" with continued improvements.&nbsp; There is a Windows Feedback app, and they are listening, because as an Insider
 (And Insider is just a person that is willing to test pre release builds) I have watched them continually fix and add things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now in the overall scheme of things.&nbsp; I don't think it is reasonable to believe that these "apps" will ever be "full functional" in comparison to the desktop applications.&nbsp; And I base that on two things.&nbsp; One is the whole idea that an "app" needs to be "touch
 friendly", work on small devices, and be "simple".&nbsp; These goals pretty much restrict how many features you can put in.&nbsp; A desktop application can put in more functionality in a smaller space simply because you are using a mouse instead of a finger.&nbsp; There
 is also a limit to how much people will scroll and switch to other windows and such until they call the program too complicated.&nbsp; And the other deciding fact is making money.&nbsp; The full featured products like Outlook, make lots of money and Microsoft is certainly
 not going to make anything that has all its features for free that directly competes with that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for practical workarounds for now, the more I think of it for the problem of spam I have better suggestions than my first suggestion.&nbsp; Some of which have already been suggested by others.</p>
<p>I suggested a new email client, because that directly addresses the request, but it is actually not the most effective.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have almost no spam in Outlook.&nbsp; In fact the few times that I have had spam in Outlook, Outlook is mistaken about it.&nbsp; And I mark it not as junk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why?</p>
<p>It starts with good practices.&nbsp; How much spam you are going to get is going to be directly related to what kind of things you sign up for with your email address.&nbsp; A little pre-thought can save a lot of headache later.&nbsp; Second plan for "risky" email use.&nbsp;
 For instance anything to do with a forum is "risky" in my opinion.&nbsp; The QPW_Test user name is connected to a throw away email address.&nbsp; As if I ever get too much email I will just dump the email address.&nbsp; In general I have four main email addresses, personal,
 business, financial institutions, "the rest/possible spam".&nbsp; My email client reads the personal and business, and the others are setup to be forwarded to the personal email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second part of this is the quality of the ISP/mail server software.&nbsp; I have a business support account that clearly I don't what to shutdown for spam, and clearly has to be very public (It is on my website).&nbsp; Along with my domain account I get email
 addresses, and they are serviced by Google.&nbsp; And they do an excellent job of catching the spam.&nbsp; My regular ISP does an excellent job too even though they don't have much work to do because I have already limited the spam by my practices.&nbsp; They are servicing
 the personal accounts.&nbsp; I use Yahoo mail for the "questionable" ones.&nbsp; and actually I'm not sure about their filters because I seems I do a pretty good job of not signing up with too many spammers, but I could simply abandon the email addresses I use for this
 if I needed to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point here is that you have to realize that even if you are using a good full functional email client, the first line of defense is always the mail servers, and you control it with their web client.&nbsp; I have never seen a email client where you can control
 all the rules and such from just the client.&nbsp; The spam filtering for the clients is just applied to what the server sends on.&nbsp; And in a lot of cases it would be better to use the server's web client to tell it about spam, so that their spam filtering can learn
 from it.</p>

            <p>you should still be able to mark as spam but you have to log into "outlook" version of email. see screen shot below. not ideal when you have shortcut right to email from your start menu.

<p>Also, clicking unsubscribe may not help you, so many sites use your viewing habits and send you advertisement based off what you search for. many sites have a privacy notice and you can opt out of having your information shared and eliminate use of your
 personal info for advertising. There is way to download app so that it will prevent sites from collecting/sharing your data. I am still trying one out myself and so far I have had to reset my windows privacy settings every time I log in. you can check out

<p>I have used this app on my Xbox 360 for months.</p>
<p>But trying to setup the app under a new account only shows a grey screen.</p>
<p>I know that ITV have moved to a new "ITV Hub" system, so I suspect that it's something to do with this.</p>

            Hi Yong Liang Tan, the mini-dump file indicates your graphics card driver as the culprit behind your System crashes . . .
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager - Accessible by right clicking your Start Button 
<br />Expand the Display Devices section 
<br />Right click your graphics card and choose properties 
<br />On the driver tab, choose 'Roll Back Driver' 
<br />If the Roll back option is grayed out, right click the device and choose Uninstall 
<br />Confirm deletion of the driver files 
<br />
<br />Either way, restart your PC . . .       
        </p>

            That is the reason of the crash. Have you consulted the manufacturer if they provide any updated driver?

            Yes. There is a large difference between driver model of Windows 7 and 10. A driver designed for 7 has 50/50 chance of running on 10.

<h2>            Logitch Profiler Will Not Start</h2>
                    Logitech Profiler program will start in "Test" Administrator Account, but not main Administrator Account.&nbsp; In Main Administrator Account,&nbsp;have used "FixIt" to stop running programs, System Configuration to stop all non-Microsoft Services, and Selective
 Startup with only System Services, with the Logitech Profiler program attempting to start, but hour glass turns once and disappears and program will not start.&nbsp; Logitech tech support states "some program is stopping Logitech Profiler from starting in the Main
 Administrator Account, since it does startup perfectly in the "Test" Administrator Account."&nbsp; Since all running startup programs are stopped, along with all non-Microsoft services, how can I determine which program is stopping the Logitech Profiler program

            <p>The account you call "Main Administrator account" cannot start the profiler, the account you call "Test", can start the profiler, so my point is that&nbsp;the&nbsp;"Main Administrator account" is possibly corrupted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Logitech Profiler in my&nbsp;Flight Simulator games too, so I appreciate the difference.&nbsp; I offer the corrupted profile, as a possible solution, a solution which you yourself have stumbled upon by saying that one admin&nbsp;user works but one admin user&nbsp;doesn't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both users would have equal access to services and programs running on your machine, you can double check if you like via the clean boot procedure.</p>

<br />Pro is the exact same operating system with just a few hidden features unlocked.  So if you don't need those features there's no reason to pay extra.
<br />List here:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compare" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compare</a>
<br />
<br />You can save a System Image backup of WIndows 8.1 so at any time you can go back in 20 minutes:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>
<br />
<br />Then install the Media Creation Tool from this link choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   This will save your files and apps while bringing you up to the latest version by the most stable method.  It will also bring all of your Updates current and solve most problems since it reinstalls Windows.  
<br />
<br />If any problems report back the verbatim error and number, then continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<p>There's also a way to enable the gpedit.msc on Home Edition, something useful for Home Edition.</p>
<p>That's probably the only significant thing Pro would offer an average Home User.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will give a little more control over Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's also a way to disable Automatic Updates on Home. The Fascist Overlords don't like me publicising this information however.</p>

<p>Ouch! Please don't yell at us. We can hear you if you type normally, in mixed case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are a home user, there is rarely any benefit to running Professional. Almost certainly, you should save the money and stick with Home.</p>
