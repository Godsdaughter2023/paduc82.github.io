<h2>            Calendar tile won&#39;t show on START screen &#40;ok on task bar&#41; &#63; Build 10130 -- AND can we have separat tile for CALENDAR from Office365&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I see calendar in the drop down list, but, unlike other non MS Calendar apps, I can't get the official APP to appear as a Larger tile on the Start screen.&nbsp; It does, however show up on the task bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AS well -- having a direct way to reach Office 365 calendar, via a standalone app, would be great.&nbsp; I think this is in&nbsp;8.1 -- but I'm not positive.</p>

    <title>Power Query Freezing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Power Query Freezing</h2>
                    I built a workbook in Excel 365 that utilizes Get &amp; Transform.&nbsp; Its pulling in data from multiple source most of which are a couple hundred kb at most with one that is maybe 16 mb.&nbsp; It runs perfectly on my machine, but I need other people in the office
 to use it and everyone else is still on Office 2010.&nbsp; When I run it on their machines with Power Query it freezes up.&nbsp; I have tried limiting the amount of queries it is actually running when I hit refresh all to just a few. As opposed to the 31 I can run on
 my machine.&nbsp; Do you have any advice on how to improve power query for Excel 2010 to stop Excel from crashing every time I try and refresh the data?

<p>Hi Dan</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a general guidance with mixed versions of Excel, the query should be built using the "lowest" version - Excel 2010 in your case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still have the same issue after re-building the query with Excel 2010 I would recommend you post it on the more specialized forum ==&gt;
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=powerquery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>ActiveSync Certificate Authentication - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael.bailey.airwavesolutions.co.uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            ActiveSync Certificate Authentication</h2>
                    
<p>Currently looking to migrate from on premise to Office 365 and planning our deployment.</p>
<p>With our on premise solution we use ActiveSync published through F5 APM and manage mobile devices using AirWatch with email "containerised" within AirWatch Inbox container.</p>
<p>To avoid users just accessing ActiveSync from any device with just a username and password we deploy enterprise certificates to all devices using AirWatch&nbsp;and configure the F5 APM to only allow connections to ActiveSync from devices that present a valid
 client certificate.</p>
<p>This means that only devices registered correctly in AirWatch and configured for email containerisation are allowed to access email and users cannot simply use their username and password in the native mail client and also should a device be lost or stolen
 that it can be enterprise wiped via AirWatch removing the certificate and thus immediately stopping email access.</p>
<p>Have found the following posts from earlier this year saying its not possible to achieve this with Office 365:</p>
<p>https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/173/p/349060/946956?ss=49ce8717-e901-473d-824e-c04afe52bd61#946956</p>
<p>https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/173/t/343927</p>
<p>Have also read a number of blogs which talk about using ADFS 3.0 to deliver certificate based authentication to office 365 but these seem to not deal with ActiveSync:</p>
<p><a href="http://skype4b.uk/2015/06/12/adfs-multifactor-authentication-not-good-for-office-365/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://skype4b.uk/2015/06/12/adfs-multifactor-authentication-not-good-for-office-365/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.clouduccino.com/2015/04/multi-factor-authentication-office-365-adfs-v3-0-ssls-via-intune/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.clouduccino.com/2015/04/multi-factor-authentication-office-365-adfs-v3-0-ssls-via-intune/</a></p>
<p>Is there a way to achieve certificate based authentication for ActiveSync&nbsp;to Office 365 at this time?</p>
<p>If not is the only method to restrict devices to use Device Access Rules and block all devices until approved manually which obviously creates a major overhead and does not deliver the same level of security as there is no means to force containerisation
 etc.</p>
<p>Any advice appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi MBAWS,</p>
<p>Regarding” Is there a way to achieve certificate based authentication for ActiveSync to Office 365 at this time?”, the answer is no. As you may see, we just can set mobile device access rules to allow/block your mobile users’ access in Office 365.</p>

<p>I cannot see how we differentiate between email applications on a device. &nbsp; If the device is authorised then how do we stop a user configuring their email in the native email client as opposed to within the containerised email application?</p>

                    <p>It seems like Microsoft doesn't want to fix this issue. Every since the May update I've been receiving this message on my band and on the Health app for Windows 10. A continuous loop of "Oops... An unknown error has occurred with your band". I've tried everything!
 Uninstalled, reinstalled, factory reset, changed phones... you name it! The only thing that works now is to install an older APK of the app, but then I can't update it and use the latest version... Ridiculous!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oops, major screw up from Microsoft and now the Band team has completely lost my trust. So much for promoting this product... it is now a useless piece of junk.</p>

Thank you for reaching out. Are you still having difficulty with using your Microsoft Band 2 as well as the Microsoft Health App? Were you able to un-pair both devices before resetting the Band?&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>To address your concern, we suggest that you <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-band/en-us/support/phone-app/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
reset</a> the Band and uninstall-reinstall the Microsoft Health App (via Windows Store or Google Play Store as fresh download) and we recommend not to use the older APK. Keep us posted.</p>

            <p>Hi Steven,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Windows 10 Insider Preview.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you want to keep the existing OneNote app after upgrading to Windows 10.</p>
<p><sub>&nbsp;</sub></p>
<p>For better understanding of the issue, please provide us following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Which version of OneNote app are you referring to?</li><li>Have you downloaded the app from store or is it downloaded from a web browser?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the OneNote app you are referring to is downloaded from Windows Store, while upgrading it should remain intact, however if a new update for the app gets released it will be replaced with the older version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have downloaded OneNote from web, you may save the installer file to reinstall the same app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps, do let us know if you need further assistance with Windows.</p>
        </p>

<p>Use Task Manager Details tab, CommandLIne column to see what is actually happening.&nbsp; The 64-bit version is called the "chrome" task.&nbsp; It manages the UI and the other tab tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 32-bit version is called the "tab" task and it is just a way of running
 the browser as you may think of it as one window per task.&nbsp; However, it isn't really a 1-1 mapping of task to tab.&nbsp; That depends on, among other things, how much memory you have.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to find out more about this implementation do a web search for&nbsp;
 LCIE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way of looking at this detail is to use a WMIC query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; wmic.exe&nbsp; Process&nbsp; where&nbsp; Name="iexplore.exe"&nbsp; get&nbsp; CommandLine, ProcessId</p>
<p>
</p><p>E.g. open a cmd window and enter that.&nbsp; Alternatively, you could just start&nbsp; wmic.exe&nbsp; and then enter the rest of that line as its subcommand.&nbsp; Then to leave you would either enter quit or exit or just close the window.</p>

            <p>MS periodically re-validates all licenses. So maybe your volume license was caught in that cycle (not that I've heard that is a normal occurrence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But frankly, MS activation is a "black hole". We drop our product keys into it, but have no idea how it all works.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't say it is not accepting the keys, so I am guessing re-activation is working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want more specific information you should contact MS activation support. Do NOT bother with normal MS Support. They don't have access to the activation system so they are useless when it comes to providing support for this sort of problem (but they
 don't admit it!). You should start the activation process, then select the phone activation option. This will give the specific phone number for your general location.&nbsp; When you phone in, do NOT reply to the initial prompts. Wait until you are given the option
 of talking to a live "service" rep.</p>

<h2>            Why is Quick Parts in Outlook 2010 being saved to my .ost file&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want to be able to move my Quick Parts to a new computer, but it seems to be saving it in my .ost file and not the normalemail.dotm file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I discovered this by saving a change to Quick Parts, and then quickly looking at the last 100 files that were changed on my Windows 7 PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were only&nbsp;3 files changed, NTUSER.DAT, ntuser.dat.LOG1, and my Outlook .ost file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I doubt Quick Parts is using the NTUSER files, it has to be saving to the .ost file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to change this behavior and have it save outside of the .ost file so I can easily transfer just my Quick Parts to a new PC?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand it should be saved in %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Templates but it is not as those files modified dates do not change once I save Quick Parts.</p>

            <p>I've done some testing and Quick Parts are, indeed, stored in %AppData%\Microsoft\Templates\NormalEmail.dotm when using an Exchange account for email.&nbsp; This is despite information I had read that QPs were store in the file I had mentioned.&nbsp; As in many other
 cases, I had to close Outlook before the file system would show the file had been updated.&nbsp; Outlook must hold NormalEmail.dotm open permanently while it is running so that updates don't get seen by the file system until Outlook closes the file when you close
 Outlook.</p>
<p>I created some QPs, closed Outlook, and NormailEmail.dotm showed the new modification date.&nbsp; I reopened Outlook and my QPs were there.&nbsp; I closed Outlook, deleted NormalEmail.dotm, reopened Outlook and the QPs were gone.</p>

            <p>Hi Charles,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> Open Internet Explorer (IE) in no add-ons mode and see if that fixes the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start Internet Explorer without add-ons,</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click the <b>Start</b> button, and select
<b>All Programs</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Accessories</b>, and select
<b>System Tools</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Internet Explorer (No Add-ons).</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If disabling all add-ons solves the problem, you might want to use Add-on Manager to disable all add-ons and then turn on add-ons only as you need them. This will allow you to
 figure out which add-on is causing the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please see “Method 3: Run Internet Explorer in "No Add-Ons" mode” in the following article for further instructions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Is Internet Explorer slow? 5 things to try</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If running IE in no add-ons mode does not fix the issue, follow the other methods mentioned in the above article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> I would suggest you to reset Internet Explorer settings and check if that fixes the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Reset Internet Explorer 9 settings</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Reset-Internet-Explorer-settings-in-Internet-Explorer-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Reset-Internet-Explorer-settings-in-Internet-Explorer-9</a></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b></p>
<p>Please note that resetting Internet Explorer (IE) settings will reset all user-defined settings including those set by installed extensions, toolbars and other add-ons to IE Defaults.
 This includes all Security, Privacy and Zone settings. Also this will clear browsing history, delete all temporary Internet Files, cookies, form data and especially all stored passwords.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps!</p>

                    <p>Hello, My Lumia 535 dual is just a week old, I have not updated nor installed any apps, but for the last two days it just started switching itself on and off and I now don't know what to do with it. Please advise because i'm considering returning it to the

<p>I was so happy about this phone, i'm now frustrated. I'm in Kenya.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Ann,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an important software update for restarting issues. Make sure that is installed on the phone, from your local support pages starting at:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-xm/mobile/support/product/lumia535-dual-sim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-xm/mobile/support/product/lumia535-dual-sim/</a>
</p>
<p>There's a yellow box on the page with a link how-to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the restart update is installed already:</p>
<p>Before returning it to the shop, make sure the battery, the SIMs and SD memory card (in any) is properly seated - switch off the phone, remove all and reinsert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please also notice: SIM2 is 2G only. The phone becomes confused when the SIM inserted in the secondary slot only has access to 3G. If in doubt, ask the operator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I advise take it to the shop after this basic troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-- <br />
Hans</p>

<h2>            E71 Wifi Connection Problems</h2>
                    I have a problem with wifi. The phone detects and connects to my home SKY Netgear router, it will load the first page but then hangs! It must be downloading data as any url I type can be viewed, once only!! Any Ideas?<br />
<br />
Apart from the above, the phone is first class! I use it sync with my exchange server, push mail works great. It even connects to my VW SAP Car kit. Good Work Nokia.<br />
<br />
But I need the wifi problem resolving!!!!

            Another setting that might help is to change the "channel setting" on your router to a specific channel rather than leaving it to "auto". Then change the same setting on your E71 to the same channel.<br />
<br />
I've had problems on 3 E-series so far, with specific channels such as 1-3, 6, 8 and 10-12. Router brands I've had are Netgear, SMC and Linksys. Currently using Linksys WRT54G without any need to change channel. Can't remember the other 2 models though.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

The mentioned setting won't change anything if you are not able to associate with your AP.

            <p><span>Hi Salah,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 Technical preview.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please answer the following questions so that we can help you.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Do you receive any error message?</span></li><li><span>Do you have any security software installed on the computer?</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to follow the methods below:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1: Run Windows Update troubleshooter</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Windows Update troubleshooter checks the network adapter and Windows Update services &amp; tries to fix them automatically.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Refer the following steps:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press&nbsp;‘<strong>Windows + W’</strong>&nbsp;key on the keyboard, this will bring the search interface.</span></li><li><span>Type in ‘<strong>Troubleshooting’</strong>&nbsp;and click on ‘<strong>Settings’&nbsp;</strong>for the result.</span></li><li><span>Under ‘Troubleshoot computer problem’ click on ‘<strong>View all</strong>’ on panel to the left.</span></li><li><span>Open ‘<strong>Windows Update’ troubleshooter</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Follow the on-screen instructions.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2: Make sure that the date and time are correct on the computer</span></span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Check the setting for Date/Time by choosing the Desktop tile and then left click on the date/time in the corner.</span></li><li><span>Click on change date and time settings. And then verify the time zone is correct as well as the internet time tab has the option to Synchronize with Internet time server.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 3:&nbsp;Disable Anti-virus program</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you are using any third party Anti-virus program, disable it to check if it’s conflicting.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Important Note</span></strong><span>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable
 it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 4: Manually reset the Windows Updates Components</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to manually reset the Windows Updates Components.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Resetting Windows update components diagnoses and fixes problems with Windows Update.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer the steps below to Reset Windows update components:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows Key + X</strong>&nbsp;on the keyboard and then select “Command Prompt (Admin)” from the menu.</span></li><li><span>Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands&nbsp;in command prompt. Press the “<strong>ENTER</strong>” key after you type each command.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop wuauserv</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop cryptSvc</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop bits</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop msiserver</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Now rename the&nbsp;<strong>SoftwareDistribution</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Catroot2</strong>&nbsp;folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Now, let’s restart the&nbsp;<strong>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>Windows Update Services</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the&nbsp;<strong>ENTER</strong>&nbsp;key after you type each command.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start wuauserv</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start cryptSvc</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start bits</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start msiserver</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Type&nbsp;<strong>Exit&nbsp;</strong>in the&nbsp;<strong>Command Prompt</strong>&nbsp;to close it.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Now you may try running the Windows Updates and check if the above steps resolve the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Registry disclaimer</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>To do so: Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully.

    <title>Outlook calendar folders are automatically duplicated upon re-opening - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesess  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook calendar folders are automatically duplicated upon re-opening Calendars</h2>
                    <p>Using Office 2013 on Windows 7. I manage scheduling for a medium-size company, so I have many shared calendars in my Outlook, and I have editing permission for six of them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I re-open Outlook Calendars at the start of the day, it defaults to opening&nbsp;the last calendar that was viewed the previous day, but it generates a new calendar folder for that particular calendar, duplicating the one I already have saved as a shared
 calendar. I end up with multiple copies of the same calendar if I don't maintain it by deleting duplicates. In some cases, Outlook is generating a primary calendar that&nbsp;was previously just a shared calendar, and I am unable to delete it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to either set a particular calendar to be the default on opening, or simply prevent Outlook from creating duplicate calendars every time I open the program - especially primary calendars that I have no control over.</p>

    <title>Windows live and outlook service is completely unreliable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oztrax  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows live and outlook service is completely unreliable</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft, I have a serious problem with your email service delivery. Same issues for Outlook and for Live Mail</p>
<p>Contacting Microsoft on phone for assistance is not easy as I will not sit on line internationally for an hour waiting to talk to an assistant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Location... I am in Shenzhen China. </p>
<p>Network Service... either direct to on line service to China Mobile or via a proxy server as needed. Service providers vary.</p>
<p>Separate Email addresses on Windows live:... 14, with Hotmail, outlook, and live extensions.</p>
<p>Email addresses on Gmail... 1</p>
<p>Operating system:... Windows 7 with all upgrades in place. Versions come from Australia, not China. Australian computers</p>
<p>Legal copies:... yes to all programs installed</p>
<p>Number of computers: 5</p>
<p>Locations of computers: 3 places in China, 1 place in Australia</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conditions of use: Both business and personal</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem:</p>
<p>I have been using windows live for as many years as its existed and outlook recently, To my knowledge all my systems have the latest upgrades installed.</p>
<p>However Microsoft email service is completely erratic and not consistent. This problem has become more serious in recent months. It did not always exist. This usage is in Shenzhen China.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;China&nbsp;I have two computers on my desk each with a version of windows live 2012 running. Two computers helps to overcome service problems. When I log on in the morning these days, most times some or all of the email addresses will not work. One or more
 versions of your error messages come up. Different messages numbers come up for different email addresses... but error messages are not consistent day to day. Often by afternoon, most of all of&nbsp;the email addresses will work normally. But it varies. And...
 each computer may have different email addresses in or out of service. Service is not consistant between both computers.</p>
<p>This means that the problem lies outside my computers. It does not matter if I use direct connections to local services or via a proxy, the problem is the same. A second office in China with a different service provider even when using the same computer
 creates the same problem... erratic service on both or different computers. </p>
<p>Many times if trying to send a larger file (say less than 3Mb) the sending fails other times it works fine. When receiving multiple files with attachments, say four consecutive separate emails, sometimes all will come through... and sometimes&nbsp;all or some
 may fail. Sometimes one comes through while the next three have the same attachment as the first, but no text... instead of the correct attachment. So the multiple transmissions are corrupt and are a fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the rub, Microsoft... Gmail does not have this problem. So what is wrong with you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm so frustrated that I am now at the point of switching the most critical service to Gmail, but I've been with Microsoft for so long... I'm giving you one last try to assist me. And you fix it or I go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to say, attempting to get through to you for email service assistance is the most frustrating thing imaginable. Other questions I had recently with another problem recently also a Microsoft email issue, not my issue... were a frustrating failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please assist to resolve this problem, </p>

            <p>Previous long term user of MS' Outlook Express with XP going back to early days where relative simplicity prevailed and everything tended to be more reliable. If only we could have the reliability of OE built into Win Live Mail, we would be immensely better
 off. &nbsp;Unreliable email is the norm. Fobbing off also seems to be the norm, which makes life for mere mortals, soon dead from life fighting with unreliable Operating Systems in order to maintain a semblance of &nbsp;acceptable productivity. The problems have been
 getting progressively worse during the past year especially. Photo album with JPG doc seem to travel successfully, but that is an inefficient work around which inconveniences my clients when the delivered documents should have been in PDF. Attempting to send
 emails with attachments today has become an unacceptably onerous nightmare. Productivity is at an all time low.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried Hotmail, Outlook with similar results to that of WLM. For some inexplicable reason, emails with attachments sent with BCC to myself via a different address, return as would be expected. The attachments returned thus can be opened and saved, which
 made me wonder if the Telstra/Bigpond ISP in Australia was at fault. I've spent hours on the phone with their technical people, so far without success. Being perpetually fobbed off with ostensible fixes that prove not to be fixes, is painful as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've wasted weeks of valuable business time while trying to send essential business pdf and jpg documents as attachments from 5 different computers with different O/S. (Win 10, Win 8.1, and 2xWin 7 all wired on Ethernet cables from fixed line router; another
 laptop Win 7 enterprise on WIFI). Each and every one of them (when running seemingly as per normal expectations), exhibits erratic email capacity. Failures are the norm and get tedious in the extreme. Repeating the despatch with the same attachment(s) from
 a different computer sometimes works. Experiments with using different "From" addresses sometimes works, but mostly don't make any difference. Generally emails without attachments travel to their intended destinations satisfactorily. Emails with attachments
 (usually &lt;100Kb), frequently fail and are frustrating in the extreme for me and the intended recipient. Sometimes the attachments get converted into gobbledygook in the body of the email when returned by annoyed recipients. Sometimes the email goes astray,
 perhaps to the dark side of the Moon. Having disappeared entirely, where nothing appears in the "Sent" folder, the sensation overall is like drowning in a sea of useless ****.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While we are on the subject of spitting the dummy, consider this: Only one computer of 4 attempted actually successfully upgraded to Win 10. All have O/S installed on SSD, with HD for main program and data storage. Three of them (64 bit) failed and "Rolled
 Back" to the previous O/S ostensibly, but in fact completely destroyed all three of them. After spending days trying to resurrect the previous setups, I had to resort to formatting and starting again. If MS management had a fraction of the marketing skills
 of a hot dog vendor they would have allowed customers to do clean installs using their existing legal License Keys, but not so. The rollout of Win 10 has been a total disaster, contrary to MS hype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only success (albeit temporary) was a 32 bit Win 10 upgrade that seemed fantastic at first, but became increasingly unreliable daily and is now completely defunct - cannot boot any which way. DVD's not recognised. USB not recognised. Cannot access BIOS,
 cannot boot from original HD (Win 7) either as it's been corrupted. The real problem is that MS has taken away the user's ability to readily apply user fixes. Maybe MS lives a dreamy ideal world where they believe that their O/S were always reliable, when
 in fact it has always been the user's ability to apply frequent fixes to previous O/S that has kept them going, to maintain productivity, to which MS has been largely oblivious. I refuse to attempt to upgrade to Win 10 until such time as the grossly inept
 Win 10 rollout, its mountain of bugs and the loss of user control has been fixed.</p>

            <p>In that case, the correct page number should appear on each page.&nbsp; If you print the document, are the page numbers correct?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you inserting a Page Break, or a Next Page Section Break?&nbsp; With the latter, the page numbers can be formatted to either Continue from the previous section of the restart at a number that you specify.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, unless you have a reason for starting a new Section, a page break should be all that you are using and unless you want to force a page break to occur before the page is full, there is no need to do anything as the text will automatically flow from

                    I'm trying to link Calendar, Tasks, and Contacts from Outlook 2010 to Access 2010. Problem is, one of the CRITICAL fields--Category--won't show up. (I know other important fields likewise don't show up, such as tons of fields in Contacts.) WHY IS THIS?!

            <p>First - Pollardie is correct in that many of your questions are Access related (specifically anything related to linking/syncing) and should be posted in:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/access?page=1&amp;tab=all">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/access?page=1&amp;tab=all</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, to fast track this a little</p>
<blockquote>I'm trying to link Calendar, Tasks, and Contacts from Outlook 2010 to Access 2010. Problem is, one of the CRITICAL fields--Category--won't show up. (I know other important fields likewise don't show up, such as tons of fields
 in Contacts.) WHY IS THIS?!
<div><br />
<div>Is there a fix?</div>
</blockquote>
<p>It's the way the MS Access addins were designed. No fix (that I'm aware of) and not an Outlook issue since it's not the one establishing the connection or exposing fields.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<div>I tried import/export from Outlook 2010 to Access 2010, but it only supports Access 97-2003, not Access 2010 databases. (Likewise with Excel, only Excel 97-2003.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Why would Microsoft do this? What's the fix?</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The fix is to save your Access .accdb databse as an .mdb file and Excel workbooks as an .xls file. The import/export process has not changed since O'2000 (or earlier - in answer to "why would Microsoft do this). While many have asked the same question about
 the current Access/Excel native formats - this is just how it works today<br />
</p>
<blockquote>I thought I read about BCM for Outlook 2010 supports a better import/export, but is that only for data in BCM? What if I install BCM, but "just use Outlook"? Would I get the import/export to Access 2010 and Excel 2010, even
 if the folders are in Outlook?<br />
</blockquote>
<p>Yes BCM employs it's own import/export process for .accdb/xlsx file types but only for BCM&nbsp;item types&nbsp;- would not apply to the standard Outlook folders. You still need to emply the standard import/export wizard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Finally, how does one link from Access to Outlook, or, alternatively, keep importing and exporting between Access and Outlook (and thereby sync between the two by constantly overwriting the data from the first to the second, then vice versa, in order to

<br />
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#1 - You can only "link" to Outlook folders where changes on either side (Outlook/Access) will be visible to each side immediately in 'real-time" since both sides are looking at the exact same dataset.
</p>
<p>#2 - You cannot directly associate an Access table to a "linked" Outlook folder. More pointedly, you cannot "map" a field from one table to a linked Outlook table and then have dynamic bi-directional updating. There may be variations available via queries
 but will leave that to those more involved with day-to-day Access development. That question would need to be posed in the forum noted above - answer (if any)&nbsp;would not likely be something that is "out-of-the-box".</p>
<p>"Sync'ing" generally infers on-going updates at some pre-deternined time(s) where changes can be made on either side of the equation without the knowledge of the other side in between "sync" sessions. That in turn requires designation of primary/secondary
 directional updating and some form of "conflict resolution". Not a trivial task if it's going to be done right and goes beyond just the simple association of&nbsp;2 datasets (of any kind).</p>
