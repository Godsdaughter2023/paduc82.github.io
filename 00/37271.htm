<h2>            Everything I click on gives me class not registered messages and nothing is fixing it</h2>
                    <p>ok so my computer has Windows 10 and it updates by itself. Everything worked fine until it updated July 26th 2018 and now everything is a mess. I cannot access anything. Everything I click on gives me a message that's says various messages along with class
 not registered. &nbsp;Iam not able to click on the task bar at all and Windows key doesn't do anything. I was able to get into task manager by right clicking on task bar, &nbsp;and I typed in a few commands I found online. I've run them as admin And so far this is what
 I tried which none of them has worked: sfc /scannow, which I tried several times and it always stops at 38% and says Windows resource protection could not perform the requested operation. DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth, which I also tried several
 times. It says image version 10.0.16299.547, does a scan, and stops at 12.2% with a error code 1392, and a message that says the file or directory is corrupted and unreadable. I've tried system restore to restore from earlier points, which there was 7 of them.
 I did them all and that didn't fix it. I've tried reinstalling Windows 10, which I had to do it from the log in screen, holding shift key while clicked on restart, and it took me to the blue screen where you can reset your pc, and I choose the option to save
 my personal files ( pictures, music etc ). I did not fix the issue. And actually it made things worse because it deleted my Firefox stuff and I can't get online whatsoever with explorer. I found an Firefox download thing in my downloads and even that gets
 interrupted at a point of download. was hoping that would give me access to the internet at least to try and download a tool to help with this but can't. I've also tried to end task with explorer.exe with task manager and that doesnt do anything. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anything else I can do? Someone suggested I get an external hard drive and put all my picture and music on it, then totally boot windows 10 from scratch using boot disk. &nbsp;</p>

            Hi BearLedoux, I agree with the suggestion to back up your personal files to an external hard drive, then do a complete reinstall of Windows 10. Using a working PC with Windows 10, you can use the Media Creation Tool to make a Windows installer. You can make a Windows installer from a USB flash drive or other external drive with at least 8 GB of storage space and separate from the one you back up your personal files to.
<br />On the working PC with Windows 10, go to this page: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />Click "Download tool now" then run the application. On the "What do you want to do?" page, select the option to create a Windows installer for another PC. 
<br />Please let me know if you have any further questions.       
        </p>

<p>Yep lol I actually did that twice. The first one didn't do anything so I thought well maybe something happened where it didn't load everything. So tried it a second time and it was the same. Did nothing to fix it. I'm not sure why cuz I had a problem a year
 ago where I had to do a reset and everything worked as it should. &nbsp;But, I was thinking that maybe there's a hardware problem? I checked the device manager for both hard drives ( both sata ) and it says on both that everything is working fine. But today I noticed
 a weird noise coming from where the hard drives are located, and it sounded like a deep vibration :(</p>
<p>which it has not made any noise at all except for the usual healthy hard drive noises, until today, and that noise comes and goes. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Appears your registry never was properly updated on the Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cant remember Laptop or PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The vibration on laptop could be the fan, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I was going to suggest to uninstall the update from July, but appears you can not do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I suggest to try.</p>
<p>Go here and try the update assistant</p>
<p>Download Link:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If it fails, then try the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have the DVD or USB Media V1803 Creators Update from April, Put it in and try and install it again, and selecting to keep your files and settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have one, you can use any PC and create the media with the tool.</p>
<p>Download Link:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure to select the correct version such as Home or Pro</p>
<p>The correct Platform. Most Likely 64 Bit</p>
<p>And to keep your files and settings.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Disconnect intern speakers by change values in the registry.</h2>
                    
<p><span>There is probably a fault with my "headphone gate" in my laptop, so when I connect the plug&nbsp;to my&nbsp;external speakers, the internal speakers will not be automatically&nbsp;muted as they should.</span></p>
<p><span>So my question is: Are there any values which can be changed in the registry, who then will completely&nbsp;turn off the internal spaekers? So I don`t have to open my laptop and&nbsp;pull out&nbsp;the speakers connectors from the motherboard...
 I run XP Pro SP3</span></p>

<p>Thanks for your answer, Andrew!</p>
<p>But I have already tried the easy options, such as tried to adjust the speaker(s) in the volume properties, with no luck. Because of the fault with my "headphone gate", the common options don`t work unfortunately! One strange thing is that when I select
 "Mute" on PC Speaker, the volume&nbsp;in the intern speakers&nbsp;turns up a little bit, not get&nbsp;silenced as they normaly&nbsp;should...&nbsp;</p>

<p>But unfortunately I don`t have such as Realtek HD Audio Manager in Hardware and Sound page, I got Conexant AMC Audio and there is not the same options. So I need to adjust the Headphone Jack Sensor (as I don`t know how to) or disable the PC Speaker in the
 registry (as I rather&nbsp;also don`t know how to)... &nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try the steps given below and check if that helps you to accomplish what you want.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Go
 to</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/283658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>'Device Manager'</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 View and click "Show hidden devices"</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Find
 "Non-Plug and Play Drivers" in Device Manager.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on the + next to "Non-Plug and Play Drivers" and double-click on 'Beep'</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Within
 the "Beep properties" window click the Driver tab.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Under
 the driver tab if you wish to temporarily disable this device click the Stop button. If you wish to permanently disable this device under the Startup Type select Disabled.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that does not help then you may try the registry fix.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Go
 to Start menu &gt; click on RUN and then type regedit to run Windows Registry Editor.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Go
 to following address:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Sound</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Change
 the value of String ‘Beep’ to No</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 the String is not there then, create a new STRING value and name it as ‘Beep’ (without quotes), give it value of ‘No’ (without quotes).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Close
 Windows Registry Editor and restart your computer</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Important:</span></strong></span><span><span> This section, method, or task contains steps
 that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can
 restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following link.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I&nbsp;may not&nbsp;have</span>&nbsp;<span>explained&nbsp;</span><span>myself</span>&nbsp;clearly&nbsp;<span>enough</span><span>about</span>
<span>what </span><span>the problem consist in. The problem is not the system sounds like "beep", but&nbsp;it`s the Speakers in my Laptop who will not be silenced
 when I put in the Headphone Plug in the Headphone Jack. There may be a fault with the Heaphone Jack Sensor... I&nbsp;So what I need is to&nbsp;find an solution who&nbsp;disconnect the Speakers in the Laptop, without opening the Laptop and pull out the Speakers Connectors,

            <p>I also have this same issue with the update to Windows 8.1. <br />
</p>
<p>Even though bluetooth is on in the PC settings, Windows 8.1 does not now detect my bluetooth Logitech Wireless Mouse M235 which it happily did prior to the update.<br />
</p>
<p>I have even gone to the extent of updating the driver for the Windows Bluetooth USB adapter and windows still does not detect any of my discoverable devices.<br />
</p>
<p>This is really annoying as I find using just the trackpad really difficult and would prefer to use my wireless mouse.<br />
</p>
<p>The advice given above relates to Windows 7 not 8 or 8.1 so can someone help by giving us the correct advice for the correct version of windows ie windows 8.1?<br />

<h2>            Retrieve used redeem code</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Few years ago, i bought a Xbox one package including 2 assassin's creed games.<br />
I installed it via 2 redeem codes provided in the package.<br />
<br />
Today unfortunately i lost the paper with the codes... and i'm going to give my xbox one to my nephew for his birthday (so he won't use my account).<br />
How can i provide him the 2 games now that i've reset the xbox and he won't use my account ?<br />
<br />
Any website to get the keys somewhere ?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot,</p>

<p>Hiya Serietele,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Forum support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once a code has been redeemed on an account that code is then used up and cannot be re-used on another.
<strong>(Meaning you will have to buy the game(s) for the new account) </strong>Or you can&nbsp;set your account as the
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Home console </a>which will allow the games to be shared. <strong>(Depending on the Developer not all games are able to be shared)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Although if you remove the account from that console, then your nephew will not be able to access the games.&nbsp;You can also set up a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/security/create-xbox-one-passkey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Passkey</a> to protect your account from others signing in or from trying to purchase content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            The Home setting basically attaches your game licenses to the console. So anyone else who uses the console can access the games you have downloaded on your account without needing your account.&nbsp;

<p>Hello Serietele,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The home console is used to share game licenses and Xbox Live subscriptions with one console, to which any account may sign in and use that content that belongs to your account in this case. It's there so that you could set it up, or it may already be setup
 if the first account that signed into that console is the current one you're using, and your nephew would not need to sign into your account to play those very games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A passkey is set until you change it, what would occur if you changed the password when already having the passkey setup would be a required password input to which would again instill the original passkey that was setup from the start after confirming/signing
 into the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We hope this clears up any confusion, and that we answered any questions you have. If there are more, feel free to reply and we'll await your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes!</p>

    <title>Create system image on external USB drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anubis2000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Create system image on external USB drive</h2>
                    <p>I wanted to use the Windows 7 built-in feature "Create a system image" to do just that - create an image of the system partition (like I used to do it with Clonezilla) to an external USB drive (which has plenty of free space, and is formatted in NTFS).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, after the "Looking for backup devices..." box is finished doing whatever it's doing, I am only given three options:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-On a hard disk (listing local partitions except the system one)</p>
<p>-On one or more DVDs</p>
<p>-On a network location</p>
<p>
</p><p>So despite the external USB drive is listed under "Hard Disk Drives" in Windows Explorer, it's not available under "On a hard disk" option. Is there any way to "hack" this tool to make it work with the external drive? I find it hard to believe this is not
 supported. I remember I was able to use this tool to do exactly this under Windows 8.1 or 10.</p>

            <p>Hello Anubis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create a system image, which contains a copy of Windows and copies of your programs, system settings, and files. The system image is then stored in a separate location from the original programs, settings, and files. You can use this image to restore
 the contents of your computer if your hard disk or entire computer ever stops working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using Windows Backup to back up your files, you can have a system image created each time your files are backed up. The files can be saved on a USB flash drive, CDs, DVDs, or a hard drive. The system image must be saved on a hard drive. By default,
 the system image only includes the drives required for Windows to run. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to include additional drives in the system image, you can manually create a system image. If you manually create a system image, it can be saved on a USB flash drive, CDs, DVDs, or a hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For reference:<br />
<strong>Back up your programs, system settings, and files</strong><br />

</p><p>However, you may refer suggestions from <strong>Imran Chand </strong>replied on February 23, 2010.<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/creating-a-system-image-on-an-external-usb-20-hard/e4ea15dc-e8d8-48e7-9faa-b92de64a9569?auth=1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/creating-a-system-image-on-an-external-usb-20-hard/e4ea15dc-e8d8-48e7-9faa-b92de64a9569?auth=1</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: To create a system image of a drive, it must be formatted to use the NTFS file system. If you save the system image on a hard drive or USB flash drive, it must be formatted to use the NTFS file system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Important: You may need to reformat USB drive, which deletes any data on it. Be sure to back up any data you want
</p>
<p>to keep before you begin.</p>

            <p>I was finally able to create the system image on an external/USB drive. It's strange because prior to posting the original post here, I wasn't allowed to do so (the drive wasn't listed after "Create system image", and the "Set up backup" had some specific
 words on why the external drive can't be used - this time, on the other hand, it was even "recommended"). And I didn't reboot in the meantime, and used the same drive on the same USB port. Weird, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway... is this image as complete as the one created by Clonezilla (I see it's about 15-20 GB smaller than Clonezilla's, but that could probably be because the Swap and Hibernate files are not there)? Meaning, if I ever need to restore it to a new disk,
 or restore the system from it because I "experimented" something on my machine, will the restore process give me the exact state of the system as it was at the point when the image was created?</p>

            Why is it unreliable? I've used Clonezilla for years, but now that I finally "graduated" to using encrypted drives, Clonezilla is currently not an option, so I thought the built-in tool would do the trick. Does Macrium support cloning encrypted (system)
 partition (not the whole disk)?

<p>Which windows again I wouldn't use it</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes Macrium can image a disk or partition and it also compresses it to save space</p>
<p>It uses WinPE recovery cd or flash media to open from boot up to restore images of system reserved and C drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any secondary partition can be restored from inside the os and within Macrium.</p>

 to insert activation code. With that done, no popup appears ???? Just the same message???</p>

    <title>Surface book with a 15 inch screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bengriffin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface book with a 15 inch screen</h2>
                    So I am interested in buying a surface book, but i am reluctant because of the screen size. I am tired of small screens, current computer is the Wacom Cintiq Companion gen. 01, and I am fed up with the screen size. it only has a 12 inch screen that is
 somewhat wide but annoying none the less. I want to know if there will ever be a 15 inch version of the surface book, and if there ever will be i will be the first to buy it, but until then i may as well stick with my current computer. i was also wondering
 why you haven't been working with Wacom to develop a pen that has over 2000 pressure levels and is a digitizer without a battery. i thought you guys had a deal with that company. &nbsp;

                    When I forced to upgrade my W10 with the 04/18 update, it required me to log in as the user, when in fact this was my wife's computer, and she was the only user, and did not have a Windows account.&nbsp; When the upgrade finished, I had replaced her as the
 user, and all of her files had disappeared.&nbsp; I recently found them in my recycle bin, with the file name c:\user\sam …&nbsp; How do I restore sam as a user on this computer, and restore all of her files.&nbsp; She has no need to have her user account linked to any off
 site location, but does want&nbsp; her files back the way they were before W10 screwed with them.&nbsp; Should I just uninstall the latest updates and hope we can go back to where we were?&nbsp; W10 has really been a disappointment. &nbsp;

<br />
<br />
<br />Restore the files from the recycle bin which should go back into Explorer although if you converted her account to your MS Account or deleted her account the files will only appear in Explorer under C&gt;\Users where they'll be restored.  It remains to be seen if there will still be the actual user account to sign into.  I doubt it, but possible.
<br />
<br />What I'd do is create a new Local Admin Account for her following this guide:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>.  Sign into the new account and set it up.
<br />
<br />Then move the files over to it from where they are restored from Recycle Bin. 
<br />
<br />When ready delete your account in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Does Windows XP Home Edition &#40;Version 2002&#41; include SP1, is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris6183  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does Windows XP Home Edition &#40;Version 2002&#41; include SP1, is the Microsoft Virtual Machine for Java &#40;MSJVM&#41; installed on it, and do future Service Packs remove it&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>While installing Microsoft&nbsp;DirectX 9.0c on my Windows XP Home Edition (Version 2002)&nbsp;operating system (not sure if version 2002 in it's&nbsp;original&nbsp;state&nbsp;included SP1),&nbsp;the accompanying&nbsp;end-user license agreement (EULA)&nbsp;included a paragraph&nbsp;stating that&nbsp;<em>"SOLELY
 WITH RESPECT TO THE MICROSOFT VIRTUAL MACHINE FOR JAVA, YOU ARE ONLY LICENSED TO INSTALL THIS OS COMPONENT ON A MACHINE THAT ALREADY CONTAINS A VERSION OF THE MICROSOFT VIRTUAL MACHINE FOR JAVA"</em>.&nbsp;Assuming the MSJVM&nbsp;was&nbsp;included with&nbsp;Windows XP Home Edition
 (Version&nbsp;2002), I went ahead and accepted the EULA. I then downloaded and&nbsp;installed Windows XP&nbsp;SP2,&nbsp;and then SP3, but&nbsp;was unsure whether&nbsp;SP2 and SP3 removed the MSJVM&nbsp;at&nbsp;any point. However,&nbsp;upon researching the issue,&nbsp;I discovered&nbsp;the 'MSJVM Transition FAQ'&nbsp;(updated
 May 07, 2004) website, which answered the question:&nbsp;<em>"If I install Windows XP SP1a or later, will it remove my current MSJVM?"</em>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<em>"No, upgrading the operating system will not remove an existing MSJVM on the computer"
</em>(<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/about/legal/en/us/interoperability/java/faq.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/about/legal/en/us/interoperability/java/faq.aspx</a>). However, I cannot find any instance of it on my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my questions are:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Does Windows XP Home Edition (Version 2002) include SP1? </li><li>Is the MSJVM installed on this version? </li><li>Does SP2 or SP3 remove the MSJVM at any point?</li></ol>

<h2>            xbox asking for password and not letting sign in</h2>
                    
<p>my boyfriend and I share a xbox 360 console, he keeps his profile on a memory stick that is basically always connected to the console.&nbsp; a&nbsp;month or 2 ago it did this asking for a password thing for both of us.&nbsp; the e-mail that my boyfriend had made to get
 an xbox account had not been letting him in saying that the password was incorrect.&nbsp; he hardly uses the thing so he just let it go.&nbsp;the xbox would not accept his password either, but when I signed in and put my password in stuff in then it let him sing in
 after and it was fine until today.&nbsp; now even when I sign in it still wont let him sign in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we have tried the password recovery and the profile recover but it just says there is not sufficient info.&nbsp; he just reneiwed his subscription a few months ago.&nbsp; there has got to be something that can be done so he can use his profile again?!?!?!</p>

<p>Obviously since you we're able write this you know your Microsoft account info because you are able to sign onto the account you used to write this. if you are getting an error message that looks like 8015D002 when you try to sign in on your Xbox there is
 a big problem going on right now where you enter the right information but the Xbox will say that you have it wrong when you don't. This is some sort of security proof related thing that is *** everyone with an Xbox 360. I'm going through the same thing now
 and I'm fed up with Xbox . &nbsp;Just try to repost any specific error messages you see and I think that I will be able to help u a little &nbsp; GOOD LUCK</p>

<p>from reading post on this forum it seems like unless you actually log into ur e-mail enough to keep it active, which some ppl don't do like my boyfriend; ur screwed. &nbsp; this is sad to have all of this associated just with a game account to log in even though
 his live account is plenty active with playing games. &nbsp;I understand the security resons but for ppl who just creat an e-mail just to make an account and barely use the e-mail, which a lot of ppl do, it sucks. &nbsp;this is disappointing considering how much gamers
 put into their account and how much stuff he will have to do over.... &nbsp; &nbsp; and with the whole 24 hr check thing with the xbox one, &nbsp;yeaaaa..... &nbsp; &nbsp;might be checkin out the ps4 for a next console unless Microsoft gets their head out of their a** &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Did you recently sign up for Two-Step Verification?</p>
<p>If you recently turned on two-step verification, you may not know how to sign in to apps or devices that don't accept security codes. Some apps (like the mail apps on some smartphones) or devices (like the Xbox 360, for example) can't prompt you to enter
 a security code when you try to sign in. If you get an incorrect password error with an app or device, you'll need to create a unique app password to sign in. Once you've signed in with your app password, you're all set to use that app or device. You will
 use this new app password to sign in to your device going forward instead of your Microsoft account password.
</p>
<p>You'll need to create and sign in with an app password once for each app or device that can't prompt you for a security code.</p>
<p>Sign in to your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>Under Password and security info, tap or click Edit security info. </p>
<p>If you're prompted for a security code here, enter it and tap or click Submit.</p>
<p>Under App passwords, tap or click Create a new app password. </p>
<p>A new app password is generated and appears on your screen.</p>
<p>On your Xbox, enter the app password displayed on the screen when asked for your Microsoft account password.

    <title>Project Scorpio Contoller not working wirelessly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dragonreborn303  say:</h3>
<h2>            Project Scorpio Contoller not working wirelessly</h2>
                    <p>Ok so I have had an Xbox One X since release, was also the Project Scorpio version and I am having issues with the contoller that came with it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Until recently I had never used it before because I gott an Elite Controller so never even took the Scorpio controller out...until I had to send in the Elite for replacement (rubber grips came off). Since I needed a
 controller while it was in repair I puylle dout the Scorpio controller. However it isn't working correctly.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The controller will not stay connected wirelessly, works fine when plugged in though. What happens is the controller quits responding entirely, i get the please connect a controller message but the Guide button does
 not flash like it does when it is a simple resync error. After troubleshooting and doing some research this appears to be a somewhat common issue with those controllers as the radio in them is messed up.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Contacted customer support previously at same time I did work order for the elite, was told that I could send the Scorpio controller in for repair/replace as well but that I may not get a Scorpio one in replace but
 could get a different special edition controller if they could not fix, which I said I would do once I got the Elite controller back.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I got that controller back today contacted MS support again to set up order for Scorpio controller only to be told sorry warranty is only 90 days and it sounded like simple wear and tear anyway and that I would not
 be able to get it repaired or replaced . I have literally used this thing for 10 days. I have owned an Xbox since the original came out, I purchased 3 360' and this is my second Xb1. In other words I have dropped a ton of money on Xbox over the years including
 the frikkin 500 I spent on the XB1X.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Purpose of this post is twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
does anyone have any other TS tips I can try</p>
</li></ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2) To vent. This will be the last time I purchase an Xbox. I could understand if I had been using the controller for the last year but I haven't, and to be told (or lied to) the first time and to be told essentially
 too bad so sad the second time is complete and utter BS.</p>

<p>Hello Shayul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with the controller. Warranties for controller start the day they were purchased. As you got the Scorpio the controller is a year old. Warranty on most accessories is 90 days. Is your console plugged directly into the wall? This can cause
 a lot of issues if it isn't. You can try the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/controllers/wireless-controller-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
wireless controller solution</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hello!<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, warranties for any product start from the date of purchase even if they are not being used.&nbsp; The only thing I can think of is if the support person you spoke with previously was under the impression you had got both controllers at the same time.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would try plugging it in via a USB cable to see if there's any updates for it or if it behaves differently while plugged in.&nbsp; Also Re-sync it to the Xbox if you haven't already.</p>

            Aside from opening the controller since it's out of warranty and replacing the radio the controller would have to stay wired.

    <title>Improper ShutDown - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> h_kesh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Improper ShutDown</h2>
                    <p>So, </p>
<p>my desktop computer with Windows 10 installed has a problem shutting down properly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The usual process takes place and the monitor goes blank but the fans and lights on the CPU are still on.
</p>
<p>I have, to no effect, waited for more than 30 minutes hoping they'd go off eventually.
</p>
<p>As a result, I'm forced to turn off the power supply. </p>
<p>The next boot-up process is really slow and I'm worried this'll harm my PC. </p>
<p>Edit: Also, i can't put my computer in sleep mode. Sleep mode isn't entered into, lights and fans stay on, and I can't wake the computer since it's not in sleep mode and it's just stuck somewhere in between everything and i have to kill the power again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes this issue is resolved after an update.</p>
<p>However the issue was absent before the last update and now has started occurring again after the update. Please help me fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>

            Hi Barely Hooman 
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Run these troubleshooters
<br />
<br />Hardware and devices
<br />
<br />Power
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not solve this:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, then just type Power Options
<br />
<br />On the left, click 'Choose what the power buttons do' 
<br />
<br />At the top right, click 'Change settings that are currently unavailable'
<br />
<br />Under 'Shutdown settings' disable 'Turn on fast startup'
<br />
<br />Save that and close Control Panel

    <title>my game &#34;SkyRim, Elder Scrolls V&#34; keeps crashing to black - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            my game &#34;SkyRim, Elder Scrolls V&#34; keeps crashing to black screen every few minutes.</h2>
                    <p>My Games for Windows game "SKYRIM, Elder Scrolls V " keeps crashing every few minutes. I have tried everything suggested by the game manufacture, and the game site "Steam" where the game plays, but nothing helps. I have all my drivers up-to-date. My PC exceeds
 all the recomended requirements to run the game.I've reinstalled the game, updated the game, scanned the game,updated my windows software, you name it I have tried it. The game installed and started just fine, but after 4 to 5 minutes of game play, it just
 crashes to a black screen, with the in-game sound still running. After about a minute the sound quits and a loud buzzing&nbsp;&nbsp; noise replaces it. I have to hold the power button down for a few seconds to get the PC to shut down. Ctl+alt+del doesn't work when the
 game crashes. </p>
<p>My PC is a Gateway DX4840 With intel Core i5&nbsp; 650 Processor running 64 bit Windows 7 Home Premium system @ 3.2 GHz., 4 GB of DDR3 Ram Memory, ATI Radeon HD 4670 PCIe Graphics Card with 1 GB of Memory, Cox Cable Internet connection with a&nbsp;Motorola cable modem,
 &amp; DLink Wireless N Router,&nbsp;15 MBS&nbsp;</p>
<p>hook-up. I TB Sata Hard Drive, a Super Multi DVD/CD RW Drive. Sometimes the game will run just fine for half an hour or more before it crashes, but most of the</p>
<p>time it crashes after just 4 or 5 minutes. I have learned to Quicksave my game about every 3 or 4 minutes so I can make progress. So far I've played the game 946 hours, which meens it has crashed several thousand times so far. Like I said before, I have
 tried everything suggested to solve the problem. Nothing works so far. I'm retired so I have plenty of slack time on my hands, &amp; I really like the game, except for the crashes. Any suggestions ? Giving up is NOT an option.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Update on crash problem: I now have 1060 + hours of game play and still haven't solved the crash problem. I normally run my computer with no auto updates enabled what so ever, not even Windows auto update. I was thinking that that might be the cause of the
 Windows error log entry that says " TESV.exe has stopped interacting with Windows and has shut down". So I enabled Windows auto update--no change at all. The game still crashes every few minutes. I have noticed that most of the crashes occre just as, or right
 after I make a turn with my charictor @ change direction of travel suddenly, or traveling fast in one direction for an extended amount of time or for a very long distance. One last thing, I sometimes use "God Mode Cheat Code" to get out of a really tough situation
 in the game. Will the use of cheat codes in the console cause crashes? If so how do I disable any "Punk buster type" game protection modes that the game might have enabled by default. I have several Mods installed but I had crashes before I ever installed
 any of the Mods. I don't have over 50 Mods installed either. I am compleatly running out of ideas and patience with how to fix this problem. It sure is putting a dampener on my enjoyment of the Game. If I wasn't so bull headed, I would have given up a long
 time ago. I really do like the Game but can't aford to buy very many more mice or keyboards, to replace the ones that I have ruined right after a game crash. I have splattered more than one mouse off of my apartment wall when my temper got the best of me.
 I figure that is better than botteling up the anger and having a heart attack. lol Just kidding. But 2 mice and 1 KB have bitten the dust so far, and my 2 female room mates are starting to think I'm a bit crazy. They ask why I keep playing the game, and I
 tell them "because I like it so much." Any new suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. Gary D. Hoover</p>

            <p>If you look at the Bethesda forums, the "Skyrim crashes" thread is at 74 pages, now (<a href="http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1270631-crashes-during-gameplay/page__st__2190" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1270631-crashes-during-gameplay/page__st__2190</a>),
 and nobody found an universal solution for this widespread problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your computer specs are more than OK, it's the game itself which causes the issues. Some argue the lock of TESV.exe (the game's executable) to Steam is the cause, and reverting to version 1.1 (where TESV.exe could be started without the Steam launcher) stopped
 the crashes. Others found that modifying the sound settings helped (24bit, 44100&nbsp;Hz). Others, again, noticed that the update to 1.3 (the 4GB memory update patch) either stopped the crashes or worsened them. The use of mods can also be a negative factor. Etc.etc.</p>
<p>It would be helpful if you had an error log of some kind. Unfortunately, it's not uncommon that spontaneous CTD's happen without leaving any traces but you could type "perfmon /rel" into the search bar (without quotes) to open the Reliability Monitor where
 crashes might be reported as events with a cross in a red circle.&nbsp;As an example: One of the users from the above forums could provide an error log with "BEX" and "Exception Code: c0000409" - that's an error that could be avoided by temporarily disabling DEP,
<p>Whatever the exact reason in your case may be: What I can say as a player of all TES games (I-V) on quite different hardware, is that Bethesda must have implemented an RCG (random crash generator) in all their game engines. It's so random that you can play
 a game for 200 hours and nothing happens, it's working flawlessly. And when you reinstall it the next time or start a new game, it's crashing so often to be unplayable.</p>

            Not only have I received the above message, but absolutely <strong>everything</strong> is gone from my Windows Live Mail account!&nbsp;&nbsp; Folders, saved messages, deleted messages, messages in the "in" folder -
<strong>everything!&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Poof!&nbsp;&nbsp; I was sending one photo to one recipient, and that's when it happened!&nbsp; I
<strong>do</strong> still have a contact list, but absolutely nothing else!&nbsp; Is this because you are requesting that I re-establish the account?

<p>Hey Swag Duck! :) It might just be easier if your friend reaches out about this themselves, if this is specific to their profile.
</p>
<p>Do you know if your friend has their profile set to appear offline? That's a privacy setting they can make from their profile directly. If so, you won't be able to see when they are online - it's possible they even set it to appear offline and then forgot
 to change it back. I've done that a few times. </p>

<p>Hey Swag,</p>
<p>Mind clarifying for me if the user is set to appear offline like in my first reply? Does signing out and signing back in work for you the same as it did for Quaza?</p>
