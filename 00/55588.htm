            I"m having the same issue.&nbsp; When I try to open as administrator it simply doesn't open.&nbsp; The icon seems to click normally &amp; I get the rolling wheel for 2-5 seconds, then it stops &amp; does not start.&nbsp; I have had this issue in the past and it has gone for
 months like that.&nbsp; During that time I used IE because chrome was inaccessible.&nbsp; I got chrome again when I got a new computer, where it worked fine for almost a year before recurring.

            <p>I have been using Google Chrome for a little over a month. I just did a full scan with McCaffe and used the quick clean. I noticed it said it was cleaning up Internet Explorer and Google Chrome.</p>
<p>Now Chrome won't launch but Explorer will. I prefer Chrome . And yes it was the most recent version. It would be a pain to uninstall and reinstall after every scan and clean.</p>

<h2>            Surface Studio AC power recovery</h2>
                    I can't seem to find a AC power recovery option to auto turn back on the pc after a power loss. &nbsp;I have 4 Surface Studios at different locations that i need to be able to access remotely at all times. &nbsp;However when a power loss comes i would have to fly
 out to the site or get a trusted source to go turn them on when powerloss occurs as i can't find a bios setting to auto turn it on after power loss. &nbsp;Is this intended or is there a setting i missing on the Surface Studio.

            Thank you Barb. &nbsp;I've considered that, but also considering that most laptops and desktops today have that feature in their bios options was wondering if Microsoft ever planned on upgrading their bios to offer the AC recovery feature offered on most devices
 today? &nbsp;I feel like it's pretty standard these days and rather than me spending additional money on a 3kdollars/machine for a feature that quite honestly i would expect on a machine of this quality. &nbsp;So didn't know if you had a source that could say if this
 feature is expected to be added in the future? &nbsp;Thank you again for your time.

<p>I believe you’re referring to a Wake On LAN setting.<span>&nbsp; </span>Currently, the Surface Studio does not natively support this setting.<span>&nbsp;

            Thank you, no sir, i'm referring to Waking up after power loss i.e. building power goes out and then is restored machine comes on automatically once power restored. &nbsp;This is a common bios setting now on all machines. &nbsp;The surface just does not offer it.

            <p>Your sys should have .Net v3.5 allready installed, unless you made the mistake of uninstalling it.</p>
<p>The various .Net versions are all required as some apps use specific versions.</p>
<p>.Net v4.5 should have been offered/installed during the windows important updates process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should also visit HP support, for your model, and install any win7 drivers available. Drivers for a laptop should NOT be scourced via windows update (Unless the laptop maker says to do so)</p>

<h2>            No option for a new group</h2>
                    So, I updated to the Windows 10 version a few days ago and now whenever I click the + I'm only given the option for a new chat or a new bot. I RP on Skype with a friend and we like to keep threads separate but now every time I try to make us a new group
 for an RP, it won't let me. I tired new chat instead but when I add her name, it just takes me to our current chat. It's very frustrating.

<h2>            Some games stobe a black screen when set to full screen on my main monitor.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've encountered a rather vexing problem recently and I'd appreciate some help solving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some games will strobe between a black screen and whatever they're supposed to be displaying when set to full screen on my main monitor. Not all games are afflicted by this, and for the games that are afflicted, it doesn't happen if they're set to windowed
 mode, set to full screen on a different monitor, or partially misaligned, so they spill onto another monitor while in full screen. It's also worth noting that this does not seem to be a purely graphical glitch as no possessing seems to occur while the screen
 is black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, this does not produce a visible error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The three games that I've had this problem with are The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth, SteamWorld Heist, and Space Run Galaxy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, I've tried verifying their local cache, updating my graphics drivers, updating windows, restarting windows, doing an in place upgrade, sfc /scannow, and clearing most of my temp files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to get Isaac working properly, once, by messing with which monitor is set as the main one, but it did not persist through restarting Isaac and I was not able to replicate my success on a second attempt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running windows 10 and have an NVidia gtx 970.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated in this matter.</p>

            <p>As far as their, very, limited settings go, I tried messing with them to no effect. However, I did figure out something interesting in the DOOM (2016) demo. The demo plays fine in full screen mode, but has the same problems as Isaac and Steam World Heist
 if I set it to borderless full screen. A little poking around makes me think that Isaac (and possibly Heist) use borderless full screen as their normal full screen without mentioning that fact and that the actual issue may be with borderless mode.</p>

            Before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps, Connect your Printer to the computer and Switch it ON. In case of Wireless printer, Switch it ON and connect it to the Wifi network.
<br />
<br />Option 1. Run troubleshooter provided by Windows OS
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; On the right side, Click Printer &gt; Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Option 2. Update Printer Driver
<br />Windows Key+X (Or right click on Start) &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Print Queues &gt; Right click on entry below &gt; Click Update Driver Software &gt; Click Browse my computer for driver software &gt; Click Let my pick from a list of device drivers on my computer &gt; Choose the driver &gt; Click Next to update
<br /> 
<br />If this does not work, select Search automatically for the updated driver in place of Browse my computer for driver software &gt; Restart your computer
<br />
<br />Option 3. Uninstall and reinstall the Printer (Credit to Andre Da Costa, MVP for providing steps)
<br />A. Uninstall Printer
<br />Click on Windows Key+X &gt; Apps and Features &gt; Scroll down and click Programs and Features &gt; Select your printer &gt; Select Uninstall
<br />Type Printer in Windows Search box &gt; Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Select your printer &gt; Remove device
<br />Type Printer in Windows Search box &gt; Click Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Scroll down and click Print server properties under Related settings &gt; Under Driver tab, look for your printer &gt; Select it and click Remove button at the bottom
<br />
<br />B. Install Printer 
<br />Go to the Printer manufacturer’s website and search for the latest Windows 10 drivers &gt; Reinstall the Printer driver &gt; Reboot the computer
<br />Type Printer in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; On Right side, Click Add a printer or scanner &gt; If Windows detects your printer, it will be listed &gt; Select the printer and follow on screen directions to set it up (In case of Wifi printer, your computer should also be logged into Wifi network)
<br />If Windows doesn't detect your printer, then you will get a blue message - Click The printer that I want isn't listed
<br />If you are using Bluetooth / Wirelss printer &gt; Select Add a Bluetooth, wireless or network discoverable printer &gt; Choose the printer &gt; Select your Printer and follow on screen directions
<br />If you are using wired printer &gt; Select Add a local printer or network printer  with manual settings &gt; Select Use an existing port &gt; Select your Printer and follow on screen directions
<br />
<br />Option 4: Clear Spooler
<br />Type Services in Windows Start Search Box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to Print Spooler &gt; Right-click and choose Stop for the Print Spooler service &gt; Go to C:\WINDOWS\System32\spool\PRINTERS. You can also type %windir%\System32\spool\PRINTERS into the address bar in Explorer if the C drive is not the default Windows partition &gt; Delete all the files in this folder &gt; Services console and right-click and choose Start for the Print Spooler service

            Helllo Jacqueline.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There are Pantum Driver downloads here if you put in your model number:  <a href="http://global.pantum.com/global/drive_tag/drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://global.pantum.com/global/drive_tag/drive/</a>
<br />
<br />If there are only old Windows edition drivers available and they do not work then you can try installing them in Compatibility Mode:   <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-non-compatible-printer-drivers-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-non-...</a>
<br />
<br />Let us know how this goes and if necessary we'll help you clean out the old drivers first which often works better and lasts longer.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Problems after a power failure</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>I have Windows 10 Pro on my computer. Version 1803(OS build 17134.407)</p>
<p>OS Version: Microsoft Windows 10 Pro, 64 bit<br />

Motherboard: FOXCONN, 2AB1<br />
Antivirus: Windows Defender, Disabled, using P C Matic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a power double blip sometime back and my computer would not boot. Tried</p>
<p>several attempts to get it going, no joy. Recovery disc, USB flash drive, nothing.</p>
<p>Took to shop and the tech put a flash drive with Win 10 on it and it did boot. After</p>
<p>this episode I restarted the computer several time with the restart button. Since this</p>
<p>happened I have had two more power outages and it would not boot. The next time</p>
<p>a friend came over with his recovery disc and it came back on. He gave me the disc</p>
<p>as he would make another. I made me a new recovery disc on my computer and on</p>
<p>the next outage, tried it and no boot. I used the one he gave me and tit worked again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I try to get this machine working, "booting up after a power outage" </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to reset saving files. Button/window did nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode with network network function to repair Windows..
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

            Hi Hugh.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> You may need to create bootable media to access Repair Mode to check the file system which is most affected by a power failure, do a Startup Repair, a Reset or the vastly superior Clean install:
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then Command Prompt to do a Disk Check:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a> and Startup Repair.  If that fails go back to Troubleshoot Options to try a Reset.  
<br />
<br />If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It  is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.  
<br />
<br />If these all fail I'd also test your hard drive to know for sure it's condition with bootable diagnostics long test from Seatools created here:  <a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>
<br />There are also diagnostics built into HP and Dell by powering up while pressing the ESC and F12 keys respectively.  Other testing tools here:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>When creating a Windows 10 iso there are generally two types:&nbsp; bootable and not-bootable.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 iso can be downloaded to the desktop and the copy and paste to a flash drive &gt; this is the not-bootable flash drive windows 10 iso</p>
<p>The windows 10 iso can be downloaded and installed on the formatted flash drive &gt; this is the bootable windows 10 iso.</p>
<p>Once you have a bootable windows 10 iso it can be used on any computer to open the Windows Recovery Enviroment (RE).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows RE on the computer has more features than the Windows RE on the Windows 10 iso.</p>
<p>The computer's windows RE has reset save files, reset remove files, startup settings, etc.&nbsp; These are unavailable on the Windows 10 iso RE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you can use the hardware method to boot to the Windows RE environment you will have more troubleshooting options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hardware method:</p>
<p>a) Power on the computer and as soon as you see the Microsoft icon &gt; power off</p>
<p>b) Immediately power on the computer again and as soon as you see the Microsoft icon &gt; power off</p>
<p>c) Power on the third time and this time allow the boot to progress as far as it will go.&nbsp; If it opens the computer's Windows advanced troubleshooting menu then click troubleshoot and see if you can open startup settings &gt; safe mode (safe mode with networking,
 safe mode with command prompt)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you cannot boot to the computer's windows advanced RE then use the bootable Windows 10 iso RE.</p>
<p>The options should be:&nbsp; starup repair, system restore, command prompt etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the frequent problems of power outages you should invest in an external HD.&nbsp; Then create backup images with free or pay software:</p>
<p>Acronis, Aoemi, EaseUS, Macrium, Paragon, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then if there is unexpected:&nbsp; malware, ransomware, operating system or registry corruption, boot failure, etc you can restore a backup image in &lt; one hour.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello, <br />
<br />
Here is my problem. About 3 or 4 days ago a USB related problem has occurred. I have no new USB devices. Windows makes the sound that a device is being pluged and unplugged repeatedly for hours at a time. I have bought a new mouse and keyboard, reinstalled
 the mainboards drivers along with reinstalling the host controllers drivers. I have updated the BIOS to try to fix the problem. Reset the CMOS. But nothing seems to work. Windows toggles between error code 41 and 43. Like I stated earlier it will do this for
 hours at a time then stop for a bit. When i check the location its under Port_#0001.Hub_#0004 and says it is a USB composite device but like the computer I also have no idea what it is. Any help would be appreciated.
<br />
<br />
My system<br />
<br />
Windows 7 Pro 64bit<br />
Intel i5 2500<br />
4gig DDR3 1333MHz<br />
NVid Geforce 550ti<br />

            Hi Akiva.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is the SD card driver installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button? If not download and install the latest from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />If the driver is there, then from Driver tab select Roll Back, or if that's not present choose Uninstall, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />If driver is in place, what happens when you insert the SD card? Is there any activity detected or a listing that shows up in File Explorer you can click to open, or right click to Format? See how here: <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/format-sd-card-using-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/format-sd-card-using-w</a>...
<br />
<br />
<br />If these all fail run the Hardware troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Does the SD card show up in another device and work?
<br />
<br />Does another SD card show up and work in this device?
<br />
<br />See if the SD card shows up in Disk Management (reached by right clicking Start button) by scrolling down on Drive map to look closely for it by size and name. If not right click to issue a Drive letter so it shows up in Explorer.
<br />
<br />Try cleaning and formatting the card first:

<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h3> ln899  say:</h3>
<h2>            Live Mail unable to locate message database&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    This morning, I tried to open my Windows Live Mail desktop client (Version 2011, Build 15.4.3555.0308), and received the following error message:<br />
<br />
Windows Live Mail could not be started.&nbsp; WLM was unable to open the WLMl message store, WLM was unable to to locate its message database, if you have moved database to a new location click OK, to reset the path to that location click cancel to proceed. Any
 existing messages will be found under orphaned accounts 0x00000000.2<br />
<br />
I clicked OK, and WLM opened, downloaded new emails, but all my stored folders have disappeared.&nbsp; The stored folders are still on the hard drive at the following location:
<br />
<br />
C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Storage Folders\<br />
<br />
However, upon examination, it seems that, while all the folders are there, they are all now empty!<br />
<br />
I don't understand why WLM lost this data.&nbsp; More importantly, I don't see any way in WLM to recover it.&nbsp; I do have a backup; how to I restore it?<br />
<br />
I'm using the 64-bit version of W7 Home Edition.<br />
<br />
Help appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks!!<br />

            <p>Think you'll find that there's a folder inside your Storage folders in Live Mail that's called Recovered items (or something like that).&nbsp; Inside that folder you'll find other folders of your filed e-mails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe that you should not just move those folders out to where you want them, but create new folders in the right place, and then&nbsp;drag the e-mails from the recovered folders to the new ones you created.</p>

    <title>Can dism be used to repair an unbootable windows 10 partition&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doddsmit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can dism be used to repair an unbootable windows 10 partition&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After a series of problem related to HD failure (described below)&nbsp; I saved the boot partition from the failing drive onto a new drive and was able to boot from it, but with with the same 6-hour boot problems described below.&nbsp; This partition later became
 un-bootable,&nbsp; with the messages: "The Boot Configuration Data for your PC is missing or contains errors.&nbsp; File: \Boot\BCD &nbsp;&nbsp; Status:&nbsp; 0xc000000f."&nbsp; (This may have been due to my changing some drive letters).&nbsp; The PC is an HP Compaq Pro 6300 64-bit computer
 with Intel 2-core 3.3 GHz processor and 6GB memory, running Windows 10 Pro version 10.0.14393 upgraded from Windows 8 shipped with the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then, I have downloaded Windows 10 ISO image and used it to successfully install Windows 10 on another partition on the new drive. It runs fine,&nbsp; but without any of my applications and data, some of which are sorely needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later, I read about using dism to repair boot and OS problems. I can run dism.exe from the newly installed Windows 10, but have not been able to address the boot issues on the partition with my programs an data. I tried using /image option to access that
 partition, but get error 87.&nbsp; Can someone walk me through this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The drive began to fail on my desktop computer.&nbsp; The system could be booted in safe mode. When booting in normal mode, it would proceed to the usual login screen, but it required 6 hours for the user login prompt to appear. Upon login at that point, all
 applications could be run but the system would sometimes lock up after normal operation for several hours to several days. I was unable to find any fix tor the delayed boot, despite trying many recommended approaches. I was able to save an image of the boot
 partition from the failing drive on to a new internal 2 GB drive, and to boot from it

</blockquote>
<p>I had not made any changes to the computer itself or updates/upgrades other than those that occurred automatically for Microsoft products or recommended by suppliers such as Semantics, Adobe, and the like. There was a gradual reduction in stability over
 Nov/Dec last year. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Later pre-boot drive tests showed problems, and ultimately the drive became unusable. Prior to that point I
</p>
<p>used AOMEI Partition assistant to transfer the operating system partition to a new drive. Many hours were spent in vain prior to and since that point. Having spent twenty years in the software development industry, I tried to preserve as much information
 as possible to assist debugging and recovery. Many screen shots showing date/times of the steps I took, messages, running processes, etc. were captured, and there are also various logs available.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could go through these and develop a timeline including steps taken and the results, most of which are probably moot at this point, although some might shed some light on what happened to the boot files and OS in the partition I saved and hope to recover.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I have multiple new drives and a clean install from the downloaded ISO image. I also have the failed OS partition on the new drive that I hope to recover. If the recovery is not successful, my next highest priority (not addressed here and now)
 will be to extract emails from my saved Outlook files. </p>

<p>If you used an imaging app and not just partition copy then it may be repairable using Startup Repair or Rebuild BCD from the wiki I linked above.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you already Clean&nbsp; installed on the drive, can you browse in to see files after assigning a drive letter in Disk management?&nbsp; Next try adding the install to a Dual Boot menu using free EasyBCD on.the Add OS tab&nbsp; If it won't boot try Startup Repair on
 the install, then Rebuild BCD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it boots try deleting the new install in EasyBCD Edit Menu tab.&nbsp; If it still starts you can delete the new install partition and reclaim its space into C or anywhere else using Partition Wizard Extend function -&nbsp; providing the new install partition is
 not the system partition, but the flagged System partition is separate. If in doubt&nbsp; post back a screenshot of Disk Management..</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;If this is a Legacy BIOS using MBR disk format then the System partition must be marked active lest it will not repair no matter how many times you run Startup repair. Once marked Active it should start within three separate startup repairs.</p>

    <title>What do you want to backup&#63; Confusing options - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yt.8019  say:</h3>
<h2>            What do you want to backup&#63; Confusing options</h2>
                    
<p>I'm confused.</p>
<p>I started Windows 7 Backup and it gives me this option to choose what to backup:</p>
<p>* Data files</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- back up data for newly created users</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- My Libraries</p>
<p>* Computer</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- C:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- S:</p>
<p>I ticked My libraries, which included music, video, pictures... etc. But I want to back up my whole user folder. Does it include that? &nbsp;Why doesn't it just say Back up my User folder? It's titled 'Libraries' which implies that it only includes Libraries
 that you see in Windows Explorer which are pictures, music, documents and video.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't tell from the description, so I expanded C:\ and ticked 'C:\Users'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem here is that the options presented are not mutually exclusive, and you end up ticking more in case any of them misses something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make matters worse, at the bottom of the screen there is another checkbox: Include a system image of drives: S: and C:.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why would I want to make a system image IN ADDITION to the files I've just selected? I know the pros and cons of taking the image of the disk -- but I can't see the reason to back up BOTH files AND image of the disk. It's not only confusing but a waste of
 space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The easyiest way is to select the "Let Windows choose" option. This saves all your data files in your library (which can be easily recovered when needed) plus it make a "System Image" of the two vital partitions (Windows 7 partition and the hidden BCD store
 partition)&nbsp;on your hard drive.</p>
<p>The System Image is very valuable as it has the ability to restore Windows back to a functioning system should any problems occur. Trust me the Image file is not wasted space, it can save you a lot of time should a software update or install fail. I always
 make Image Backups prior to installing/uninstalling any software or using Windows Updates.</p>

<h2>            LOTR Two Towers</h2>
                    
<p>Will we have the opportunity to buy LOTR The Two Towers from the XBOX Game Store since the original XBOX disc is not compatible with the XBOX 360?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I love this game.... :`(</p>

<p>I loved Two Towers and was disappointed it wasn't compatible with 360 BUT if you want a similar experience for a good price the Lord of the Rings:Return of the King game for the original XBOX is compatible and plays in the 360 and plays very similar to the
 Two Towers...I bought it on Amazon for around $5 to $6 bucks and it's a blast in co-op.</p>

    <title>Video files &#40;.avi&#41; not playing on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> llysanth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video files &#40;.avi&#41; not playing on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>To be clear, this is an issue with Microsoft's Windows 10 I am having, however the lengthy description is an attempt to relay the exact issue, now to get things rolling, I have just finished building a new desktop, with a fresh install of Windows 10.&nbsp; All
 of my software is configured and all of the drivers are up-to-date.&nbsp; This entire issue went smoothly minus a failed SSD due to a major bug which required a firmware update after a lengthy data recovery process.&nbsp; Now to my issue.&nbsp; The main topic is that .avi
 files are not running within either my default Movies &amp; TV app or Windows Media Player 12.&nbsp; I attempted to download a couple of different codecs with no success.&nbsp; So I installed a third party media player and they will now play minus sound.&nbsp; I have been doing
 quite a bit of research regarding this issue and it all seems to revolve around the fact that people brought over .avi video files from other systems and the consensus is either they are corrupted or there is a compatibility issue with the decompression methods
 of the different codecs of the different versions of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to the meat and bones of my problem.&nbsp; My scenario is bit more unique.&nbsp; At least that is how I feel about it.&nbsp; My rig is a gaming rig built to last with very little need for hardware upgrades for, what I am hoping, to be many years to come.&nbsp; I also utilize
 my computer for college as my old desktop was Windows Vista and was no longer capable of completing the job.&nbsp; Everything I want to work on my computer works just fine, except for one game.&nbsp; It crashes Windows 10 the moment I open it, every single time I open
 it.&nbsp; I am able to ctrl+alt+delete to bring up the control panel, but I am unable to click on anything at all.&nbsp; The only way I am able to regain control of the desktop is by signing out of my profile when I ctrl+alt+delete then signing back in after the program
 in question is forced to shut down.&nbsp; I have contacted support for this game, being Sega for "Dawn of War II: Retribution", yet they have been wholly unhelpful in finding a solution.&nbsp; I have attempted their steps in regards to directx issues, compatibility
 issues, other Visual C++ redistributable installs, etc etc but nothing worked.&nbsp; Instead of listening to what my exact issue was and finding a solution, they simply went down the list of standard troubleshooting steps and then gave up entirely when none of
 them worked.&nbsp; This I believe is all they are obligated to do so I went ahead and tried looking for the root of the problem on my own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now since the game crashes upon startup I assume it has something to do with that.&nbsp; There is no bug report to speak of as I am unable to click on anything.&nbsp; Through my digging I found the game's assets in its installation folders and had a thought about
 the opening cinematics and logos so this is at the point that I learned that none of these files open on Windows 10.&nbsp; They are having encoding issues.&nbsp; This means that downloading a separate player will not fix my problem.&nbsp; I need Windows 10 itself to be able
 to play these files for them to open and play properly when I run the game.&nbsp; If the video's crash that means the game will crash the moment it tries to play them, which is the moment you open the game.&nbsp; This is at least my assumption on the matter but I feel
 that I am on a pretty good start as all other options seem to have been exhausted.&nbsp; I need to have the Movies &amp; TV app and Windows Media Player 12 to be able to open the .avi files, these ones specifically.&nbsp; I am certain these videos are not corrupted as they
 were installed upon the game's installation and I have already attempted to reinstall the game during the troubleshooting steps with Sega.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any help, as this may be just a game I never got to play, but it also makes me feel like I made a mistake with Windows 10 if it is unable to play this video format without me having to download a separate media player that is of no use
 to me given the situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you ahead of time.</p>
<p>

<p>There might be a compatibility issue with the video format that you're trying to play. There's a lot of improvement happened in Windows 10. We recommend to send a feedback using the Feedback Hub app, so that our Windows Engineer can review your concern.</p>
