<h2>            No &#34;ringing&#34; &#40;some sort of indication that someone is calling me&#41;</h2>
                    <p>The old non-built-in Skype app was always running in the background (tiny icon in the status tray) and when someone would call me, a popup would appear and play a sound. But now I'm using the app that is built into Windows 10, and it will not ring reliably.
 Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. Last night I was even <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
expecting</span> an important call, so I never left my computer, but they tried twice and assumed I was not available. Nothing happened on my computer. An hour later I got curious and manually opened the Skype app and saw the two missed calls, but it was too
 late to call them back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know what's going on, and more importantly, what I can do about it? Last night I was using some powerful software, so RAM might have been a little tight, but Skype notification should be a high priority for system resources, I would think.
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/skype_win10-skype_messms/notification-sound-does-not-always-play-for-new/5650339c-3c03-445f-a310-3e28dbde2829">
This thread</a> revealed that IM notifications don't make sound unless the app is not only open but the active window (that sounds absurd, too), but I'm talking about
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">call</span> notifications, i.e. ringing. That seems like it would be the most basic thing that Skype needs to do.</p>

            I’d suggest downloading classic Skype and use it to see if that corrects your problem. 
<br />
<br />Here is the direct download link:
<br />

<p>That link immediately streams a file - is there a page that says what it is? I don't feel comfortable just installing a downloaded file with no verification or even reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/ I can download a file that is supposedly Skype for Desktop 8.22.0.2, but when I run it, it says, "Please install Skype from the Microsoft Store for the best experience." Of course when I try that, it tells
 me it's already installed, because it's just the built-in one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I previously had Skype for Desktop installed, but I uninstalled it after being continually confused between the two Skype icons, and I was told the built-in one was good enough. Is the built-in one actually not functional?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I had the app open, and then closed it and had my husband call me. It rang fine this time. But I can't trust it if I don't know why it sometimes doesn't work.</p>

<p>Ah, I missed the little dropdown mark before - thanks. Classic is now installed.<br />

<p>I'm still hoping that someone has a clue about why the built-in one doesn't do notifications sometimes. It seems that I shouldn't need both programs.</p>

<p>"...as enhanced as classic..." Were you able to write that with a straight face? ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if I'm reverting to using Classic, I'm probably going to have to put up with these problems again, right? (my thread from February that resulted in me uninstalling Classic in the first place) https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/skype_win10-skype_startms-skype_installms/how-to-get-rid-of-the-other-skype/99933a58-3d8a-4000-bc16-a8978e388562</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any tips about how to control which Skype is doing what when both are installed, let me know. I don't think I can uninstall the built-in one, or even log out of it (since it's tied to my Microsoft account that my PC is running under). And the
 rumor about the colors of the two apps is not consistent - there are some places where both apps are white-S-on-blue. Clues are welcome.</p>

<h2>            Screen flashes black for a second</h2>
                    <p>So ever since I got my computer about a month ago, my screen will flash black for around a second. In that second the audio from my PC is still playing and I can still use my mouse to interact with things on screen. I have tried the task manager fix but
 that doesn't do anything. This will happen 2-3 times a day and is starting to get very frustrating. Any ideas on what the cause is or how to fix?<br />
P.S My drivers are up to date.</p>

            Hi olchum60, version 1809 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

            Hello, Olchum60,
<br />
<br />I'm an Independent Advisor and will assist you. 
<br />
<br />Only the new fixes were to be installed on the device if you have already installed earlier updates as they became available. 
<br />
<br />Questions: What is the make/model of the device?
<br />Why haven't you upgraded to version 1809?
<br />Did you by any chance look into Control Panel &gt; Programs &amp; Features &gt; View Installed Updates?
<br />
<br />You may download the .iso file from the link below then use an application called Rufus to burn the .iso file to USB drive. Insert the USB drive into the system &gt; Reboot and Windows will install the current build.
<br />Windows 10 .iso

<p>Revert back to previous Good Config. This is how to do:</p>
<p>(1) shoutdown the computer.<br />
(2) Getting into Windows SAFEBOOT MODE: Start Pressing F8 or F4 or F10 or ESC or hold [SPACEBAR]<br />
(3) Scroll down till it say LAST KNOWN GOOD CONFIGURATION [ <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/boot_failsafe.mspx?mfr=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/boot_failsafe.mspx?mfr=true</a>&nbsp;]<br />
(4)&nbsp; Restart the computer. This should bring your computer to a state before latest update cause system error.</p>
<p>If you have a firewall, you may want to update that as soon as you can successfully load into Windows. This is because many time I have seen that Firewal/AV/AS software interfere with Windows Update.</p>
<p>Also, clean your temporary files using <strong>CCleaner</strong>:&nbsp; <a href="http://download.piriform.com/ccsetup234.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Win 7 and Win 10 PC can share files, but not the new Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tbihnoh2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 7 and Win 10 PC can share files, but not the new Win 10</h2>
                    <p>I have on my network:</p>
<ol>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>ASUS RT-AC68U router with attached USB drive shared</li><li>Work laptop, Windows 7.&nbsp;</li><li>Laptop A with Windows 10, drives shared.</li><li>Laptop B with Windows 10, drives shared, homegroup "Tom" setup with all sharing enabled.</li></ol>
<p>From the Work laptop:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can see all the devices</li><li>I can access the share on my router</li><li>I can access the files on Laptop A</li><li>I can access the files on Laptop B</li><li>I can see the media files on all devices as well. Since Windows 7, I guess there is no Homegroup option.</li></ul>
<p>From Laptop A</p>
<ul>
<li>I can see all the devices.</li><li>I can access the share on my router</li><li>I can access the work laptop (login screen, no accounts setup, but I at least get a request for user credentials)</li><li>I can "see" the homegroup "Tom" on Laptop A.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>I <strong>cannot </strong>join the group. When I click on the group and the button Join group, I'm prompted for the password. I immediately paste the copied password and click on OK and receive this error: "Windows no longer detects a homegroup on this
 network. To create a new homegroup, click OK, and then open HomeGroup in Control Panel."</li></ul>
</li><li>I&nbsp;<strong>cannot</strong> get login credentials when I click on "Laptop B" when viewing the Network. I get the error: "\\LAPTOPB is not accessible. You might not have permission to use this network resource. Contact the administrator of this server to find
 out if you have access permissions. Account restrictions are preventing this user from signing in. For example: blank passwords aren't allowed, sign-in times are limited, or a policy restriction has been enforced." &nbsp;I don't even have options to sign in and
 as noted above, am able to sign in to Laptop B from the work laptop.</li></ul>
<p>From Laptop B</p>
<ul>
<li>I can see all the devices.</li><li>I can access the share on my router</li><li>I can access the work laptop (login screen, no accounts setup, but I at least get a request for user credentials)</li><li>I&nbsp;<strong>cannot</strong> get login credentials when I click on "Laptop A" when viewing the Network. I get the error: "\\LAPTOPA is not accessible. You might not have permission to use this network resource. Contact the administrator of this server to find
 out if you have access permissions. Account restrictions are preventing this user from signing in. For example: blank passwords aren't allowed, sign-in times are limited, or a policy restriction has been enforced."&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>In summary, the Windows 7 computer can interact with the router and both Windows 10 laptops. Each Windows 10 laptop can interact with the router and the Windows 7 laptop. Both Windows laptops cannot interact with each other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main priority is getting it so my LAPTOPB can share files both ways with LAPTOPA. The work laptop is just there to help me see more about where the problem is isolated.</p>

</p><p>Both are Windows 10 Home.</p>
<p>Since it's just me (no other email addresses, all are setup with local accounts. I have a username: TV with password: tv on each laptop. The Windows 7 laptop (work laptop) actually does not have a password with the login account, but I created an account
 on my Laptop B to provide a username/password to log in with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not have a homegroup setup before Windows 10, but I attempted to create a homegroup on each of these computers. I'll attempt this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I'll delete this directory in both laptops.</p>
<p>2) I'll leave one off and on the other, follow instructions to create the homegroup.</p>

</p><p>Looked up TeamViewer. This is for a home network so I don't think I'll spend $750 to access the files.. I'll have to revert to sneakernet if that's the case! :)</p>

</p><p>I gave up on it and replaced the operating system in the former Windows 8 laptop with Linux Mint. To install, I just had to burn the .iso to DVD with the windows burning utility, reboot, hit esc several times to get to the setup prompt and disable the UEFI
 (secure boot) mode. Once I rebooted, I was able to hit esc key several times to get to the boot menu and select the DVD drive. Installation was easy from that point going forward. I could've setup dual boot at that point I suppose, but I decided I had already
 backed everything up and couldn't take the issues I'd already had with Windows 10, so went clean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To my surprise, the desktop looked very much like my Windows 7 desktop. There is a menu in the lower left corner, a task bar at the bottom, a clock to the bottom right... etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only real difference is it comes with Libre Office which can open and save Office 2010 and above documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to share with the Windows 10 PC immediately without messing around with a home group. It took less time to research a Linux version I wanted, figure out how to install it, and figure out how to get to files and share than it did fighting with
 Home Group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is a failure and I'm now thinking of just switching my other personal laptop to Linux Mint. Or maybe I'll try out one of the other flavors or distros...</p>

<h2>            Sound devices crash Star Wars Battlefront 2 for  Windows 10, from Origin, released November 2015</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>OS = Windows 10 Pro, latest&nbsp;Windows 10 updates and&nbsp;drivers installed as of 11-28-2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have trouble with sound playing in Star Wars Battlefront 2 for&nbsp; Windows 10, from Origin, released November 2015,&nbsp;(3.0 GHz with Realtek on motherboard&nbsp;sound device)&nbsp;it will make the game crash and fail
<strong>during initial loading of the game</strong>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that if you disable the sound devices in device manager (leave device manager running) and then&nbsp;start the game it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you are playing the game, enable the sound device using the currently running device manager,&nbsp; you can get to the device manager if you left it running by using Alt-Tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this computer system,&nbsp;the&nbsp;sound&nbsp;will then work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another computer (4.0 GHz), with&nbsp;an IDT High Definition Audio (latest driver installed)&nbsp;and the game&nbsp;audio works fine, only once did the game fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A third computer (3.0 GHz), with an Conexant SmartAudio HD &nbsp;(latest driver installed)&nbsp;and the game audio works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>12-4-2015 updated information.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Just updated Windows 10 and Star Wars Battlefront 2 as of 12-4-2015, 1 pm EST.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I ran Battlefront 2 (started and completely stopped and exited game 4 times and playing for about 5-10 minutes each time) without crashing on the 3.0 GHz computer with Realtek (on motherboard)&nbsp;sound device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the initial startup the sound can be a little scratchy, or stops and starts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe the error has been fixed, we will see.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 problems with USB ports and printing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melanie815  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 problems with USB ports and printing</h2>
                    <p>While I was out of town (forgot to turn off my computer), Windows 10 magically and without my permission, installed itself... I was in Santa Fe, my computer was in Sarasota.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 questions... </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. my USB ports don't seem to work anymore... don't recognize my phone Galaxy 6 edge or my tablet, also an android.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have updated drivers, and followed every single piece of advice I could find on this (and other) forums.&nbsp; I have gone to device management and did the troubleshooting... it seems to laugh at me!&nbsp; when it says that nothing is wrong!&nbsp; When I plug in my
 phone to transfer photos, I "tap here" to import, just to get the message that there's nothing in that folder (except for the 700 photos that need to be transferred).&nbsp; It's driving me completely crazy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. tried to print from my email today, only to look at a blank box that comes up and teases me with a "print" prompt.&nbsp; I would suspect that these are two of the same side of the USB coin.&nbsp; My printer is a HP Envy 7640 and is wirelessly connected to my OLD
 computer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I DID NOT want to install Windows 10 because my computer is too old.&nbsp; In fact, I was looking forward to getting a new computer and using Windows 10 sometime soon, but not NOW.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Sounds silly, but I want my old games back without having to tie my stupid little Majong Titans to the internet.&nbsp; I don't want to answer, "No thanks" I don't want to buy something every third game.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. When I tried to go back to 8.1, the recovery prompt says that I have Windows 7... don't think so.&nbsp; What happens to every thing I did after my upgrade to 8.1?&nbsp; Gone?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. I'm learning to hate Windows 10 and Microsoft, in general, because they forced this change upon my without permission.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>But for now?&nbsp; I just want to do what I did before the invasion.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. </p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 Mail App &#34;Sent&#34; Folder Issue.. email reappears - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaeldorr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Mail App &#34;Sent&#34; Folder Issue.. email reappears after deleted</h2>
                    <div>Hi. I recently ran into an odd issue involving the Windows 8.1 Mail App.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I eventually seem to have solved the&nbsp;“problem”, and I am posting this in case it might help someone else.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>To make a long story short I had a bunch of emails (15 or so) that I had left within the&nbsp;“Sent” folder. I was keeping them for a bit. Anyway I decided that I should probably delete at least some of them.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>So I went into&nbsp;my&nbsp;“Sent” folder, and checked the&nbsp;“All” box to select everything there,&nbsp; and clicked on the delete icon in the far right. And all of the emails disappeared from the&nbsp;“Sent” folder as expected.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I went into my&nbsp;“Deleted” folder and&nbsp; thought for a moment. I decided maybe I should move a few of them back into&nbsp;“Sent” in order to keep them.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I selected those emails that I wanted to keep and clicked on the&nbsp;“Move” icon at the bottom of the screen. I moved those emails back into my&nbsp;“Sent” folder and they went back to the folder just fine.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Then I thought again, and decided that I wanted to delete them anyhow.. that I might as well delete all of my&nbsp;“Sent” Mail after all. (LOL, I know.. I am indecisive)</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow I soon found that I could not delete any of&nbsp;those&nbsp;emails that I&nbsp;had originally moved from the&nbsp;“Deleted” folder &nbsp;back into the&nbsp;“Sent” folder, no matter what I did.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as I tried to delete any or all of them (by any method) the deleted email would somehow reappear in my&nbsp;“Sent” folder less than a quarter of a second later.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I tried selecting&nbsp;“Empty Folder” from the manage folders icon, selecting them all at one, and one at a time. Moving the emails to another folder.. nothing worked.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Any of the emails in&nbsp; question always reappeared back&nbsp;in my&nbsp;“Sent” folder less than a quarter of a second later, no matter what I tried. I restarted my system a couple of times, turned it off and on.. even used system restore. Nothing seemed to ever stop
 each of those emails from going back into my&nbsp;“Sent” folder.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing worked.. Until this did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In desperation I had my&nbsp;“Sent” folder open in Mail, and was looking hopelessly at the emails that always came&nbsp;back.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>And I began pressing&nbsp;“Ctrl+D” (the keyboard shortcut for&nbsp;“Delete”) over and over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first it did not help, the emails would disappear briefly from&nbsp;“Sent”, only to pop back in there a fraction of a second later. Over and over each email kept disappearing and coming back as the computer moved through the list.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I began pressing “Ctrl+D” faster and faster in anger, &nbsp;eventually&nbsp;not giving the email time to return.. and after a few minutes of this I noticed that slowly&nbsp;there seemed to be less emails in the folder. That gave me hope.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>After some time (a few minutes of hitting “Ctrl+D” non-stop, &nbsp;I&nbsp;reluctantly&nbsp;&nbsp;halted pressing the keys,&nbsp;held my breath,&nbsp;and waited.. and none of the emails came back. Yay!?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I guess after a while the computer must have&nbsp;realized I wanted to delete those emails.. and it quit trying to bring them back.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I think maybe the&nbsp;“problem”&nbsp;was caused somehow by the fact that I had moved the emails back into&nbsp;“Sent”myself &nbsp;after they had been put into my&nbsp;“Deleted” folder when I was unsure about wanting to delete them.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I also think from now on, if I have anything in my&nbsp;“Deleted” folder that I change my mind about and want to keep.. I will move them into a user created folder (and not the&nbsp;“Sent” folder) in the hopes that this won’t occur again. I figure I can simply delete
 the user created folder altogether if anything like this happens again thus taking the email with it.</p>

            <p>Hi!&nbsp; I hope&nbsp;what I wrote&nbsp;will help you!&nbsp; I never had this particular "problem" occur ever again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully you will be able to get things sorted out with your "Sent" folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;try deleting the entire folder itself, for fear that something like that might cause other problems with regards to your mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps..&nbsp;this issue might be caused&nbsp;if&nbsp;the services (mail servers)&nbsp;you are using&nbsp;as your mail provider (mine&nbsp;would be&nbsp;roadrunner) were slow in updating the mail or perhaps prone to having difficulties.. maybe. But I am not sure about that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I wrote this while I was using Windows 8.1 and never had this happen again</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then I have moved on to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I wish the Windows 10 Mail App had an "Select All" option to select every piece of mail within a folder, and/or the control + A keyboard shortcut&nbsp;did this in the&nbsp;Windows 10 Mail App (like&nbsp;you could&nbsp;in Windows 8.1).&nbsp; Or you could press F5 to re-sync the
 mail in Windows 10.. like you could within the Windows 8.1 Mail App.. but all of that is I suppose.. another story..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of Luck... I hope you can get your issue work out.&nbsp; God Bless!</p>

            <p>OK, thanks to Swathi Ravichandran I got MS Mail SENT folder to clear, but something is still not syncing with my original yahoo account.&nbsp; Here is how&nbsp;I got it to clear.&nbsp; Swathi asked if I tried to clear the SENT folder in my yahoo account, so I went there
 and did.&nbsp; Found bunches of stuff that I was not seeing in MS Mail in this and many other folders.&nbsp; Cleaned house in yahoo directly.&nbsp; Then waited a little, then checked back via MS&nbsp;Mail and it was all gone.&nbsp; BUT, some stuff I left in yahoo did not show in MS
 Mail, so really, , what am I saving by using MS Mail??&nbsp; But that isn't the problem I was wanting to fix (now I do) soooo, go directly to your accounts and clean them there if your getting rubbish results in MS Mail.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is my 2 cents.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Yes.. now that you mention it, I do recall noticing that if I went to my mail provider's Webmail page.. Sometimes I did&nbsp;notice old pieces of mail (in some folders) which&nbsp;still seemed to be&nbsp;"there" according to Webmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But these very same&nbsp;pieces of mail,&nbsp;had been read, and deleted within the Windows Mail App some time ago.. (and&nbsp;thus&nbsp;were no longer being seen) any longer within the Windows Mail App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So (like you suggested) it is probably a good idea for us to visit&nbsp;our accounts directly (via our provider) from time to time and check to see if there are any "left over" pieces of mail there.. which are no long being seen by the Windows Mail App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps it is an issue with the accounts not syncing properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, it would probably be good to clean things up occasionally directly at the accounts themselves (through your provider) (for example using the service provider's Webmail Page.. or the&nbsp;equivalent).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the Good Tip!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of Luck!&nbsp; God Bless!</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:&nbsp; Oh and I did notice that some times it can take a while for changes to appear within the Windows Mail App after I had made them in Webmail. For example when I created a new "user created"&nbsp;mail folder in Webmail.. it could be a while before that folder
 actually appeared in the Windows Mail App.. even after I had synced things a few times.</p>

    <title>Hide IP Address - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> island girl tci  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hide IP Address</h2>
                    I live outside the USA temporarily and would like to be able to access Netflix, Hulu, etc on my new computer which uses VISTA 64 bit. I need to know a safe software that is compatible with Vista 64 bit and will allow me to hide my ip address if possible.
 I tried Hotspot shield but it did not seem to work on Vista. Works on my husbands Window's XP just fine tho.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if there is something safe out there.<br />
Thank you

<p><span>Hi Island Girl TCI,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Technically it is not possible to hide any IP address of a home network, if you do this you wouldn’t be able to browse Internet, because IP address helps locate
 and communicate over Internet. </span></p>
<p>
<span>But you may hide your IP address using Anonymous Proxy Server which will act as a intermediary
</span><span>for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers.</span></p>
<p>
<span>An anonymous proxy server requests for Internet information on your behalf using its own IP address instead of yours which will result websites see proxy servers
 IP address instead of yours. </span></p>
<p>
<span>There are many free and paid anonymous proxy servers available on Internet to browse through a website hiding your IP.</span></p>
<p>
<span>I would suggest you to have look at this guide which discusses how to keep your surfing safe and to your self.</span></p>
<p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helped.</span></p>

    <title>How can I save a sound recording to my computer&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zeoj99  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I save a sound recording to my computer&#63;</h2>
                    I'm trying to create a movie on Windows Movie Maker using a song I recorded on my iPod. Movie Maker allows me to add music, but it requires me to look in a folder already on my desktop marked "Music". What I am trying to figure out is how to get the song
 from my iPod to the folder on my computer. If necessary, I can re-record the song using my computer, if you tell me how to do that. I have a Windows 7 laptop and a 3G iPod Touch.

    <title>Standard User Account and User Account Controls Question. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Standard User Account and User Account Controls Question.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Hi, I'm a Standard user in Windows 7, but I know the password for the Admin account, and I was just wondering how to get the UAC to only prompt me for the password when programs try to make changes to Windows. In the Admin's account, the UAC Settings
 are:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<br />
"Always Notify Me When<br />
Programs try to install software and try to make changes to Windows.<br />
<br />
I make Changes to Windows."<br />
<br />
That is the Default for a Standard User in Windows 7. But not for an Admin.<br />
<br />
"Always Notify Me When:<br />
Programs try to install software and try to make changes to Windows."<br />
<br />
Notice that it doesn't say <strong>"(But do not dim my Desktop)."</strong> I don't know, but I think you can only use that setting in an Admin's Account. Since I am a Standard User, and I do visit familiar websites and use programs that I trust, why can't I
 have that setting as my default? The only setting that is close to that is:<br />
<br />
"Always Notify Me,&nbsp;<strong>(But do not dim my desktop)</strong>, When:<br />
Programs try to install software and try to make changes to Windows."<br />
<br />
If anyone knows how to set the Default Admin UAC Settings as the Standard UAC Settings, that would be great. Thanks.<br />

<p>
</p><p>It is unfortunate that you are facing these issues when you try to upgrade to Windows 8.1. I can understand your frustration, let&nbsp;us work together to resolve&nbsp;it.&nbsp;Disconnect all the external devices except Monitor, keyboard and mouse and check if you are
 able to download the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the methods below and check if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I</span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;would suggest you to reset Windows Store Cache and check if it helps.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Press "<strong>Windows Key +R</strong>" on the keyboard to open

<h2>            Regarding Taredo Tunneling</h2>
                    <p>Yes, I did call my network provider, Time Warner Cable and the tech explained that they are always changing IP address in a constand mode.&nbsp; My linksys router that is connected to the Time Warner Cable Modem is the hardware that is assigning the 192...xxx
 IP address.&nbsp; I do not have any connection issues to the internet.&nbsp; It is my Norton Security system that I check everyday that displays in the history section the 169..xxxxx IP address as a pseudo tunneling interface warning.&nbsp; Time Warner explained that as
 you replied to me that Windows issues the 169...xxxx IP address when conflicts with the Router IP address.</p>
<p>Everything is fine with no trouble connecting to the internet.&nbsp; Thanks for your reply.</p>

<br />
Don't worry.&nbsp; Be happy.<br />
<br />
You would be happier if you dumped your Norton Security software.&nbsp; (If you want to do so, be sure to use the
<a href="https://www-secure.symantec.com/norton-support/jsp/help-solutions.jsp?lg=english&amp;ct=united+states&amp;docid=20080710133834EN&amp;product=home&amp;version=1&amp;pvid=f-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Norton Removal Tool</a>).<br />
<br />
You can stop reading here, but if you want some more detail, read on.<br />
<br />
Your ISP -- Time Warner -- correctly explained that it assigns you a "dynamic" IP address.&nbsp; That means that the IP address may change from session to session (the assigned external IP address will always stay the same until you disconnect from your ISP).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Because you're using a router, however, you will never see the IP address that Time Warner assigns to you unless you (a) look at the "Status" page of your Linksys router's configuration utility or (b) go to a website like
<a href="http://www.whatismyip.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.whatismyip.com/</a>&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I suppose that it's possible that Norton can access this address and report it, but for most people that would be superfluous.&nbsp; Unless you're running a web server or otherwise need to know how to reach your computer over the Internet (e.g., to access your home
 computer while traveling) there's no need to know your external IP address.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you open a Command Prompt window (Start &gt; Run &gt; cmd &gt; OK) and type <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ipconfig /all <br />
you will see -- among other things -- the <span style="font-weight: bold">local</span> IP address that is assigned to your computer

<br />
If you see an IP address that is between <span>169.254.0.1 through 169.254.255.254, that is called an Automatic Private IP Address (APIPA) and is assigned by Windows to your computer's network interface card when (a) the NIC is configured to get
 an IP address automatically (the default) and (b) the NIC is unable to reach the DHCP server (typically in your router) that is supposed to automatically assign that address.&nbsp; This almost always is an indication of a bad wireless encryption password.&nbsp; This
 has nothing to do with a conflict with the router's IP address.</span><br />
<br />
If you see anything about "Teredo Tunneling Interface" you are most likely using Vista or Windows 7 rather than XP, but whatever version of Windows you have, the "Teredo Tunneling Interface" relates to IPv6 and you don't need it and almost certainly are not
 using it.&nbsp; The following isn't my own language, but it's accurate:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<p>To make a long story short, it means you have IPv6 installed as part of your networking components. Check the following;</p>
<p>Go to Control Panel and double click Network Connections. Right click on the icon for your Local Area Connection and select Properties from the menu.</p>
<p>On the General page of the properties sheet there's a box which should contain an entry for Microsoft TCP/IP version 6.</p>
<p>I won't bore you with the details but the bottom line is that most people have no need at this time for IPv6. That said, it won't lead to problems if you leave it installed on your computer. That said, uninstalling IPv6 won't cause you to lose your internet
 connection. The entry you see for Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is the important one.</p>
<p>If you're curious about IPv6, here's a web site with more information.</p>

<h2>            Xbox App Game DVR, audio records, video stuck</h2>
                    <p>This has been happening on my computer and my brothers, and we can't find anything online about it. We've had our computers for over a year now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, this happens randomly, but sometimes when I record with the DVR the audio will be captured just fine but the video will seem like it's stuck on the first frame. The whole video is just the one frame of video. Like the video is paused. Happens in multiple
 games. Today, I recorded a clip where this happened, but my cursor happened to be on screen. The video plays, the cursor moves, but the background gameplay is still stuck. So, the video isn't actually stuck. Something is getting messed up with the recording
 where the gameplay isn't recorded properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are two video examples where the cursor shows up but the video is stuck:</p>

    <title>Problems connecting to Synology NAS in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems connecting to Synology NAS in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently purchased a new laptop running Windows 10 Home (v1703) and am having problems connecting to my Synology NAS.&nbsp; I can access the NAS drive through web browsers with the IP address, and it's showing in "Network" in Explorer. However, whenever
 I try to access it through Explorer (e.g. to map one of my shared folders) I get the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows cannot access \\LONGDISKSTATION</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the spelling of the name.&nbsp; Otherwise, there might be a problem with your network.&nbsp; To try to identify and resolve network problems, click Diagnose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error code: 0x80070035</p>
<p>The network path was not found."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far as I can tell, there's not a problem with the drive as I can access it through web browsers and can access it on other devices - e.g. non-Windows 10 PCs, iPhone / iPad and my Sonos system.&nbsp; Having said that, when I run Synology Assistant on my laptop,
 it doesn't seem to be able to find the NAS drive, even though it's clearly there and apparently can be seen by Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the basics, such as disabling my firewall and anti-virus, but that doesn't make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had a look at some of the Google threads on this but - honestly - I'm a novice it when it comes to these things and I'm not sure I'm looking in the right place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can offer an solutions - in plain English that a layman can follow! - that would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Adam</p>
<p>

<h2>            One particular app does not give the option to uninstall it.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: uninstall app</p>
<p>I have an app I am unable to use or unistall. All my other apps work just fine. This one particular app does not give me the option to uninstall it. I get the option to pin to start or to customize. When i click on the app it tells me to go to the store.
 I have emailed the gamer/support for this app and gotten no response.&nbsp;<br />
I am using windows 8.1. If I can't use it then i would like to get rid of it. I would actually like to keep it but i know this game gets bugs, glitches, and a lot of hiccups however I have contacted the gamer/support several times and gotten no response. It
 is very, very frustrating.<br />
Please let me know what i should do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you&nbsp;</p>

<p>So I could not find a games folders. I have emailed the support at Words by Post Free several and several and several times with no response. I don't know what else to do hence the reason I contacted you guys. If the developer actually responded to me I
 wouldn't need your assistance :(<br />
This is all very frustrating to me. I have had to uninstall and reinstall this game numerous times due to "glitches." But not to be able to uninstall it. No response from the gamer...sucks.<br />
Please tell me what I need to do next.&nbsp;</p>

<p>thank you so much for helping me with this.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Didn;t work. I deleted the Temporary Folder but was unable to find a game folder.<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
Didn't work either. I receive the same message: this app can not be opened. please check the store.<br />
Now though my only option is to pin it to start. I don't have the option to customize.<br />
<br />
My other apps are working just fine. I have contacted the programmer several times and he has
<strong>NEVER </strong>responded...I need to get in there. UGH!!!! As frustrating, irritating as it to me, im sure it is for you too.&nbsp;</p>
