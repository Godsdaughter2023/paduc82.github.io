<h2>            Xbox one- Skyrim se error code 0x83.....</h2>
                    <p>when I try to load Skyrim s e on Xbox one it says 'syncing 99% ', then says something went wrong. Click try again and it does the same thing. When I click use off line it says delete all local&nbsp;saved files . Then error code 0x838601e7. When we search code on here the code doesn't come up. Don't want to delete as I will lose all my games.&nbsp;</p><p>Please fix this or explain to me how I can.</p><p>Many thanks&nbsp;</p>

            <p>welcome to call of duty this happens all the time i once got banned for supposedly cheating. here was the problem i wasnt even on the game when i happened i had got off over 4 hours prior and was at work the one who had reported me was i guy i had reported for cheating and rage quit because we got tired of him cheating and ganged up on him and so he was mad and reported all of us for cheating and a bunch of over made up junk. however it also depends on what those 2 words were that you had said. i understand cussing happens all the time on CoD. epsecially when you get people that either rage every time they die or are kids that shouldnt even be on the game in the first place. its just one of those things that happens. im not saying kids shouldnt play but im sick of people that cuss or make racist remarks or think they have to make sounds like they are having **** or something. come on folks act your age or get off instead of harrasing those of us who want to try to enjoy the game.</p>

<p>Kirn Snipez (&nbsp;you put the report in Call of duty IW&nbsp;)&nbsp;not sure if you mean to put it here or in&nbsp;(&nbsp;2k ) forms&nbsp;but hey welcome, i'm not sure if you mean 2k17 but i hope this message will help you and some other people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>i'm going to asume to put 4 letter and 3 letter words&nbsp;in them 2 words i'm not sure if you got an Xbox Ban or the game ban, but their might be 2 reason why you got a 2 week ban and not a 24H chat ban, if you had a 24h chat before then you will get a 2 Week ban, then maybe&nbsp;month or life ban, &nbsp;if not then it maybe the fact 2k is an E&nbsp;game and&nbsp;parents keep their kids on E&nbsp;game to lower the risk of bullying/Cuss-words/mean people, and since maybe you put them 2 words that is a higher risk since you did it on E&nbsp;game where more kids around,,&nbsp;then an 18+ where swearing is more common, often thrown around.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I&nbsp;know it seem kinda unfair the fact that cheater get away with a lot. heck, what Xbox need to do, is let the people know (&nbsp;update them on the issue )&nbsp;like if someone is cheating and i report them, they need to be a message that like (&nbsp;We have seen that this person has been cheating and has been banned or what ever they decide on doing to that account )&nbsp;just because i have seen a lot of cheater get away with it. i personal dont mind glitching, but their is a limit, if your in a glitch where zombie cant get you, if you killing people and they cant kill you, if you boosting or somesort cheat to win&nbsp;then they should be banned or de-rank, but if your doing out of the map glitching to do exploring to see what&nbsp;you can find since their are some easter egg in some game where if you go out of the map you can see them witch help find new things about the game (&nbsp;i know it rare ) but sometime is kinda cool even to even&nbsp;see the map in a diffent way. and some devs dont mind p
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I&nbsp;Agree with JackSkellinglon in some way&nbsp;but Call of Duty is a&nbsp;competitive game to some people, and for me i do enjoy winning, but i can also have fun and win at the same time. i enjoy going into a game and just killing anyone in my way, it make me feel me good, just like having fun to you feel good, we all have options about game some people see it as a job they want to do (&nbsp;MLG ) some people dont care and just care about having fun. and i understand that. and as much as kids play Call of duty even with it 18+&nbsp;Age, the game is 18 for a reason not for kids (&nbsp;in the UK )&nbsp;if you have a kid playing a 18+ game you can get your kids taken off you, in rare case.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>i agree with JackSkellinglon i have been in Lobbys Where they tell me&nbsp;to get Can*** and die, i have had people say Racist things about my gamertag, my family, even saying their going to kill me &amp; my family over&nbsp;a game but i know&nbsp;what they say and what they do is other thing.&nbsp;and i say to that (&nbsp;nothing ) i let them say&nbsp;whatever, sometime i laugh at them, and just waste their time, since they can focus that on me and not on someone else,&nbsp;&nbsp;report them (&nbsp;file a complate )&nbsp;or even if you feel like Xbox does nothing (&nbsp;Record&nbsp;them then send it to them on Twitter or Facebook support i'm sure they might be able to do something.&nbsp;but to me i have gotten numb to cuss words&nbsp;i'm fine if people saying cuss words&nbsp;or something to release the stress as long as its not targeted&nbsp;to anyone, and stress is how we get better at the game, because we know we can do better so by getting stress we learn what we are doing wrong and work to fix it so w

<p>really tthey should not protected them&nbsp;under the Code of Conduct&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don’t cheat or tamper. For example, don't:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Use unauthorized hardware or software</li><li>Exploit game vulnerabilities or glitches</li><li>Make unauthorized modifications to your account profile or its contents (e.g., tenure, Avatar, game saves, Gamerscore, achievements)</li><li>Intentionally play with someone who is using unauthorized software or methods</li></ul>

</p>
<p>like it say&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploit game vulnerabilities or glitches</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>so if he is cheating then xbox team need to sort it out, for me i&nbsp;record them with the in-game DVR save it on my account then report them, then add the video in the comments, so that their is no way they can get away with it unless xbox team are dont look at them (&nbsp;they should do )&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Monakeene,<br />
<br />
Who is your email service provider?<br />
<br />
No, The first party will not see the BCC email.&nbsp; <b>Blind Copy</b> refers to the practice of sending a message to multiple recipients in a way that conceals the fact that there may be additional addresses on the complete list of recipients. BCC is often used
 to prevent an accidental "Reply All" from sending a reply intended for only the originator of the message to the entire recipient list<br />

<h2>            Perfromance issue in Rogers Yahoo Mail in Microsoft Edge.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Rogers Yahoo Mail </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since upgrading to Windows 10 and using Microsoft Edge, Rogers Yahoo Mail&nbsp;has&nbsp;become&nbsp;painfully slow. Specifically, the&nbsp;rotating circle appears after trying to type almost every word&nbsp;or few words. Additionally, when you try to correct a typo or navigate elsewhere
 in your email,&nbsp;the lag is incessant - from thirty seconds up to&nbsp;several minutes on many occasions. This does not occur in any other web-access&nbsp;service.&nbsp;Why is this happening and is there a remedy?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer these question to assist you better.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When you say 'This does not occur in any other web-access&nbsp;service' have you tried in Internet Explorer?</li><li>Have you tried accessing other mail service provider e.g. Outlook?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try using Rogers Yahoo mail in Internet Explorer and check if you face performance issue. Also if you have Outlook or other mail service account you may try using that and check if you&nbsp;see same issue. If the issue doesn't occur in Internet
 Explorer then you may follow the&nbsp;Methods below and check if that helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would also recommend you to check latest Windows Updates. Go to
</span><strong><span>Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">. If you have any pending updates remaining to install, kindly install them.
</span><span>Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> </span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would recommend you to
<strong>run app troubleshooter </strong>and check if it helps. Follow the below link to run app troubleshooter.</span><span>&nbsp;

            <p>Both of your offered methods do not offer a remedy. When opening mail via Internet Explorer, the issue does not exist, however Explorer seems to have it's own global downside in terms of performance (ie. not responding, etc.).</p>

<h2>            Device cannot start &#40;code 10&#41; with VGA display adapter and Radeon X600</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm trying to use two monitors with my Windows 7 PC.</p>
<p>I have two display adapters: the integrated Intel chip (Standard VGA graphic card) and a Radeon X600 Series card.</p>
<p>I enabled the integrated chip using the BIOS, restarted the computer and installed the drivers.</p>
<p>After another restart, I get this error code from Device Manager, on the integrated chip: Device cannot start (code 10).</p>
<p>All the Windows updates are installed and all the drivers are up-to-date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
This could happen if Radeon X600 is causing a conflict with the on-board graphics card. Since Radeon X600 is much more advanced graphics card than the on-board card I would recommend you to disable the on-board card.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may refer to the article below which explains about the multiple monitor setup.</div>

<h2>            Drivers not installed code 28 can&#39;t view drivers from install update window WIN7 64bit</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have been trying to install a Brother printer MFC-J435W printer for some time. It will not install the drivers. I have been on the phone with Brother who was no help. I have downloaded all the latest drivers to specific location and manually tried to point
 to the drivers during install. It finds the folder but no files are seen to choose thus it fails. If I open an explorer window and view the files in the folder, they are there and can be viewed. Why won't the update driver/manual install drivers window pick
 it up. Is this a permissions issue? I am running WIN7 64 bit home premium. I have restored to previous versions, run as administrator, created new accounts, install during safe mode&nbsp;and tried everything I can. Any help would be appreciated. Very frustrated.</p>

Support for your Brother device comes from Brother.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Your solution, given what you have, is to download the full software package for the Brother device in question and Windows 7 64-bit and install it.<br />
&nbsp; <span>&nbsp; <br />
<a href="http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public/us/us/en/dlf/dlf/000000/004700/dlf004756.html?reg=us&amp;c=us&amp;lang=en&amp;prod=mfcj435w_us&amp;type2=1&amp;os=93&amp;flang=8&amp;dlid=dlf004756&amp;dispforlist=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Full Driver &amp; Software Package for

<span>MFC-J435W</span></a><br />
&nbsp; <br />
Download and save it.&nbsp; RUN it - do not try to install the drivers through the device manager/add a printer, etc.&nbsp; You'd probably have to extract&nbsp; the files in ways that brother does not do automatically in order to use a different process and it is not worth
 it.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Their instructions are:<span><span>
<ol>
<li>Disconnect your Brother machine from your computer if you already connected an interface cable.</li><li>Make a temporary folder on your HDD [hard disk drive] as the location to save the downloaded self-extracting file, e.g. C:\brodnt</li><li>Download the file to the temporary folder.</li><li>Once downloaded, double click on the downloaded file to extract it.</li><li>Select your language and click "OK".</li><li>Follow the installation screen directions.</li></ol>
</span></span>So that is what you should do.&nbsp; Disconnect the device from the computer,
<a href="http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public/us/us/en/dlf/dlf/000000/004700/dlf004756.html?reg=us&amp;c=us&amp;lang=en&amp;prod=mfcj435w_us&amp;type2=1&amp;os=93&amp;flang=8&amp;dlid=dlf004756&amp;dispforlist=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
download</a> &amp; save the given software, run the software and follow the instructions to complete the installation.&nbsp; No need to use the Add printer wizard, etc.<br />

            <p>thanks but I have tried that many times along with the uninstall tool from Brother and tried that as well. This is not a Brother problem. the problem is during install it can't find the drivers. I believe it is a permissions issue. I installed on my wife's
 laptop no problem with windows 7. I even copied the files from the good install from the laptop and copied them on my pc with no luck.

            Hi,
<div>Thanks for the reply. I have tried everything in the tutorial. I believe it is a permission problem. The folders and files where the drivers are can be viewed via explorer. But during any install the files can not be viewed or pointed to only the folders.
 Then it says no drivers found.</div>

<h2>            Claymore vs Silver Knight Straight Sword</h2>
                    
<p>Apples and oranges, I know, but I'm thinking PvP wise. I am going to have 40 intelligence and 40 dexterity. The weapon will likely be buffed with crystal magic. Do you think that the claymore would be a better choice due to stun-locking ability, or will
 the silver knight straight sword be better for it's speed?<br />
<br />
My build is capped at 105. Do you think I should just bring it to 125?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why 125 instead of 120?</p>

<p>Honestly, I would say that you should try both out and swap between the two in between invasions.</p>

<p>I see a lot of level 125 builds on the character planner. I thought that was a common plateau?

<p>Personally, I would take the claymore over the SLSS. If you 2-hand the claymore, you can stagger an opponent who is blocking rather quickly, leaving them open for a big hit. It can also be more difficult to chip away at a PVP opponent with a less damaging
 weapon. You may have hit them 5 or 6 times, but if they can get away from you, they can heal up quickly, forcing you back to square one. With bigger weapons, you swing slower, but you can finish the fight in fewer hits, and you can stagger/stunlock enemies,
 making it easier to chain your hits together. </p>
<p>An alternative would be to take your weapon of choice up to +5 Enchanted to take advantage of your high INT. You wouldn't be able to buff the weapon anymore, but you'd still do plenty of magic damage, and it would free up your spell slots for other things,
 like defensive buffs or Power Within. </p>

<p>You can stunlock with any weapon so long as you break the other person's poise. &nbsp;Whoever told you that only ultra-greatswords can stunlock is wrong.</p>

            Thank you for your prompt reply Andre, you are showing HP Envy 5660 printer information, unfortunately on my HP Envy 4527 the color selection box is no longer showing, it only shows the top two - Tray Selection and Media. The color box is completely missing
 and has been for some time following a Windows Update several months ago. I did manage to get color on my Envy 4527 after completely removing it and then reinstalling via Window Wizard but it has vanished again after the last Windows Update a few days ago.

            I would try uninstall and reinstall it again to see if it corrects the problem. 
<br />
<br />You can download the latest driver from the following link:

<br />Also, I see a firmware update from July 2018 you might want to apply so it improves compatibility:

<h3> oflint  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - infinite reboot cycle</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 on a VAIO laptop successfully and restarted successfully, but since yesterday it started to enter an infinite reboot cycle at startup. The first screen says "Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart". At restart it report
 "Preparing to repair", then "Diagnosing your PC". Then the next screen says "Automatic Repair". After reaching about 40 or 50% it then gives me the Option to Restart or an Advanced Options button. Restart takes me back into an infinite loop of these same screens.
 Advanced Options gives me the option eventually to go back to an earlier point. This fails. What can I do? Following the "troubleshooting" links I find I can enter Safe Mode with Networking but I don't know what to do next. This PC was working flawlessly with
 Windows 8 previously.</p>

            Thanks for all the suggestions. I was also advised by a second tier Microsoft "expert" to either install a clean copy of Windows 10 and lose all my files and apps - essentially start all over again - or to revert to Windows 8.1. No-one actually mentions
 the troubleshooting options that are available even if the computer is stuck in a boot loop. This allows you to either restore 8.1 or to do a System restore or to boot in several different flavors of Safe Mode. Luckily I&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;restore the system, and
 go on to load Windows 10.&nbsp;I then checked for driver incompatibility issues and found that on my Vaio laptop there might be a problem with old drivers for AMD Catalyst clashing with the Intel graphics driver. I uninstalled Catalyst and now the machine boots
 correctly without any error message (INTERNAL POWER ERROR). In fact it boots much faster than it did with Windows 8.1 so this is a bonus.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You may have found out why the used Dell was for sale.<br />
<br />
A CD/DVD drive is 4 drives in 1 and any those 4 can fail while the others work. Of course if needed doing a Refresh or Reset or Clean Install of the OS might help (can't tell by your wording above if you did that or chat just said to do it and offer no real
 help). Cheap discs can also be paly or even disks that are not writeable and/or not in the drive you have. Good news is new CD/DVD burners are cheap if not a laptop.<br />
<span><br />
Burn CDs (or data DVDs)</span><br />

<p>
</p><p>Hi recently I was on the phone with a Dell tech support agent who downloaded and used a program called
<strong>Dell Click 2 FIx</strong>. It looked like a plethora of tools to fix Windows issues, auto updating drivers, and solutions to known issues with systems. Very useful. When installing it, I noticed that many of the tools looked like programs from other
 people, including many freeware/shareware programs. After use the agent was careful not to forget to remove the program.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am curious if anyone has any more info. <span>on</span> what this program uses and if it's available anywhere? Thanks.

                    Hi everyone.&nbsp; My Sony VAIO laptop is useless right now and I'm hoping someone can steer me in the right direction about what to do.&nbsp; It all started when I was trying to download a program to get my laptop's webcam to work.&nbsp; I thought I found it on the
 internet so I clicked download and gave permission to install.&nbsp; I walked away from my computer for hours only to see that a ton of unwanted programs had made their way onto my computer.&nbsp; I was not happy.&nbsp; I've tried to remove it all but some of it is not in
 my programs list.&nbsp; I was able to download W10 and I hoped maybe that would help arrest the unwanted programs and malware.&nbsp; Now I am just getting a Cortana voice message and a visual warning that says my computer has been corrupted and I should call customer
 support ASAP.&nbsp; The number on the visual message is 1-866-361-7747.&nbsp; When I called the guy with the heavy E. Indian accent asked how he could help.&nbsp; I asked him to identify himsel

            <p>Two points/questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. You say "a ton of unwanted programs." How many are there in a ton? Are these all malware?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have multiple malware infections, it is usually nearly impossible to fix your computer They often interact in such a way that even if you remove them all, they leave problems behind them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The *worst* time to do an operating system upgrade is when you are having problems. Upgrading under those circumstances doesn't solve problems and often worsens them.</p>

            I ended up taking my laptop to the Geek Squad at Best Buy.&nbsp; The arrested over a thousand issues related to malware/spyware.&nbsp; It cost me $165.00.&nbsp; My laptop seems to be working very well since then.&nbsp; Better than dropping a bunch of money on a new laptop.&nbsp;
 Thanks again for everyone's input.

    <title>Internet Explorer, Word Templates, and Windows 10 version 1703 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim bishop  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer, Word Templates, and Windows 10 version 1703</h2>
                    <p>We have an Intranet page with HTML links to commonly used Office 2013 Word Templates. The HTML links actually point to shortcuts (.lnk files) which in turn point to the Word Templates. Pointing the links directly to the templates opens the template, rather
 than a document based on the template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to upgrading to 1703, clicking one of the links in Internet Explorer would cause a Word document to open based on the Word Template. Now the Word document never opens. No error is displayed or logged in the event viewer. The same is true when using
 Chrome. However, the links work fine when using Edge. Unfortunately, we are unable to use Edge as out default browser due to it's incompatibility with our agency's browser based EHR (Electronic Health Record) software.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC's in our domain which have not yet been upgraded to Windows 10 version 1703 still work fine, that is the Word documents still open as expected from the HTML links on our Intranet page. Only the PC's that have upgraded to 1703 exhibit this problem.
 Double clicking the shortcuts in File Explorer works fine in 1703, a document based on the template open right up. It's only when clicking the hyperlink in IE or Chrome that the document fails to open.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else having this issue? Has anyone found a fix? This problem has halted our deployment of the 1703 upgrade.</p>

                    <p>I notice in Device Manager I have 3 drivers in the Section Other Devices that have a Question Mark against them.&nbsp; They are:&nbsp; BTSecure; Clavis Server; SMS/MMS.&nbsp; They say they are working but it says the driver details are unknown.&nbsp; I also notice in the EVENT
 Log is a Warning for BTUSB&nbsp; that may be related to the device manager.&nbsp; I am running Windows 10 pro 64bit.&nbsp; Have done all the updates including the so called April update.&nbsp;&nbsp; WinVer = 1803 OS Build 17134.81.&nbsp; I seem to have seen there may be a problem with
 some USB areas after the latest Window major upgrades/updates.&nbsp; This is not a show stopper but it would be nice to clean up this area.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; The warning in Event Log for BTUSB Hub gives 0x491f7fffff &amp; 0x1fffff (not very helpful?)</p>

<h2>            Program only works right on 256 color mode.</h2>
                    När jag startar mitt gamla spel The reap 1997. Så funkar det bra till jag ska börja spela det som händer är att allt går alldeles för fort det är som att spelet körs i 10000 fps? Men när jag går in på pogramet och ändrar kompatibilitet till 256 färger
 så går spelet i normal takt presis som det ska. Men det är så fult så att man ser knappt vad som är på bilden jag vill inte köra i 256 färger för att spelet ska gå i normal tackt. When i start my good old game The Reap 1997 on windows 7 the game works fine
 loading goes fast and its all good but. When it comes to the gameplay the game run really fast its unplayebull its like its 10000 fps but when i tryed using 256 color mode the game whent to normal speed as it should but now the game looks like **** is there
 a way for me to play it without 256 color mode and still run in normal speed?

<h2>            PCI Device</h2>
                    <p>I bought a new laptop with Windows 10 on it (Toshiba satellite&nbsp; model# S55-C5274).&nbsp; Didn't like it so I did a clean install of windows 7 professional&nbsp;64 bit.&nbsp; After reinstalling numerous drivers I am having trouble with finding one: It is the PCI device.&nbsp;
 When I pull up the device manager it has Other devices then sub of that is the PCI Device.&nbsp; When I double click on that it has a location of PCI slot 5 (PCI bus 9, device 0, function 0) and in the driver status box it has drivers not installed (code 28).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to the computer management, click on device manager then on the menu bar click view and resources by connection it falls under memory with the sub tab of mobile 5th generation intel Core PCI express root port #6 - 9C9A then the subtab of that is
 PCI device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I check my system memory it recognizes the 12 gig of ram, has the right processing speed, and has the correct hard drive size.</p>

<h2>            internet connection sharing on ad hoc wireless network</h2>
                    
<p>ok, I looked thru the forum, but still have not adressed a problem I'm having.</p>
<p>background, we purchased 2 new laptops, vista 64 bit dual core and all from Dell, upgrading from 10 and 4 year old laptops.</p>
<p>set up internet connection, ATT GSM tether to cell phone via USB port, then set up an ad hoc network with internet connection sharing (ICS) worked well for about a week. BTW we used the same setup for years with the old hardware, some glitches sometimes,
 but worked well.<br />
<br />
the problem I'm having is the ad hoc and ICS failed, the host computer still connected ito the nternet and&nbsp; the ad hoc network working, but the remote computer only in local, no local and internet for the remote computer, that red X in the connections in between
 the network and internet in the remote computer.<br />
<br />
I have tried making new ad hoc with ICS, several times, tried to troubleshoot for every which way, working thru all the tutorials and settings, tried reversing the host and remote, all with no success. still no internet for the remote computer, and looking
 at that dreaded red X. went thru all the diagnostics and setting prompts from there, still no inernet for the remote.<br />
<br />
please help, usually I can sort this stuff, beginning to think maybe&nbsp;a setting I can't find or change, or&nbsp;drivers or something&nbsp;ATT has installed to disable ICS, which puts me in aspirin territory.<br />
<br />
I would like to repair it as is, but also wouldn't mind a wireless router, if something is possible with my phone modem with USB, right now, it's very inconvenient to pass the phone back and forth between computers.<br />
<br />

You said this connection worked well for about a week.&nbsp; Have you tried doing a system restore back to the point in time when it worked?&nbsp; Obviously something has changed, either a software or hardware update, or the network adapter is failing.&nbsp; Try the restore
 back to a point in time before the problem occurred and let us know if that worked for you.<br />
<br />
To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps: <br />
Click Start, type system restore in the Start Search box, and then click System Restore in the Programs list.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.
<br />
In the System Restore dialog box, click Choose a different restore point, and then click Next.<br />
In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click Next.
<br />
Click Finish.<br />
The computer restarts, and the system files and settings are returned to the state that they were in at the time that the restore point was created.<br />
<br />
Let us know if we can be of further assistance.<br />
Thank you,<br />
