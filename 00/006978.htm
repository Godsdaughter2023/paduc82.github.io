<h2>            Printer won&#39;t print from laptop after an update of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 -- last week an update was done -- now I can't print anything that is internet based - I can print a word or excel doc but no internet.&nbsp; I have uninstalled my printer and reinstalled -- I have done a check of software and printer is fine
 -- my&nbsp; PC and tablet are able to print docs from my printer -- it is only my laptop that is a problem and that is the only one with Windows 10 on it - so I believe this latest update did something as I was able to print before that.</p>

<p>I've recently got an E72 and I'm trying to set-up email (via Lineone)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've done the inbox thing ok but can't send anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the Advanced Mailbox settings, there is no Incoming mailbox or Outgoing mailbox settings option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've searched high and low but can't find anything that will let me have access to the Outgoing mailbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am I missing something?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>I need information to assist you better:</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>What is the version of Outlook connector, is it 32bit or 64bit?</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Outlook connector has to match the version of Outlook that is installed on the computer.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Since you have Outlook installed as 32bit, you need to install Outlook connector as 32bit.</font></font></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font><font color="#000000"><font>Step 1:</font></font></font></b></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>1. Right click on the Downloaded connector file, then click on the ‘Properties’ option.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>2. Click on the Compatibility tab.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>3. Uncheck ‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’ checkbox and uncheck ‘Run this program as an administrator’ check box and click Ok.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Now try running the downloaded file and verify the result.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font><font color="#000000"><font>Step 2:</font></font></font></b></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>You may also try downloading in clean boot and check the result:</font></font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: Once the troubleshooting is done, ensure to restart the computer in normal mode.</span></font></p>

            HI <br />
Many thanks for your response however the issue is not the outlook connector as I have installed the 32 Bit as the Outlook is 32 Bit so that's OK.<br />
<br />
The issue is how do you actually set up or add a new calendar that is synchronised with my windows calendar?&nbsp; Do I have to set up my Hotmail email account in outlook first?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have tried every possible way and I know that when someone explains it step by step that I am going to feel like doing a Homer Simpson!<br />
<br />
I am pretty IT and windows/office literate so it's frustrating me that I cannot do this.<br />
<br />
Many thanks for all your help<br />
Regards<br />
Chris<br />

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For additional information regarding your concern, are you using the same OneDrive account to all your devices when you access OneDrive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you can try resetting your credentials for the notebook in your iPad:</p>
<p>1. Go to iPad <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>OneNote</strong> &gt; <strong>Reset OneNote</strong></p>
<p>2. <strong>Delete Sign-In Credentials</strong> and turn the toggle on</p>
<p>3. Make sure OneNote is not running (Check and see all running apps, close OneNote if it's still running)</p>
<p>4. Re-launch OneNote and sign in again.</p>

            <p>Hello Johanna 777</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I'm using the same OneDrive account to all my devices.</p>
<p>It's a company Office 365 Account.</p>
<p>All the pages, tables some pictures are shown. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After resetting my credentials for the notebook in my iPad (one more time), <em>
some, but not all </em>images now appeared on the iPad.</p>
<p>As a test, I added one more picture on my PC. The problem still exists.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure that there is something wrong with the sync to the iPad App!</p>
<br />
<p>BTW: There is one more person with the same problem:<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_onenote-mso_imobile/photos-on-onenote-ipad-app/8c02716b-d888-4a9c-a5b7-52603e914ac8">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_onenote-mso_imobile/photos-on-onenote-ipad-app/8c02716b-d888-4a9c-a5b7-52603e914ac8</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid of data loss too!</p>
<p>My workaround is to only to use the iPad fo adding pictures and simultaneously saving the pictures on my PC into folders in the windows explorer. However this workflow is very annoying and I'm already looking out for an alternative app.</p>

            I have no experience with navigations, but I try to answer to (1): First make sure that the sliding mechanical Qwerty keyboard is closed. Then<br />
(a) touch once with the stylus on the editing area: the small stylus-operated virtual Qwerty keyboard will open.<br />
(b) (when the small keyboard is visible, or not), touch (once but a longish time) the editing area with a finger or two: the big "thumbpad" will open. To change from the "thumbpad" to the small virtual Qwerty, touch the "arrow down" symbol (in the upper right-hand
 corner of the display panel).<br />
- To make this correctly, (I believe) you need to choose behind Settings &gt; Control Panel &gt; Text Input Settings, and via the "On-creen" tab, activate "Enable stylus input methods", activate "Launch finger keyboard with finger tap".<br />
- More instructions are found behind "Help &gt; Text input settings &gt; Text input - On-screen keyboard" and "Help &gt; Text input methods &gt; Virutal keyboards".<br />
- I hope this helps. But please note that I have a quite old SW version in my N810). - Eppukoo

<h2>            Slow Alt Key shortcuts on excel and word</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having issues with office 2016 - mainly with the alt key short cuts on excel and word. Every time I try to use an alt key shortcut, there is a significant lag before the shortcut gets registered and I have to wait for the animation to finish before proceeding.
 I've tried calling customer support and their suggestion was to use office 2010 which they discontinued online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a couple of posts with similar problems on excel 2013, and i used some of the solutions like disabling animations and making changes in the registry. But none of these helped in anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone faced similar problems with the alt key shortcuts and maybe found a solution?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help!</p>

<h2>            Photo Browser Acting Strange - N79</h2>
                    
<p>I don't know what kind of a problem is this. But my photo browser is not catching any pictures snapped via camera. There's one corrupt image there as well that doesn't get deleted nor ever gets opened. Other than that there is basically just 15 images that
 keep on coming again and again, as compared to my 200 images snapped. It shows 200 images, but opens only 15 when viewed in Captured. Any views on this please. Even Reinstalled my Firmware to eradicate the issue, not working still.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any Help is greatly appreciated.</p>

            are you using the N900 headset? or a different one?<br />
(Check your headset conditon using another phone or something)<br />
<br />
*aslo try this;<br />
after plugged in, rotate your headphone jack slowly..<br />
<br />
**this could happen coz of a app youve installed. So remove apps like headphone demon and apps newly installed.<br />
<br />
***i got kinda same prob when i bought ma N900 in 2009. But after PR1.2, its gone..<br />
So check your firmware version and update it...

    <title>No Text Wrap feature in PowerPoint&#63; Surprising - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No Text Wrap feature in PowerPoint&#63;  Surprising</h2>
                    
<p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I'm astounded to discover that PowerPoint 2007 has no automatic Text Wrap feature to wrap text around pictures, graphics or other objects, like the Text Wrap feature found in Word and Publisher going back maybe as far as the original Word for Windows and
 certainly as far back as the original Publisher.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to a quick Internet search, it would appear that the text wrapping feature is also lacking in PowerPoint 2010.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a truly amazing oversight given that PowerPoint has such a visual orientation.&nbsp; It's hard to imagine that it would be much of a challenge to take the text-wrapping algorithms and code you developed years ago for Publisher and adapt them to PowerPoint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The manual workaround kludge (which ought to rhyme with "sludge") recommended on the Microsoft Office website (see http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint/HA102821141033.aspx) is unnecessarily awkward, time-consuming, and fundamentally embarrassing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, computers should work for people, not the other way around.</p>

<p>A simple alternative is to use word to do all that text wrapping stuff and then insert that as an object in PowerPoint..try this and check if it suits your work.</p>
<p>(Or )</p>
<p>you can also try inserting a new Microsoft Word object in PowerPoint and there or go ahead with the text wrapping in that object in the presentation and that should do the job</p>

    <title>Word 2007 changes margins before printing, how to stop this&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tooooooooooooooo complicated&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2007 changes margins before printing, how to stop this&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>When I select print, MS Word (2007) kindly reformats the document without being requested to do so, by changing the margins
 slightly. The result is that all the hours of hard work to nicely format the document are destroyed in a second.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>If you close and reopen the document, the scrambled format is still there. But if you exit Word and restart it, then you
 are back to square one. Nevertheless, you still cannot print the document as intended, because as soon as you start to print it again, it does the wonderful scramble game again.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Why would MS program such a feature? And why have I been unable to find how to disable this feature, after going through
 all imaginable menus, etc? Even if this feature were supposed to help somebody somewhere somehow for some unimaginable reason, why isn't the default option to NOT have this alleged benefit? The normal user should have to go through all the endless menus looking
 how to turn this option ON--not looking how to disable this unwanted nuisance.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Last of all, but certainly NOT LEAST: why on earth is everything so extremely complicated? Why did it take me about an
 hour to get to this support location (after going on wild goose chases from one so-called help and support location to another); and then when I found this site, it took me about an hour just to jump all the hoops to sign up! Unfortunately, this is NOT the
 first time that this has happened; instead, this INSANITY is NORMAL--just about every time I have a problem of any degree. It is so bad that for many years now, I have not tried to get help on ANYTHING WHATSOEVER! I just try to live with the problems, rather
 than dedicate my entire life to the far greater problem of trying to get help for the problems.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>By the way: I am
<u>very</u> technically minded, and should be able to wade through the madness much easier than the average person; I don't have any idea what most people do, other than the same thing which I usually do--face the consequences of the problem itself, which is
<u>much easier</u> than getting so-called HELP! And is all this technology really helping us out? Are we better off than before it came along?? Do we have more spare time now--or are we now spending all of our spare time trying to fix the endless problems that
 technology has dumped in our laps???</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Perhaps these questions are more philosophical than this web site is intended to answer; but perhaps the question--even
 if not answered--will give at least one or two others out there a slight glimpse of the magnitude of my frustration, since this is the first time in YEARS that I have even bothered to attempt getting support (knowing full well by countless experiences how
 overwhelmingly difficult it is to actually get the problem solved). But tonight I thought that I would give it another try, after many years of just living with problems rather than dealing with the extreme frustration of trying to solve them; and SURE ENOUGH--the
 same old madness still reigns supreme in the technical support world of so-called "help"!!!</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Is there anyone out there who is willing to dedicate their life to solving the biggest problem of all: how to turn computers and technology
<span>Is there anyone out there who is willing to dedicate their life to solving the biggest problem of all: how to turn computers and technology
 into making our lives easier, instead of harder than before they were invented. And secondarily: how to get solutions that are not so complex and difficult, that the attempted problem solving becomes a bigger problem than the original problem. If anyone can
 handle either of these things, and especially both, they should get a Nobel Peace Prize, and should also become the richest person that ever lived. Anyone up for a gargantuan challenge??????????</span>

Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>Yes, I have tried the PDF route; and no, it does not reformat.&nbsp;&nbsp; But that is not a real fix to the problem; instead, it is taking a detour around the problem (which is usually much easier than actually trying to solve a problem).</p>
<p>And I have used that detour many times; but another problem is that PDF prints about ten times slower than MS Word.&nbsp; And I had a 60 page document that I needed to print 3 copies of in a short time; this is one reason why I considered in this case going ahead
 and braving the extreme complexity of trying to solve a problem that should be either non-existent, or worst case be a minor problem with a very simple solution.</p>
<p>However, it takes longer to find a solution to the problem (IF one actually exists), than to go ahead and print the 180 pages at PDF snail pace.&nbsp; But I didn't have time to do either; so I printed the scrambled document in MS Word, in spite of all the time
 I had spent formatting it.&nbsp; Then a few days later I got on this web site, trying to see if there was a real solution, for future cases.&nbsp; All in all, it is VERY frustrating (as briefly mentioned in my entire detailed portion of the original question).</p>

<br />
<p><span>Thanks also for your reply (see previous reply and response).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Actually, the document was set to print in the default printer--the only printer I have had for more than a year, and the only one that I have had set to default in more than a year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Also, it does the same thing whether the printer is physically connected or not. So it is MS Word (and/or printer driver) that is doing the unwanted and unneeded devastation--not the printer itself. And whether it’s the printer or printer driver, why
 does MS Word even allow it? And how can I turn this ridiculous option off? Or perhaps could my worst nightmare be true (and most likely is true): perhaps that which should never be in the first place, does not even have the possibility to turn it off? It would
 be bad enough if this was an option, and the default setting was “on” rather than “off”; but far worse would be that you are forced to accept the feature, like it or not!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And I really would like to know what possible good could ever come out of such a feature? Is it the result of careless programming, and was never intended by anyone? Or did somebody actually go to the trouble of intentionally planning and designing
 this bug?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I can't imagine the least bit of good that it could do anyone, or than maybe being some kind of protection against the text going outside of a printable area on the printer. Yet even that doesn't fit; because I make the page margins a full inch wide
 on each side of the document, which should be plenty wide for any printer to handle, and yet it still hesitates not to do the scramble dance without any extra fees or pleadings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Furthermore, I have seen software that warns before printing that the text is outside of the printable area; and gives the user the option to print anyway as is, or have the computer adjust the margins to the standard printable area.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Often in this case, if I chose ignore and print anyway, the printer still prints everything just fine.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So no need to scramble the document, without my request, in order to supposedly make things better!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>AT MOST, all that MS Word should be programmed to do is give the option to print as is or not. And WHO, by name, is responsible for it NOT being this way? Never-mind, you could also spend a lifetime trying to find the responsible person(s); and it's
 likely you would never find them, and even if you did--they would have some way to wiggle out of responsibility, again making all the time and effort a total waste. Again: VERY FRUSTRATING--especially since this is not an isolated case.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
This case is just one of countless similar situations that I've had over the years; I have learned to expect that computer problem solving is far bigger of a task than I can possibly handle, even if I had full time to spend on it!</span></p>

<p>Thanks again for your help.&nbsp; I did take a look at the Knowledge Base article, but it seems to be dealing more with the inability to print anything--not my specific problem.</p>
<p>My document does contain a few URL hyperlinks; but no pictures or anything else.&nbsp; Also, the problem is that the text is not carriage returning at the exact same place where it did when I initially wrote the paragraphs.&nbsp; I am able to find the specific places
 where this is happening, and it's not URL's or any such thing.&nbsp; It is simply the margins are slightly narrower, so the carriage return comes one word sooner in a few cases.&nbsp; But it takes only once to ruin the whole layout of the whole document from that point
 forward; and it actually does it far more than once.</p>
<p>Again I have to wonder if this margin revising is by design, and if so can it be turned off?&nbsp; Or is it just clumsy programming by MS?</p>

 quality; if I leave it on "draft", then nothing changes when I go to print.</p>
<p>And it can happen in a document with only one line of text, and nothing else.&nbsp; If the one line of text fills the whole line so full, that it is almost at the point of carriage return, then when "normal" print quality is selected, it does indeed go ahead
 and carriage return that last word of the line.</p>
<p>Even if this is a driver problem, why would MS Word allow the driver to&nbsp;fool with the document?&nbsp; The driver should have no such authority over the document.&nbsp; And again, PDF does not do this; so it is possible for the word processing software to prevent the
 driver from changing the document.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If Word uses the current printer driver to format the document, then this feature would most certainly qualify as "by design" (and Stefan above said that it was not by design).&nbsp; And again, this should be an option--not a requirement; and the default on this
 option should be disabled, not automatically gifted to you without request.</p>
<p>Adobe PDF quite obviously does not use the printer driver to format the document; so as I said before, it is possible to create software without this
<u>destructive</u> feature.&nbsp; The printer should not have the ability to delete text in the document, or add pictures, or change hyperlinks OR DESTROY THE DOCUMENT IN
<u>ANY </u>WAY WHATSOEVER!&nbsp; And changing the margins does indeed destroy the document, at least for printing purposes.&nbsp; The ONLY thing that the printer (and printer driver) should be allowed to do, by MS Word, is print the document EXACTLY as it was created.</p>
<p>The link to the "fixes" above may or may not help this problem.&nbsp; I don't see anything on the page indicating that my issue is a known problem, which is fixed with any of those downloads.&nbsp; And unless someone knows for sure that this problem is fixed with
 the download, I am not about to just try it and see.&nbsp; Experience has shown me that random method fixing attempts usually end up creating more problems--and rarely fix the initial problem.</p>
<p>I am thankful for the few here who have tried to help me.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I think it's time to crawl back into the hole where I spent the last five years--of not trying to fix ANY problems.&nbsp; I have spent about a day's worth of time trying to solve this one
 (not all at once, but scattered over a week or so); and I still have nothing clear to solve the specific printing problem at hand--much less the far bigger problem mentioned in my original post above.</p>

<h3> sydsolo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I upgrade Office Home and Student 2016 for Mac to include the latest Outlook&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have purchased Office for Mac 2016 and it does not include Outlook. Can simply get an upgrade &nbsp;(including Outlook) of this suite or do I have to buy or subscribe to Outlook for Mac separately?
</p>
<p>Would subscribing be better value or more economical than buying Outlook (as I did with the Office 2016 suite)?</p>
<p>Thanks to anybody who can answer this.</p>
<p>

            <p>An important factor when considering purchasing a stand-alone copy of Outlook for Mac (it's available from the Microsoft store), is how far along we're into the product life cycle of 2016 and how soon you will see the next version of Microsoft Office to
 purchase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now we're more than half-way through the product life cycle of permanent 2016, so if you buy stand-alone outlook you'll pay almost ask much as for the whole suite, and you'll only get a few months of use before the new version comes out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest buying a suitable Office 2016 subscription that covers both your Mac and PC needs. It's like buying Office 2019 (my guess as to the next round) early and getting to use the new features (there are already lots of them) right now instead of waiting.</p>

            <p>Hi sandra_6868, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Answers. I am pleased to assist you with your concern. I would like first to clarify as to what exactly do you mean by " combined a hotmail account and a outlook account "? do you mean having only one account which you can
 switch from your Hotmail to Outlook account? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindly provide us with much detailed information as how do you want us to help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In line with this, you can choose between Linking Accounts or create an Alias. Linking accounts means, you may access your other account without providing anymore your password. This will allow you to switch from one account to your other account. To know
 more about an alias please refer <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/conquergraymail/advanced/alias" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h3> umeshkanade  say:</h3>
<h2>            SD card apps not found after upgrade from windows mobile 8.1 to 10</h2>
                    I upgraded my windows mobile from 8.1 to 10 (Microsoft 640 dual sim). I had an SD card with a few applications installed on it. The SD card is detected by windows 10 , but it does not shows any of the applications installed on it under windows 8.1. The
 SD card usage is shown currently as 90%, which means the data/apps installed earlier under 8.1 are still present on the SD card. I have some very important apps which I cannot access after the upgrade.<br />
<br />
How do i make them show up again ?&nbsp;

            Hi, UmeshKanade.<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
If your memory card is not recognized, make sure that:<br />
<br />
1. You have a fast 4–200GB microSD (Lumia with Windows Phone 8: 4-128GB microSD) memory card by a well-known manufacturer.<br />
2. Your memory card is not full (there should be at least about 50 MB of free memory on the card).<br />
3. Your memory card is not password protected. To check if your memory card is password protected, connect it to a PC with a USB reader that has a microSD card slot. If the card cannot be accessed, it is password protected. Remove the password from your memory
 card using the device where it was previously used.<br />
<br />
If your memory card is not working as expected and has thousands of media items, the file system scan may consume considerable amounts of your phone processing power even when running in the background. If you think that is the issue, go to Settings &gt; System
 &gt; Storage, tap on the SD card (D:) and at the bottom of the screen tap Remove (Lumia with Windows Phone 8: App list, select Storage Sense, tap the SD card bar and tap remove SD card). You can access your memory card next time you restart your phone.<br />
<br />
If you see the Scan SD card and fix errors message box, tap Yes to have your phone scan the card and try to fix any errors. If you see an SD card scan failed message, insert the memory card into a PC and try and fix it there with these steps:<br />
<br />
Before formatting your memory card, make sure you have a backup of the data as it is lost during the formatting:<br />
<br />
1. Connect your memory card to a PC with a USB reader that has a microSD card slot. If your card reader or PC has a regular SD card slot, you can use a microSD card adapter.<br />
2. Use the File Explorer and browse to the removable storage on your computer, right-click the memory card and select Format.<br />
3. For 4-32 GB cards, select the file system FAT32 and allocation unit size 32 kilobytes and press Start. For 64-200 GB cards, select the file system exFAT and allocation unit size 128kB.<br />
4. Press OK to confirm the data loss warning message. When the formatting process is complete, press OK.<br />
5. Restore only the data that is compatible with your phone (JPEG or MP4 in the photos folder or MP3 in the music folder).<br />
6. Right-click the memory card, select Eject, and wait until it is safe to remove the card.<br />
7. Insert the memory card into the memory card slot in the phone until it locks into place.<br />
<br />
Keep us updated. <br />

            <p>After a firmware upgrade you need to reinstall all apps which you had on the SD card, they will not be picked up by the OS, as you have already found out. Depending on the app, you will probably lose all data related to it.<br />

                    <p>When I try to connect, I only get the 'black' screen. I can click on it and it activates the relevant function on the phone but nothing is visible on the laptop. Occasionally it does a reboot of the phone after accepting the connection. I've read all the
 various messages on forums to resolve it e.g. disconnecting, re-install drivers etc. but none of them work for me. I've tried different USB cables and all the ports on my lapto Makes no difference. Very frustrating.</p>

<h3> twrm  say:</h3>
<h2>            1520 speaker problem</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased a 1520 just 4 weeks back. It was all fine till yesterday. Got some cracking sound &amp; disturbance in the speaker during calls, I assumed it to be some sort of network error, but yesterday evening the speaker went completely dead. I'm able to hear
 the caller if I use the loudspeaker, but not otherwise. I haven't connected any headset or bluetooth device. Pls help me out with this problem.</p>

<p>Press and hold the power and volume down buttons for about 10-15 seconds until the phone vibrates. Release the buttons and the phone will restart properly. Once done, you may have to reset the time by going to Settings &gt; date+time. If the “Set automatically”
 option is on, turn it off and set the correct time, date and your current time zone. Tap on back to save the changes. Hope this helps.</p>

<p><span>Has your problem been solved? I have the same issue. &nbsp;I'm using lumia 1520 white, and after I used my headset for some music, it seems that the unit didn't recognize the headset being removed. So even if I'm not using the headset anymore, the sound
 does not come out from the speaker. Also, when making calls, the other person cannot hear me (and vice versa), only when I use loudspeaker or I use headset, it's fine. How's this happening?</span></p>

<h2>            moving user from an .onmicrosoft.com account to the  correct account using the same domain name with the valid account information.</h2>
                    I created user under a new domain name &nbsp;when I realized I should just &nbsp;add the new domain to the companies existing account. &nbsp;I have all the users entered under the correct domain except for one who I can't &nbsp;recreate because it appears under the *** Email address is removed for privacy ***
 account. &nbsp;How do I delete the onmicrosft.com account so I can add the user's email under the added domain account along with the other company users?

            If the files were very big, then you need a Wi-Fi to download them.

            Hi, I had restarted the browser, tried a different browser, cleared cache, rebooted etc.&nbsp; I went online to see an outage map that showed my area as being out or having trouble.&nbsp; I ended up going to Microsoft help and working with an online tech for over
 2 hours and we finally got it back up and running.&nbsp; Still don't know exactly what the problem was.&nbsp; Now will watch it for a few days to see if it stays or not.<br />

            I was getting the same two messages. I found I could access outlook.com if I used the Edge browser. and I could access outlook-the office suite program in Firefox. but&nbsp;outlook.com still doesn't work on Firefox.

            <p>This seems related to this:&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oemail-oapps/unable-to-access-emailsoutlook-mail-site/080fc338-bf02-4acc-8a52-70ce0967c36b</p>
<p>
</p><p>To quote the answer there:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;fixed it by clearing cache of my main browser and using another to get past a 'updated terms' of each first that wouldn't let me agree</span></p>
