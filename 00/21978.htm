<p><span>Hi Alexander,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for reaching out with your inquiry, we’re happy to help!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>When importing your shopping campaigns from Google AdWords to Bing Merchant Center, there are certain attributes that
<span>get imported and other attributes that do not. Please keep in mind, shopping campaigns are only available in the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Germany and cannot be imported for other countries. You can find more information on importing
 from Google AdWords to Bing, in our Bing Ads <a href="https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50851/0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>One attribute that is not transferable, is the store ID. When you are making the import, you should see a section called Choose Import Options. Under this section, you are able to choose your import
 options for Bing Merchant Center. Please check this section to ensure that you are selecting the correct options to give your Bing Merchant Center store its own individual store ID.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope that you find this information helpful. I am also happy to look into this further for you to make certain that everything has been done correctly and I have sent you a private message on how
 to proceed. Please check your private messages.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sincerely,</span></p>

<h2>            Refreshing pivottable in excel 2010 without opening sourcefile </h2>
                    
<p>How can I refresh/update a pivottable(in xlsx-format)&nbsp;in excel 2010?. Sourcefile is another excel workbook(in xlsx-format). Everything is ok as long as the sourcefile is open, but when it´s closed I get an errormessage. This was not any problem i excel 2003.</p>
<p>I have found out that it will work if I save sourcefile in compatible-format with 97-2003, but I wish to upgrade all files to xlsx</p>

<h2>            Finding Master Category List in search contacts window</h2>
                    When I am in the Contacts page and am categorizing contacts, I can access the Master Categories List, and view all my categories, but when I need to find a contact my category I can't find a way to pull up the Master List.&nbsp; I have right clicked in the
 search categories bar, and then clicked on Categories, and that brings up the drop down list.&nbsp; At the bottom is the little option of "Any Category" which is how I access the master list when adding new categories or assigning categories.&nbsp; But when I click
 on this in the search function, the whole thing disappears!&nbsp; I had no problem in my old Outlook Contacts getting the Master List for search purposes.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting. As I understand you’re unable to find the categories once you click in ‘Search’ bar under ‘contacts’ folder.</p>
<p>It would be best if you provide the following details:</p>
<p>1. The exact steps you are taking that leads to the problem.</p>
<p>2. Are you talking about the Category in the Ribbon or the Search bar?</p>
<p>3. How many data files are opened in the Outlook?</p>
<p>4. Does the issue occur with particular contact folders or with all?</p>
<p>It would be best if you upload screenshots of the same.</p>
<p>Refer the article below on how to post the screen shot:

            <p>365 is a subscription version, paid for monthly or annually</p>
<p>If you have a valid subscription it is upgraded whenever a new version is released, if you purchased 1 year ago it would be Office 2013, the current version being 2016</p>

<p>Just a quick heads up to all Nokia E72 owners !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia E72 Firmware update version 31.023 now available. Apparently it (finally) fixes the spacebar bug.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edited by Admin:</p>
<p>Thanks clintonjeff - the official changelog will be published soon and the update is already available for many E72 product codes around the world (and new are being added all the time). Unfortunately our forum policy doesn't allow links to any unauthorized
 changelogs that are not available via public Nokia websites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can get instructions - and soon also the official changelog - on how to update from</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm trying to update my Nokia e72 firmware to the new 31.023, but I keep getting the error message:<strong> "Nokia Software Updater has lost its connection with your device"</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been using OVI Suite, and have tried more than 15 times, restarting (by taking out the battery... it doesn't turn off!) and reconnecting my phone every time. I even hard reset my phone, but that didn't help either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, I tried to use Nokia Software Updater. So I got the latest version from Nokia website, but I still get the same error message.<em> It's 3:15am now, and its more than 24 hours that I'm trying to do this!</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Nokia e72-1 model is (RM-530).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the problem? and what is the solution?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Siamack</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>I finally solved the problem!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason I couldn't update the firmware, was that the new firmware file wasn't downloaded correctly, and was corrupt. I think the Nokia Software Update should verify the integrity of such files before attempting to update the handset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I couldn't update my handset on the computer which I primarily downloaded the new firmware on. Because it kept trying to install the same corrupt file, and didn't ever try to download a fresh copy of the new firmware file. So, I installed a fresh copy of
 Nokia Downloader on another computer and started over the update and got a fresh copy of the firmware update file... And the update finished successfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope my experience would help others who might face such problems.</p>

<h2>            Difference between &#34;Apply Actions&#34; versus &#34;Clean Computer&#34;</h2>
                    When a virus is detected, you get two button, Apply Actions and Clean Computer.&nbsp; What is the difference between the two?&nbsp; Either one apears to remove the virus.&nbsp; Everyone I know who has used Forefront or MSE has no idea what the difference is.&nbsp; This is
 completely non-intuitive.

            "Clean Computer" will take the Microsoft-recommended actions on all threats.<br />
<br />
"Apply actions" allows you to select the actions to take, either remove, quarantine, allow, or in some cases clean (when existing files have been infected).<br />
<br />
Typically, just hitting "clean computer" will do the right thing - however, for&nbsp;low and medium severity threats, you do need to make a choice and apply actions.<br />
<br />
Thanks for using MSE,<br />
Joe

<h2>            office 365 encountered an error</h2>
                    I'm getting pretty angry about this. I have been working on it all day and the result is the same.<br />
<br />
The message I am getting is <br />
We are sorry but Microsoft Office has run into an error that is preventing it from working. Microsoft Office will need to be closed as a result.<br />
<br />
It gives me the option to repair or close. I have done repair about 10 times, same result. I have uninstalled it using the fixit tool, manually and through remove programs.<br />
<br />
I even thought it might be clashing with office 2010 so I uninstalled that. No avail.<br />
<br />
The preview worked great, loved it...but this is a nightmare! I have installed it on my tablet and it is running fine and even says it is installed in "my account" but when I look to see if my laptop has installed properly, it is still saying I have 4 of 5
 installs left, yet Office is on my laptop just not working.<br />
<br />
I rang microsoft and the woman there told me I need an activation code, I argued with her that I didn't, the damn thing just won't run. Anyone else having /had this problem<br />
<br />
EDIT:- I have fixed it. I decided to download the 64bit version (against microsofts wishes) and it installed, works and even says in my account I now have 3 downloads left...go figure! So anyone else with this problem, try the 64bit version.<br />

                    <p>I always have my status as invisible, but just recently Skype constantly changed me back to active. I change it back to invisible and, sure enough, the next time I look, I'm back to active again.</p>
<p>How do I stop Skype changing this setting? Another user had an identical issue recently but that user was using windows 10 and I am using MacBook Pro.</p>

</p><p>This is a feature of the new Skype. If you're idle from the app on a certain period of time, your status will automatically change to invisible. There's no option to disable this.</p>
<p>

                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I work in a small IT support company. We manage some our clients Office 365 admin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A user for one of our clients had there Office 365 BE license removed by mie without being converted to a shared mailbox first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One week later, I noticed the issue and immediately reinstated the license to the user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a little concerned that some of their data would have been deleted. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I signed in to OWA as the user and I can emails in there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question would be, how long do Microsoft keep unlicensed mailboxes before removing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to your reply</p>

            <p>Hi BolbsUK,</p>
<p>
</p><p>An unlicensed mailbox will be kept in Exchange Online until it is deleted, permanently removed or purged by the Office 365 admin.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a user’s license is removed, all data that is associated with that user account is held for 30 days. After the 30 day grace period, the data is deleted and can’t be recovered, except for documents that are saved on SharePoint Online and the data in
 the user's mailbox. </p>
<p>

<p>hi manuel,</p>
<p>according to your description, i’d like to confirm more details with you to narrow down the issue:<br />
1.&nbsp;whether the error popped up during the upgrade to office 2016 or after the upgrade finished?<br />
2.&nbsp;what’s the version of your onedrive for business client? you can find the information by opening
<strong>task manager</strong>&gt;<strong>processes</strong> and choosing <strong>properties</strong>&gt;<strong>details</strong> after right clicking
<strong>onedrive for business</strong><br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=189af624-2bb1-4626-93b2-37d05f7e67d3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d189af624-2bb1-4626-93b2-37d05f7e67d3" /></a><br />
3.&nbsp;do you install any other versions of office programs on your computer?<br />
4.&nbsp;could you uninstall and re-install it via <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2903984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2903984</a> &nbsp;?</p>
<p>if the issue persists, it may be related to a known issue about onedrive for business sync app after upgrading to office 2016.<br />
we are getting some reports on that and will continue to update the status on the thread below.<br />
https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/172/t/409801/</p>

<p>hi manuel,</p>
<p>this issue might be caused by the cache of onedrive for business. you can try clearing it and check the outcome. here are the related steps:<br />
1. stop sync all folders.<br />
a) right click the “onedrive for business” icon in your task bar.<br />
b) click “stop syncing a folder”, to let a pop-up window appear which lists all the document libraries.<br />
c) “stop syncing” all the libraries. after that, none of the document libraries will be listed in the pop-up window.</p>
<p>2. back up all the local documents &amp; files in your document libraries to another place.</p>
<p>3. after the backup work is done, remove the original documents &amp; files in your local onedrive for business folder.</p>
<p>4. cache clearing for onedrive for business.<br />
1) right click on the windows status bar, select start task manager, and get a list of running processes by clicking the “processes” tab.<br />
2) verify that none of the following processes are running:<br />
groove.exe (microsoft onedrive for business)<br />
msosync.exe<br />
msouc.exe<br />
winword.exe<br />
excel.exe<br />
powerpnt.exe<br />
microsoft office upload center</p>
<p>3) close all the applications you are running in your system.<br />
4) if any of the above processes are running, stop the process by right-clicking it and selecting end process.<br />
5) give yourself an administrator role as follows:<br />
click the start button and type cmd in the search bar. when cmd.exe appears in the results, right-click it and select run as administrator.<br />
6) at the command prompt, delete the office file cache and spw folders by issuing four commands as follows:<br />
type “cd %userprofile%\appdata\local\microsoft\office\16.0\” and then press the enter key.<br />
type “rmdir officefilecache /s” and then press the enter key. type y and press enter key<br />
type “cd %userprofile%\appdata\local\microsoft\office\” and then press the enter key.<br />
type “rmdir spw /s” and then press the enter key. type y and press enter key.</p>
<p>7) if you get an error when executing either rmdir command, one of the .exe processes is probably still running. correct the problem by returning to the task manager (step 2), stopping the processes, and then removing the directories as described previously.<br />

<p>Hi Manuel,</p>
<p>You can try following steps to make One drive for business icon show in the task bar:<br />
a. Try to right-click your OneDrive for Business library under<strong> Favorites</strong> or in the disk where you sync them to.
<br />
b. Choose<strong> Pin to Start</strong><br />

<p>HiEchoHU,</p>
<p>Yesterday I uninstalled completely Office 16. After rebooting I deleted the cache following your steps. Then I rebooted back again and reinstalled Office 16, and the error is still there.</p>
<p>But I found strange than when I reinstalled I had the same layout, `preferences and configurations intact.</p>
<p>I don’t know what else to do.</p>
<p>I’d just ask you a link for downloading version 13 so I can downgrade.</p>

<h2>            Replay animation and narration when returning to a slide</h2>
                    I have a ppt set up as a pps.&nbsp; When the user returns to a slide that they have already viewed, I'd like the narration and animation to start from the beginning for that slide (re-play).&nbsp; How do I set this up?

<p>Insert a new blank slide just prior to the slide with animation and set it to transition automatically to the following slide (the one with your animation).</p>
<p>Then set the link the previously returned to your slide with animation to go to the one just before it.</p>
<p>Sounds wacko, I know.&nbsp; But it works.</p>

    <title>I Want to Set the Headings View as the Default in the Word 365 ProPlus - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> airspeed222  say:</h3>
<h2>            I Want to Set the Headings View as the Default in the Word 365 ProPlus Navigation Pane</h2>
                    <p>When I open Word (Office 365 ProPlus, current, Windows 10 Pro, current), the Navigation Pane defaults to the Pages View. Even if I previously saved a file while displaying the Headings View, Word then opens momentarily in Headings View and instantly changes
 back to Pages View. So annoying!<br />
<br />
This is especially frustrating because I am an author. When working on a novel (typically over 300 pages long) I absolutely do not want to wade through icons of 300+ pages to "navigate." What I want to see to navigate through a novel is a defacto Table of Contents;
 Headings View is a listing of my 50+ chapters as well as the Preface, Dedication, After Word, etc., which is exactly what I want. Instead, I am forced to reset the Navigation Pane back to my preferred Headings View every time I open a document (I have many
 open when writing). And I watch every one switch from Headings View back to Page View automatically. This anti-productivity feature is getting very old!&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Online searches reveal only strange, archaic key combinations to open the Navigation Pane, nothing to set the View default. I'd even be willing to take a tip about a Registry edit to set this right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is Word doing what it wants and not what the user wants? Why would it automatically switch back to some preset default, instead of staying where it was on last use? Why is there no way to set the default?<br />
<br />
Help!</p>

<p>Hi Airspeed222,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm very sorry for the inconveniences this behavior has caused. Based on my test of version
<strong>1808</strong> (Build <strong>10730.20348</strong>),&nbsp; version <strong>1905</strong> (Build
<strong>11629.20246</strong>) and version <strong>1906</strong> (Build <strong>11727.20188</strong>) the Headings view is the default view of the Navigation panel. Even if I switch to the Pages view and save the document, the Navigation panel is still in the
 Headings view when I reopen the document or any other documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the Heading view is set as default on these builds, I'd suggest that you may go to
<strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Account</strong> and check if your Word application is updated to one these latest versions and builds. If not, you may click
<strong>Update Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Update Now</strong> to install the latest update and see if this would change the behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you have any further concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Nathan</p>

            Thanks for your reply, Nathan.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I'm one of those update dorks who repeatedly checks to be sure everything is always up-to-date. (I did also state that my Office 365 ProPlus and Windows 10 Pro were current in my original post.)<br />
<br />
Intel Rapid Storage Technology software for my RAID arrays, iTunes software, Norton Internet Security, Windows updates, nVidia drivers (I could go on), it all gets updated very frequently.&nbsp;My main machine triple-boots Windows 7 Ultimate/Windows 10 Pro/Windows
 10 Pro Insider Preview, I run iOS 13 beta on my iPhone, MacOS Catalina beta on my MacBook Pro...all of it up-to-date.&nbsp;I build all of my own desktop computers, I've wired and installed all of my own home Ethernet networks, I've installed aftermarket firmware
 (DDWRT) and configured it all on my Wi-Fi hardware...and all of that stays updated, too!<br />
<br />
But I can't seem to lick this Word issue.<br />
<br />
You ask below if there's anything else you could do to assist. I did suggest I would be willing to try a registry change, but wouldn't know where to start. Any ideas? Also, short of a programming change, it seems I might just be stuck. A shame, Word is typically
 not known to be short on user configurable custom settings. I participate in the Insider Preview program, maybe this sort of feedback could lead to a change here, too. That's definitely what it's about, right?<br />

<blockquote>But I can't seem to lick this Word issue.<br />
<br />
You ask below if there's anything else you could do to assist. I did suggest I would be willing to try a registry change, but wouldn't know where to start. Any ideas? Also, short of a programming change, it seems I might just be stuck. A shame, Word is typically
 not known to be short on user configurable custom settings. I participate in the Insider Preview program, maybe this sort of feedback could lead to a change here, too. That's definitely what it's about, right?<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, this is the sort of suggestion that 'feedback' is designed to collect.&nbsp; You should submit the suggestion there, it won't do any good here.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, the Nav pane / Document Map has been around for several versions without the command. I doubt MS will bother adding it now. But it doesn't hurt to ask.</p>

<p>Hi Airspeed222,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. If you have already updated to the builds that I mentioned, then this behavior may be related to something else, for example the add-ins. You may try going to File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; in "Manage", select "Word Add-ins" &gt; Go, then
 disable all the add-ins and see if the behavior still exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, to check if this is related to the user profile of your operating system, you may create a new user then sign in with this new account and see if the behavior would change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you use the Navigation Panel feature a lot, as a workaround, you may add the feature to the Quick Access Toolbar to make it easier to use:</p>
<p>1. Go to File &gt; Options &gt; Quick Access Toolbar &gt; switch "Popular Commands" to "All Commands";</p>
<p>2. Select "Navigation Pane" in the command list &gt; click Add &gt; OK.</p>
<p>After that, you will see the Navigation Pane button in the following position:</p>

<p>One more thing to try. Very old school. Long ago all changes to normal.dot had to be done this way.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Restart your computer</li><li>Find your normal.dotm template location</li><li>Copy the full path to the clipboard</li><li>close all other sessions of Word and Outlook, </li><li>go to the file open dialog</li><li>select "Template" as the file type</li><li>select normal.dotm</li><li>Open it for editing</li><li>set the navigation pane the way you want it</li><li>type a space and delete it (to force Word to save the changes)</li><li>close Word, saving the changes to the template.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Start Word normally.&nbsp; Does it work?&nbsp; If it does, restart the computer and start word to check it the setting is still correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it isn't, start Word using Run As admin.&nbsp; Repeat the steps above.</p>

<h2>            update index button grayed out</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi,
</span></p>

<p><span>I am working on a Word 2010 document and would like to update only the index, but the
<b>Update index</b> button is grayed out. </span></p>

<p><span>I can update the index by selecting the entire doc and pressing F9, but this updates everything - TOC and cross-references, fig numbers, etc. - which I don't want</span></p>

<p><span>Any insight as to what I need to change to make the button active is much appreciated!</span></p>

<p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community and we will be glad to assist you with your concern about updating index
 entries.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to ask a few questions, for more clarification on the issue:</span></p>
<p><span>1. How are the index entries inserted in the document?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Press Alt+f9 and check if the field codes are available for index entries.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The
<b>Update</b> <b>Index</b> option will be available only when you have placed the cursor on the index entries. If you have paced the cursor anywhere else in the document then the
<b>Update</b> <b>Index</b> option will be greyed out.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope the above suggestions help to resolve your issue. If you need any further assistance reply and we will be glad
 to assist you.</span></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Just&nbsp; a little suggestion, I am not sure wether it is going to work but rather give it a try. Did you try clear storage and reset your mobile again? And see if it gives the same error again or re installs well. Your problem seems like a wrong software installation
 that is why you are getting such bugs.</p>

                    <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Another day and another&nbsp;problem with&nbsp;Calendar app in Windows Phone 8.1. Namely, the app does not reflect correctly regional settings. I use English language and Polish regional
 settings. It is followed in all the app, but Calendar which still keeps displaying all appointment with AM/PM. Further when creating new one, again time selector uses AM/PM. It looks like the app is totally blind to the settings.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Do you have the same problem?</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't fully understood the issue. Do you mean that the Calendar is showing AM/PM instead of using the 24 hour clock format?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want the calendar to use the 24 hour clock format, please sign in to <a href="http://calendar.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>The time format on Outlook.com calendar does not affect Windows Phone calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hikari_PL, please check you have the latest version of the Calendar app. The initial version of the 8.1 Calendar app ignored regional settings, but the latest one respects the 24H time format setting. If you come to this thread on your phone, you can tap

            <p>Thanks for hint to update the app, but it seemed that I have the latest version already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to give you more feeling. This is calendar app (new appointment &gt; select date):</p>
<p><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=691F859C589B24F0&amp;resid=691F859C589B24F0%2130705&amp;authkey=AEjgRWewBGMioy8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=691F859C589B24F0&amp;resid=691F859C589B24F0%2130705&amp;authkey=AEjgRWewBGMioy8</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you see date starts from month which is very US approach. In Poland this would normally start with year or date, having month in the middle. So, regional settings are ignored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is interesting, when I go to tasks (something like "subapp" under Calendar), create new task, set a date and I have different situation:
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=691F859C589B24F0&amp;resid=691F859C589B24F0%2130706&amp;authkey=AAXqjND4Qy4IKik" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>1) Data selector correctly starts with year (in line with regional settings)</p>
<p>2) Months and day names are translated into Polish (I use US as my phone language)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, there is some awkward inconsistency here.</p>

            Yeah, when making a new event, I get the month/day/year thing too. AM/PM has been fixed me, which was much more important personally. Here's hoping the date picker for new events will eventually respect the regional setting.<br />

            Actually the problem refers to whole calendar app (or rather calendar view), i.e. headings, date and time selectors, time display, etc. As this is a stand alone app now i hope that they will fix it soon.

            Hi - my Lumia was upgraded yesterday to 8.1, and I have the same problem with calendar showing AM/PM not 24-hour clock. My regional settings are set to 24-hour clock. I checked my calendar.live settings (it's actually under Options, not Settings) and I
 do have 24-hour clock set. So something is still wrong.

            <p>I have the same problem too. </p>
<p>It's just weird as it worked perfectly in WP8, but since the upgrade to WP8.1 it fails.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Dutch and English (US) language installed, but the Dutch regional settings are set.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Live tile, and lock screen show the time correctly. Only in App all times are shown using AM/PM and the timepicker for new events also shows AM/PM. So at some points the calendar App knows about the regional settings and at other points it doesn't.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would figure it would work for the entire App or correctly or incorrectly, but not a little bit of both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to bash Microsoft or Windows Phone, but it seems to be the trend of a lot of things Microsoft is delivering into production these days.&nbsp;It is just not done, and the quality is shamefully low. There will come a point people will no longer accept
 this and go look for alternatives.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem with the calendar app in Windows 8.1. Regional formats are ignored. Coincidently, an update for the mail, calendar and people app became available just as I read this thread(!) which somehow fixed the problem in Windows 8.1. I say
 somehow because the fix also changed the display language from English to my local language. I prefer English as the display language because much of the translation work is quite bad. I also have a hunch that new versions and updates become available first
 in their English version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it's the display language setting that's ignored, not the regional formats setting... On the surface of things, this seems like unnecessarily poor development from a company of Microsoft's size and experience.</p>

<p>Where did you purchase the AD Premium P1 license? Have you assigned the license to the user?
</p>
<p>Please share with us a related screenshot. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, to enable users to reset their Azure AD passwords, we need to configure password reset policy and add contact data for the test user. Please refer to this article for detailed information:

    <title>Error when using Accounting format in Excel - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Error when using Accounting format in Excel</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm from Denmark and have a very annoying issue when using the format Accounting in Excel 365 for formatting cells. The Danish currency symbol kr. is supposed to be aligned on the left in cells formatted with Accounting and the amount aligned on the right
 in the cells. This works fine with $ and other currencies, but when choosing kr. or some other currencies (have checked many), it goes wrong. This used to work correctly in older versions of Excel, but on my two Windows 10 machines with Office 365 it doesn't
 work correctly. On my wifes Windows 7 machine with Office 365 it does work as supposed. How do I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Correct (from my wifes PC):</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dc87aae6-666c-4ff9-b562-f5351f937e5a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dc87aae6-666c-4ff9-b562-f5351f937e5a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Incorrect (from my PCs):</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1111d57d-6a15-491a-a07c-1583aae7e482?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1111d57d-6a15-491a-a07c-1583aae7e482?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>Also works correctly in Excel 2010.&nbsp; Try entering the following Custom format:</p>
<p>
</p><p>_ [$kr.-406] * #,##0.00_ ;_ [$kr.-406] * -#,##0.00_ ;_ [$kr.-406] * "-"??_ ;_ @_

<p>
</p><p>I formatted as Accounting with Danish currency (kr), then clicked on Accounting to see how it was defined.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same procedure should work on your wife's computer with Excel 2007.&nbsp; You might prefer to rely on the Custom format on your wife's computer, just in case there is something different between your (Danish) Excel and my (US) Excel.</p>

    <title>My personal laundry list for the N8. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> st_halcyon  say:</h3>
<h2>            My personal laundry list for the N8.</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Notably, the bugs I have experienced thus far are:</strong><br />
<br />
1. Inability for Wi-Fi to connect in Offline mode if you have previously gone to Offline mode and said No when activating an app that requires data connection.<br />
<br />
2. When you turn on the phone without a SIM card, then hit the Call button, it will stay in an infinite loop in the Dialer screen.&nbsp; It'll ask you to please insert a sim card, followed by either OK or Cancel.&nbsp; So after you insert the SIM card, you hit OK, then
 it repeats the question.&nbsp; If you hit Cancel, it repeats the question.&nbsp; You can't get out of this infinite cycle other than turning the N8 off.<br />
<br />
3. After a hard reset of your phone, the Ovi Social app is missing the widget for the home screen.&nbsp; Yes, you can go to the Nokia Messaging OTA site to get the update, but after 2 hard resets, the installation of the update gives me a "Unable to install" error.&nbsp;
 Which is a joke, because after the first hard reset it worked wonderfully.&nbsp; And it never worked for me subsequently.<br />
<br />
4. Even after defining a WLAN destination, if you don't have a SIM card, you can't configure any mail other Mail for Exchange.&nbsp; Yes, the new Mail app tries to use mail routed through Nokia, but at least give me the option to create mailboxes using old traditional
 direct IMAP or POP3.<br />
<br />
5. With my N95 and N97, as soon as I turn on my car (equipped with Nokia CK-100), I automatically get connected to BT HFP and A2DP profiles.&nbsp; The car kit will tell me, "Phone connected."&nbsp; A second later, "Player connected."&nbsp; With the N8, the car kit will only
 connect to just the phone automatically.&nbsp; For the player to connect while the car is on, I have to open up the music player and play a music, which will force N8 to make the A2DP connection.&nbsp; So when that happens, you hear a 1.5 second message saying, "Player
 connected" followed by music that is already 2 to 3 seconds into the song.&nbsp; I thought it was perhaps the Car Kit getting full with the list of paired devices (memory is for 8 pairings), but clearing the list doesn't help.&nbsp; I thought it was the Car Kit firmware,
 so I upgraded it to 4.401, no luck.&nbsp; Then when I tried my old N97 and N95, it worked as expected!&nbsp; But not the N8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Sometimes after a hard reset, even when I respond with selecting my country/city and entering my time, the phone will start with the UK time zone instead.&nbsp; The UTC time is correct, but for the wrong time zone.&nbsp; Why does it do that?!?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. 60% of the time when I turn on the phone (even when it was Normal mode during the previous shut down), I do not get the classic Nokia tone when the iconic handshake video plays.&nbsp; This is your brand recognition!&nbsp; Something so valuable that it's impossible
 to put a dollar value on it.&nbsp; And you botch that up?!?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>List of the reduced functionalities:</strong><br />
<br />
1. In previous generations of Mail app, if an email contains what appears to be a phone number, Symbian will make it clickable so that you can call the number.&nbsp; Not so with Mail app in S^3.<br />
<br />
2. In previous versions of Messaging app, if I receive a SMS, I can either click on the call button (no longer exists in the N8) or Options &gt; Call to call the sender of the SMS automatically.&nbsp; Now, with S^3, the Call option is no longer in Options.&nbsp; Makes it
 really hard to call the SMS sender back while you're driving.<br />
<br />
3. In the previous generations of Mail app, I can call up the Listen option when I'm either in a Mailbox or have the email open, and it will read the email.&nbsp; Now, this functionality only exists on the Messaging app, not Mail app.<br />
<br />
4. If you open up the Message Reader app, it will be able to playback all your SMS, MMS, Mail mailbox's messages.&nbsp; Great, right?&nbsp; But in order to listen to an email, you must first go through all the SMS messages first before it will play back any emails.&nbsp;
 So if you have 20 SMSs, you have to click on the FFw button 20 times before you get to listen to your email.&nbsp; Truly a brilliant design, whoever came up with that.<br />
<br />
5. In the previous Symbian web browsers, when I hit the Back button, I can either go back/forward using the left/right gestures, and selecting a page by tapping the page.&nbsp; I also have the option of hitting the left or right arrows right above the soft keys
 and hitting Select (left soft key) or Cancel/Stop (right soft key).&nbsp; In the N8, everything but the Select key is there.&nbsp; Now it's replaced by a blank?!?&nbsp; If you want to force me to use gestures and taps, then at least do me a favor and remove the left/right
 arrows on the screen.&nbsp; (Surprisingly, if I invoke the web browser using the YouTube "app", the Select soft key appears during back/forward navigation.&nbsp; Hmmm...)<br />
<br />
<strong>List of improvement suggestions:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Whenever you're in a screen that has a tiny left/right arrow (such as reading an SMS message, or looking at your Messaging Inbox, allow me to swipe left or right to go to the previous/next message or folder.&nbsp; This functionality already exists in the Calendar
 app.&nbsp; So why stop there?&nbsp; Not only that, but extend it to Settings menu!&nbsp; Why should gestures be limited to up and down, except for the Calendar application that allows left/right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Allow landscape dialer, like the N97.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Uhm, what happened to the Converter application?&nbsp; It has been a staple of all Nokia phones, and suddenly it's missing from the flagship phone?&nbsp; Nokia's comeback phone?!?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. A much simpler VPN application?&nbsp; Look at what Apple did in just a little over a year.&nbsp; A simple process of logging into Cisco VPN.&nbsp; What's Nokia's way, after having VPN solution for years and years?&nbsp; Still a mess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Previously, connectivity settings were easier to get to with the N91, N95 and N97.&nbsp; Now, I have A) Menu &gt; Options &gt; Settings &gt; Connectivity &gt; Wi-Fi, and B) Menu &gt; Options &gt; Settings &gt; Connectivity &gt; Settings &gt; Switch to Wi-Fi?&nbsp; I can work around it as
 a power user.&nbsp; What about those people who make up the biggest market share of iPhone users who are not technologically savvy?&nbsp; And do you see the irony with Settings buried within Settings menu?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Port all functionalities of PC Suite to Ovi Suite, and fix all the bugs in Ovi Suite.&nbsp; The latest 3.0.0.271 still has bugs and missing functionalities.&nbsp; Open back up the dual code development pipelines (PC Suite and Ovi Suite) to the N8 until all core
 functionalites are successfully brought over to Ovi Suite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia, I hope this thread captures your attention within the developers and management.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. When you click on the notification area in the home screen (top right), and click on the battery icon and activate power saving mode, sometimes the N8 hangs or does not successfully get out of power saving mode when you do the same and click on Deactivate
 Power Saving Mode.</p>

<p>Nice (if sad) writeup.</p>
<p>It's really just the little, niggly details isn't it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a long-time NOK fan who is now 2 weeks into N8 ownership I hate to see this happen.</p>
<p>Particularly on the heels of the N97.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The device itself (N8) is a work of art.</p>
<p>But the software, frankly, is alpha-level at best.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can they fix it?</p>
<p>I like to think they can however I have to wonder if it will matter.</p>
<p>As is often said, you only get one chance to make a first impression.</p>
<p>It is already abundantly clear to me that S^3 should not have been allowed anywhere near the retail public in its current state.</p>

<p>Status update after installing PR 1.1 version 013.016 for product code 059DV2 on 2011.02.20, plus new bug reports after testing and using PR 1.1 extensively for 44 days.&nbsp; I thought I needed to put in this status update before installing PR 1.2, which became
 available on 2011.04.03 for my market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Inability for Wi-Fi to connect in Offline mode if you have previously gone to Offline mode and said No when activating an app that requires data connection.&nbsp;
<strong>Status as of PR 1.1:</strong>&nbsp; Semi-fixed.&nbsp; After installing PR 1.1, when you're in Offline mode and you use an App that required Internet connection and subsequently say No when asked if you want to allow WiFi in Offline mode, it will still prompt
 you later on.&nbsp; But this is semi-fixed because sometimes, when the N8 is in Offline mode and you try to access an app that needs Internet connection, the question "Allow Wi-Fi connections during this offline period?" doesn't even bother to prompt you, other
 than "Conn. Unavailable" in the upper left corner of the screen.&nbsp; What da?!?<br />
<br />
2. When you turn on the phone without a SIM card, then hit the Call button, it will stay in an infinite loop in the Dialer screen.&nbsp; It'll ask you to please insert a sim card, followed by either OK or Cancel.&nbsp; So after you insert the SIM card, you hit OK, then
 it repeats the question.&nbsp; If you hit Cancel, it repeats the question.&nbsp; You can't get out of this infinite cycle other than turning the N8 off.&nbsp;
<strong>Status as of PR 1.1:</strong>&nbsp; Fixed.<br />
<br />
3. After a hard reset of your phone, the Ovi Social app is missing the widget for the home screen.&nbsp; Yes, you can go to the Nokia Messaging OTA site to get the update, but after 2 hard resets, the installation of the update gives me a "Unable to install" error.&nbsp;
 Which is a joke, because after the first hard reset it worked wonderfully.&nbsp; And it never worked for me subsequently.&nbsp;
<strong>Status as of PR 1.1:&nbsp; </strong>Unknown.&nbsp; Have not tried to do a hard reset, but now that Social is on 1.3, I'm sure the installer file now includes the widget.&nbsp; But I also heard that the latest beta version of 1.3 (as of this writing) may require an
 uninstallation of older versions of Social first, otherwise it may fail.&nbsp; Other reports indicate Social no longer works after the update.&nbsp; Follow the discussion in betalabs.nokia.com for the Social 1.3 app.<br />
<br />
4. Even after defining a WLAN destination, if you don't have a SIM card, you can't configure any mail other Mail for Exchange.&nbsp; Yes, the new Mail app tries to use mail routed through Nokia, but at least give me the option to create mailboxes using old traditional
 direct IMAP or POP3.&nbsp; <strong>Status as of PR 1.1:&nbsp; </strong>Still unfixed.&nbsp; No SIM card, no ability to define a new mailbox other than Mail for Exchange.&nbsp; You absolutely must have SIM card.&nbsp; Why?!?<br />
<br />
5. With my N95 and N97, as soon as I turn on my car (equipped with Nokia CK-100), I automatically get connected to BT HFP and A2DP profiles.&nbsp; The car kit will tell me, "Phone connected."&nbsp; A second later, "Player connected."&nbsp; With the N8, the car kit will only
 connect to just the phone automatically.&nbsp; For the player to connect while the car is on, I have to open up the music player and play a music, which will force N8 to make the A2DP connection.&nbsp; So when that happens, you hear a 1.5 second message saying, "Player
 connected" followed by music that is already 2 to 3 seconds into the song.&nbsp; I thought it was perhaps the Car Kit getting full with the list of paired devices (memory is for 8 pairings), but clearing the list doesn't help.&nbsp; I thought it was the Car Kit firmware,
 so I upgraded it to 4.401, no luck.&nbsp; Then when I tried my old N97 and N95, it worked as expected!&nbsp; But not the N8.&nbsp;
<strong>Status as of PR 1.1:</strong>&nbsp; Still broken.&nbsp; I won't be able to test this out with PR 1.2, since I ripped out Nokia CK-100 and installed CK-600.&nbsp; I've never used the N97 with CK-600, so I don't know if the A2DP connection is automatic or not, but with
 N8 PR 1.1 and either CK-100 or CK-600, the A2DP connection is still NOT automatic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Sometimes after a hard reset, even when I respond with selecting my country/city and entering my time, the phone will start with the UK time zone instead.&nbsp; The UTC time is correct, but for the wrong time zone.&nbsp; Why does it do that?!?&nbsp;
<strong>Status as of PR 1.1:</strong>&nbsp; Unknown.&nbsp; I've only done 1 hard reset since upgrading to PR 1.1, and it didn't misbehave.&nbsp; But during PR 1.0, the behavior wasn't constant, but half the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. 60% of the time when I turn on the phone (even when it was Normal mode during the previous shut down), I do not get the classic Nokia tone when the iconic handshake video plays.&nbsp; This is your brand recognition!&nbsp; Something so valuable that it's impossible
 to put a dollar value on it.&nbsp; And you botch that up?!?&nbsp; <strong>Status as of PR 1.1:</strong>&nbsp; Still a problem.&nbsp; Now, it seems like 90% of the time when I turn on the N8, the Nokia tone doesn't play during the hand shake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8. [New bug in PR 1.1] Light time-out:&nbsp; </strong>I never had a problem with this in N8 PR 1.0, but only started noticing this in PR 1.1.&nbsp; When you have a browser up and running, and you leave the N8 alone, like no movement or screen activity such
 as leaving it on a table, the screen doesn't black out after the allotted time setting in Settings &gt; Phone &gt; Display &gt; Light time-out.&nbsp; It will go dim, but the screensaver never kicks in.&nbsp; This happens 75% of the time, and is quite annoying.&nbsp; This behavior
 seems to manifest itself when you're in an app that requires Internet connection, such as the browser or email application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>9. [New bug in PR 1.1 or possibly in PR 1.0 as well] Apps dependent on operator even on unlocked and unsubsidized Nokia phones:&nbsp;
</strong>I am not sure if this is a new problem with PR 1.1 or existed in PR 1.0, but it appears that some apps like Social, Email and Ovi Maps are dependent on operator permissions, even if the device is unsubsidized and purchased unlocked.&nbsp; I don't know if
 this is a problem with PR 1.0 because when I traveled from 2011.02.25 to 2011.03.10, I already upgraded my N8 to PR 1.1.&nbsp; But basically, after I popped in a pre-paid SIM card at another country, starting Social and trying to log in will tell me something along
 the lines of checking with the operator and then telling me I cannot use Social.&nbsp; (I traveled to China.)&nbsp; But I could kind of work around it by exiting, then tapping the Social widget.&nbsp; Sometimes hitting refresh will somehow allow me to get Facebook updates
 in China, and sometimes it will tell me Service Unavailable.&nbsp; Likewise with Ovi Maps.&nbsp; When I was back home in the USA, I had many other online services, like Time Out, Lonely Planet, Trip Advisor, etc.&nbsp; But once I popped in a Chinese SIM card and go online
 with the operator (3G or Edge), all my online services disappeared, and replaced with Chinese services which was totally useless as my USA N8 cannot render Chinese characters.&nbsp; Mind you, I did not connect to 3G or Edge for a few days, so during those few days
 when I was just using WiFi, I was still able to look up things in English in Trip Advisor, such as nearby restaurants or hotels.&nbsp; But as soon as I connected online via SIM operator network, features started disappearing.&nbsp; Same with email behavior.&nbsp; No SIM
 inserted, can't configure new email mailboxes.&nbsp; No SIM card, Social displays "Service is not available" even if I have WiFi AP connected.&nbsp; The important question here is, why are unlocked and unsubsidized S^3 phones even checking with the operator if I can
 run whatever services?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>List of the reduced functionalities:</strong><br />
<br />
1. In previous generations of Mail app, if an email contains what appears to be a phone number, Symbian will make it clickable so that you can call the number.&nbsp; Not so with Mail app in S^3.&nbsp;

 really hard to call the SMS sender back while you're driving.&nbsp; <strong>Status as of PR 1.1:&nbsp;
</strong>Still a problem.<br />
<br />
3. In the previous generations of Mail app, I can call up the Listen option when I'm either in a Mailbox or have the email open, and it will read the email.&nbsp; Now, this functionality only exists on the Messaging app, not Mail app.&nbsp;
<strong>Status as of PR 1.1:&nbsp; </strong>Still a problem.<br />
<br />

 So if you have 20 SMSs, you have to click on the FFw button 20 times before you get to listen to your email.&nbsp; Truly a brilliant design, whoever came up with that.&nbsp;
<strong>Status as of PR 1.1:&nbsp; </strong>Still a problem.<br />

5. In the previous Symbian web browsers, when I hit the Back button, I can either go back/forward using the left/right gestures, and selecting a page by tapping the page.&nbsp; I also have the option of hitting the left or right arrows right above the soft keys
 and hitting Select (left soft key) or Cancel/Stop (right soft key).&nbsp; In the N8, everything but the Select key is there.&nbsp; Now it's replaced by a blank?!?&nbsp; If you want to force me to use gestures and taps, then at least do me a favor and remove the left/right
 arrows on the screen.&nbsp; (Surprisingly, if I invoke the web browser using the YouTube "app", the Select soft key appears during back/forward navigation.&nbsp; Hmmm...)&nbsp;
<strong>Status as of PR 1.1:&nbsp; </strong>Still a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6. [New reduction of functionality in PR 1.1] This is truly a new one for Nokia - Breathing Light Notification:&nbsp;
</strong>In the N8 PR 1.1, when you go to Settings &gt; Phone &gt; Notification lights &gt; Notification light &gt; Events notified, you can now enable/disable 2 events:&nbsp; "Missed call" and "New message".&nbsp; But in PR 1.0, you had a third choice:&nbsp; "New email".&nbsp; Uhm...&nbsp; **bleep**?!?&nbsp;
 Why would Nokia remove a notification event type?!?&nbsp; Is the business justification that nobody cared enough about the breathing light that having some extra lines of code for notification of new emails would be a waste of precious firmware C:\ drive space?!?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7. No ability to specify which drive to use for Mailbox repository:</strong>&nbsp; In the previous iterations of Symbian, I could tell the mailbox which drive to use, the C:\ drive or the mass storage or even the memory card.&nbsp; Now, that flexibility is
 gone.&nbsp; Why is this a problem?&nbsp; Recently, I was sending a bunch of emails with big attachments, and suddenly, I was notified that C: drive was running out of memory!&nbsp; What do you know?&nbsp; The Sent mail is stored in C:\ drive!&nbsp; That's real smart, considering real
 estate in C:\ drive is already little to begin with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>List of improvement suggestions:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Whenever you're in a screen that has a tiny left/right arrow (such as reading an SMS message, or looking at your Messaging Inbox, allow me to swipe left or right to go to the previous/next message or folder.&nbsp; This functionality already exists in the Calendar
 app.&nbsp; So why stop there?&nbsp; Not only that, but extend it to Settings menu!&nbsp; Why should gestures be limited to up and down, except for the Calendar application that allows left/right?&nbsp;
<strong>Status as of PR 1.1:&nbsp; </strong>Nokia is still ignoring me on this one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Allow landscape dialer, like the N97.&nbsp; <strong>Status as of PR 1.1:</strong>&nbsp; Added!&nbsp; Kudos!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Uhm, what happened to the Converter application?&nbsp; It has been a staple of all Nokia phones, and suddenly it's missing from the flagship phone?&nbsp; Nokia's comeback phone?!?&nbsp;
<strong>Status as of PR 1.1:&nbsp; </strong>Nokia is still ignoring me on this one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. A much simpler VPN application?&nbsp; Look at what Apple did in just a little over a year.&nbsp; A simple process of logging into Cisco VPN.&nbsp; What's Nokia's way, after having VPN solution for years and years?&nbsp; Still a mess.&nbsp;
<strong>Status as of PR 1.1:&nbsp; </strong>Nokia is still ignoring me on this one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Previously, connectivity settings were easier to get to with the N91, N95 and N97.&nbsp; Now, I have A) Menu &gt; Options &gt; Settings &gt; Connectivity &gt; Wi-Fi, and B) Menu &gt; Options &gt; Settings &gt; Connectivity &gt; Settings &gt; Switch to Wi-Fi?&nbsp; I can work around it as
 a power user.&nbsp; What about those people who make up the biggest market share of iPhone users who are not technologically savvy?&nbsp; And do you see the irony with Settings buried within Settings menu?&nbsp;
<strong>Status as of PR 1.1:&nbsp; </strong>Nokia is still ignoring me on this one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Port all functionalities of PC Suite to Ovi Suite, and fix all the bugs in Ovi Suite.&nbsp; The latest 3.0.0.271 still has bugs and missing functionalities.&nbsp; Open back up the dual code development pipelines (PC Suite and Ovi Suite) to the N8 until all core
 functionalites are successfully brought over to Ovi Suite.&nbsp; <strong>Status as of PR 1.1:&nbsp;
</strong>Technically this isn't a problem with the firmware on the N8 but rather a problem with PC Suite in disallowing N8 connectivity.&nbsp; Anybody wants to give me an update on the latest version of PC Suite 7.1.5X.X?&nbsp; Since the Nokia "Download software" support
 site no longer has a link to PC Suite but just Ovi Suite, I suspect PC Suite will never be opened up for N8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia, I hope this thread captures your attention within the developers and management.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p>The dumbing down of Nokia phones and software (esp OviSuite) reminds me of the strategic errors Mercedes Benz made with their cars about a decade ago. MB car development had been "engineering lead" for decades with great succes. Then suddenly some knobby
 management consultants came in and advised them to change to a marketing led development strategy. The quality of their cars fell accordingly, and their customer base deserted them for other marques with better engineering. They realised their mistake after
 about five years....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia seems to be following the same strategy since they appointed that ex Microsoft muppet as CEO. Suddenly they have started dumbing down their phones and software so that iPhone users can understand them.</p>

<p>I don't understand what the Nokia board sees in Elop.&nbsp; I mean, what is the measurement of success that is set upon Elop?&nbsp; If you recall, Elop was in charge at Microsoft for working with Nokia to bring Office suite of productivty to Symbian.&nbsp; That announcement
 was almost 2 years ago.&nbsp; Nothing came out of it at the end, just like the supposed close joint development of Skype and Symbian during the hyped N97 prelaunch, which never materialized for over a year after N97 got released.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mean, if Elop could not even deliver on Symbian versions of Office productivity apps, how the heck did Nokia board have the confidence that Elop can deliver on turning things around?&nbsp; Instead of cutting red tape and fixing bad corporate culture with indecisiveness
 (such as competing Symbian development strategies instead of a unified one) and unwilling to take risks in new and emerging technology (such as touchscreen technology), he decided to simply get rid of Symbian which was definitely salvageable with right leadership
 and go the route of WinMo.&nbsp; Doesn't make sense to me...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your <em>2. In previous versions of Messaging app, if I receive a SMS, I can either click on the call button (no longer exists in the N8) or Options &gt; Call to call the sender of the SMS automatically.&nbsp; Now, with S^3, the Call option is no longer in Options.&nbsp;
 Makes it really hard to call the SMS sender back while you're driving.&nbsp; <strong>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following&nbsp;in PR1.2 - I think it was the same with earlier versions but cannot recall for sure as 99.9% of the time I respond with sms not call. In the received message the senders name is underlined (as if it were a link) - if you touch that (which is
 not a big target to hit if driving) the Call button comes up and that gives the option to Voice Call or Video Call the sender. For those of us who don't bother with video calls it does mean&nbsp;a redundant choice though.<em><br />

<p>Thanks for letting me know about the bootup tone always working for you.&nbsp; I wonder why this has been a problem for two of my N8's, second one being a replacement Amazon sent me to replace the first one.&nbsp; I suspected that it may have something to do with
 my installing fring app, which always wanted to start up at boot time, but my first N8 didn't have fring installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to the ability to call SMS sender, I should've clarified that that only works when you are in Conversations mode.&nbsp; In Inbox mode, you can't call sender.&nbsp; Kind of a pain in the butt.&nbsp; But as to hyperlinked number in text messages being clickable, yeah,
 that's nice, but that functionality doesn't work in Email anymore.&nbsp; It used to, but not in Email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's like Nokia engineers are working in silos.&nbsp; They don't understand the good features in previous versions to port over to the new one.&nbsp; Or, they are simply lazy.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; It's frustrating for end users like ourselves.</p>

<h2>            Using the Recovery Image folder</h2>
                    <p>So here's my scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded from Windows 8.1 with most recent update to the WTP build 9926. Though it's not on my main machine I have a lot of games that I'll have re download if I do a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When my Windows 10 TP boots up in no longer shows the option to roll back to windows 8.1. I do still have the C:\RecoveryImage that was created untouched. Without burning to a DVD how can I use that recovery image folder to go back to Windows 8.1 and then
 reinstall WTP10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            If the issue persists let's try the "Change the power management" solution:
<br />
<br />"1) Right-click your WiFi icon at the bottom right corner of your PC desktop and click Open Network and Sharing Center. 
<br />2) Click Change adapter settings. 
<br />3) Right-click your WiFi adapter and click Properties. 
<br />4) Click Configure. 
<br />5) Go to the Power Management tab. Untick the box for Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power. Click OK"

<p>Hi, the message you sent me today, on how to fix the problem is the same as the last one you sent me..On that one &nbsp;I got as far as step 4 but couldnt &nbsp;find &nbsp;step 5 on the list, as I tried to come out of the page i got different pages &nbsp;flashing up on the
 screen telling me something had gone wrong , i could not delete it screen kept flashing..when i checked my antivirus, Bt Mc Afee, it said a suspicous website &nbsp;had been detected, then i turned off my laptop, when i tried putting it back on at that point &nbsp;i
 just had a blank screen... i rebooted, and was told it was updating, and is ok now..have still got the problem now and then going offline. but am very hesitent to try that proceedure again incase the same thing happens, think i may have to put up with it going
 off line now and then..Hope you can understand what i am talking about.&nbsp;</p>

            I understand Mr. Son, Just in case, the step (5) if the current way doesn't apply we can go into your RegEdit and disable ConnectedStandby (cS).

<h2>            Education edition of 365-can admins see my files&#47;what I&#39;m doing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So Microsoft is now giving away free Office 365 accounts to Faculty/Staff/Students at Universities, which is awesome!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is probably a dumb question, but...&nbsp; Is it possible for admins or others at my school to see what I'm doing when I use Office on my own PC?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like they can see the OneDrive account associated with the account I set up, but I'm not actually using that account, I'm continuing to sign in with my personal Microsoft account I was already using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Admins at my school can apparently choose whether we get updates to Office fast or slow (we're on slow, so we don't get Office 2016 until next year, I guess), so I'm just kind of worried-what else can they do?&nbsp; By using this, I'm not somehow letting anyone
 else "see" what's on my PC, or what I'm typing in Word, or what's on my *personal* OneDrive account, right?&nbsp; They can only "see" what's in the OneDrive account associated with the account I set up with my university's email? (Which I'm not actually using right
 now.)</p>

            <p>As far as I know, the administrators cannot read the files in your OneDrive or on your hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2013/365 introduced a tool called "Telemetry" for administrators.&nbsp; It does monitor some things, but apparently not document content.</p>
<p>

Hopefully uninstalling it will get rid of any connection there, and hopefully my personal Microsoft account isn't somehow associated now with this one I set up for my school :-/</p>

            <p>If you have installed a corporate/education license AND log in with their email account then definitely they can use telemetry to track the info listed previously.&nbsp; If you log in with another ID, I have no idea how much they can track.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, uninstalling will remove the telemetry. It should be contained within the 365 CTR.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your "personal" account as been associated with 365 Education, then my GUESS would be that their telemetry would apply to that ID.&nbsp; I don't KNOW for sure.

            <p>I'm just wondering. If you associated your "personal" account with 365 Education, then I'm guessing they have some sort of implied access to it. But that is just speculation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And don't forget, there is a very good chance that you school isn't even aware of the telemetry fucntion, let alone actively using it ...&nbsp; (lots of "great new features" that no one knows about or uses ... ).</p>

            <p>I had to&nbsp; create a new account with my school email address and a new password, so I'm not entirely sure if they're connected or not.&nbsp; On one Office page it lets me sign into one or the other by choosing like "personal" or "business/University" from a drop
 down, sooo...</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yeah, I'm almost certain my school's NOT doing anything with this right now, as they went with Google stuff and no one seems to be the admin, but still, I don't want to have to worry about what file names I'm using or the like, whether they might have
 personal information.</p>
