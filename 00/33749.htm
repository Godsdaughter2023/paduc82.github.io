<h2>            Urgent&#58; not receiving incoming calls</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I work with a company where my job is calling clients. I've never had problems calling people, but if they call me, the call goes straight to another person.&nbsp;<br />
I need those calls.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please, contact me to *****</p>

                    <p>I have windows Microsoft Edge , suddenly I am printing blank sheets.&nbsp; I&nbsp;found and used the old outlook program&nbsp; with no problems. I have tried system restore and&nbsp;&nbsp; scannow with no success. I have re-down loaded the printer and trouble shooting says there
 is&nbsp;no problem&nbsp;Can you give me suggestions. Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why you are experiencing this problem and that's what we are going to figure out. This type of issue normally happens when there's a hardware failure or software change made on the computer prior to this concern. Before we proceed
 with the troubleshooting steps, we would like to know more about this concern. Kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you make any changes on the computer prior to this concern?</li><li>Is this the first time that you encountered this concern?</li><li>Have you tried using a different printer? If so, did you experience the same issue?</li></ul>

            In reply to your questions. Yes I have made changes recently, I down loaded the Microsoft Creator Upgrade after which I had a corrupted program, I tried the usual cleaning process and uninstalling without success. System restore&nbsp;was unhelpful. I then used
 the Microsoft install/uninstall program which succeeded eventually. During this process I uninstalled the creator upgrade and returned to the previous program.&nbsp; This is the first time I have encountered this problem and would point out that I am not a youngster.
 As regards the printing this was at first quite confusing&nbsp;in that it printed some and not others. I completely reloaded the printing program and all the testing indicated that the printer was healthy. At this point I tried the outlook program and the printing
 was fine as was&nbsp;also printing PDF documents.&nbsp; All I have if try printing through the Microsoft Edge program is a blank sheet of paper which is shown to be blank on the printer program. I hope this helps cl

            I have purchased a new printer for the testing phase. It behaves&nbsp;&nbsp;exactly as my first printer&nbsp;.a) the&nbsp;printer program shows a blank page and prints a blank page using Microsoft Edge. During the setting up phase of my second printer I noticed the words
 "internet explorer" appeared on the screen. If I engage the internet explored program I appear to print without any problems.&nbsp;

<h2>            Chkdsk can&#39;t run because &#34;there is no direct access to the volume&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>I can't run my disk defragmenter because it says chkdsk is scheduled to run! I ran chkdsk /f and chkdsk /r, it asked me if i wanted to schedule a disk check the next time I restarted, I said Y. Then when I restarted it said disk check couldn't get direct
 access to the drive and stopped. I then tried running chkdsk /c which gave warning messages and said it was running on read-only mode, so I understood I had run a wrong command. Then I changed my registry at "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Control/Session
 Manager/Boot Execute" from "autocheck autochk /p \??\C: autocheck autochk *" to "autocheck autochk /r \??\C: autocheck autochk *" which still didn't work!</p>
<p>What should I do? I don't have my Windows XP Installation Disc (Don't know what happened to it), and I also don't have any space to backup my hard disk, except an 8 GB USB Drive and a 4 GB on-line space provided by Norton.</p>
<p>My System Specs:</p>
<p>MS Windows XP Professional SP3</p>
<p>Intel Core2 CPU T5600 @ 1.83Ghz, 1.0 GB RAM, NVIDIA Geforce Go 7400\</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Remove the pending manual check disk in the in the BootExecute section of registry by entering the following command from a Command Prompt window:<br />
<br />
chkntfs /d<br />
<br />
Then look at your registry again and verify that all you see in HKLM\SYSTEM\CURRENTCONTROLSET\CONTROL\Session reads like this:<br />
<br />
autocheck autochk *<br />
<br />
That is the default value.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
That means that XP will automatically check the dirty bit on all volumes and will run check disk on any dirty volumes on the next reboot, so reboot.</p>
<p>If you are really low on disk space, the check disk will not run until you free up some space for it to work.</p>
<p>You need about 15% free space on the volume for check disk to run.&nbsp; Do you have at least 15% free space on the troublesome volume?</p>
<p>You will have a chance to skip the check disk as Windows is starting, but if you choose to skip the check disk on reboot, that will not clear the dirty bit.&nbsp; The only thing that can clear the dirty bit is a check disk with error correction.</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find.&nbsp; It may take a long time to complete or appear to be 'stuck'.&nbsp; Be patient.&nbsp; If the HDD light is still flashing, it is doing something.&nbsp; Keep an eye on the percentage amount to be sure it is still
 making progress.&nbsp; It may even appear to go backwards sometimes.<br />
<br />
When chkdsk runs automatically on a reboot, the results are shown in the Event Viewer Application log.&nbsp; You need to look there after check disk has run and XP has finished loading for the results and for any problems. If it looks like nothing happened, look
 at the report in the Event Viewer Application log.<br />
<br />
To see the Event Viewer logs, click Start, Settings, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
A shortcut to Event Viewer is to click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
%SystemRoot%\system32\eventvwr.msc<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
Look in the Application log for an event sourced by Winlogon, something like (yours may be different):<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winlogon<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1001<br />
Description:<br />
Checking file system on C:<br />
The type of the file system is NTFS.<br />
<br />
<br />
One of your disks needs to be checked for consistency. You<br />
may cancel the disk check, but it is strongly recommended<br />
that you continue.<br />
Windows will now check the disk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

Windows has finished checking your disk.<br />
Please wait while your computer restarts.<br />
<br />
If the error correction is successful, the dirty bit will be cleared, so check the dirty bit again from the Command Prompt like you did before and see what it says.&nbsp; The volume is dirty or it is not dirty.<br />
<br />
If the check disk on reboot did not clear the dirty bit, you should reboot again and check the log and check the dirty bit again until the volume is not dirty.<br />
<br />
If the automatic check disk on reboot will not clear the dirty bit, I would run the check disk manually by booting into the XP Recovery Console using a CD that you can make, then you can better see what is happening and decide what to do.<br />
<br />
If your dirty bit will not clear, you could have a problem with your hard disk and consider replacing it.&nbsp; If you don't want to replace the drive you can tell XP to never check the dirty bit on the volume again, but that is risky behavior.<br />
<br />
If you do not have a bootable XP Recovery Console CD to run the check disk manually, you can make one (no XP media required).&nbsp; You would probably like to have one anyway if you have no bootable CDs, so we can make on later if you want.</p>

<p>I removed the pending manual check, and saw that the registry value for boot check was autocheck autochk *. I also checked and verified that the volume c was dirty. It still gives a message saying: "Can not get direct access to the volume C" when I schedule
 a manual check. I don't know why it doesn't attempt to check at reboot, even though I have 69% free disk space.</p>

<p>That's good.</p>
<p>What happened after cleaning up the registry, seeing the drive was dirty and then rebooting to let the built in check disk run automatically?</p>
<p>When you reboot, and the XP progress bar in the bottom of the screen goes from left to right a few times, then you should see the automatic check disk kick in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you see when reboot? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you see the message you&nbsp;describe: &nbsp;Can not get direst&nbsp;access&nbsp;to the volume C" or does it really say "Cannot Open Volume for Direct Access". &nbsp;</p>
<p>Does it just look like XP doesn't even try to check the volume?</p>
<p>Do you see any winlogon type events in the Event Viewer after this reboot where the&nbsp;automatic&nbsp;check disk should be starting? &nbsp;If there is a report from the automatic check disk attempt, we need to know what it says.</p>
<p>Why are you trying to schedule a manually check at this time when you know the volume is dirty and you know that only a check disk is able to clear the dirty bit? &nbsp;Don't try to schedule anything manually until the dirty bit gets cleared. &nbsp;Let's figure this
 part out first :). &nbsp;You need to let XP try to straighten things out (if it can) before you start&nbsp;scheduling your manual checks so we don't get mixed up.</p>
<p>Sometimes third party softwares that include disk monitoring tools or disk protection tools will&nbsp;interfere&nbsp;with the XP check disk operations. &nbsp;Example would be Diskeeper, ZoneAlarm, Spyware Doctor, Auslogics). &nbsp;Is any of that sort of thing installed?</p>
<p>Do you now of have you ever had any third part disk defragmenter or disk&nbsp;optimizing&nbsp;softwares installed or have you just always use the built in XP tools?</p>
<p>Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation: &nbsp;McAfee, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you ever used any third party applications on your system where the product description includes such descriptive phrases as:</p>
<p>cleaner, mechanic, detective, doctor, cure, optimize, clean up, tune up, speed up, fix up, compact, compress, faster, power, boost, booster, guaranteed.</p>

<p>Automatic check disk doesn't kick in after the XP progress bar movement, and the OS reboots normally, showing for a few seconds the original HP wallpaper, and then reversing back to my normal desktop wallpaper along with the desktop icons. I attempted to
 reboot manually to see the error message I keep forgetting, but you exactly mentioned in your post (Cannot Open Volume for Direct Access), in order to write it here for further information about my current situation.</p>
<p>XP doesn't even try to clear up the dirty bit when rebooting.</p>
<p>I have no entry in my Event Viewer after the reboot, only a Winlogon entry dating back to the 28th of October this year, where it says "The shell stopped unexpectedly and Explorer.exe was restarted".</p>
<p>The only third-party systems software I use are CCleaner, PeaZip, and Quality Media Converter (QMC). CCleaner has a registry error checker which I use when I'm suspicious about my registry's integrity, It also has a disk cleaner tool which I used once to
 see what it did, and what difference it had with Windows Disk Cleanup Wizard. I doubt it did any harm. I use the built-in XP tools otherwise.</p>
<p>I have a Norton 360 installed, and I also use its Startup Manager to uncheck all the startup programs, so that my OS boots up within 30 minutes. It still takes a long time to boot up though although I disabled all of the startup programs.</p>
<p>I think that covers all the questions. Thanks</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth Turn On&#47;Off Button</h2>
                    Hello Microsoft Community!<br />
I have a problem with the Bluetooth device. I can't turn it on/off. All the drivers have been installed, and checked for updates. On my laptop, is running 64-bit operating system (Home Edition). Can it be the problem from my laptop model (Acer Aspire E1-532),
 or Windows type?<br />
Hope for help<br />
Cheers<br />

            We are volunteers willing to help you try to resolve this issue. 
<br />
<br />What device is it - make and model?
<br />
<br />Does it work on other computers?
<br />
<br />Do other Bluetooth devices work on your Acer Aspire?
<br />
<br />If you mean a Bluetooth device such as a mouse or headphone will not turn on then it either needs new batteries or has a hardware issue. If the latter it probably needs to be replaced.
<br />
<br />If you mean it will not connect after the device is turned on then use the methods below. (And of course the device might still need to be replaced.)
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />Check with your System/Motherboard maker and install the latest Bluetooth Drivers. Ask their support and in their forums about any known issues.
<br />
<br />Acer Aspire E1-532 - Drivers &amp; Firmware (BIOS) - set to your version of Windows.

<br /><a href="http://community.acer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://community.acer.com/</a>
<br />
<br />Acer - Worldwide
<br /><a href="http://www.acer.com/worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.acer.com/worldwide/</a>
<br />
<br />Also update the BIOS and chipset drivers while there as they can also affect the Bluetooth operation.
<br />
<br /> ===========================
<br />
<br /> Good idea to update all the major drivers :
<br />
<br />Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their name.
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

    <title>Failed to Enumarate objects in the Container. Access is Denied. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dpay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Failed to Enumarate objects in the Container. Access is Denied. Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I migrated from my old computer, which was running Windows 10 (upgraded from Windows 7 around 6 months ago). I have an external Hard Drive which I used to back up my Photo, Document, Video&nbsp;and Music Libraries. Before changing my computer I made sure that
 all my data was backed up to this external Drive and checked that it all worked and that I had access to all Folders and files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On changing the Computer (also running Windows 10, but newly&nbsp; installed) I started to re establish my data from the External Hard Drive to the Computers Internal Hard Drive. All the Document, Video and Music folders (plus their content) copied across with
 no problem at all. Unfortunately the same can not be said of the Photo folder and its files!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I try and transfer a file from the external Drive I get a pop up message Box telling me that "You require permission from the Computer Administrator to make the changes to this file"! This happens when I try and move any of my photo files! What
 is more concerning is that I can not open up any of my photos from the files, when I try, all I get is the&nbsp; message "You don't currently have access to this file" if I press
<em>continue, </em>I get a further message telling me that "you have been denied permission to access this folder". I have tried the "fix" outlined by Pavan_N above, but like mcpolamb, I also get to step 3 and am also faced by an "error applying security" message
 telling me that I had "failed to enumerate objects in the container". Whatever I try to do in the "security" tab on the Properties Box makes no difference. If I change anything relating to "users" including adding myself as the Administrator comes up with
 the message "failed to enumerate objects in the container. Access is&nbsp; denied". This is so frustrating given that I have Thousands of personal photos, taken over many years that I have no access to! It is very strange that I had no problems opening them in
 my old computer and also that there is NOT the same problem with all the other files being transferred from the external HD to my new&nbsp; computer, but only the Photo folder and files. Some urgent help would be much appreciated. Many thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I definitely know that could be frustrating. I can understand how you feel. I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be due to one of the following reasons:</p>
<div>a)&nbsp;You don’t have permission to access the file,</div>
<div>b)&nbsp;The file you are trying to access is corrupt,</div>
<div>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are using any third party security software, it may be blocking the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In most of the cases, this issue occurs when the user doesn’t have sufficient permissions to access the file. So I would suggest you to take ownership of the file and then check if the issue persists. Refer to these steps:</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. <strong>Right-click </strong>the <strong>program </strong>that you want to take ownership of, and then click
<strong>Properties</strong>. </div>
<div>2. Click the <strong>Security </strong>tab, and then click <strong>OK </strong>
on the Security message (if one appears). </div>
<div>3.Click <strong>Advanced</strong>, and then click <strong>change</strong>. Enter your password if prompted.</div>
<div>4.<strong>Type </strong>in your <strong>username </strong>and press <strong>
enter</strong>.</div>
<div>
<p>5.&nbsp;If you want to take ownership of the contents of the folder, <strong>select
</strong>the<strong> Replace owner on sub containers and <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; objects </strong>check box.<br />
6. Click <strong>OK </strong>and <strong>close </strong>all the windows.<br />
7. Follow step <strong>a </strong>and <strong>b</strong>, <strong>click </strong>
on <strong>advanced</strong>.<br />
8. Under "<strong>permissions</strong>" tab, select your <strong>user account </strong>
and &nbsp;click on "<strong>change permissions</strong>"</p>
<p>9. Check the "<strong>Replace all child object permission entries from this object</strong>." option and click
<strong>Ok</strong>.</p>
<p>10. All permissions will be replaced if you click Yes.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Try these steps and let us know the results. We’d be happy to help if you need any further assistance.</div>

            Many thanks for this response, unfortunately it did not work. I followed the instructions above, but I still ended up with an "error applying Security" message box telling me "failed to enumerate objects in the container. Access is&nbsp; denied". Just one point
 - not too sure what you mean by username, I have been using the administrator name that I have given my computer, is that correct? On another point, when I reach point 5 on your list, there is not a
<strong>Replace owner on sub containers and objects </strong>check box!

            <p>Hello Abhinav,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not advisable to download a copy of any version of Windows from any of the third party sources. However, the link provided earlier for Windows 8.1, provides you with very easy chronology of steps in order to re-install the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I would recommend those steps and check if you are able to re-install. If you get any issues while installing at any step, please provide us with the exact error codes/messages. So that we can help you with the relevant troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do feel free to write to us in case you have any issues/concerns while working on your computer, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Surface Book with Dock 1661 with Dual Dell p2016 monitors in DP mode not working</h2>
                    <p>Had this setup for few weeks no major problems except occasional Intel Driver crash where monitors and the surface book screen will shutdown and then reload when driver comes back up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just installed the new firmware updates 2/17/16 and after it went to sleep, I lost by Dual monitors displaying. I have tried rebooting, rebooting the dock, unplugging and plugging back in the monitors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The display settings show all the monitors attached, #1 is surface book, #2 and #3 are dell p2016 but the dual monitors are greyed out. The mutltiple displays dropdown says "Disconnect this display" on dual monitors. If I try change it to extend and click
 apply, tells me settings could not be saved. Also resolution drop down is greyed out and not showing anything. I am dead in the waters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help.</p>

            <p>I &nbsp;though I had fixed the issue updating the Nvidia GPU drivers. But as soon as my book goes to sleep or hibernates or even displays turn off after X time, the dual monitors will not come back up. &nbsp;I have to disconnect the dock, take 1 of the dp cables and
 plug it into the side port on the book, then when that external monitor comes up, I plug it back into the dock, then connect the dock back to the book, then both will come up. Like the displays have reinitialized. I have tried undocking the screen from the
 book and it will not reinitialize the displays, only moving one of the cables from the dock to the book will reinitalize them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any Ideas?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You have mentioned that you face this issue even while browsing, Windows Update will not cause this issue. It is always advised to keep the drivers updated to the latest version as per the manufacturer.

            It might not be the operating system fault (Windows ) and in most cases it is due to problem in the driver or the game itself when it rendering graphics or interact with the graphic&nbsp;card.

<h2>            Recovering Xbox Live account</h2>
                    
<p>I was wondering how &nbsp;I can recover my xbox live account that I made when I was young since I don't remember any of the info I never had to use the info until xbox had an update and made me log in with my email and password and I didn't know it. I tried calling
 them, and I also submitted&nbsp;a&nbsp;<span>Microsoft account recovery request a few times. I wouldn't mind making another account and play on that, but I bought Minecraft and a few other games that I enjoy playing and I didn't want to lose those games or rebuy them.</span></p>
<p><span>This is my first time using forums sorry if I didn't post this in the right section.</span></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Once your proofs are set up, you’ll need to use one of your proofs to confirm any account changes and to access certain parts of your account. So it’s important to make sure the phone numbers and email addresses you enter are correct.</p>
<p><b>How to add proofs</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to&nbsp;<a href="https://account.live.com/proofs/manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Manage your security info</a>&nbsp;and sign in with your Microsoft account.
</li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>Add New</b>&nbsp;under&nbsp;<b>Phone number</b>&nbsp;or under&nbsp;<b>Alternate email address</b>.
</li><li>Follow the instructions to set up and confirm the new proof. </li><li>If you already have a proof on your account, you might need to use that proof to verify the addition of a new proof.
<p><b>Note</b>&nbsp;Proofs can be added to new accounts without validation for a short period. Existing accounts will need to have their proofs validated by using an existing proof.</p>
</li><li>If you’re unable to access any of your current proofs (such as a phone number you don’t recognize or an expired email account), see&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/lost-proofs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Get help with your Microsoft account
 security proofs</a>. </li></ul>
<p><b>Proof requirements</b></p>
<p>Xbox LIVE will require that you have two proofs on your account, and at least one must be a phone number or email address. We recommend one phone and one email proof to provide the best security options for your account.</p>
<p><b>Why are so many proofs required?</b></p>
<p>Often people change or stop using a particular phone number or e-mail address. By having two proofs, you are more likely to have access to at least one of these accounts and thereby reduce the chances of being locked out of your account for even a short
 time period.</p>
<p><b>Phone and email</b></p>
<p>When you access your account, we want to make sure it’s you who is making any changes. We’ll send a one-time code to the phone number or email address you’ve provided. When you send that code back, we’ll know it’s really you.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>No spam or marketing. Use your real phone number and email.</b>&nbsp;We’ll only call, text, or email to check that you are you, so the info you provide needs to be valid. If you give us the wrong info, we won’t be able to validate your identity, and you might
 lose access to some Xbox LIVE functionality until you can validate your security information.
</li><li><b>Easier password reset.</b>&nbsp;If you forget your password or lose control of your account, your phone number or alternate email address will help you reset your password.
</li></ul>
<p><b>Trusted PC</b></p>
<p>You can also select&nbsp;<b>Make this computer a trusted PC</b>&nbsp;to link your Microsoft account with one or more personal (not public) computers. Then, if you ever need to reset your password, just use one of the linked computers, and we’ll know that you’re really
 you.</p>
<p><b>How to remove or delete an existing proof</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to&nbsp;<a href="https://account.live.com/proofs/manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Manage your security info</a>, and sign in with your Microsoft account.
</li><li>Next to the proof you want to remove, click&nbsp;<b>Delete</b>.
<p><b>Note</b>&nbsp;If you have only one proof on your Microsoft account and you want to remove it, you may have to use that proof to validate its own removal. (For example, to remove an email address that is the only proof on your account, you may need to respond
 to an email message sent to that same address.)</p>
</li><li>If you’re unable to access any of your current proofs (such as a phone number you don’t recognize or an expired email account), see&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/lost-proofs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Get help with your Microsoft account
 security proofs</a>. </li></ul>
<p><b>Out-of-date, invalid, or inaccessible proofs</b></p>
<p>If you don’t have access to any of your current proofs for your Microsoft account (for example, if the phone numbers and email addresses associated with your account have all expired or are invalid), see&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/lost-proofs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Get
 help with your Microsoft account security proofs</a>.</p>

<p>Hello Primal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your questions. Not sure what the DVI+A mean. With the audio output, you can select the best one that works for you. Most select digital stereo on the 360 console. If the others work though you can use them.</p>

            Hi there,&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;DVI-Analog (DVI-A) is known as&nbsp;</span><span>DVI-A
 cables which carry a high-quality analog signal however DVI-A is NOT compatible with DVI-D configurations please refer to the microsoft agents article on configuring audio options.<br />
<br />
DVI A ("</span><span style="font-style: italic">DVI-A are used to carry a DVI signal to an analog display, such as a CRT monitor or budget LCD. The most common
 use of DVI-A is connecting to a VGA device, since DVI-A and VGA carry the same signal. There is some quality loss involved in the digital to analog conversion, which is why a digital signal is recommended whenever possible.")&nbsp;</span><br />
I hope this information helps have a great day.<br />
<br />
Kind Regards<br />

Hi,<br />
<br />
Are you using Windows 7 32bit or 64bit?<br />
<br />
Step1:-I would suggest you to run the printer troubleshooter and check:-<br />
Open the Printer troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under Hardware and Sound, click Use a printer.</p>
<p>Refer this link for more information.<br />
“Open the Printer troubleshooter”<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Printer-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Printer-troubleshooter<br />
</a><br />
If that doesn’t help then try these steps.<br />
<br />
Step2:-If you check this Canon’s official site, it shows that it is compatible with Windows 7 32 bit. If you are using Windows 7 32bit, then I would suggest you to download the latest drivers from this site and check if that helps.<br />
<a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;tabact=DownloadDetailTabAct&amp;fcategoryid=335&amp;modelid=9436" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;tabact=DownloadDetailTabAct&amp;fcategoryid=335&amp;modelid=9436</a><br />
If you are using Windows 7 64 bit, try to contact Canon and check the compatibility status of the product with Windows 7. Refer this link:-<br />
<a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=SupportIndexAct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=SupportIndexAct</a><br />
<br />
Step3:-You may check the compatibility of the product with Windows 7 with this link:-<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>Step4:- However as a workaround you may try to install it in Vista compatibility mode and check if that helps.<br />
Here are the steps to go in to the Vista compatibility mode.<br />
To change compatibility settings manually for a program:<br />
1. Right-click on the software, <br />
2. Click Properties, and then <br />
3. Click the Compatibility tab. <br />
4. Put a check mark on “Run this program in a compatibility mode”.<br />
5. Select the operating system as Windows Vista<br />
6. Click “Apply”<br />
7. Click “OK”<br />
Check this link for more information.<br />

Hope it helps<br />

    <title>Is the SP4 black-screen problem being actively tracked&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gaaaaaaaaaa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is the SP4 black-screen problem being actively tracked&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Just arrived downtown for jury duty and am waiting to be called. Head over to the quiet waiting area, pull out the SP4 to find - yeah it's warm. Good times. Open the cover. I get keyboard back-light and no way to wake it up aside from doing a hard restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That this is still happening is beyond comprehension.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That this was considered fixed last month is disappointing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SP4 is the most unreliable piece of hardware I own. What should be "the way" to run windows serves only to showcase what a dumpster fire this combination Windows 10, the driver stack or the EFI firmware has become.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot return the SP4, I'm outside the window. I hear nothing from MS aside from "it's a hard computer science problem to solve" and parroting from the likes of Thurott and MJ Foley that the problem is fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is this being actively tracked?</p>

<p>Sorry, but I can't agee with either of your point.&nbsp; </p>
<p>My sp4 and 4 others that I setup do not have the wake from sleep issue so there are good machines out there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>All you are accomplishing by complaining in the manner that you do is that Microsoft personnel&nbsp; will and probably are ignoring your posts.&nbsp; I think you might accomplish more by invoking the lemon law strategy&nbsp; and then posting a complaint with the Better
 Business Bureau when Microsoft fails to respond.&nbsp; Your states Consumer Protection organization and the state Attorney General office can also be contacted.&nbsp; They will generally contact the vendor and harass him far more then your posts do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hint: one complaint from many is more effective then many complaints from one as long as the many all sound like different people. (wink, wink, nudge, nudge)</p>

 for no reason. Microsoft also does not need you to defend them. They make great products and honest criticism will let them know what to improve on.</p>

<p>You obviously didn't read my post carefully and didn't comprehend the point i was making.&nbsp; I never said people shouldn't complain only that there are more effective ways of doing it.&nbsp; As for winning the lottery I must be incredibly lucky as I have setup
 5 SP4s and none of them have the wake from sleep problem.&nbsp; Makes you think, doesn't it.&nbsp;

            No registry tweaks related to the black screen wake from sleep problem.&nbsp; I'm not sure that exchanging your sp4 again will help.&nbsp; Microsoft is obviously recycling these machines back to the consumer as warranty replacements.&nbsp; I could be wrong or you could
 get lucky but I think a better approach is to legally pressure Microsoft into sending you a new sp4 or a full refund. After a 3rd replacement if the problem still exists you a clearly a candidate for a Lemon Law refund.&nbsp; I would contact your states Consumer
 Protection Agency and discuss the issue with them.

<p>
</p><p>If you have already upgraded to Windows 10 and have activated you copy of Windows 10, then you are free to reinstall Windows 10 without any issues. Unless you perform any hardware changes to TPM, CPU or Motherboard, it shouldn't affect your activation status.
 Feel free to get back to us if you have any other queries; we'd be happy to help.</p>

            Hi,
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your interest in Windows 10. I will be glad to answer your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make sure I understand, by "hook up a large monitor",&nbsp;you are referring to connecting to a second monitor is that right? If so, yes, you will be able to connect to a second monitor.&nbsp;You can check the link below for reference:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/how-to-add-and-use-a-second-monitor-with-windows/b9159662-4163-4408-9286-4e2e73077692">How to add and use a second monitor with Windows 10</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, please note that&nbsp;Surface Pro 1 will definitely &nbsp;support Continuum. Also, if you are referring to using an external drive, you will be able to do that too.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information on Continuum, please refer to the link below.</p>

</p><p>I understand that I, as a classic Skype user on a PC with Windows 10 as the operating system, should have Skype version 7.40.0.151 installed instead of my present 7.40.0.103 version. But for some reason it is NOT possible for me to update my version to 7.40.0.104?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed your message that the only difference between the&nbsp;<span>7.40.0.104 and 7.40.0.151 versions is only in the labeled version number.</span></p>
<p>Thank you and have a nice day!</p>

<h2>            Service apr&#232;s-vente honteux &#33; &#91;Shameful after-sales service&#33;&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Bonjour,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Propriétaire d'une xbox one x depuis 1an, j'ai récemement eu un problème avec le lecteur bluray. J'ai inséré le jeux forza horizon 3 et il a refusé de sortir définitivement malgré tous mes efforts (y compris éjection manuelle). Je ne voulais pas ouvrir ma
 console sous garantie.&nbsp;</p>
<p>J'ai contacté le service après vente et dès le lendemain ma console partait en allemagne pour réparation. Outre le fait d'avoir récupéré ma console rayé ! Le Bluray du jeux avait disparu ! Et le comble, c'est qu'après réclamation, on me rétorque que je n'ai
 jamais envoyé le CD du jeux (ni dedans ni dans le carton...) Foutage de gueule ! Evidemement, j'ai envoyé ma console se promener en allemagne pour le plaisir !&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Inadmissible, j'ai décidé de porter plainte.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>J'attends de Xbox une réponse (un sav? )irréprochable. A 500€ la console il faut pas déconnner. A minima, un geste commercial à hauteur du préjudice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Et je n'en resterai pas là. J'alerterai les réseaux sociaux.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cordialement.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p><strong>[Translation -&nbsp;Hello,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Owner of an xbox one x for 1 year, I recently had a problem with the bluray player. I inserted the game forza horizon 3 and refused to go out permanently despite all my efforts (including manual ejection). I did not want to open my console under
 warranty.</strong><br />
<strong>I contacted the after sales service and the next day my console went to Germany for repair. Besides having recovered my striped console! The Bluray of the game was gone! And the excuse is that after claim, I'm told that I never sent the CD of the game
 (neither inside nor in the box ...) Foutage mouth! Evidemement, I sent my console to walk in germany for fun!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ineligible, I decided to make a complaint.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I expect from Xbox an answer (a sav?) Irreproachable. At 500 € the console must not be disconnected. At least, a commercial gesture to the prejudice.</strong><br />
<strong>And I will not stay here. I will alert social networks.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cordially.]</strong></p>

            You'll most likely find they have not seen the disc they&nbsp; replaced dis drive&nbsp; straight away without looking. Unfortunately, there is no proof.&nbsp;
