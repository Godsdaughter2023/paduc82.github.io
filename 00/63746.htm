<h2>            Windows 10 Mail App Not Automatically Syncing with Gmail</h2>
                    <p>I have seen a number of posts with syncing errors, but none specific to what I am seeing. I have set up my gmil account to sync "as items arrive" and also "every 15 minutes" and while manually syncing works fine, the system seems to simply not want to sync
 without intervention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No error messages are present, and when I open the app it just tells me how long it has been since my last manual sync. I have removed and re-added the account. I have rebooted the system, which seemed to fix it for ~8 hours. I have no third party AV or
 firewall, and have checked the Windows firewall to ensure it was not blocking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>

I'm having the same issue. &nbsp;I can for a sync just fine, but the windows mail app has stopped syncing as items arrive.

<h2>            refund or possible code change</h2>
                    i purchased destiny 2 forsaken annual pass for my friend but when he tried it he said that it would not work when he entered it i filled out multiple refund forms and talked to multiple live agents in chats and nobody is refunding me or offered to change
 the code so that it will work in the US the reason why i'm not getting a refund is because A: its not eligible for a refund because of the terms of sale forum (which has nothing about sending gifts to friends in different countries) and B: the refund forums
 don't have the correct category for sending codes and i was suggested to use the ``the item did not work as expected`` category which apparently if you submit incorrect information they will reject the request which it asks for a error code which i don`t have
 because it is a gift that i sent to my friend in the US and i`m from canada and the confirmation email in the fine print that it`s only eligible for renewal in canada and the best part is it did not give me the option of which c

<p>There actually is a note before you enter your friend's email address to let you know the code will only be redeemable in your country along with links to the terms and conditions of the sale which also state this. So they are correct in that case.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Kamrin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue about refund. You will have to continue to follow up with emails. Also remember to keep in mind when you purchase something as a gift where you are that is the region you are purchasing. So they wont be able to be used in other regions.
 As for exchanges there is no way to exchange a code that has been purchased in the wrong region. You have done the correct path by trying to get a refund.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<p>Hi Kamrin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The refund request forms are reviewed by live refund specialists. When you fill out the form, it should ask you for your preferred email to receive the confirmation email with your service request number and eventually a decision email will be sent to the
 same email you provided in the form. Any appeals to the decision must be done through the email you received giving you the decision. If you are inputting the correct order number and everything else on the form is accurate, then the decision is based on account
 history and your account is just not eligible for a refund at this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Customer support no longer handles refund requests and the best way to appeal the decision is to reply to the decision email you should have received. Also don't submit multiple refund request forms for the same order as that can reflect negatively on your
 account.</p>
<p>

<h2>            erro batlefield 3</h2>
                    <p>Olá, preciso de ajuda.
Meu jogo não quer iniciar. Baixei battlefield 3 na gold&nbsp;e&nbsp;ele estava funcionando normalmente, mas agora ele está dando o seguinte erro.

-------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>Erro no jogo
Impossível ler o disco.</p>

<p>1. Limpe o disco com um pano macio
2. Reinicie o cosole</p>

<p>Para obter mais ajuda, visite
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.xbox.com/support</a>.
-------------------------------------------------------

Já baixei o jogo varias vezes e não deu em nada. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
Como é que um jogo que baixa&nbsp;na live gold &nbsp;sendo que foi Baixado completo, pede pra colocar o CD?</p>

            What version of XP (Home/Pro) and what service pack? Right-click on My Computer and select Properties if you don't know the answers.<br />
<br />
Does "go wireless" mean that you want to be able to use your laptop in various parts of your home away from your Internet connection or do you mean that you want to be able to use your laptop anywhere in or out of your home that you can get a cell phone connection?<br />
<br />
What model Zoom product did you purchase?<br />
<br />
How do you now obtain your Internet service (e.g., dial up, DSL, cable, Ethernet network connection)?<br />
<br />
Assuming that you have some sort of Internet service in your home, what is the <span style="font-weight: bold">
make and model of every device </span>between your computer and the wall jack where your Internet service enters your home?<br />

            <p>Hi,
</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Were there any recent changes to the system prior to the issue?</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
<p>Follow the link mentioned below and check the issue in safe mode with networking.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222</a>
</p>
<p>If the issue is fixed in safe mode with networking, I would suggest you to perform a clean boot and check if it helps.</p>

</p>
<p>If the issue does not persist you may continue with
<b>step 2 </b>from the above link.</p>
<p><b>Note:
</b><span>Make sure you reset the computer to normal mode after the troubleshooting completes. Refer the section “Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state”</span></p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b></p>
<p>Follow the link and perform a sfc scan, check if it helps.</p>

                    The latest Windows update has caused horrendous slowing down of programs. How can i safely remove it?

            If you recently installed the December update, I recommend you remove it.
<br />
<br />Many users are reporting issues with this update, I recommend you uninstall and block it until further notice:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />(This is the update you want to uninstall KB4054517
<br />
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, perform a repair upgrade:

            Hi Rich,
<br />
<br />Blue Screens are in general caused by a bad driver
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Hi Robbie,
<br />
<br />My name is Nic and I am an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />Try the following steps and let me know:
<br />1. Go to C:\ Program Files (x86)\google\googledrivesync.exe (Alternatively, you may go to Start - Computer - Local Disk (C).
<br />2. Search for Program Files and click on it.
<br />3. Move to Google -&gt; Drive.
<br />4. Expand the googledrivesync.exe file and check.
<br />If the above steps don’t help, post your query in Google Drive Forum Support for further assistance <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#%21forum/drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://productforums.google.com/forum/#%21foru...</a>

            Hi  natsuboss1 
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level
<br />
<br />Other options:
<br />
<br />1. Play a youtube video with the soundcard speaker jack unplugged and let it play through the laptop's inbuilt speakers.
<br />2. While it is playing, plug in the audio jack and see if it starts playing. 
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:

</p><p>My installation is only a couple of weeks old <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5fe61bb-7928-4e9b-a3ae-029ce8fc2a3c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5fe61bb-7928-4e9b-a3ae-029ce8fc2a3c" /></a>&nbsp; and your solution doesn't work. I have enabled the option, a line appeared in the Start-up tab of the task manager, after
 which I disabled the option again and the line disappeared.</p>
<p>The problem is also not consistent. When I start my day and wake my computer from sleep, skype will startup. When I put it to sleep and wake it instantly skype doesn't start.</p>
<p>This seems to work all the time: Start the application, then right-click on the icon in the task manager and click exit. You will notice in the running processes that it didn't really exit, but don't touch it. Now reboot. When you logon skype while restart
 automatically.</p>
<p>It seems to be some new feature in Windows that tries to restart all Microsoft-apps after a reboot. Where can I disable this?</p>
<p>How can I make skype for business exit when I tell it to exit?</p>

<p>Hi Frederik_136,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked the version and found that it's not up to date. Microsoft has just released an update for Skype for Business 2016 on Jan.2, please upgrade it and check if the issue can be fixed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that Skype for Business always start even you've enabled the option and you want to prevent this. I'd like to confirm you about some details as below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Regarding '<em>I have enabled the option</em>', do you mean this option?</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ebe72019-0434-423a-841c-f09f83736cef" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ebe72019-0434-423a-841c-f09f83736cef" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Did you disable the Skype for Business under startup in the Task Manager as below?</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15aa64dd-25de-4d15-91a4-59a01eea43c3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15aa64dd-25de-4d15-91a4-59a01eea43c3" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Please capture a screenshot of this scenario -&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;<em>a line appeared in the Start-up tab of the task manager, after which I disabled the option again and the line disappeared.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Here is my way to exit Skype for Business: right click the Skype for Business icon to exit.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6df1f760-226f-415f-9c46-122fa4186a13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6df1f760-226f-415f-9c46-122fa4186a13" /></a></p>
<p>And you can open the task manager and monitor the Skype for Business process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please correct me if there is any misunderstanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Lance</p>
<p>

    <title>Why is my task bar and icon on my desktop blinking&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why is my task bar and icon on my desktop blinking&#63;</h2>
                    This bug started happening to me and i have not found any solutions on how to fix it. My task bar keeps blinking every few minutes along with the icons on my desktop(im not sure how to describe it but its like it is refreshing itself same with my icons
 on my desktop it disappears and reappears for a second). Also when i move my icons around from the original place they move back to the original place when my desktop and task bar flicker/blink. I think this is also the reason why my games keep minimizing
 when im playing it on full-screen, also while im watching a long youtube video i click the full screen my taskbar appears and i have to click the chrome icon on my task bar to make it go away. Then after a few minutes it appears again. Is this some kind of
 virus? I've tried many solutions like scanning for viruses etc and nothing has been working its giving me a head ache.&nbsp;

<p>Alright, good information to know that the files stay until you restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on that information, what is most likely occurring is that you profile is broken and you are getting logged-in to a temporary profile every time you start up.&nbsp; Temporary profiles are just what they sound like, and when you logout everything stored
 in them gets lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might possibly be seeing a message like this when you first login too, although it could be hidden or disappear before you notice it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's what I'd like you to try:</p>
<ol>
<li>Login to your computer</li><li>Right-click the Start button and choose Run</li><li>Type CMD and press OK</li><li>In the Command Prompt that appears, do you see the word TEMP on the last line shown?&nbsp; For example, it may say
<strong>C:\Users\Temp&gt;</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you see the word TEMP, then we know we've found the problem and we can work on fixing it next.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>After Windows 7 Pro upgrade to Windows 10, my application programs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> muse2u  say:</h3>
<h2>            After Windows 7 Pro upgrade to Windows 10, my application programs were no longer installed.</h2>
                    <p>I did an upgrade of my Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10 using the Windows Upgrade process. Prior to the install, the compatibility check indicated that none of my installed programs were incompatible. The installation process was uneventful and the only prompt
 that required me to make a decision was whether I wanted customized or express settings. I chose the latter. When the installation was completed, I was prompted to log into my account. The first thing I noticed was none of my desktop icons were retained. The
 startup menu had some of my previous installed/apps in the list but none of the entries linked to the executeables. The Windows 10 Program Files folder no longer contained any of my apps. The Windows 7 Program Files folder containing all of the installed programs
 and all my User folders (Documentation, etc) had been moved to a Windows.Old folder, probably retained in case I want to back out. What part of this upgrade did I not understand. I thought that after the Windows upgrade all of my compatible programs would
 still be installed, all of my installed programs would be in the Startup Menu and all of my installed programs icons would still be on my desktop. Should I have requested a customized settings install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some more observations:</p>
<p>The apps that are all missing do appear in the Settings : Apps &amp; Features List with the option to uninstall. Many have the original install date others have today, July 31, 2015 as the install date. Hitting Uninstall does nothing, not even give an error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you try to reinstall a missing program, the install program seems to check the registry and determines that an uninstall must take place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although the missing programs are no longer in the Windows Program Files folder, the data corresponding&nbsp;to the missing programs is as expected still in the Program Data folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Start Menu may be getting its information from the Program Data folder which would explain why some of the missing apps have entries in the Menu in spite of the fact that the programs are no longer installed in the Program Files folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pc had two account, an admin account for me and a second account for my son. If given the option at program install time, some programs were installed with the option to make them available to anyone on the pc, while others were made available to only
 my account. Is it possible that the Windows 10 upgrade doesn't properly handle a multiple account Windows 7 or 8 PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: I posted much of the following in another member's post and include it here in case someone has the same problem, Googles and ends up here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Answer Desk has advised me that there is a flaw in the Windows 10 upgrade process that randomly (random because they don't know the conditions that cause it) effects some people, and some installs, and that will result in some or all of the programs
 installed no longer being installed. As I posted above, the symptoms are, the application is no longer installed in the "Program Files" folder, but is still in the "App &amp; Features" list, "Program Data" folders, and "Start Menu", all icons on the desktop pointing
 to the missing programs are gone. Microsoft says until their developers can resolve the issue, their only advice is,&nbsp; perform the Windows Update Recovery process and restore your previous operating system. Since the problem appears to be random, they advise
 to then rerun the Windows 10 upgrade. Many people have had success recovering most if not all their applications on the second install.<br />
<br />
In this particular case, the solution to the missing app problem isn't simply to reinstall the missing programs because you will still be left with a Windows registry, Program Data folder, and Startup Menu that is not in sync with your installed apps, and that
 will eventually bite you in the ****.<br />
<br />
My advice is to wait a week or so if you can (don't exceed the month limit to the recovery of the old OS), to give MS developers the opportunity to fix the problem and then perform the recovery and reapply the Win10 Upgrade, if that is their recommendation
 at that time.&nbsp; If you can't wait, perform the recovery and upgrade now, and hopefully the majority of your apps will return and those that don't, it's back to the discs and activation codes to perform program reinstalls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A major concern I had with being forced to reinstall apps was the fact that the Microsoft Office 2013 Student &amp; Home I had purchased and installed came with the License condition that it could only be installed once (i.e. if the hard drive self-destructed
 or Windows was corrupted and I had to reinstall the OS, I could not install Office a second time). Microsoft Answer Desk advised me that as long as I had the "Product Code" I would be able to reinstall. I don't know if that reflects a change in the original
 license condition or if that is a courtesy from Microsoft. I assume that that install would require Microsoft's participation in order to execute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have asked Microsoft to post on this forum to give a more authorized report of this issue. I have also asked them to email me if a solution to the issue is implemented. If they respond I will post an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: Beware of Window 10 rollback to previous OS!! which was identified as a fix to this issue. I tried to rollback and my PC ended up in an infinite loop of reboots "Attempting to recover installation" &amp; "Restoring your previous version of Windows".
 I don't believe this is another "random" issue. My suspicion is that whatever caused the original missing program issue may in fact be preventing a successful rollback. If rollbacks are not dependable, this upgrade is not ready for prime time! Anyone who ventures
 down this road better have a hard drive/image backup or you're **********.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: Another warning. Apparently even a restore of the System and Windows 7 partitions from a backup, performed before the upgrade was initiated, appears to be unreliable in recovering Windows 7. I have used Paragon Backup &amp; Recovery 14 Home to restore
 my Windows drives and partitions on many occasions. This is the first time that a recovery has failed. This is the first time that I have tried to recover this particular pc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first thought was that the Dell Optiplex 960 BIOS had security that was preventing writing properly to the partitions. (Microsoft, are you listening? That could be an explanation for the Windows upgrade and rollback failure.) I had used this same program
 to back up the original Dell hard drive and restore it to a larger one without issue, but I assume that the BIOS would not treat that the same as recovering over the active partitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I thought, did the Window 10 upgrade and/or rollback make changes to the hard drive/BIOS/BIOS settings, that would impact a partition recovery? It must have done something to the boot sector/boot process to force the "Attempting to recover installation"
 process and subsequent loop . If it did that and more would that complicate recovering the system drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point we are in an area way beyond my experience. Anybody out there have any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thought. Even if the restore of the partitions had been successful, it isn't clear what the status of the Windows 7 license was. I assume that a successful Windows 10 rollback would also have restored the Windows 7 license. A failed Windows 10 rollback
 could result in a Windows 7 license that would have to be reactivated with Microsoft assistance before it could be used.</p>

            <p>IF what you've described is accurate, it appears that your files and folders were somehow
<em>not moved</em> across in the final process (interrupted or just plain buggy)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, if you're up to trying and assuming that you did not tinker further under the hood (hacked the registry settings), here's one possible solution to your issue. It is a slightly tedious process if you want to do it right, and without messing things
 up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>goto</p>
<p><strong>C:\Windows.old\</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>COPY</strong></em> the following folders and all their sub-folders to where they should rightfully be
<em>after </em>the upgrade:</p>
<ul>
<li>C:\Windows.old\Program Files\ --&gt; C:\Program Files\</li><li>C:\Windows.old\Program Files (x86)&nbsp; --&gt;&nbsp; C:\Program Files (x86)\</li><li>C:\Windows.old\ProgramData --&gt;&nbsp; C:\ProgramData\</li><li>C:\Windows.old\Users\&nbsp; --&gt;&nbsp; C:\Users\</li></ul>
<p><strong>*** NOTES ***</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>IF asked "The folder already exist, do you want to merge", click YES</li><li>IF asked "The destination already has a file with the same name...", click on
<strong>SKIP THIS FILE</strong> and check on the the checkbox at the bottom left that says something along the lines of "DO THE SAME FOR THE NEXT ### FILES FOUND"</li></ul>
<p><strong>*** WARNING ***</strong></p>
<p><strong>Doing so in bulk will also move over obsolete files and/or older versions of Windows programs that Windows no longer support in Windows 10, so RULE OF THUMB : NEVER OVERWRITE / REPLACE ANY FILES THAT ALREADY EXIST IN THE DESTINATION FOLDERS.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>A safer, but more time-consuming method is to go into the 4 folders mentioned above, and
<strong>selectively </strong>copy over the folders which I did not mark "DO NOT COPY"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attached screencaps below are some of the folders which you <strong><em>SHOULD NOT</em></strong> copy over (simply because there will be new/updated versions already in their rightful places)</p>
<ul>
<li>BLUE rectangles are directory structures you should keep note of (there's more than one "COMMON FILES" folder that needs to be copied over, make sure you copy to the correct sub-folders)</li><li>GREEN marks the folders you want to COPY</li><li>RED are folders that you DO NOT want to copy because if your Win10 is working, those left behind in Windows.old are the Win8.1 versions. *NOTE* Your computer might have different setup / hardware, what I'm showing are files left behind in
<em>my</em> windows.old folder after a successful upgrade, ie, old files / files that are no longer needed in Win10.<br />
<br />

            <p>Just a thought ... your rollback isn't successful probably because the files were not in the correct directories.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, Win10 dos not utilise the BIOS for bootloading, you need to lookup UEFI</p>
<p>here's one to get you started:</p>

            <p>Wow, these are some incredibly detailed instructions, wkhai.&nbsp;And reassuring to have for anyone facing or worried about&nbsp;the upgrade issues that are being discussed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I'm not sure muse2u is in a position to be able to do what you describe here, seeing as he reported being, firstly, stuck in a rollback 'loop', and then unable to perform a recovery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you going to do a clean reinstall of Windows 7, muse2u? And then stick&nbsp;with that for now, or&nbsp;try the upgrade again? Fingers crossed that you manage to recover all your data from your back-up after a clean install. Keep us posted!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if the conversion from BIOS to UEFI during the Windows 7 to 10 upgrade is causing more problems for people doing Windows 7 upgrades and/or rollbacks compared to Windows 8?</p>

            <p>This has turned into a minor disaster, if losing an OS that took a lot of work to customize and data that took a lot of time to build up can be called a disaster. I will explain in a moment. First, an apology, I'm going to go into some detail in the hope
 that if anyone else runs into some or all of my issues, they may find some help here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>wkhai, I am familiar with the process you described. It was the first option I considered after the first logon to Win10. After reviewing the Program Data folders and the registry. It appeared that everything was as it should be, where it should be, except
 for the missing program files in the Program Files folder. (I also compared the original install location of the missing programs on my other PCs and they were all installed in the Program Files folder as they had been on this pc, therefore not moved before
 the upgrade.) For example, Dropbox installs itself in the Users\name\AppData\Roaming folder, to prevent multiple accounts on a pc from setting up additional Dropbox accounts. There are no Dropbox executables found in the Program Files directory. Dropbox installed
 fine in Win10 and worked after the first login. Other programs install themselves into the AppData folder if they plan to write to that folder because, if I understand right,&nbsp; Windows doesn't allow an app to write into the Programs Folder. I could have just
 moved the missing files from the Program Files Window.old folder to the Win10 Program Files directory and manually created shortcuts to the programs since everything else seemed to be in place for those programs. The problem with that approach was that, even
 if the procedure worked, I could be left with a system where the Registry, Start Menu, App &amp; Features list and AppData folders might be ever so slightly out of sync to cause me grief later on. As a last resort, I would have taken that approach. In retrospect,
 I should have done that, but because of Microsoft's confidence in the rollback process, I proceeded with that instead. As I documented above, that failed, and so did the hard drive partition restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>RA2015, Microsoft Answer desk agreed with me that since there was no way of knowing what the status of the install was at this point, the next option was to do a clean install of Win 10. They provided me with a link to a page to download the Win10 install
 boot media creator. Two things that might seem obvious to most, but could cause confusion to others: one is the selection of which creator to download, the 32 bit version or the 64 bit version. The selection is not based on the target Win10 to be installed
 but the bit version of the operating system that the boot media creator program will run under. The other thing to make note of is that the creator must be run in administrator mode or else you will run into the infamous and cryptic error message, "Something
 happened" with code 0x800704dd-0x90016. I downloaded the program, created a boot DVD and proceeded to perform a clean install of Win 10, resigned to the fact that I would have to reinstall all of my programs, re-customize them all and re-setup all my home
 LAN shares, etc. If you have access to your install sources, if their licensing allow re-installs and if you don't have too many programs, that might not be an unreasonable task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything went fine until I had to select the location where Win 10 was to be installed in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point my system consisted of a System Partition, what use to be the Win 7 partition, and the rest of the drive was allocated to a data partition that contained my media files and other documents. The system and windows partitions were periodically
 backed up using the Paragon B&amp;R program. The data partition was backed up periodically using a file synchronization program. It was the system and windows partition restores that had failed previously, so the current status of the contents was unknown. My
 assumption was that the Win 10 clean install would delete the partition(s) content and start from scratch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I selected the windows partition for the install and that resulted in an error message that in effect said that Win 10 could not find a place to install itself. I saw on the internet that many people got this message when they were performing the install
 from a USB memory stick. For others it was related to their boot sequence, and still others, the way the wind was blowing. The advice I decided to follow was outright deleting the partitions before performing the install. That option is available on the Win
 10 install prog screen. I deleted the system partition first, rebooted and started install and got same error. I deleted the windows partition and again got the same error. When I deleted the data partition (more about that later) and rebooted, the install
 proceeded as expected and completed without error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some observations that might make others think twice:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the same Microsoft account id that I use for my admin logon on my Windows 8 desktop computer, to perform the original Win 7 to Win 10 update on my test computer and to logon to the admin account that was created for me there. Microsoft remembered
 that I had performed an update, and Win 10 was automatically activated. I forgot that one of the "benefits" to Windows pc accounts that use the same Microsoft account as login, they start synchronising some of their settings. What I discovered the next time
 I logged into my Win 8 account was that the desktop background image that had been setup to change every hour, had been replaced with the Win 10 desktop background. I am sure that that kind of synchronization can be turned off if desired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another other issue was that all of my accounts on all of my PCs had initially been setup with local password control. This resulted in my first name being used to create my Users folder. The first name is also used in setting up access to shares between
 the PCs. Having the first name used made sense, easy to remember, easy to identify on the hard drive. What Win 10 did is use the first 5 characters of my Microsoft account id which, for some people could result in some fairly cryptic folder names and log screen
 ids. Some of that may be customizable but I suspect that the Users subfolder is carved in stone as is the name used in share access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered that the Windows 10 compatibility check cannot be relied on to be 100% accurate. It concluded that the PC hardware and software was compatible. I had installed two addon cards into the Dell that I had forgotten about; one was a StarTech PCI
 4 port USB 3.0 card and the other was a PCI SATA controller card. I was able to access all my hard drives connected to the controller, so that seemed to resolve itself. However, the USB 3.0 ports would not work. The driver for the card was developed for 32
 and 64 bit Win XP, Vista 7, and Server 2008 in 2012. The were no Win 10 versions of the driver. I installed the old driver and the ports now work. The Device Manager indicates that there is an outstanding PCI problem but at this point I don't know if that
 is the result of some issue with either of the cards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>RA2015, you bring up an interesting point re a BIOS to UEFI conversion. I am not familiar with that so I will do some research to better understand before I comment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now in the process of reinstalling my important programs and customizing Windows 10 to act as a test pc and to provide a simple 24 hour "server" function for my home LAN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In summary, here is a list of some of things I recommend based on what I learned:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Use the compatibility check only as a guideline. Check with the manufacturer of your PC and any hardware that was added, to confirm compatibility. The more obscure the manufacturer, the more unlikely that upgraded drivers are not available. The old drivers
 may or may not work. Also remember, operating system upgrades generate new revenue if they force you to upgrade hardware, so there is more incentive to steer you in that direction instead of pouring money into updating drivers (read "built-in obsolescence").&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Identify your most important programs and check with the developers to confirm compatibility and licensing restrictions. If the update goes as advertised and all programs are still installed, the program may not function until you go through some kind
 of reactivation process. Be familiar with that process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Avoid installing data partitions and system and windows partitions on the same hard drive. Assume that sometime in your lifetime, windows will fail and the last resort to recover, is to restore the hard drive. The backup and restore of the whole drive
 will be much simpler, smaller and faster, if it is a complete drive backup of only the Windows portion. Buy the fastest hard drive you can afford at a capacity to hold Windows and installed apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Backup! Backup regularly! Turn on Windows backup facilities and schedule them to either perform automatically or to remind you if they have to be performed manually. The frequency depends on how much work you want to do to get back to where you were.
 I have restored Windows from 6 months old backups and been up and running in a few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Perform a complete backup of the whole Windows drive before starting the Windows 10 upgrade. If you have data partitions on the same drive and you are backing them up separately, make sure you know what you are backing up. I performed a synch backup thinking
 I was backing up the data partition on the Windows drive, when in fact I was backing up a different drive altogether. Having to delete the data partition to install Windows, I am now faced with recovering the partition from a one year backup. Some of the data
 will be unrecoverable. I accept full responsibility. Hence recommendation no 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Is this really necessary? Is this really necessary right now? If you are currently running a Windows 7 or Windows 8 pc, support for these OSs will continue for some years. Are the Windows 10 features so desirable or necessary to you to perform the upgrade
 now? The less computer knowledgeable you are the more I recommend staying away from the bleeding edge. Wait a few months before making that leap. Try to involve someone in your social circle who is computer knowledgeable to help you. Check forums such as this
 one to get a feel for how things are rolling out. Keep in mind that the majority of people reporting on forums are experiencing problems. People with successful uneventful installs would not constitute the majority of posts. So put the number of problems reported
 into a realistic perspective.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, sorry for my verbosity.</p>
<p>

            <p>So it couldn't get any worse! Oh yeah!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Providing recoverability from a failed Win 7 to Win 10 upgrade in the recommendations above, was focused on the Win 7 test desktop computer that Win 10 was being installed on. It turns out that all other Win 8 computers that you are already using your Microsoft
 account id on, are at risk because of setting synchronization.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some background: Window 8 introduced the ability to synchronize the settings of all Windows 8 computers that you use your Microsoft account id as a login. The settings are stored on your OneDrive. Synchronization of settings is turned on by default on both
 Win 8 and Win 10 installs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, say you have a couple of desktops and a laptop, they don't even have to be connected to the same home LAN. You install Windows 8 on one of them. You create an account on the computer using your Microsoft account id. Window synchronization is turned on
 by default. You customize your Windows 8. You install a third party program to, say, bring back the start menu. You install a third party anti virus program, Norton Internet Security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some time later you&nbsp; upgrade one of the other PCs from Win 7 to Win 10 using a clean install (some of the consequences I describe may or may not apply if you are doing a Windows update instead of clean install). Windows synchronization is turned on by default.
 The moment you login to Win 10 with your Microsoft account id, Win 10 and Win 8 start synchronizing settings. You don't really want this to take place at this time because you don't want the settings of this virgin Win 10 account to be propagated to Win 8
 yet. As documented above, the Win 8 desktop background immediately gets changed from whatever it was, to the Win 10 background. If you reboot your Win 8 computer, the next login to your account on that computer hangs when the third party start menu fails to
 load properly because the Win 8 settings have been changed back to reflect the original Win 8 start menu. Not to worry. You just reinstall the third party start menu program. And since there is no third party antivirus program installed on the Win 10 computer
 yet, the settings on the Win 8 computer are changed to reflect no antivirus program is installed and Win 8 offers to install Windows Defender. Norton Internet Security is still installed but fails to startup properly. You uninstall NIS and reinstall it. It
 runs and seems to be working properly, but Win 8 notification warns that no antivirus program is running. Things seem to be very out of synch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the current status of my Win 8 computer. </p>
<br />
<p>You can't trust the Win 10 upgrade risk to be restricted to the computer the install is taking place on, so before you start the upgrade:</p>
<p>
</p><p>0.1 Temporarily turn off synchronization on all Windows 8 pcs that you are using your Microsoft account as a login. This is documented here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-CA/windows-8/sync-settings-pcs</p>
<p>
</p><p>0.2 Create a Win 8 system restore point, just in case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you decide to reactivate the synchronization feature after the Win 10 upgrade, activate it on one computer. conservatively select the settings to sync (that is .. pick those settings, like Windows themes, that are less likely to interfere with program
 startups). and then do the same on the other computer. Make sure everything is working as expected on both computers, before your proceed to turn on more settings to sync.</p>

            <p>The settings synchronization feature issue above is more serious than I thought.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the install of Win 10 on one pc has poisoned the settings of Win 8 on the other, attempts to recover Win 8 using restore points are futile (this may also apply to any hard drive backup restores you have of your system), even restore points created before
 the Win 10 upgrade. The reason is that if the restore point was created while synchronization is turned on, the first thing that will happen when recovery is completed and you login to your account, Win 8 will download the poisoned settings from OneDrive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if you turn off synchronization on both pcs, the poisoned settings are still on OneDrive. You can apparently remove all backed up settings using the procedure documented here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://onedrive.live.com/win8personalsettingsprivacy/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't quite figured out is the settings removal process performed on one PC, removes the settings from OneDrive or both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also haven't figured out how to get to the Removal function without using the above page. I tried to login to OneDrive directly and was not able to find the function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use setting synchronization between your Windows 8/10 PCs, you better have some restore points, system images and hard drive backups with synchronization turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not a Windows specialist, but I have been around the block several times. Most of what I am documenting here I have learned as a result of troubleshooting my Win 10 problems in the past week and applying some common sense. I would welcome comments from
 anyone with more experience than I to correct any conclusions I have come to in error and suggestions I have made as a result of limited experience. I certainly don't want to be guilty of spreading any misinformation on the net.</p>

            <p>You shouldn't have to purchase another Key, and the problem might well be sorted out via Microsoft Support or Activation Centers.&nbsp; My point was that if you are making long distance phone calls to other countries, and if you are kept on the phone for any
 length of time, it might just be cheaper to buy a new Key.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>"i know how to clean install or upgrade windows!", my point there was a clean install with the upgrade version of Windows 8.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Was your computer an OEM machine?&nbsp; If so the Product Key might have been embedded inside the Cmos (Bios), so what do you mean by "just reset Bios"?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We can appreciate that perhaps changing the hardware configuration might have confused the Activation process to believe that you are trying to install a used Product Key on another machine, but the fact remains to correct it you need to contact Microsoft.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Maybe you can start the contacting process via online or E-mail support if it is possible.&nbsp; See "How may we help you?" in this article, it may be applicable.</p>
