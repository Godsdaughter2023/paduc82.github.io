<h2>            Dynamic Excel  Charts</h2>
                    <p>I have been helped by learning how to create a dynamic Excel chart, so I thought I would share what I have learned.</p>
<p>Here is the sample data:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>First create named ranges for each of the columns. </p>
<p>On the Formulas tab, Defined Names group, choose Name Manager.</p>
<p>Then click New.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use this formula for the "Value 1" column: <strong>=OFFSET(Sheet1!$B$2,0,0,COUNT(Sheet1!$B:$B),1)</strong></p>
<p>Use this formula for the "Value 2" column: <strong>=OFFSET(Sheet1!$C$2,0,0,COUNT(Sheet1!$C:$C),1)</strong></p>
<p>But the label&nbsp; formula is a little different because it is text: <strong>=OFFSET(Sheet1!$A$2,0,0,COUNTA(Sheet1!$A:$A),1)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Offset() function will make the range to update as you add values to it.</p>
<p>Now you can create a chart<strong>.</strong> For this example I will use a Column Chart<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Right click on the chart and choose "Select Data..." from the drop-down menu.</p>
<p>Add an entry to the Legend Entries for each column. For Example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then add your legend series:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then click OK.</p>
<p>You Should now have a chart which looks something like this:</p>
<p>Now whenever you add new rows to your data, your chart will automatically update!</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            Did you enable 2-factor authentication on the accounts? If so, you need to use an app password. 
<br />
<br />If it's a gmail or yahoo account, you can enable 'allow less secure apps' instead.

                    <p>I've installed Outlook mobile app on my iPhone and set it up to work with my outlook.com account. There's mail, contacts, calendar etc. However, I can't seem to find the Tasks section anywhere (and even googling it doesn't help). So one simple question --
 how can I view and manage tasks in this app?</p>

<br />
<br />May I suggest you to delete your Microsoft/Outlook.com cookies and clear browser caches then restart the browser?

<h2>            Read Only Files  &#38; File Permission Error</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
Recently I have noticed that a lot of my word files have become Read Only. I haven't done anything different, (that I know of). I tried to gain permission in Restrict Editing tab but when i press 'Restrict Permission' button I am prompted with the following
 message:<br />
<br />
'Your machine isn't set up for Information Rights Management (IPM). To set up IPM, sign into Office, open an existing IPM Protected message or document, or contact your help desk.&nbsp;<br />
I am signed into Office and I dont understand what else Im supposed to do.<br />
<br />
Also, I am having trouble saving new documents. I am prompted with this message.&nbsp;<br />
'Word cannot complete the save due to a file permission error'.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Why is this happening to me!!!!!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please Help

<br />
<br />
The "set up Information Rights Management" error may sometimes appear when trying to edit or save documents if the content is in protected view, the file properties are set to read-only, your Office is not activated, your OneDrive storage is full, or because
 of your antivirus. For workarounds, we advise that you refer to the link below:<br />

<p>How do you turn updates on a Windows10 as it comes already on? Which updates? are you trying to get the Insiders build? did you turn on get insiders builds? did you set it to Fast? As &nbsp;a Insider we are expected to have computer knowledge and supply some
 details about systems and builds when posting.</p>

<p>Hi...if you feel there is something wrong with your new compute... rather than fool around with it...take it back where you bought it while it's still under warranty ...your system was pre-installed Windows 10?...I am guessing...then you are not on an Insiders
 version....we need more info as to what you are running.</p>
<p>*Right click 'Start icon' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; select&gt; 'Run'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; type: <strong>winver</strong></p>

            <p>You may not be able to see the IP address of the machine used by the hacker.&nbsp; That might not show up in the mail headers.&nbsp; What should show in the server networking&nbsp;logs is the IP address of the system that connected to the server.&nbsp; It might be possible
 to use that to locate the hacker.&nbsp; At the very least, the server admin may be able to block that network.&nbsp; If the server admin has cleared the logs, you are out of luck until the hacker makes another connection.&nbsp; You should be able to prevent that, however,
 by changing the mailbox's password, choosing something strong.</p>
<p>Who is your mail provider?&nbsp; There may be other protection steps you can take as well.</p>

    <title>SharePoint Workspace 2010 has stopped working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mandyshaw  say:</h3>
<h2>            SharePoint Workspace 2010 has stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have (or rather had) an external&nbsp;SharePoint 2010 site nicely sync'd onto my PC via SharePoint Workspace 2010.</p>
<p>I am now, all of a sudden,&nbsp;getting 'SharePoint Workspace 2010 has stopped working' every time I try to open this particular site.</p>
<p>I have deleted and re-added it twice, running groove /clean /all in between (which has worked successfully for me on a previous occasion).</p>
<p>I have tried installing the Office for Business client but it won't talk to a 2010 SharePoint server (despite this solution being listed as the Answer on the other post here with this subject).</p>
<p>I can't connect to the SharePoint from Word or Excel as it is not an Office 365 one.</p>
<p>I can't change anything server side.&nbsp;I am just an end user who wants to use&nbsp;SharePoint quickly and efficiently. I want to&nbsp;change the folder structure in a part of the SharePoint site that I control, a task that is (or was) quick and easy with SharePoint
 Workspace but which seems almost impossible from the web browser client (which doesn't&nbsp;provide the 'open with windows explorer' option that I have seen on other SharePoint sites, unfortunately).</p>
<p>Any ideas? I am pretty frustrated!</p>
<p>I don't, unfortunately, have access to any other SharePoint sites or I would try adding those to see whether this is a server side or a client side problem (I am inclined to think the latter).</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Mandy</p>

<h2>            I have been a WIP member for nearly 3 years, now I canot activate</h2>
                    <p>I have been stuck on v.1709/ b. 17025.1000 since installed manually from ISO download, since auto updates stopped at b. 16073 several months ago. I have been unable to update since, but with that exception, My Win10 Pro has been running fairly well. until
 I started getting a few glitches and so I did a clean boot and ran chkdsk, and when it booted up I got a message saying I was not activated. I ran the activation troubleshooter, and it said it found the license, but I had to install Win 10 Pro, which is what
 I am running already. I tried to use the feedback hub to report it, it said I had to sign-in to use the hub, so I clicked on sign-in and it showed you are already signed in, so I cannot enter feedback, I cannot activate, it wants me to BUY a license, that
 I have had since April 2015</p>
<p>Try to activate, I get this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be25ad65-417c-462b-a2ee-0c092701a4dc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be25ad65-417c-462b-a2ee-0c092701a4dc?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I next use the troubleshooter and get this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c6c4323d-bf52-4cf9-b412-0b61306c226a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c6c4323d-bf52-4cf9-b412-0b61306c226a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking my system I get this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c23ec6c-f632-4285-ba05-26c8844baa3c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c23ec6c-f632-4285-ba05-26c8844baa3c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot sign in unless I am activated, but I must be activated as I have not changed my OS and all I have done is run a Chkdsk /f</p>
<p>As you can see here, I am and have been a WIP member for nearly 3 years:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3ba7192b-45c4-4c04-b07d-089fd10dd708?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3ba7192b-45c4-4c04-b07d-089fd10dd708?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am signed in here, online, but cannot sign in on the hub, actually because I am already signed in and it shows me as signed in, yet keeps prompting me to sign-in and will not let me uses the hub as it does not recognize that I am signed in already, just
 like it wants me to install Win10 Pro, when I am already running Win10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please HELP!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>A couple of questions for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp;&nbsp; You say that you have been having update issues since 16073.&nbsp; That was before the latest public build which is now 16299.214 or beyond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp; You say you did a manual download of 17025?&nbsp; Did that ISO come from Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may be getting hit from an expiry date on an old Insider build.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since you PC obviously has an update block, if this was my PC, I might be tempted to use Media Creation Tool to install the latest public build and use that to leap frog to 17101.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming you already have a valid W10 license, your W10 PC should be already activated by Insider build all have about a 6 month expiry date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With this info, someone might be to provide more info for you.</p>

<p>i was logged into the wrong email account</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Yes it was. I could not get them so I went to the WIP&nbsp; download page and found the 17025 ISO</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp; You say you did a manual download of 17025?&nbsp; Did that ISO come from Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Yes, as I said above it was from the WIP Download page. </strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Yes, I am 'tempted' to do a lot of things, but not until I exhaust all else. This is my only machine and I cannot chance losing everything, which is what it says if I try to update using these other ISO files.&nbsp;</strong><strong>The 17025 has been
 running fine for months. </strong><strong>All I did was run a Chkdsk, and now my digital license is gone. I cannot login to the hub, yet it says I am logged in when I try. Something weird going on all from a clean boot and a chkdsk.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>As for updates, I don't get updates because the reports all say the update database is corrupt, but does not say where it is or how to fix it. The update troubleshooter says it is 'fixed', and if I do a manual search for updates,
 it reports "your device is up to date".&nbsp; I keep getting mixed messages</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming you already have a valid W10 license, your W10 PC should be already activated by Insider build all have about a 6 month expiry date.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I assume you saw the scan report that says it found my license, but to activate it I have to install Win10 Pro, which is what I am running. The PC has been activated since April of 2015. I have never had an expiry before, in almost 3 years running
 WIP. If they had an expiry, it must have auto-renewed with the updates that worked before 16073</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>With this info, someone might be to provide more info for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What info? The TS bot that did the scan found it, but it wants me to install what is already installed!</strong></p>

<p>Try installing any build (preferably the public build 16299.15) of Windows 10 Pro to a small partition, or to a VHDX file.&nbsp; It should auto-activate.&nbsp; You can just shrink C: by 64GB to make room to install a separate copy of Windows 10 Pro. Minimum disk space
 to install is 20GB, I believe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do the above you will prove that your device is still permanently licensed for Windows 10 Pro.
<em>Possibly </em>(seems unlikely) it will help activate your main install.&nbsp; Activation is not at all dependent on your Microsoft Account. It should activate even if you do not login with a Microsoft Account.&nbsp; But the Activation Troubleshooter can use the Microsoft
 Account the device license is linked with to help reactivate after a motherboard change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To try to get Windows Update to work for OS upgrades, try booting with Windows 10 install media. Use SHIFT-F10 from the first install screen that loads to get a Command Prompt. Delete C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution folder and subfolders with:</p>
<p><strong>rd /S /Q&nbsp;C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows appears on another drive letter in this mode, use that letter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From within Windows use an Administrator Command Prompt to run <strong>cleanmgr /sageset</strong> and select every checkbox.&nbsp; Then run
<strong>cleanmgr /sagerun</strong> to clear the preselected items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Feedback Hub, Reset it in Apps and then totally uninstall it. Then reinstall from the Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also switch to a local Windows login and then switch back to a Microsoft Account Windows login to try to straighten out the account issues that you see with Feedback Hub.</p>

            <p>You can create a Microsoft account, using just about any email address you want to use....you are NOT limited to using a Microsoft-related email address. If your current Microsoft account that is set up on your phone uses a gmail account as its login name,
 you should still be able to purchase&nbsp; and download apps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you want to change the account so that it is using your live.com email address instead =, you will need to hard reset the phone and set up the Microsoft account, when prompted to do so, using your live email address and its related password.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I can't really tell from the information provided in the question, if you have set up a security recovery email account or something else
</p>
<p>You can't change the account on phone without performing a hard reset your phone</p>
<p>
</p><p>The account needs to be a <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft account</a> the @live address which you add and make it the primary account not the Gmail</p>
<p>
</p><p>you state you can't log into your account but have not stated the reason why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not addressed in the above you need to provide a fuller and better descriptions as we don't have access to your phone so can't see what you are seeing or doing

<h2>            Virus that keeps installing itself.</h2>
                    Malware bytes detects it, and removes it. And I've looked into my local drive, and deleted all the setups. Uninstalled manually. Let Malware bytes uninstall it. But after a while it still shows up in my programs and features. And I scan and Malware bytes
 detects it again. And it just repeats the process.

            <p>Sorry, I was unaware that someone had replied. It's name was something like CssYsversion or something along those lines.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it was installed, it had text that would be links. What I mean is, your reply would have a link with this program installed. Link to random advertisement,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And when I had clicked on my browser.&nbsp;Sometimes it would&nbsp;direct me to "Your computer may have a virus" and it would keep doing it. And I wouldn't be able to get off the page. Regardless of me telling the site to stop sending notifications when I tried to
 exit out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even my anti virus software (Malwarebytes) would detect it as a PUP. But even when uninstalled it would redownload itself. So far it hasn't done it again. If you do know how to stop these types of problems it would be nice to know in the future.</p>

            <p>P.S </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did even try manually uninstalling it. Antivirus, and even going through control panel and uninstalling it. It seems it did indeed reinstall itself, however this time I have not noticed and off things about my browser.&nbsp;Searching up the virus through my
 Local Disk. And I had just found out that it's called CSysSecure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I do know this is a PUP. Because I have uninstalled countless of times and when I did, my results would always be the same. My browser would be back to normal working as intended. I use Chrome, and if you ask, I did disable and delete all my extensions.
 I am aware that they are able to cause these things as well.</p>

I am running XPSP2. I have tried all the drivers from Nokia and no luck. I can't find any place that I can download the drivers for the MyBat cable.<br />
<br />
Also, my OS sees this cable as a USB Serial Controller.<br />
<br />
How do I get this cable to work and what phone manager is the best for my phone???<br />
<br />
TIA<br />
<br />
Bill

            There is nothing wrong if you can see the cable as a com port it is working. 6030 is not design as plug and play. The software what you use will find the 6030.

            No, you <strong>cannot disable</strong> find my phone service. It is a <strong>
necessary</strong> service, its because if the phone is stolen then thief could disable it.<br />

    <title>Outlook 2010 and gmail are not syncing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maryjammerman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 and gmail are not syncing</h2>
                    I recently changed my ISP to Frontier.com. Previously my ISP was a local wireless provider. I use gmail but access my messages through Outlook 2010. Now none of my emails are showing up in Outlook. I can access them via gmail web, but I prefer to use Outlook.
 I had to set up a Frontier Email; however, I don't want to change email addresses with all my contacts so want to remain with gmail.com and Outlook. The error message I get when setting up/changing on Outlook is the the server is not connecting. Thanks!

<p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>I'll try my best to answer your questions.</p>
<p>1) No, the gmail account is not in Outlook as I removed it and tried to add it back in, but that failed.</p>
<p>2) yes.</p>
<p>3) As of last evening the error message had two parts:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Log onto incoming email server (POP3): your email server rejected your login. Verify your user name and password for the account in Account Settings. The server responded: -ERR authorization failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Send test e-mail: Cannot send the message. Verify the email address in your account properties. The server responded: 554 5.7.1 Error: The message could not be send because your email program needs to identify itself to the sending mail server. Please
 see http://support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took a photo of these messages with my phone! Previous messages had more to so with not contecting to the server.</p>

<br />
Thank you for replying.<br />
<br />
As mentioned in the error message, it looks like you might have entered incorrect credentials (email address/password).<br />
<br />
Let's&nbsp;try to log into webmail using the same credentials and check if it you're able to access your emails.<br />

I look forward to your reply to assist you further.<br />

<h2>            Is there any way to push calendar items to an exchange calendar&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an Exchange calendar at work, and have been using Google Sync to sync it between my computers and my phone (WP8).&nbsp; With the uncertainty around Google Sync, i've been trying to accomplish this task within the MS applications.&nbsp; I've been able to subscribe
 to the calendar, so when i change the Exchange calendar, the hotmail calendar on my phone updates as well.&nbsp; But i can't push items from the phone to the exchange calendar like I can with my google calendar.&nbsp; My firm won't allow personal devices on their network,
 so setting up the exchange calendar directly is not an option.&nbsp; Is there any way to do this, or am i stuck with Google Sync?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jim</p>

            <p>Hi Mark:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of my calendar entries are made in Microsoft Outlook 2010. The entries are either manually entered in Outlook, or are placed there through acceptance of invitations sent through e-mail (.ics files)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a google calendar, and also enter details there manually.&nbsp; Using Google Sync, I can keep the Outlook calendar and the google calendar synchronized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently picked up a Nokia 822 WP8 device (which is fantastic, i must say).&nbsp;&nbsp; I have the phoned linked to my MS account.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also have set up my google mail account, which allows me to see the google calendar, and still allows me to enter calendar details
 on both the phone, and on Outlook, and both calendars stay synchronized.&nbsp; I can also sync my hotmail calendar to the google calendar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I sent the first note, I downloaded and installed the Outlook connector, and i now have my hotmail/MS account syncd up to Outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, now I can see my hotmail calendar in Outlook, but I don't know how to get the Outlook and hotmail calendars to
 sync without having Google in the middle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi JimFekete,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you please clarify what you meant by "<em>So, now I can see my hotmail calendar in Outlook, but I don't know how to get the Outlook and hotmail calendars to sync without having Google in the middle.</em>"?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, I advise that you remove your Google account first and let us know if your Outlook/Hotmail calendars will now sync successfully. You can also reconfigure your accounts by following this link:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Hotmail/mobile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Go mobile with Hotmail</a></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you encounter an error while synching your accounts, kindly post the exact message here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Well, I'm 99% of the way to a solution here.&nbsp; I've eliminated the google calendar.&nbsp; However, I'm now using two calendars.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For personal stuff, i'm using my hotmail calendar, which I can update on my phone or in outlook,&nbsp;and see changes in both</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For work stuff, i'm using my exchange calendar, which I can update in outlook, and by publishing the calendar and subscribing to it in hotmail, I can see it on my phone as well.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On both outlook and my phone,&nbsp;I can see both calendars, so I can see all my appointments.&nbsp; So this is an acceptable solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I would like to be able to put appointments on my exchange calendar from my phone.&nbsp; I haven't figured out how to do that yet, or whether it can even be done.&nbsp; I haven't been able to set up my work exchange account on the phone, because i have to
 reach the network through VPN.&nbsp; Somehow, this wasn't an issue with Google Sync.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any additional perspective would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Sure.&nbsp; I published it to the internet and subscribed to it in Outlook.com.&nbsp; Exact steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using Outlook2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Calendar View, on the Home tab in the Ribbon, go to the Share section and select Publish Online, from the dropdown select "Publish on Office.Com".&nbsp; In the following dialog box, select "Previous 30 days through next 60 Days", Full Details and "Anyone can
 subscribe.."&nbsp; Click OK, Outlook contacts web server and publishes calendar, and provides a webcal:// URL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, go into the calendar page of Outlook.com, select "Subscribe", enter the URL into the appropriate input box, hit OK and there you go.&nbsp; The Outlook calendar now can be seen in Outlook.com, and since this account is synced to my phone (WP8) I can see the
 calendar entries on the phone.&nbsp; I can't modify the calendar on the phone or on Outlook.com, only in Outlook2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the issue I'm working now is that when the calendar is viewed in Outlook.com and/or the phone, it isn't complete, not all calendar entries are there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>even better would be&nbsp;a way to sync the Outlook Calendar directly.&nbsp; I know that if I could just set up the account with Exchange credentials it would work exactly like that, unfortunately I haven't figured out how to reach the Exchange server yet.&nbsp; On the
 phone, i'm asked for e-mail and account password, but those are not sufficient to reach the server.&nbsp; WHen I was using Google sync, it asked for the server information (just like Outlook2010 does), and using that information I could sync my Outlook 2010 calendar
 with my Google calendar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for looking into this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jim</p>

<p>Usually when you move objects in a form or report (objects like labels or text boxes or check boxes etc) around you have to snap them to a special "space". These of which are laid out in a grid format and you can merge etc etc.</p>
<p>But I want to put a check box on top of a picture in a specific place. Is it possible to make the check box move freely so that I can do so?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, I was wrong (at least in Access 2010 - what I have available to test right now).&nbsp; You CAN overlay an image control with a checkbox and have the checkbox be seen.&nbsp; So, you can do exactly what Tom said with the Top and Left of the control's.</p>
