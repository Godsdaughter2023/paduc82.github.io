<h2>            Unrealistic activity reporting for xbox</h2>
                    <p>Lots of questions about activity reports not showing correct timings and I am in the same boat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My sons activity reports show him being on longer than he actually is.&nbsp; For example it shows him online for 15 hours on a Wednesday and it cant be correct because :-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xbox and W10 pc are not in his room. </p>
<p>Time zone is correct in settings</p>
<p>Xbox is turned off when he isnt playing</p>
<p>He sleeps for 8 hours and is at school for 8 hours. If he did NOTHING else the maximum he could possibly be on that day is 8 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone shed any light on this? </p>
<p>
</p><p>He claims that the Xbox updates his games when its switched off - is this true and if it does would it contribute to his activity report?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>He has games like Fortnite on his phone too - if he played these on his phone, does this add to his activity time? Activity only shows the Xbox and the PC and I an struggling to see why the report shows unrealistic usage.</p>

            The xbox can be setup to update while off, but I'm unsure if it contributes to activity time.

<h2>            San Andreas Graphics not working right, images attached</h2>
                    <p>So I have recently decided to buy this game for a really good price but the graphics are disappointing and I can not work out whether it is the setting on my computer or within the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried changing the settings as much as I can but nothing seems to change. Everything else works fine, but I have bought the game for the good graphics which were praised by many compared to the old edition.
<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">Has anyone experienced similar problems and found a solution? I am not a very experienced gamer and therefore rely on anyone here to help me please, are there any other settings I have to change?

<p>You need to try downloading the game again. </p>
<p>You can try to use Compatibility options until the cows come home and they are<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> not going to help with the texture issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The problem has nothing to do with compatibility</span>. As I said previously, my Intel HD4600 runs the game poorly, but the graphics still look good.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">[EDIT:</span></em> Testing the game again, I see the stutter is as bad with low resolution as it is @1680x1050 when using the HD4600 gpu.</p>
<p>- <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Also note that an recent updated re-release version of
<em>any </em>game is not going to have compatibility issues with Win10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>- And more... I just found that <em>3D Mark</em> will be releasing a special benchmark tool for integrated graphics next month. Keep</p>
<p>a watch for it if your are interested. ]</p>
<br />
<p>
</p><p>- Have you monitored the games frame rates ? Assuming the missing textures are the only problem and the game is running smoothly,
</p>
<p>your gpu is doing it's job, and should run the game successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I didn't focus on your GTA-SA <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">setup screens</span> previously. They have more options than the originals (including Social Club), and the</p>
<p>graphics may look a bit better, so they may need a little bit more processing power than the original version.</p>
<p>What is more likely to cause issues with frame rates are <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
the other new options.</span></p>
<p>I had to install a Draw Distance mod with the original version, and as I said previously, this takes a big hit on processing power, so</p>
<p>once you get the textures in the game you may need to reduce<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> Draw Distance</span> from 100%.
<p>(in that order) will also have an effect on the frame rates.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"I have paid over £1000 for my laptop and I would have hoped it is more than sufficient for gaming."
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is is adequate, and better than integrated gpu's that preceded it, but 'more than good enough' may be stretching it.</p>
<p>Games are not created equal, and <em>no</em> laptop without a dedicated graphics processor is truly a 'gaming' machine, regardless of the</p>
<p>mfg putting a 'gaming' tag on the label. Not at this stage of integrated graphics processing technology .</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"it has a total of 4.5gb gpu"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Laptop mfg's have been using this bogus marketing scam of calling the RAM that is 'dedicated' to graphics 'Video RAM' for years.
</p>
<p>Your laptop has no VRAM. Integrated graphics use part of the machines system RAM. In this case 4.5GB of the systems 8GB
</p>
<p>is apparently 'dedicated' to graphics. This is not the same as the VRAM that is used on dedicated graphic cards.</p>
<p>All this means is the system reserves that amount of RAM for gaming, which by the way is more than your gpu is likely to be able</p>
<p>to use anyway.</p>
<p>If you have not read the review I linked to, do have a look.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"told me that it is more than good enough for these games."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Just because the game was released in '04 does not mean it was well optimised for integrated graphics processors.</p>
<p>If fact the opposite can be true, and both GTA-SA and GTA4 were poorly optimised for PC from day one (they were 'ported' over</p>
<p>from console versions to PC), even with dedicated graphics cards.</p>
<p>Because of this they need more gpu grunt to run well than they might have if developed for PC first.</p>
<p>I have a couple of old games that won't even run on integrated graphics because integrated graphics has no VRAM, and while</p>
<p>those games may not use much VRAM the game is coded in such a way as to prevent the game from running if it does not</p>
<p>detect the minimum amount of VRAM it requires.</p>
<p>[EDIT: ...<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> I see HP have another variant on this model that has Nvidia dedicated graphics with 4GB VRAM]</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"Forza Horizon 4 demo it looked pretty good "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Many games, particularly games with a big on line component have lower requirements for low graphics settings relative</p>
<p>to maximum graphics settings. The FIFA and COD games are two good examples.</p>
<p>However, many other games have a somewhat small gap between minimum and 'recommended' system requirements. This is why</p>
<p>I said it's difficult to suggest games that will run well on your machine earlier.</p>
<p>eg- The game <em>Crysis</em> was released in '07 and it was a 'standard' for testing a machines graphics capabilities for years after because</p>
<p>the developers set the graphics bar for the maximum graphics settings so high.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>'Looking good' is easy. eg- in game video sequences can look better than the game (more common in old games) because they
</p>
<p>don't require much processing power. Equally, loading the game and standing in one place can look great, but try moving around</p>
<p>and things change. This is because games build a 3D scene in real time, and this is what requires processing power.</p>
<p>

<p>For some unidentified reason, my computer no longer shuts down as it is meant to do. Each time I try and shut down, programs close as usual, it logs me off successfully, but it<em>hangs</em> on the 'Shutting down...' screen until I turn the computer off
 manually - even in<em>safe mode</em> . I could leave the computer on all night, and it would still be the same by the time I woke up.</p>
<p>I have no idea what's causing this, so help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            That error indicates an issue with your NTFS file system and you can usually fix it by running chkdsk /r from the XP Recovery Console.<br />
<br />
If you have no genuine bootable XP installation CD from which you can boot into the XP Recovery Console or are not sure what kind of bootable CDs you have, make a bootable XP Recovery Console CD and be sure what you have (no XP media required).<br />
<br />
Maybe someday the XP forums "Ask a question" dialog will ask these questions automatically when a new thread is started so I do not have to ask them every single time.&nbsp; It might even be possible to resolve an issue in a single reply when enough information
 is provided.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
<br />
If your system has a working CD/DVD drive (let's pretend it does) here is how to make a bootable XP Recovery Console CD and run chkdsk /r from then:<br />
<br />
<p>Use the XP Recovery Console to verify the file system on your HDD and correct any problems&nbsp;and then try to boot your system - this may be all you need to do. &nbsp;Or, you are welcome to&nbsp;just start trying things that might work.</p>
<p>Boot into the Windows Recovery Console using a bootable XP installation CD.</p>
<p>If you have no bootable XP media (or are not sure what you have) create a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD and be sure.</p>
<p>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come with a store bought system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</p>
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig</a></p>
<p>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>When installing ImgBurn, DO NOT install the Ask toolbar.<br />
</p>
<p>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a></p>
<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt or read about the XP Recovery Console here:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/recovery_console_cmds.mspx?mfr=true</a></p>
<p>A good idea before starting things is to first verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.</p>
<p>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any&nbsp;problems on the afflicted drive.</p>
<p>Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;It will not hurt anything to run it.</p>
<p>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</p>
<p>chkdsk C: /r</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear
 to go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</p>
<p>Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer.</p>
<p>You do not have to adjust the BIOS again to boot on the HDD since the CD will not be present.</p>

            How did those Microsoft Support Engineer ideas work out?<br />
<br />
You should be in good shape though...<br />
<br />
Here is what the Microsoft TechNet says about your error:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc939018.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc939018.aspx</a><br />
<br />
Your symptom is classic after using the power button.<br />
<br />
To most folks, it doesn't really matter to much what the article says (although I have read it a few times and it is good reading).&nbsp; You just really need to what caused it and how to fix it.<br />
<br />
There is always some risk of data loss when running chkdsk /r, but I have never had an issue with it.&nbsp; If you are nervous about it, somebody else will have to tell you how to make a backup of your stuff (I choose to never go there), but that may not work either
 since your file system is obviously corrupted and needs repair.<br />
<br />
But you must also look at the cause...&nbsp; there was a power interruption or somebody used the power button and that is not a good idea (although sometimes you just gotta).&nbsp; That would make this a self inflicted wound - not an XP problem.&nbsp; That is why I always
 ask the <span style="font-style: italic">power</span> question...&nbsp; The answer is almost always
<br />
You are going to have to run chkdsk /r sooner or later to fix it, so it might as well be sooner.<br />
<br />
Make the bootable RC CD as indicated, tell your Packard Bell (through the BIOS or some F key when it starts up) to look at the CD drive as the first boot device and follow the instructions.<br />
<br />

            I have fixed it so many times, my earlier reply with instructions is just a one handed copy/paste operation for me.<br />
<br />
The MSE reply number one begins with the word "Try", so that rules that out for me.<br />
<br />
The MSE reply number two requires an XP CD-ROM which most people on this planet do not have so that rules that out for just about everybody that come here with a question.<br />
<br />
If you hang around and wait, somebody else may come up with some other ideas for your entertainment!<br />

            <p>Hello Jordan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this stage, provided that a restore has not been run on the machine, I would recommend obtaining a USB drive cage so that you can put the hard disk from your old computer into it.&nbsp; You would then plug the drive cage into the USB port of the new computer
 and recover the data from the drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I did all of the following steps above and i messaged and called my contacts and they all were able to answer except the contact im having this issue with. My contacts have also said that they sometimes see me unavailable even when im online and that my
 messages sometimes take quite a while. I can still see the contact i cant get&nbsp; ahold through being online and he can pick up when i call him yet he cant get my messages. I checked my wifi and phone and they work fine so i know they arent the issue.&nbsp;

<p>I have just installed fresh copy of Windows 10 Pro using media creation tool on June 6. I have installed the updates. My sticky notes keeps closing/crashing on every 10 minute. I have to re-open it on every 10 minutes, however the data is not lost. Any permanent

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apps crashes are commonly being driven by corrupted files or due to its outdated version. You can try to check if there's a new update for the Sticky Notes app in Windows Store. Install the update if there's any. This should do the trick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information, we would like to know if you made any modifications/configurations on your computer prior to the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I start up my laptop I sometimes get a blue/black screen. The power light goes on and the backlight on the keyboard momentarily goes on, then off. But I don't see an image on my screen. If I let the battery drain and restart, and press the ctl button
 I get back the image on the screen. Is there a glitch with Windows 10 operating system? Do I need to download a driver? I can't afford this laptop to do this, it is less than 2 years old.</p>

    <title>UDP socket error 10040 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> presstek - jaroslav stekl  say:</h3>
<h2>            UDP socket error 10040</h2>
                    Our application receives data from a DSP board on a UDP socket. The receiving loop starts with the target amount and then continues requesting amounts decreased by what has already been obtained. Normally, the individual pieces match the sizes sent by
 the board. Randomly, the recv() fails with the 10040 error. At that point, the available amount (via peek) is not matching the sent size, and is usually either a huge number or a multiple of the individual sends. We're running this on Win 8, however can see
 it with XP SP3, as well.

    <title>Am I out of luck&#63; XPS 420 - Windows 7 No Dell Devices - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rdc consulting  say:</h3>
<h2>            Am I out of luck&#63; XPS 420 - Windows 7 No Dell Devices</h2>
                    <p>Back ground:</p>
<p>Dell XPS420</p>
<p>Original O/S Vista Home</p>
<p>Upgraded to Windows 7 Professional</p>
<p>&nbsp;(Not purchased from Dell)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I first upgraded from Vista to Win7.</p>
<p>Install went well. And I still had all my Dell devices.</p>
<p>In particular Device for USB 2.0 ports and Sound/Recording (Sigma)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I had to re-install Windows 7. This time none of the Dell Devices/Drivers showed up.</p>
<p>Have (appear to be generic) devices to work Sound, USB, BUT not those for USB 2.0 or Recording.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have original Dell Device CD but will not install.</p>
<p>Complains "wrong O/S".</p>
<p>Tried to download devices/install from Dell site.</p>
<p>Again - "wrong O/S".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know all the original Dell devices were working and upgraded when I first install Windows 7, so I know versioning isn't the problem.</p>
<p>Can't seem to get an answer from Dell Support (Out of warranty? Win7 not bought from them?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is my question/s:</p>
<p>Can I still install those devices? Have CD.</p>
<p>(.inf file won't work - complains - not valid file)</p>
<p>Can I somehow get drivers that will load from some place else?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Or am I 'out of luck'?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will installing a separate 3rd party Sound card help? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Are you sure that you downloaded right drivers for the right architecture of Windows 7 you are running (32 or 64 bit)?</p>

            <p>Yes.</p>
<p>I deliberately stuck with 32-bit Windows 7 so this would not be an issue. (It is an old box.)</p>
<p>The original O/S was Vista 32-bit, the upgrade was 32-bit. </p>
<p>The Dell devices/drivers on the CD are 32-bit.</p>
<p>The Dell drivers I tried to install from Dell Support are 32-bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again. Everything worked after I originally installed Win7 over Vista. Which was mildly odd as I had to reformat the HD. But there they were -&nbsp;I had all the sound/recording and USB 2.0 drivers.</p>
<p>[Side note: I'm likely missing other Dell specific drivers too - but so far&nbsp;I haven't found an issue with anything else.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Re-installing wipped them out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps there is some kind of registry setting to force Windows Device Manager to see I have a sound/recording 'device' and load the driver to support it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm at a lost. I'm used to the old days. Have an OEM&nbsp;driver - install it. Why is Windows giving me a problem? &lt;g&gt;</p>

            Use the CD that came with your motherboard, the Ethernet drivers will be on there. If you don't have that disc any more, you can download the drivers from Intel's website on a computer with a working connection and transfer them to the computer on a USB
 drive.<br />
http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?agr=Y&amp;DwnldID=18196&amp;ProdId=3066&amp;lang=eng should be the drivers you need.

            I have this same issue. I have a gigabyte EX58-UD3LR motherboard and when I upgraded from Vista 64 bit to windows 7 64 bit, the internet wouldn't work. So I used my laptop to download the driver for windows 7 64 bit and installed it on my other computer
 (the one with the issues). And now my network icon at the bottom doesn't have an X and looks as though it is connected to the internet but when I try to use the internet it doesn't work at all. Skype is the only thing that connects. Not even Internet Explorer
 connects. so I wanted to know if there were any other known issues for this and if so are there any solutions other than to put vista back on my computer.

            Hi, I have a new toshiba laptop and there is an exclamation next to the laptop icon in control panel. &nbsp;It says " the driver for ethernet controller is not is not installed." &nbsp;This is a new windows 7 that came loaded when I bought it. &nbsp;So I went to Trouble
 Shoot and it said " trouble shooting was unable to auto fix all of the issues found. &nbsp;You can find more details below, Ethernet controller doesn't ha a driver" &nbsp;I can get on the internet just fine, email, everything. &nbsp;What is this problem and should I be concerned.
 &nbsp;I do have problem with the scan feature of my also new HP 6500 all in one printer/fax/scanner, is this related? &nbsp;Go slow with answers, I'm good but Im not a hot rod. &nbsp;thanks, B

<h2>            Flickering at the top row of pixels on my Surface Book 2</h2>
                    <p>Hello Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So upon purchasing my Surface Book 2 and setting it up, I have realized there is a flicker on the top of the screen. Only happens when on battery and I already tried a factory reset. If I move the cursor actively or use my Surface Pen the nothing happens
 but as soon as I stop it starts to do the same flickering. Sometimes it also stops on its own but it comes back in a few minutes. Does anybody knows why this happens?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help?</p>

            <p>Hi <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/2fb98750-3010-437b-8ed6-5e55430f634b">

<p><em><strong>"I am not certain what function this controller has as I can access the internet"</strong></em><br />
You problably have several network controlers - that's very common for years - on your PC. The one that currently doesn't work is an Ethernet one that is used to connect your PC to a network using a cable. Next to it you probably have a Wireless network controller.
 If the latter works you have access to your local network and/or Internet even if your Ethernet controller doesn't work. Of course if your Wireless controller was having that problem but not your Ethernet controller you would still have access to your local
 network and/or Internet but using a cable that time.</p>

<p><strong>Windows Device Manager error codes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>See <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943104/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Description of Code 10-related errors that Device Manager generates in Windows-based computers</a>. In a nutshell it's usually due to and incompatible, outdated, or corrupted device driver.</li><li><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310123/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Explanation of error codes generated by Device Manager</a></li></ul>
<p><strong>Approach to fix the problem</strong></p>
<p>Try&nbsp;updating the driver automatically ([Win]+X / Device Manager / Network adapter / Double-click on your Broadcom NetXtreme device / Driver tab / Click Update driver)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this doesn't work - i.e. Windows doesn't find a more recent driver.<br />
NB: If you already know the <u>exact</u> model of your Broadcom NetXtreme controller you&nbsp;can skip steps 1&nbsp;and 2</p>
<ol>
<li>Take note of the Hardware Id of your device ([Win]+X / Device Manager / Network adapter / Double-click on your Broadcom NetXtreme device /&nbsp;Details tab / Select Hardware Ids in Property / Right-click&nbsp;2nd Value / Copy)</li><li>Open your preferred Internet browser and search the Net for the Hardware Id you just Copied - Paste&nbsp;the value&nbsp;to avoid any mistake. The results you'll find should help you identify what the exact model you have - there are several according to the
<a href="http://www.broadcom.com/support/ethernet_nic/downloaddrivers.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Broadcom Ethernet NIC Driver Downloads</a> page</li><li>Go to the above page to download&nbsp;your device&nbsp;driver paying attention to "32 bit" vs. "x64" and to the comments for the driver</li><li>In File Explorer go to the folder where the new Broadcom driver was downloaded and double-clic on the .zip file to extract all files</li><li>Install the new driver ([Win]+X / Device Manager / Network adapter / Double-click on your Broadcom NetXtreme device /&nbsp;Driver tab / Click Update Driver... / Browse my computer for driver software / Click Browse... and navigate to the folder where the driver
 was unZipped / Click Next...)</li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Start Menu Disappears</h2>
                    <p>This has been a recurring problem for me and is getting more ridiculous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had the Windows 10 start menu, Cortana, Edge, Calendar, Notifications and Volume (i.e. everything that) pop-ups on the task bar disappear on me so many times I've lost count.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually this happens immediately after I start up (i.e. the menus are missing straight away) and a quick visit to the Techmesto website using the CMD prompt resolves it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>However, after logging in this morning and using my start menu as per normal, it all suddenly disappeared. More importantly, the Techmesto work around is not working!!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This disappearing menus act usually occur after an update. Also after installing the latest update yesterday, my computer seeming failed to shutdown last night. I only discovered that it was STILL shutting down this morning...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The previous time, Avast Grimefighter probably deleted some files that corrupted the pop-ups. I got rid of Grimefighter and everything was fine. I did upgrade my Avast antivirus recently (~2 weeks ago) but everything was OK until this update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can Microsoft do anything about this disappearing menus act permanently!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Techmesto workaround is not effective, what can be done next?</p>

<p>I have uninstalled, reinstalled, checked my microphone, I have ethernet.........I have selected microphones and speakers that have always worked.......and yet, after fooling around for 5 hours I cannot get the test call to replay audio!</p>
<p>With that said: I AM able to use my webcam to play a movie of me talking and that works and will replay.</p>
<p>What is happening?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            I have a similar problem. I've been operating on Windows Vista with a fairly up-to-date Logitech USB web cam with microphone. I was forced to update Skype to 7.36.0.150, after which, everything kept working except for the receiving party not hearing us.
 I've checked all the microphone settings. The microphone shows up as being sensitive to sound in Audio Settings, but it does not pass the free test call. I have un-installed and re-installed Skype, and the problem is still the same.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Same problem with my Sony Vaio with windows Vista after being forced to update Skype. The built in microphone doesn't work anymore, but worked before the update. &nbsp;The built in microphone works when used with another program to record voice. Seems like Skype
 has a bug and hope it can be fixed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>thanks for the input</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping it can be fixed too. &nbsp;I stay in close touch with family in China and Australia and Skype calling has been a wonderful capability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How about this. &nbsp;I was working in China when my daughter was having her first baby, at home with midwives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to watch and be part of the whole thing for several hours. Saw my beautiful new grandson being born in Toronto.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Skype realized the good it can do I wonder would it want to find a way to arrange tech support and keep us talking (and viewing) around the globe</p>

<p>Hi David, &nbsp;I am far far from being on a technological par with what you've written, but I appreciate your sharing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>With family as far away as China and Australia, not being able to use Skype calling is very disappointing, at best.</p>

<p>I am having exactly the same problem. Running Skype on Windows Vista with Logitech Webcam used to work perfectly. Now with latest Skype update microphone in Skype doesn't work. Microphone is fine since it still works fine outside of Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any chance of this being fixed by Skype team any time soon?</p>

    <title>Reinstalling bluetooth driver for windows ten, and some other annoying - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joseph&#35;127  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reinstalling bluetooth driver for windows ten, and some other annoying issues i need help with</h2>
                    <p>Alright, so I kind of went too far down the rabbit hole with this one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got these bluetooth headphones, and I've been trying to connect them to my ASUS laptop for a week or so. The toggle switch to turn bluetooth on and off doesnt show up in my settings, so i searched for help. I found a "guide" that was supposed to help,
 it just said to go to Device Manager and update the bluetooth driver to the latest software. This didn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a question asked by someone on a forum that described my situation quite well, as well as an answer. The answer was to uninstall all bluetooth related devices from device manager, and restart the laptop because device manager was supposed to just
 automatically reinstall it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This just made the situation worse, though. I've just restarted my laptop but nothing i deleted has been reinstalled. The "bluetooth and other devices" menu still shows up in my settings, but the toggle still isnt there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up going and installing a bluetooth driver from Intel's software but it hasnt done anything. Nothing new has popped up apart from the installer, which ive already gone and used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a thorough, easy to understand walkthrough on how to fix my situation, and how to get the headphones to connect to the laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, its worth mentioning, i know the headphones work just fine because they connect to my phone just fine, with no audio problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help? Thank you</p>

            Good morning, Joe!
<br />
<br />I can tell you, sometimes these things aren’t cut and dry, but I’ll do what I can to try to troubleshoot and figure out a solution for you!
<br />
<br />Let’s give windows troubleshooter a shot. Click start, type “troubleshoot” and launch it.Find Bluetooth and run the troubleshooter, see if it can find the issue. 
<br />
<br />Next, click on start, and type "services" and right click and run as admin. Find any and all bluetooth services, and make sure they are started. 
<br />
<br />______
<br />
<br />What’s the make and model of your PC? Click start, and type “system information” and open it. Next to system model you should see the model I need. 
<br />
<br />What version of windows are you running? Click start, and type “winver” and hit enter, a box should pop up. 1709? 1803? 
<br />
<br />Let me know, we'll figure this out!
<br />
<br />- C
