    <title>My Surface pro 4 won&#39;t charge - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hananrahamim  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Surface pro 4 won&#39;t charge</h2>
                    <p>So I recently bought a surface pro 4. It was OK the first few days then I left it for around a week. Today I tried using it again and the battery refuses to get charged at all. All it says is "plugged in, not charging". When I unplug the charger it shuts
 off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to leave it for around 8 hours connected to the charger, went to work and came back, still didn't work. So I felt like I have no choice but to do a complete reset for the system. I did, and yet, no results. Still, the device recognize the spu but
 won't charge whatsoever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

Try plugging the power into the sp4 upsidedown with the power cord facing up.

Since the power plug on the sp4 is proprietary where do you plug in the cell phone charger?

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />To uninstall the Facebook app, you can click Start, then find the Facebook app, right-click it and click Uninstall.
<br />
<br />If this doesn't work, you'll need to click Start, type "uninstall" and select the first option. Find the Facebook app in the list and select it, then click "Uninstall".
<br />
<br />Hopefully this helps! Please let me know if you need more assistance. Thanks!

How in the world to I get to "Live agent"? I had one going, but it was cut off, am not sure how. I can't get back to "live agent". Your link only offers a virtual agent option. Have tried that many times and it's totally useless. Where is the "live chat" option?

    <title>Windows 10 Hibernate problems since Creators update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davex4  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Hibernate problems since Creators update</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I have an Acer Aspire 5560 laptop that has been upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 Pro V10.0.15063. (32 bit.) When I used Windows 7, hibernate worked fine. Similarly, when I upgraded to Windows 10 hibernate worked OK. However, since installing the
 Creators update, hibernate does not work all of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is somewhat puzzling is that 60% of the time I hibernate, and when I resume working, everything is as should be. All the files I left open and web pages are there - i.e. hibernate has worked correctly. The other 40% of the time when I resume from hibernate
 my laptop boots up from scratch as though I have previously shut down which I did not. Obviously I have then lost everything I left open. Also when this happens my wifi comes up as disabled which I have to reset through the laptop's keyboard, and my default
 browser is minimized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched through the community and the web and notice that many people have had a similar problem, but not where hibernate sometimes works and other times it does not. Nothing has changed on my laptop insomuch I have not installed any new software/hardware
 (or updates), just Windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried unchecking fast start up, checked that all drivers are up to date, ran power troubleshooter, changed all hibernate settings to 'do nothing' shutdown, reboot and changed do nothing back to hibernate, but I still the problems persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be grateful if someone can help me and restore my faith in Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Well, no one from Microsoft seems to be interested in this problem anymore, but I have found a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you read my original post, I stated that when Hibernation failed and my laptop rebooted instead, then my wifi would be disabled and I had to reset it. So I went to Device Manager / Opened&nbsp; Network Adapters / right click on Wireless Driver / Properties
 / Power Management / and unchecked 'allow the computer to turn off this device to save power'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the same to the Ethernet Driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This improved the situation, however hibernate would still fail at times, but nowhere near as bad as before. I then searched for updated drivers, but the maker of my laptop only had old drivers available. So, I went to the manufacturer of the drivers site,
 in my case Broadcom, and downloaded their Wireless Lan and Ethernet drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once downloaded, instead of executing the software, I right clicked on the download and selected 'Troubleshoot compatibility'. I let Windows do it thing and then clicked on apply fixes. Made sure 'allow the computer to turn of this device to save power'
 was unchecked on the new drivers and hibernation now works correctly.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>USB Device not recognised - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            USB Device not recognised</h2>
                    When I plug my Golf Buddy VT3 into my desktop USB socket (HP Envy 23 All-in-One) running Windows 8.1 (also happened in Windows 8), I receive the message that it is not recognised because of an "invalid Configuration Descriptor". &nbsp;It works perfectly on
 my laptop running Windows 7 but I have loaned the laptop to a friend for a while. &nbsp;Any ideas how to fix?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Apologies, having spotted a reply to a similar post that stated "you probably have a defective USB port", I tried a different USB socket on my PC and it happily accepted the device.</div>

            Many thanks for your prompt response Eliyas. &nbsp;As I added to my original post, plugging the device into a different USB socket on my PC caused the correct drivers to be loaded and I have since been able to view the content of the device on its management
 software package. &nbsp;The offending USB socket is quite happy to accept a USB storage device but was obviously not happy to read my Golf Buddy

            <p>My guess is that the port is not able to provide enough power to your&nbsp;Golf buddy. If that's the case, you will be able to use&nbsp;a self powered HUB in between to get the device to work.</p>

<p><strong>I listen to audio books and have been for the last 10 years or so. &nbsp;I download from the library via OverDrive or Audible.com but since I have Windows 7 and "must" use Media 12, my books do not automatically go to the Media Library. &nbsp;In the "old media
 11" you could manually add all or some of your books by browsing your files. &nbsp;But now there doesn't seem to be that option and when I searched "help" it said that when you open media 12 it will search and load your books for ou....but it doesn't. &nbsp;I want to
 do it manually -- &nbsp;So my books are in my music folders, like before, but I can't access them through media 12. &nbsp;Why did they eliminate the option to add audio files in the new media 12 and since I can't go back to media 11 or earlier, because of Win 7, I am
 at a loss. &nbsp;Loading books to my mp3 player was so easy and I spent all last night trying to search for any answer, with no luck. &nbsp;I'm sure others are having this same problem and I hope that it is just a small fix.....HELP</strong></p>

<p>Didn't get back to check this forum until today....</p>
<p>I already have a default folder for my music, just like you had to have in the previous versions of Windows Media...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found the primary answer that will help any others wanting ALL their music files added to the Windows Media 12 Library...(Just creating a default folder isn't enough with Media 12)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You have to clear the "CACHE" for Win Media 12...</strong></p>
<p><strong>MAKE SURE TO&nbsp;</strong><strong>RUN: &nbsp;%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Media Player</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a small addition to your "To-Do List" every time you use Windows Media 12 -- Kind of a nuisance BUT when you do this it will make sure that all of your music/audio files are automatically added to the Library whenever you download them either via
 Audible.com or OverDrive or any other download sites as I do...</p>
<p><strong>** FYI</strong> -- Be sure to write down this "run file" because after you run it and the Windows Media 12 Cache is cleared,&nbsp;<strong>ALL your music files will be added without a problem</strong>. &nbsp;Of course you need a default folder, but those that
 use Win Media should know this already....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I always search HELP and any other forums before asking but this time I was at my wit's end trying everything!!</p>
<p>Thanks again, Debbie aka meowebkat</p>
<p>p.s. &nbsp;Would be nice if Windows had thought of this when they updated their Media Player or at least a fix that would "delete" the cache everytime you exit Windows Media 12...I used to proof programs and would try everything before releasing something new.
 &nbsp;Programmers need to not think so technical and think "user-friendly"</p>

            If you stop the <strong>Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service</strong> (Start - type&nbsp;<strong>services.msc</strong> - Enter) before clearing WMP's library, then you probably only need to do this once, and not every time you use WMP.<br />

    <title>Windows 7 Can&#39;t detect external drives plugged into usb ports - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> web_tracker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Can&#39;t detect external drives plugged into usb ports</h2>
                    
<p>This problem is similar to other problems posted yet mine is some what unique. My problem does not appear to be a driver related problem. I am using a IDE to usb converter attachment that, has it own separate&nbsp;power supply that plugs into my ide drive. The
 ide converter plugs into the ide port and has a cable that plugs into the usb port of my computer. I am using windows 7 Pro (64 bit)&nbsp;in an Acer quad core computer, with 4gb ram and a 500 gb hdd. Anyway the usb to ide converter works fine in an xp system, it
 is able to detect the hard drive fine, as I used this drive to backup my customer's files. The problem is I can not copy the files to a windows 7 system from the backup drive.&nbsp;The current system is a microtower&nbsp; and has no room for any other drives, besides
 this board does not have any ide interfaces on the mobo only two sata ports on the board. So connecting the drive internally is out. I am wondering why the windows 7 is unable to detect an external drive installed via the ide to usb converter.&nbsp; In the device
 manager it seems to detect the ide to usb converter and thinks that this is the drive.... but the drive attached to the device is not detected. In the device manager... when I plug in the usb converter I get a device called "USB device" under hard drive, and
 under usb devices... USB mass storage device. But this seems to be the converter not the drive itself, because when I go under&nbsp;disk management services the hard drive plugged into the usb converter is not detected. I have a 80 gb hard drive plugged into the
 converter. Like I said before when I plug this drive into an XP system it detects the hard drive without any problem and I can access the files off of the external drive. I have plugged in other drives into this usb to ide drive converter and I have the same
 problem that my windows 7 computer can not detect the external drive. I have even used external usb drive enclosures and it strange that I can not detect hard drives plugged into my system. It detects thumb drives/memory sticks fine. I have no questionable
 devices shown in the device manager. This has been bugging me for months, been thinking about trying an os reinstall just to solve this issue but would rather avoid it since this system is a system upgrade from windows vista home premium to windows 7 business
 (for example when I bought it they upgraded the system to vista business edition (which I paid for) and then since windows 7 came out on the same date as I purchased the system I was able to upgrade to windows 7 business edition. Now you know my delima in
 not really wanting to go through and OS reinstall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I wanted to add the following information, this also is driving me up the wall, I am sure it is related to my issue. when I look at devices under the disk management services there is are two phantom drives that are shown Disk 1 or drive f and Disk 2 or
 drive G. Both of these drives say they are removable and say no media. So if I try to eject these drives, eject is actually greyed out. In the device manager both of these drives are shown under portable devices both drive f and drive g. These drives do not
 exist on my computer so why do they keep popping up? I have tried to delete both devices in the device manager, which causes them to go away in the disk management services. But if I scan the system for new hardware or reboot these two phantom drives keep
 popping up.&nbsp; As well in the device manager the two phantom drives are listed under the usb devices as an USB Storage Device (this item also repopulates even after I deleted then rerun a scan for new hardware. It is possible that the drives previously plugged
 into the usb ports were removed from the usb ports without using the eject command to safely remove the drive. If that is the case could that be the cause of the phantom drives? If so how can I repair this problem?</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There may be a need for setting drive jumper depending on the type of IDE drive. To use it externally you may have to change its jumper setting.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Remove the jumper(s) completely from the IDE drive and check if that makes any difference.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also if feasible, try and connect the IDE drive to another computer running Windows 7 via USB port and check if the issue is specific to your computer
 or Windows 7 in general. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With respect to the phantom drive issue,</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Some third-party&nbsp;CD/DVD burning software install virtual drives to mount image files.</span></p>

            I just Stopped Using Edge for two months and went back to old reliable IE. After that I started up Edge and it worked fine WHY Who knows Edge is still very slow and still dose weird things just to much to say but I'll will shut it down again and go back
 to IE. Microsoft will you stop experimenting if you have something that works Stop trying to make it better Hey YOU DON'T OK. Keep your Dam Hands off of that works or take the time and clean out the junk you leave in your so called Windows and Browsers. Look
 at all your windows, 98 worked and 7 worked So far all others were Crap. If you Cant make it better leave it alone. &nbsp; Thanks for all your help This topic is finished Thank you

<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(153, 51, 0, 1)">There are several reasons why. One is Microsoft supports cheating through game for windows by giving out cheaters tools gamers used to cheat in the game
 where Xbox gives no such tools and if you cheat to even the playing field you will get banned for life. Secondly, the COD series have no dedicated servers which would stop all the cheating altogether but this must come from the developers like Activision which
 they will never do….YET !</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(153, 51, 0, 1)">I say yet because of there new Elite site which will develop into its own gaming site within two years then you might see dedicated servers but for now
 even with COD Elite you will still have the cheaters and modders, and those who use rapid fire controllers among other cheat tools. How can they get away with cheating from what I’ve read many gamers will use one of their own Xbox system as their dedicated
 server allowing others to use their site while they use their cheat tools almost like shadow playing I don’t understand all of it but then again that is why I don’t cheat.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(153, 51, 0, 1)">The best way for you to enjoy your COD copy is play with a group of your friends in your own town and school, or neighborhood this way you know who you’re
 playing with, in doing this you will play in a private room allowing none of your friends, friends into the game play this is how cheaters access your private room. This is the only way to enjoy CODBO or others.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(153, 51, 0, 1)">With all this said, we clean gamers must play COD at our own risk, enjoy what we can of the game, when we can and when you think cheats are happing use
 your report button. You may not think reporting does little because cheating continues you have to remember one important thing MONEY … COD is big business bringing in Billions of dollars from 11 million online COD player around the world and you think they
 (Developers, ) are worried about what you think so long as they got your money they are happy. Your own unhappiness isn’t there concern getting your money is … I understand its is very frustrating not be able to play a decent COD game match on a boring afternoon
 but life doesn’t give out roses does it.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(153, 51, 0, 1)">In ending ( I can talk too much LOL ) I hope you will not allow cheating in COD stop you from playing the game remember, cheating gamers are not around
 24-7 if you watch closely in your time zone you can pin point within reason to be able to see the time pattern when the most cheating appears to your time zone in your city. Being on the East cost, I found out the cheating goes up after 3 PM because kids are
 done with school and 11 PM because the young adults get off work. This isn’t a fool proof method but it does help me to stay out of COD when cheating pop up on these peak hours. And how can you tell when cheating is happing…I don’t believe in Lag this is a
 cover up for cheating when you see a gamer sliding across the map or flying in the air, or walking through walls or shooting you through a building you know no one can see you I’m sure aimbot is being used as well as other codes. Cheating kills games, it steals
 money from gamers like me by forcing me to cut my game playing time down and I would play COD all day without the cheating but with cheating I play it two weeks then I walk away for whenever I decide to play it again. If you click on my profile you will see
 my age and CGP. CGP is Clean Game Play meaning I don’t cheat in MP. What you do in a private room is your business but in the main MP lobbies its my business.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(153, 51, 0, 1)">I hope I have open your eyes to a new world cheaters never win but on Xbox its big money for those who do cheat. Some are paid to cheat, others are testers
 for cheat software companies its big money. Enjoy your COD games…..Oh, don’t request friendship I don’t know you and I am out of your age group.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Unfortunately you are rendered forever helpless. Once hackers infiltrate a game, there is nothing you can do as an individual. Personal experience has taught me that the reporting system is a waste of time, they are just as much skeptical of you as they
 are your claims. It's a shame that much of Xbox Live has become a safe haven for hackers &amp; cheaters. They are just too many in number for Microsoft to be able to control. You can say that they have gotten the best of Microsoft, and made the Xbox pay-for-play
 service a product that is lacking in quality and integrity.</p>

<h2>            What do I do&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My windows live account associated with my xbox live account was recently hacked and whatnot, passwords changed and everything. Now I can't recover my account to another xbox or even change the password or email online or on the dashboard. I went to hotmail
 and tried recovered my password but it still doesn't seem to work. I was wondering what are the options of getting my account back? I don't really care that much about the email account itself as much as the xbox live account. I tried contacting Microsoft
 about it and they put me through the recovery process but I have yet to here a reply from them after 36 hours (they say it takes 24 or less). How should I proceed? This is my second account btw.</p>

            <p>If you contacted Xbox support they should have set up an unauthorized access escalation to get you your account back and they will also look into any purchases that were made while the account was gone and refund you for those. When the investigation is done you should receive an email tell you that you can recover the account. </p>

<p><span>Hi Jose,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This could be due to the incompatible drivers installed for the Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 3945ABG network card on the computer. I would suggest you to update the drivers and check if that help.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may run the Intel Driver Update Utility Tool to find the latest driver updates for your computer and then install all the driver updates and check if that helps. You may run this tool from this link:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span><a href="http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/detect/wireless" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Intel Driver Update Utility Tool</a></span></i></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If that does help, then follow instructions given below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Uninstall and Reinstall the Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network Card Drivers</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to uninstall and reinstall the driver:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Step 1: Uninstall the Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network Card Drivers</span></i></b></p>
<p><b><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i></b></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press “Windows Logo” + “X” keys on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on “<b><i>Device Manager</i></b>” from that list.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Search for the network card device from the device list, right click on it and then select “<b><i>Uninstall</i></b>”. On the un-installation window, if you have an option: “<b><i>Delete
 the driver software for this device</i></b>” you may select that and then remove the corrupted drivers from the computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Follow the on-screen instructions to complete it and the restart the computer if prompted.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After the restart, you may again open the
<b><i>Device Manager</i></b> and then click on the “<b><i>Scan for hardware changes</i></b>” button at the top of the
<b><i>Device Manager</i></b> window and check if Windows 8.1 detects the network card device and installs an appropriate driver for it automatically. If that happens, then check if it resolves the issue. If the issue persists, then go with
 the next step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Step 2: Check the Windows updates for any latest driver updates.</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check in Windows updates if any driver updates are available. If so, install the same and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press “Windows Logo” + “W” keys from the keyboard.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type “<b><i>Updates</i></b>” in the search bar and click on the icon “<b><i>Windows Update</i></b>” from the search result.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the “<b><i>Windows Update</i></b>” window, click on the link: “<b><i>Check for updates</i></b>” from the left hand side of the window to receive a fresh list of updates.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If the updates are available, then install all the updates listed there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If Windows Update does not offer the latest Windows 8.1 driver, then try the next step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Step 3: Update Driver Software from the Manufacturer’s website:</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can download the drivers from this link:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<br />Have you recently ran updates when this happened?

    <title>Blue Snowball Microphone not Recognized by PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lws0925  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue Snowball Microphone not Recognized by PC</h2>
                    <p>I bought my Blue Snowball Microphone in April, and it worked fine until June. Then, for some reason, when I would go to plug it in, I would get an error message that says "USB device not recognized." I tried troubleshooting it with the built-in troubleshooter
 for hardware and devices and it told me that it had found and fixed the problem and prompted me to restart my computer. I restarted my computer, and it still didn't work. When I went into Device Manager, the microphone is simply showing up as a USB, not as
 a sound, video, or game controller. I attempted some of the fixes from the following link,</p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/blue-snowball-usb-microphone-doesnt-work-after/47890956-2791-4eaa-b80b-41b6afdf588b?auth=1">https://answers.microsoft.com/</a></p>
<p>but none of the ones I tried worked, as most of them were contingent on the device at least being recognized as a recording device. I also can't figure out how to manage my recording devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            Hello! Sorry you are having this issue. Hopefully we can fix it.
<br />
<br />This could be  a hardware issue. Check this video for a fix on that: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ-Tf0i0Esg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ-Tf0i0Esg</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/gQ-Tf0i0Esg?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/gQ-Tf0i0Esg?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>

<br />You can manage recording devices by right clicking the volume icon and going to Open sound settings or Sounds then recording. Make sure all devices even hidden are shown by right clicking inside sounds &gt; recording and click show disabled/hidden devices

            I haven't checked on the hardware, but the software fix didn't work. When I go into sounds and try to show disabled or disconnected devices, the microphone didn't show up (presumably because Windows doesn't even know that the USB plugged in is a microphone).

<h2>            Micro SD CARD</h2>
                    <p>Hello fellow Surface users,</p>
<p>I just purchased the Microsoft Surface Pro i5/4GB RAM/128 memory.&nbsp; I would like to install more memory by way of Micro SD Card. What type of&nbsp; Micro SD card is compatible and what is the largest I can install without compromising speed.
</p>
<p>Thank you so very much,</p>
<p>Oliver &nbsp;</p>
