<h2>            Push Power Management for devices through GPO or SCCM</h2>
                    <p>I have users whose computer is dropping USB devices from device manager. My team believe it is because of "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power."
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fed4ce2c-7127-4c08-bd46-70ab7d42eb21?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fed4ce2c-7127-4c08-bd46-70ab7d42eb21?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Is there anyway to un-check this through a GPO or a SCCM script? I am not allowed to make these modifications in my company but if I can provide the process then they will apply it.</p>

<h3> valvelessbike17  say:</h3>
<h2>            xbox wont read disk</h2>
                    
<p>My xbox wont read any disks DVD, games, Music Cd's, Or lens cleaning disks. Now i have tried every step posted on this site&nbsp;to resolve the issue with no luck, I can't afford to send it in for repairs, The only thing i haven't tried yet is to take it apart
 and cleans the lens by hand. I don't want to take it apart but if there isn't away for me to get it repaired or replaced for free i might have to do that. No a friend of mine has told me about a program he used once through you guys that all he had to do was
 send his broken one in and they sent him a refurbished one at no cost to him. I was just wondering if that was true and if it is how would i go about doing it myself? Please i would&nbsp;very much&nbsp;like to get back to playing my games so if you can help me it would
 be very much appreciated.</p>

            <p>If your xbox is less than a year old, you can call support (1-800-4MY-XBOX in North America) and arrange a warranty repair. &nbsp;If it is out of warranty you will have pay for a repair.</p>
<p>I would not recommend taking it apart as that is considered modding the console (something that is not allowed to be discussed on the forums) and may result in your console being banned from the live service entirely.</p>

 Every time. What the hell did u guys do? Does anyone else have the same problem after the update. And if its something like my xbox is too old for the update. You guys are gonna be giving out a lot of free consoles. Cause I will contact a laywer.</p>

 the ambassadors are getting free points to tell you to send in your XBOXs for repair that will cost you at least 100 dollars. &nbsp;Sounds fair right?</p>

<p>Hey! Just in response to Onyx, taking the Xbox apart is NOT considered modding as modding is making a change to the way the console looks or functions. HOWEVER, if you were to attempt to take apart your xbox there are warranty stickers you would be severing
 or removing in order to reach the disk drive and reading laser which violate your warranty with no questions asks. I personally suggest you call Microsoft and have them take a look whether you are in or out of warranty; you can only break your xbox further
 by opening it.</p>

<p>I don't care how well you take care of your equipment, if your console is outside of the warranty period, you have gotten your money's worth and It's time to pay for a repair or better yet, buy a new unit. &nbsp;How do you expect Microsoft Xbox to acheive their

<h2>            Changing title bar color of specific programs</h2>
                    Is there a way of changing the title bar color of specific programs? Some companies like Google are reluctant at implementing proper support for new Windows 10 features such as colored title bars.
<br />
<br />
Goal is to make Google Chrome's title bar black or dark grey, since changing its theme makes it use a custom interface with horrible ugly context buttons.

            The goal was to test the feature with Google Chrome since it's a browser with a bad theme API. If successful, the same method could be easily applied to any other program with unmatched interface/title bar colors.
<br />
<br />
<br />
The custom title bar color is a Windows 10 feature and 3rd-party developers can easily make it the color they'd like. Edge has a black title bar when using it's dark theme for example. I was just curious to know if there's a way to set a color for a specific
 program rather than setting the default color that affects all the title bars that aren't coded colorful by their respective developers.

            <p>You do not install Windows XP by installing it like you would a program in Windows 7. Instead, you need to set your PC's BIOS to boot your PC 1st from your CD/DVD drive instead of your current hard disk. You then put your Windows XP&nbsp;CD/DVD in the DVD drive.
 When you then start your PC, your PC uses the CD/DVD to install Windows XP on your drive. It is more involved than installing a standrard program, but it it is doable for a reasonably IT competent home user.
</p>
<p>There are a few things to remember:</p>
<p>- The process will wipe the hard drive/partition it installs to, so you will lose everything on it - personal data (photos, documents, etc.) and programs. Therefore make sure you have separate backups and program installation disks, etc.</p>
<p>- You will need compatible Windows XP drivers for all your hardware. Make sure they are available for
<u>all</u> you hardware before you start.</p>
<p>For more detailed information, please see:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-xp/help/setup/install-windows-xp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-xp/help/setup/install-windows-xp</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, I&nbsp;advise you to&nbsp;reconsider&nbsp;switching back to XP from Windows 7. Although you may feel more comfortable with XP, it is at/near the end of its support life as far as Microsoft is concerned so updates will eventually stop. Also, in a year or two's
 time when you may need to buy a new printer or a new program, you are more &amp; more likely to find XP isn't supported/compatible. You may be wiser to perservere now with the newer Windows 7. The decision is, of course yours though.</p>

Are you sure you want to remove Windows 7? Compare Windows 7 vs. XP vs. Vista:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/compare?T1=tab20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/compare?T1=tab20</a><br />
<br />
If it's a new computer it might not have drivers for the older Windows system, meaning it will not work correctly.&nbsp; First you would need to check with the computer manufacturer if they have XP drivers for your computer.
<br />
<br />
Then you would need to use an available XP license you have, or buy a new one and install it on your computer. Insert the install disk into the computer, reboot, and start the install. During the install process you can format the Windows 7 partition then continue
 installing Windows. You'll have to backup your files and reinstall all your programs.<br />
<br />
You can not use a Windows 7 key to activate XP.<br />
<br />
In case you ever want to reinstall Windows 7, make sure you have a way to reinstall. If you don't have install disks, you can make a system image:<br />

<h2>            Multiple Skype Accounts causing problems logging in.  How do I sort it out&#63;</h2>
                    Somehow I have accumulated 3 Skype Accounts.&nbsp; The first is in my name. The second has my E-mail Address.&nbsp; Are these actually the same account or different ones?&nbsp; The third is an obvious misspelling of my name.&nbsp; How do I sort the mess out?

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The accounts you saw are different accounts but possibly related to each other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the first account was created under Skype name and the second one was under an email address, you can merge them in to one account. To do so, you need to make sure that you have access to each of the accounts you have then follow the steps on this link:

A single sign-in for Skype and your other Microsoft services</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You also have the option to delete the excess Skype accounts if you want to. You just need to follow the steps

<h2>            I can longer do online banking with HSBC since the last Windows upgreade installed.</h2>
                    I can get online as usual and access the signing in page, give my security details etc but when the page should direct me to my account it simply remains 'busy' indefinitely. I have visited the bank and can access my account using their computer as well
 as my other computer upstairs. In addition I had this problem about a year ago after another Windows update bit it resolved itself after a few days.

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Have you any third party security software installed ?
<br />
<br />Also, if the issue resolved before it may be a temporary network issue.
<br />
<br />You could try clearing the DNS cache:
<br />
<br />Start &gt; type cmd &gt; then right-click Command Prompt &gt; Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Then type the following command and press "Enter" ::
<br />
<br />ipconfig /flushdns

                    <p>I upgraded to Win 10 and all was working well this morning I had a system crash and after restarting the MS Edge Icon does not show on the task bar&nbsp; (the blank window is there and will launch edge), and when I left click the start button - it does not work,
 if I right click the start button I get the list as I would have in win 7/8 ???</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried a couple of programs to clean problems, no luck --- I restored the system to a reset point yesterday (before the crash) and I still have the same issues as listed above</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there a way to reload win 10 to bring the operation back to normal operation???</p>
<p>

</p><p>Hello Community -- Thank you for your concern with the above email regarding my Windows 10 issue
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I've noticed on other postings regarding similarities for this problem -- it looks like a major fix is required for resolving. The little bandaid fixes proposed are not fixing the problem --
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for me this problem remains unsolved</p>

            HI,
<div><br />
<div>Sometimes even while using a admin account, Windows requires you to have elevated privileges to install a file or make changes. Follow the methods one by one and restart and verify after each one.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You may firstly try running the file as an administrator.</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Right click on the setup file of the software that you are trying to install.</li><li>Select “Run as administrator”.</li></ol>
<p>Change policies in the policy editor and check.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click Start, type "Local Security Policy" (without quotes) and press enter.</li><li>Click on Software Restriction Policies.</li><li>In the right pane, double click on the "enforcement".</li><li>Select “All users except local administrators”.</li><li>Click Ok and restart the computer and check if the issue is fixed.</li></ol>
<p>Try modifying the registry entries.</p>
<ol>
<li>Browse the registry to HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer<br />
Create: DisableMSI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type: REG_DWORD&nbsp; value = 0&nbsp;&nbsp; (0 should allow you to install it was originally 1)</li><li>Browse to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Installer\Products\<br />
Search the list for the product that is causing the error.. delete the folder in the products folder…&nbsp; this may also correct your error.</li></ol>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for your response. I do normally manage to get round the issue by run as administrator, and the policy is already set as you suggested. I have made the registry tweaks (at least I think I have, I don't mess with the registry).</p>

<p>Fingers crossed that the registry change has done the trick.</p>

Hi Mike 



Thank you for taking an interest in my problem and posting a reply. I hate to be the one to **** on your cornflakes, especially at this time of year but the corruption protection is not working.  SFC reports several corrupted files which it can't fix. I am also having a nightmare with updates particularly with Microsoft Security Essentials. Its possible the two issues are linked. As for the name of the programme it was  Nero 11 platinum, their Technical Department even gave up and refunded my payment. I even have problems with Trouble Shooters not running. On of the Trouble shooters that did not run yesterday has now run but without any great benefit. For example Windows Update Error 


 0x80070003(2013-12-24-T-12-51-15P) Not fixed. I wanted to send you a picture but it puts me above the word count. 



I bought the PC, installed an extra HD and installed Windows 7 64 bit. I Validated my copy on line no problem and have not changed any registry settings.  



Maybe I am just unlucky

            <p>I have files that SFC can't fix too, but I don't run Nero 11 because Nero is a PITA.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Nero 11 is two years old, and Nero have been working hard on a new version which will work better with Windows 7 and 8. All you have to do is look happy and pay up. Nero has been doing this for years.. :-)</p>

<p>The problem with installing 'iffy' stuff is that it can have unpleasant effects upon other stuff which worked ok at one&nbsp;time..</p>

<p>The Nero&nbsp;URL has a link to Nero 11 Platinum which takes&nbsp;you straight to ........... Nero 2014 Platinum, the official fix for Nero 11, and it only costs $109.99 US.. :-)&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Yes well we all learn over time. I started with Nero 4 many years ago and I guess I have bought their CE his latest Beamer. I use Burn Aware Free (yep free) I have also used the built in burner and it worked fine. I have also given up paying for anti-virus
 like Norton, Bull Guard and use &nbsp;Microsoft Security Essentials (who said nothing free is ever any good?) even if updating it is a nightmare. Anyway it's lovely to chat but what is the solution to There can only be one boss? And in your opinion is this why
 I am having problems with updates? I am not worried by the corrupted files found by SFC either, if it works don't mend it. Which is a good job as viewing the log is a days job and deciphering the data way beyond my capabilities. Maybe that could be your next
 Fix It project, auto-analyses of the log file and simple solutions.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I dare say you are packing up now for Christmas, so I hope you and yours have a fantastic time. I'll throw in a Happy New Year as I doubt you guys will be in harness much before mid-January.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When you are back I will look forward to a full and complete explanation and solution. Is it too late to add that to my Santa list&nbsp; (ho, ho, ho)?</p>

            <p>You are the 'boss', but even the boss doesn't have permission to disable the sprinkler system.. :-)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Microsoft have tried to make it as impossible as they can to kill the operating system. In general, users don't want to kill it off either, So, safeguards are added to the list of jobs given to the 'automatic administrator' and
<em>"The system administrator has set policies to prevent this installation"</em> is one of them.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Back in the heady days of DOS and Windows 9x, users really would have been the BOSS and could make decisions that would take out the OS at a key stroke. These were known as 'bad choices' and frequently took the BOSS totally by surprise.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Some choices were made on a weekly basis and others had daily status. The one good thing was that the ensuing Windows re-installation ensured at least a few minutes of smooth running.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows 2000 was not a consumer OS. Entering it was like walking into a self-locking jail cell, which suited System admins to a tee. It stopped members of the typing pool from screwing things up, not only at their end but also the server end of the business
 ops.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>XP was like a&nbsp;'double door' store.&nbsp;One side was locked and the other side wasn't. System admins hated it at first.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then along came Vista and UAC. A couple of confrontations with it saw users turning it off. So, instead of getting a gentle message asking 'are&nbsp;you are sure you want to do that', it could be over-ridden. The worst case scenario was having to re-install and
 having no data backups.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows 7 has UAC but most would never know it. Instead of&nbsp;issuing a warning at every mouse click, it lets you feel like you are in charge, but will not let you deal a terminal blow. That is reserved for less than perfect Microsoft Updates..
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>.. and while we are on that subject.. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows updates work well 99% of the time, and will work 100% of the time assuming that there has been 0% user intervention at any time since the initial installation. Service packs too will do the same.. BUT..
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Some users have just&nbsp;GOT to play Command and Conquer Red Alert (an example), and if they can't, they will scream until they are sick. So, some bright spark finds a way of manipulating the system (making unauthorized changes), and&nbsp;at the next round of Windows
 Updates .......... wah, the system has been corrupted and the updates will NOT.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The same kind of effect is seen by using registry cleaners which take out anything that is not being used. It is like removing the spare wheel from the family car. It may never be used, but if you get a 'flat'? Uh-oh..
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now, I am not suggesting that it is entirely the fault of the&nbsp;user, because some seemingly 'bona fide' programs are installed in all good faith. Unfortunately, not all programs are created equally. What you don't and may never know&nbsp;as the&nbsp;user is that the
 program's code writer maybe be using unauthorized memory addresses in order for the program to run as fast as the user hopes it will, or for&nbsp;it to work at all.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The greatest quality of a PC is that one can do almost anything with it. The worst&nbsp;failing is that users and code writers&nbsp;try to do anything and everything, often&nbsp;blissfully unaware of the global consequences..
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Note that I have refrained from using technical jargon this time.. :-)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>I trust you had a Merry Christmas? Thank you for your most fulsome&nbsp;response (things a bit quiet over this time of year?), especially as it was jargon free. I understand what you are saying about messing about with Windows and not carrying the spare wheel.
 To continue the motoring analogy, one of my cars won't let me exceed 7500RPM, another will not allow me to select reverse from 5th gear and another tells me when it is time for an oil change or a service. At least I know why these things are happening. As
 for why as the sole administrator I can't even run a Microsoft Fix-it I am no wiser. Maybe the next release from Microsoft will be called &nbsp;Windows Hal? I can't let you do that..............</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Happy New Year.</p>

            <p>Hi Mike</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Indeed it may not (regrettably in this case it was the correct one) I am sure Microsoft would provide a more appropriate response such as something like "The fixit you are trying to run is not for this version of Windows" Not that the administrator has set
 policies which prevent this programme from running" But then who knows? Maybe the effect of the ridiculous EC ruling has had a far more profound effect and an evil revenge is being wreaked on all of Europe. Would it help my case to state here and now, quite
 publicly that I am a Eurosceptic? I do believe that far from being a free trade area (which still hasn't materialised) the EEC is determined to create a Socialist Social Republic of Europe and dominate all sovereignty (except Germany as they will be in charge).
 But no it was indeed the correct fix it, one which promised to end all issues with my downloads as I recall. It did indeed&nbsp;provide information with nice yellow triangles but stopped short of actually doing anything useful. A kind of Programmus Interruptus.
 Equally frustrating. So Mike&nbsp;you must guess again for our dance to continue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>An unauthorised change? &nbsp;Let me quote you "Windows 7 has UAC but most would never know it. Instead of&nbsp;issuing a warning at every mouse click, it lets you feel like you are in charge, but will not let you deal a terminal blow. That is reserved for less than
 perfect Microsoft Updates" Ah, as someone, more famous than I once said "To her the words you've spoken twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools". I&nbsp;do consider&nbsp;this to work equally well for the written word. The only programme that has kicked up has been
 the Nero 11 platinum (PITA Edition, Programme Interfacing and Transforming Arrogance) and as you may recall (and you may not as it was a wee while back now) that I could not install this programme and warning told me it was as corrupt as a Mugabe.&nbsp; Don't worry
 I would have repaired windows using my installation disc (or even reformatted and run a fresh installation I have backups) but for some reason once the boot screen fades as do my keyboard and mouse and I do not at the moment have a serviceable wired board
 and mouse. As for a malware infection I use the recommended Microsoft Security Essentials (and whilst that crashed before it completes the last 10% of a full scan) I am sure that would not have permitted access to my system. I use custom scan and do a drive
 at a time to avoid crashes. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So, with regret my New Year present to you is a try again award. Which coincides with my resolution of "Sort out who is the boss here". Hopefully we will have a solution long before we can challenge the corresponding longevity of Alistair Cooke.</p>

Bug check description: This indicates that a kernel-mode driver attempted to access pageable memory at a process IRQL that was too high.<br />
This appears to be a typical software driver bug and is not likely to be caused by a hardware problem.
<br />
A third party driver was identified as the probable root cause of this system error. It is suggested you look for an update for the following driver: igdkmd64.sys (Intel Graphics Kernel Mode Driver, Intel Corporation).

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</b></span><br />
<br />
<u><b>If you don't know where DMP files are located, here's how to get to them:</b></u><br />
<br />
&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upload the zip containing the DMP files to Skydrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply.<br />
<br />
<u><b>If you are going to use Skydrive but don't know how to upload to it, please visit the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive</a><br />
<br />
<b>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete DMP files upon use.</b><br />
<br />
<u><b>If your computer is not generating DMP files, please do the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
1. Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
2. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
3. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
4. Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

            Great, thanks!<br />
<br />
All of the attached DMP files are of the <u><b>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (d1)</b></u> bugcheck.<br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that a kernel-mode driver attempted to access pageable memory at a process IRQL that was too high.</i><br />
<br />
A driver tried to access an address that is pageable (or that is completely invalid) while the IRQL was too high. This bug check is usually caused by drivers that have used improper addresses.<br />
<br />
<i>Unable to load image \SystemRoot\system32\DRIVERS\<b>igdkmd64.sys</b>, Win32 error 0n2<br />

Ensure you have the latest video card drivers. If you are already on the latest video card drivers, uninstall and install a version or a few versions behind the latest to ensure it's not a latest driver only issue. If you have already experimented with the
 latest video card driver and many previous versions, please give the beta driver for your card a try.<br />

<p>I just bought the Galaxy S9+ and while it connects using the Smart View app the pairing does not remain. Using my Galaxy S7 I have no problems. I do not have a Windows 10 computer so is there another way to update the firmware or can you tell me the current
 version for the 4 Square Windows model?</p>
<p>I see it as V2.0.8350.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: I was able to update the firmware to most current V2.0.8372 but now the S7 will not connect at all and the S9+ still doesn't stay connected.</p>

    <title>D-Link Wireless Adapter won&#39;t work with Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike dv  say:</h3>
<h2>            D-Link Wireless Adapter won&#39;t work with Windows 7</h2>
                    I looked in the Windows Compatibility Center and it says that my D-Link Wireless Adapter, WUA-2340 is compatible with Windows 7. Our newest computer can see my wireless network, but won't connect. Worked fine with Vista. So is it compatible or not? I downloaded
 the latest drivers from the D-Link website, that version is a year old. I was told by D-link support that it is not compatible with Win 7. They say it's not. MS says it is. It won't connect. Anyone know what's going on? I would like to not have to purchase
 a new adapter.

    <title>Blank screen at login page. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wolfie119  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blank screen at login page.</h2>
                    I'm running Vista Home Premium.<br />
<br />
After some automatic windows security updates last month I started getting blank screen when loading gets to login page. I would be able to see the loading process onscreen up to the microsoft loading bar then as it goes into the login page I can hear the windows
 startup chime but my screen will go into sleep mode as if there is no video input.<br />
<br />
I can still load into safe mode with networking though and when I checked the device manager for faults I can't seem to find my monitor listed. Even scanning for new hardware doesn't detect it. Have tried numerous recovery options including system restore to
 dates way before the updates, safe mode&nbsp;start up then clean boot, windows cd startup repair which shows no problem, updating latest bios and device drivers. All but to no avail. Occasionally windows would start up normally but problem&nbsp;keeps coming back without
 me installing or connecting anything new. Need help please.

            Mine doesn't start up at all even after waiting for 30 minutes. I suspect it could be somehow related to my graphics card driver because when I uninstall it in safe mode I can get windows to load normally into windows explorer. However it will automatically
 scan and install the device driver back and when I restart the pc I will get the blank screen again. I have tried checking device manager for conflicts but there are none. Tried downloading and installing the latest driver but it doesn't help. I am running
 out of ideas how to resolve this problem.

<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking - or go to Command Prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any such corrupt files here.<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a cause.</span></p>
<span><br />
If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning startup (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer - from Command Prompt type eventvwr and enter).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html</span></span></a></span><span>.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try going to Command Prompt again and type c:<br />
<br />
type cd c:\<br />
<br />
type cd c:\windows\system 32\eventvwr<br />
<br />
Then type ren logs logs.old<br />
<br />
Then reboot Windows and see if that clears up the problem.<br />
<br />
If none of this works, post back and we'll see if we can come up with something different.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span>

            Thanks for replying.<br />
<br />
Problem started around end Nov when about 10 or more windows security updates got automatically downloaded and installed. Tried restoring system to 1 day before or even to earliest date (mid Nov) but it didn't work. Tested some solutions I found on the net
 like updating drivers, disabling services&nbsp;and such. PC could load normally for a week and I could install all windows updates without issues.&nbsp;Blank screen returned after further windows updates on 2nd week Dec and I tried restoring system to the week before
 but it didn't work. A few mornings when I power up the PC it would load normally. I will then check for device driver conflicts and do full virus scans but nothing came up. I recently found out that when I uninstall the display driver (Nvidia GeForce 8500GT)
 in safe mode the blank screen would be gone and&nbsp;I will be able to login albeit in low res. Then the display driver will install itself and when I restart the blank screen would be back. I have tested with updating the latest display driver or reverting back
 to the windows supplied one but they don't solve the problem either.<br />
<br />
Following your instructions I restored the system to its earliest date but 13 Dec is the farthest I could go. Didn't work. Tried the Startup Repair with my OEM Windows Disk and it didn't find any conflicts. Ran sfc /scannow in safe mode...it says "Windows Resource
 Protection did not find any integrity violations." Ran chkdsk /f/r after a restart too.<br />
<br />
I am not sure about how to use the event viewer.<br />
<br />
<span><br />
If that doesn't work, try going to Command Prompt again and type c:<br />
type cd c:\<br />
type cd c:\windows\system 32\eventvwr<br />
Then type ren logs logs.old<br />
Then reboot Windows and see if that clears up the problem.</span><br />
<br />
Followed these instructions above but system couldn't find logs file. I did rename the one found in c:\Windows though.<br />
Restarted but problem still not solved.

<br />
You need to undo this renaming of the Logs file in Windows.<br />
<br />
At a command prompt type:<br />
<br />
cd c:\Windows<br />
ren &lt;whatever you renamed it&gt; Logs<br />
Then exit.<br />
<br />
I just realized that process doesn't work - I found it posted by someone I trusted and there is no eventvwr folder (it is a file) so there's no logs folder there.<br />
<br />
Here's what I should have typed:<br />
<br />
<span>try going to Command Prompt again and type c:<br />
<br />
type cd c:\<br />
<br />
type cd c:\windows\system 32\winevt<br />
<br />
Then type ren logs logs.old<br />
<br />
Then reboot Windows and see if that clears up the problem.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Give me some time to research this further - this is a difficult problem to resolve.&nbsp; Perhaps someone else will post something in the meantime.<br />
<br />
Good luck!

            Here's an&nbsp; article for the "black screen of death" that might be of use: <a href="http://thebackroomtech.com/2008/12/30/fix-for-windows-vista-black-screen-of-death-aka-ksod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://thebackroomtech.com/2008/12/30/fix-for-windows-vista-black-screen-of-death-aka-ksod/</a>.<br />
<br />
Here's a thread that covers this topic with an answer that at least worked for one person:
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaprograms/thread/50247d5e-0ae0-446c-a1bd-11287fd1478a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaprograms/thread/50247d5e-0ae0-446c-a1bd-11287fd1478a</a>.<br />
<br />
Here's an article that claims to be "the solution" to the problem: <a href="http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2008/12/the_mysterious_black_screen_of.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2008/12/the_mysterious_black_screen_of.php</a>.<br />
<br />
The problem is that nobody is really sure of the problem or the solution - not even Microsoft.&nbsp; And solutions that work for some people, don't work for others (and the various solutions don't even seem to be related).&nbsp; The best we can do at this point is check
 over what's available and try our best to work around the problem until a solution works.<br />
<br />
Here's a Bing listing of articles on this problem: <a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=black screen of death vista&amp;form=MSDTLB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.bing.com/search?q=black%20screen%20of%20death%20vista&amp;form=MSDTLB</a>.&nbsp; As you can see, there's much discussion about it but nobody has an answer that works in all cases (perhaps because there are multiple causes and nobody knows what they are).&nbsp;
 You can scroll through the listing to see if you find anything I haven't already posted that you want to check out.&nbsp; Here's Google's version of that search:
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=black+screen+of+death&amp;rls=com.microsoft:en-us:IE-SearchBox&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sourceid=ie7&amp;rlz=1I7DMUS_en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.google.com/search?q=black+screen+of+death&amp;rls=com.microsoft:en-us:IE-SearchBox&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sourceid=ie7&amp;rlz=1I7DMUS_en</a>.<br />
<br />
Here's one solution that almost certainly will work if you can gain access to the system in normal mode.&nbsp; D<span>o a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows
 Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system cane with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 I usually don't mention this option because most people can't ever get into Windows in normal mode when this occurs, but you seem to still be able to on occasion so it's an option to consider if/when that happens.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />
<br />
P.S. And don't forget to try that rename the log in the Windows\System32\winevt subdirectory if you haven't already done so.&nbsp; Several people have said it resolved their problem (but they had a full version of the KSOD instead of the partial version you're experiencing
 so it may be something different).<br />

<p>Found the log file in Windows\System32\winevt subdirectory. Tried to rename it but access was denied even I had run command prompt as Administrator. Guess there might be some protection of Windows file being altered.<br />
<br />
Trying out each of the solutions you so helpfully listed now. Will update when I get any results. Thanks.<br />

Have thought about doing a clean reinstall of windows all over as a last resort but will try all your solutions first.</p>

            Update<br />
<br />
Solution&nbsp;1.<br />
Tried and found that my RPC values are already what the user suggest to change to.<br />
<br />
Solution 2.<br />
Tried and BSOD didn't go away.<br />
<br />
Solution 3.<br />
Same as article 1.<br />
<br />
Can't do a system repair/upgrade with the Vista Installation Disk because it is an older version than the SP2 I have installed. Upgrade option not available, only clean install. Sigh!

            You can always uninstall SP2 (and if necessary SP1) so that the system repair/upgrade process will work.&nbsp; You can re-install them later once the process is complete along with the other updates that will have to be re-installed.<br />
<br />
Good luck!

<h2>            A Small White Horizontal Line</h2>
                    <p>On my external monitor, not my laptop's screen, a small horizontal white line is present near the bottom right. There is no way to interact with it and this is the first time I've ever before encountered it.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/014a5fb5-9f19-4ba3-a21e-2f925a599bd9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/014a5fb5-9f19-4ba3-a21e-2f925a599bd9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can tell it's not part of the background because it is positioned above the window, though still under the taskbar. It even comes with its own little shadow.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/137b2d7c-2a83-4769-9393-19ea66997796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/137b2d7c-2a83-4769-9393-19ea66997796" /></a></p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if anyone might know what this is. I'm sure it'll go away once I restart the laptop, but I'd still like to know either way. I'll update any changes after I restart to inform you if restarting did actually work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi 2AI 
<br />
<br />Can you please explain this in more detail . . .
<br />
<br />Are you trying to limit your overall CPU usage to below 25% or set that limit for any single application on your PC?
<br />
<br />May I also ask why you want to limit CPU usage by an application and are those application(s) you want to limit just standard applications, or very specific applications?

            Hi 2AI
<br />
<br />It is not possible to limit an applications access to your processor. Windows and the Intel software on your PC, manage the speed and utilization of your Processor, you should not adjust that because you could cause your system to be unstable and mos likely not to start . . .
<br />
<br />Please try this to find out if some rogue application is using your system resources:
<br />
<br />Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc)
<br />
<br />choose the Processor Tab, if necessary
<br />
<br />Leave that window open to monitor your system
<br />
<br />When your system is over busy, is your Hard drive, CPU or RAM overly busy at that time?
<br />
<br />If so, click on the appropriate column header, so the arrow faces down
<br />
<br />What are the top 5 processes at that time?       
        </p>
