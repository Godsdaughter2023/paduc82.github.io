            <p>rcowan21,</p>
<p>I went through the settings you described on my 650 and call waiting was checked as ON. However, to get to that setting I picked SIM1 and AT&amp;T (in blue). Do you use AT&amp;T? If not, does your provider have Call Waiting as part of your service? You might want
 to check that? Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Creating a report based on multiple value field in Microsoft Access</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a table of members. One of the fields is whether they are an active member or not... another field shows the sessions they are registered in ( as a lookup value) Each member can be registered in more than one session.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like a report that tells me the names and total of active members in each session.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance</p>
                </div>

<p>This is not a good use of an MVF. You should have a registration table that shows who is registered for each session. That table should have the MemberID as a foreign key. You then create a query that joins the member table with the registration table on
 MemberID and use that as the basis of your report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The member table should not even have that MVF. You should have a form with a subform bound to the Registration table.</p>

<p>Hi Scott, Thank you for your reply. I managed to get a basic design of what I was after by creating a report and simply grouping by Session. However, it groups alphabetically instead of chronologically as it is text. I will end up tweaking that somehow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will follow your advice and see how I go. May I ask why it is not a good idea to have it in the same table? And what difference it would make creating a new registration table? Will my sessions field still be an MVF?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I create a Sessions Reference Table with 3 Fields:<br />
- Session ID</p>
<p>- Session Name</p>
<p>- Session Time</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I create a query that will join the Sessions with Members. The fields will be:</p>
<p>-Member ID</p>
<p>-Session ID (Still a MVF?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I create a report from this, do I simply do the same, group by session?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Really appreciate your help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sessions.SessionID should be autonumber.</p>
<p>MembersInSessions is the junction TABLE (not query) and has a PK over MemberID and SessionID which are both Long Integer numbers.</p>
<p>This sets up a classic M:M (many-to-many) relation between members and sessions.</p>

<p>OK, while MVFs make for a nice interface, most pro developers don't use them because they cause more problems then they are worth. MVFs model a many to many relationship, but they do so with a hidden table that makes things harder to work with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Access is a relational database, therefore, data needs to be stored relationally to work efficiently. Your member table should only contain identification info about members. I.E. Names, address contact info.&nbsp; Since members may take multiple sessions, that
 is why they should not be in the Members table. In my opinion you need at least three tables here, besides your members table. The first table, I'll call Courses:</p>
<p>tblCourses</p>
<p>CourseID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>CourseName</p>
<p>other info about a Course</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you have the sessions table which will show when each course is given. So there will be a 1:Many relation between Courses and Sessions</p>
<p>tblSessions</p>
<p>SessionID (PK autonumber)</p>
<p>SessionTime</p>
<p>CourseID (FK)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally you have a Registrations table to show which members are registered for which sessions. This models the many to many relationship between members and sessions.</p>
<p>tblRegistrations</p>
<p>RegistrationID (PK autonumber)</p>
<p>MemberID (FK)</p>
<p>SessionID (FK)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now your query joins all the tables to pull all the info you want for your report and you can then group the report by Session.</p>

<h2>            My Outlook calendar events have disappeared</h2>
                    All of my Outlook calendar events except about three are gone. I have several calendars, and I sync them with my phone. They are all still on my phone and on Google, and they are also on Outlook today, and I get the notifications for them. Every couple
 of days, just for a few minutes, the events display on my calendar, but it is&nbsp;erratic.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a backup of my calendar from when the events were displayed (and most of them were there), but since they are in Outlook Today, I believe there is a problem with Outlook rather than the events themselves. I have uninstalled the sync program, but
 it did not resolve the issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It is not the view. I am looking at the month, and I have also checked the AutoArchive.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I am running Outlook 2010 on my Dell desktop using Windows 8.1&nbsp; Everything was fine until Sunday the 16th.&nbsp; Using a new iPhone 5S, but calendars have been syncing fine since getting things set up 3 weeks ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get Reminder alerts from the calendar, and it shows all events if I go to the Internet site - but it just isn't showing in Outlook anymore.&nbsp; There must be a fix because I use Outlook extensively for all of my affairs.</p>

            EAS = Exchange ActiveSync, a connection protocol that Microsoft has deprecated for Outlook.com and replaced with Exchange. If you use Outlook 2010, you should re-add the account using autoconfigure.

<h3> russell d fort  say:</h3>
<h2>            Maximize Excel 2010 performance ... what role does CPU, Memory, 32 vs 64 bit play&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm looking at purchasing a new desktop for work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I routinely work on very large Excel and Access files and want to maximize my performance with these applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What factors will give the best results?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CPU - speed / cores</p>
<p>How many cores does excel / access support?</p>
<p>Is there a limit to the number of cores that will improve performance?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trying to understand if an i7 is better than an i5 ... would a 6 core xeon be better than an i7 ... etc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Memory </p>
<p>How much memory will excel / access utilize?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compare&nbsp;8 gigs of memory vs 16 gigs ... does additional memory help with a single large file, or just when you have multiple large files open or not at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>32 bit vs 64 bit</p>
<p>Does the 64 bit versions of OS and Office provide better performance with large files?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, a what point will the number of cores, amount of memory, etc&nbsp;not pay back in terms of additional performance?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Intel i7 "Extreme" running at 3.33 GHz, 12 GB RAM, humongrous disk drive space.</p>
<p>That CPU has 4 physical and 4 logical cores.</p>
<p>OS: Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit</p>
<p>Office:&nbsp; both Office 2003 Professional&nbsp;(32 bit of course) and Office 2010 Pro Plus in 32-bit flavor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#2 - Just 2 months old now:</p>
<p>Intel i7-3820 running at 3.6 GHz (more speed than the older Extreme for fewer dollars now), 12 GB RAM, more humonstrous disk drive space (C=1TB, E=2TB).&nbsp; Again, this CPU has 4 physical and 4 logical cores.</p>
<p>OS: As before - Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit.</p>
<p>And the Office 2003 &amp; 2010 versions are the same!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now - if you want to spend the bucks on a Xeon CPU based system, go ahead - but remember that you're actually paying a lot extra for a CPU that is designed for use in a server, not in a workstation.&nbsp; but they do process stuff really fast!&nbsp; If you have to
 balance your budget for the CPU, pick the fastest CPU you can afford, regardless of number of cores.&nbsp; If you go with an i7 you're going to get at least 8.&nbsp; But I'll let you in on a 'secret' - I've got a CPU usage monitor running on both systems, and most of
 the time the average usage across all the cores is below 25% although you might see one or two of the 8 up at even 100% from time to time, but the others will be near zero.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now I have IE open doing this response; I have Excel 2003 running with a 1MB file, and even Excel 2010 open with a 1.5MB file, there's a background task that always keeps the CPU occupied, and I've got Outlook 2010 open with a couple of reply emails
 in progress.&nbsp; My CPU usage is at 13% :), and I'm using right at 3GB of my 12GB of RAM.&nbsp; Task manager tells me I'm running 98 processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the number of cores that Excel 2007 and later can use - just leave the setting on "automatic" or "all" and it'll use what's available.&nbsp; There were instances with Excel 2007 where you could actually get better performance by cutting down the number
 of cores being used to just 1, but I believe that's been fixed in 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With 12 to 16GB of RAM you'll probably never really use it all.&nbsp; I have a rule of thumb of at least 2GB per cpu core.&nbsp; And if you plan on setting up virtual machines, at least 2GB allocatable to each of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUT there is a point that simply tossing more RAM at Excel doesn't help.&nbsp; There are certain internal features of Excel that only allocate themselves a certain amount of RAM and regardless of the amount of physical RAM you have in the computer, if they hit
 one of these internal limits, then you're going to see one of those "not enough memory..." messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your last question was basically asking "what's the sweet spot combination of CPU type, clock speed and installed RAM?":</p>
<p>CPU is almost a no-brainer again: given a particular class of CPU by a manufacturer, the higher the clock speed, the more work you'll get done in a given amount of time.</p>
<p>RAM - I haven't seen performance graphs for RAM installed with Windows 7 64 bit.&nbsp; But there is typically a curve that's steep up to some point and then almost levels out at some point.&nbsp; If you can afford the 12 or 16 GB, then go for it, but I've got a kind
 of gut feeling that the sweet spot is at 12 GB or perhaps less.&nbsp; I don't think the extra $$ for something like 34 or 32GB installed would get you much bang for the dollar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now about that OS - definitely go with the 64-bit version!&nbsp; Without the 64-bit version of Windows, you're not going to "see" more than 4GB of RAM no matter how much you actually have installed.&nbsp; So that's pretty much a no-brainer.&nbsp; If you buy 12 or 16 or
 more GB or RAM, you're going to need a 64-bit operating system to use it.&nbsp; Also, if given the option, set the drives up as NTFS formatted drives, not FAT-32.&nbsp; Lots of advantages to the NTFS (NT File System) format.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office 32-bit vs Office 64-bit??&nbsp; Well, in theory the 64-bit version should do things faster.&nbsp; I have the 64-bit version on my office computer.&nbsp; Quite frankly I don't really see a big performance difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, with the 64-bit version of Excel, there are still a lot of 3rd party "Add-Ins" that have not been set up to work in 64-bit Excel.&nbsp; So if you want a smooth path to using Add-Ins in Excel, stick with the 32-bit version of Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple of other things to think about:&nbsp; one of the slowest things happening in and around your computer (besides user keyboard/mouse&nbsp;input and disk I/O) deals with the display.&nbsp; If you can afford a high end video card with lots of RAM on it, go for it.&nbsp;
 It'll pay off in improved performance in getting the data from the CPU/RAM onto the display.&nbsp; Gamer systems usually make great workstations: they have high end CPUs, lots of RAM and really hard working video cards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another place you can gain some performance improvement for relatively little cost is by adding an external RAM cache in the form of a thumb drive or memory card to be used as ReadyBoost memory.&nbsp; I'll let you read about that here:
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff356869.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff356869.aspx</a></p>
<p>You can add up to 32GB of cache RAM in this way (see the article for limitations on that).&nbsp; I've got both of my machines set up with small, 4GB ReadyBoost USB drives.&nbsp; I'm thinking of moving up to a larger sized device on at least one of them to see if I
 notice any improvement, just haven't done that yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope I've not confused you too much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another great place to ask your question(s) would be over at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.broadbandreports.com/forum/hwreviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.broadbandreports.com/forum/hwreviews</a></p>
<p>The folks in that place live and breathe hardware.&nbsp; Be prepared to meet some fanatics and some brand name "fan boys" (AMD is Best! No! NO! Intel is the way to go!) But they'll probably have up to date information about those sweet spots.</p>
<p>You can even post questions anonymously there - but there are advantages to creating a free account with them.&nbsp; I can tell you that you will not get any SPAM by creating even a free account (they offer a $10 account, but if you just get the free account
 and remain a member long enough, the pieces you pay the $10 for to use early will come to you anyway).&nbsp; I say this with some certainty - I helped moderate the site for some 7 years; it's privately owned and operated, and the owner values his member's privacy
 as much or more than his own.</p>

<p><span><span>Hey Barry Anderson,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Deleting the Temporary Internet files should take care of removing these files as long as you don’t have the Preserve Favorites Data box checked. If you do, the icons
 that are related to your favorites will not be deleted/removed.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Another reason the files may not be deleted is because they are currently in use. Try deleting the files when Internet Explorer is completely closed. The easiest way
 to do this is to:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Close
 all windows of<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Internet Explorer</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Internet
 Options</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Press<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Enter</strong>
 on your keyboard</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Delete</strong>,
 under the <span>&nbsp;</span><strong>General</strong> tab, under the
<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Browsing history</strong> heading</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Uncheck
 all boxes</span></span></p>

            Hi Robert,<br />
<br />
It is not feasible to migrate the files and folders of China (QQ) to Office 365. However, we do can set up your China (QQ) mailbox account as a “Connected account” of your Office 365 account. Via this method, we can receive the emails sent to your China (QQ)
 mailbox in your Office 365 account. <br />
Note: When setting up your China (QQ) account as the Office 365’s connected account, it is needed to ensure your China (QQ) mailbox account’s settings are enabled (POP/IMAP). You can enable them in your China (QQ) mailbox’s settings&gt; Account&gt;POP/IMAP. For more
 information, please refer to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Connect-email-accounts-in-Outlook-on-the-web-Office-365-d7012ff0-924f-4f78-8aca-c3912d886c4d?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            When Outlook 2019 started up it set up my email easily through my ISP.&nbsp; Unfortunately, when I looked at the data file it set it up as a .OST file.&nbsp; When I tried to find a way to use my old .PST files from Outlook 2013 they open in 2019 but there seems
 to be no way to set them up as the default and the files where new mail goes to.&nbsp; The old archive.pst file can be opened but I cannot use it because I get a message that states it is not unicode compatible.&nbsp; Since I cannot seem to find a way to utilize my
 .PST file from Outlook 2013 other than simply opening it in Outlook 2019, none of my contacts or notes ported over.&nbsp; I am REALLY not liking the automated setup of Outlook 2019.&nbsp;

            OST file means you've set a mail access by IMAP protocol. If you want your mail would be delivered to PST file you need to set POP3/SMTP access to your mailbox.
<br />The exact settings should be provided by e-mail provider.
<br />

<br />...........
<br />When I tried to find a way to use my old .PST files from Outlook 2013 they open in 2019 but there seems to be no way to set them up as the default and the files where new mail goes to.  
<br />.................
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Hi James
<br />
<br />There seem to be a few salient details missing from your descriptions but first some givens
<br />
<br />#1 - There's absolutely no question about whether or not &lt;any&gt; Outlook version supports a PST file - all do including '2019 which leads into #2
<br />
<br />#2 - Outlook '2013 thru the current versions all configure an email account the same way. More specifically, if only the email address and password is entered, the account would be configured as an IMAP account by default which uses an .ost file.
<br />
<br />So, if your Outlook '2013 configured the account as a POP3 account, one of two scenarios would be applicable
<br />
<br />a) an in place (in place = on the same machine) upgrade was performed from an earlier version of Outlook ('2010 or earlier) to '2013 OR
<br />
<br />b) the email account was manually configured
<br />
<br />#3 - Only POP3 accounts can be configured to deliever emails to a specific &lt;Inbox&gt; folder. Not an option for an IMAP account
<br />
<br />#4 - In terms of the Unicode error you've encountered, that ould indicate one of two situations
<br />
<br />a) The PST file is an ANSI based file which would mean it would have been carried over from a very old version of Outlook thru the years. However, even if that's the case, Outlook '2019 will open an ANSI based PST file. I just double-checked that using Outlook '2019 version 1904 11601.20178.(from the Office 2019 suite - not Office 365).. 
<br />
<br />b) the PST file has become corrupted. This could easily occur if the file was copied from a machine where it was being used while Outlook was still open.
<br />
<br />#5 - Am unclear exactly what the current situation is but am assumig this involves a new machine with a new installation of Office and you are configuring the account(s)? Is that correct? If yes, do you still have the old machine from which to copy files from?

<p>Yes, but the file location is also changed, into "temp..." Strange !<br />
And when you import your old pst file, it does not take the sub folder, only the inbox mails, without folders !!</p>
<p>Now that Microsoft is the owner of the programme, they change what you buy as they like. It is a scandal, If I could I would throw everything in the REAL bin and never open a computer anymore.</p>
<p>have a nice day however, if still possible.</p>

</p><p>Many of the times apps installed on either SD card or Phone memory getting lost there short cuts or suddenly getting not loaded.And some time D:\some junk path use to get displaying on Phone menu.</p>
<p>If we play any game for more then 30 min (or) if we do a skype video call phone is getting heated in the rear end like iron box.Hope Microsoft will surely fix this issues in there latest release of OS update at least.</p>

<h2>            Word template dotx files do not open as a new document when clicked, when right clicking the only option is edit.</h2>
                    <p>We have dotx files saved on a shared drive managed by an admin assistant so all our reports are the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on one of these templates as i used to in Word 2013, it no longer opens up a new document "Document 1" as a docx file, it opens as the original template ready for editing. As such some of the functionality of using a template is lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i right click on nthe dotx file the top option is "edit" rather than open or new as it used to be. Open and new are not available as choices.</p>

<p>I am the OP and so far none of the responses has addressed the problem i posted, or the similar issue observed by others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What we would like is an answer to how Word 365 on Windows 10 can revert to the age old default of opening a dotx file as a new docx when we click on it. We don't want to save it to a local drive (not that that works anyway), because
 then any global changes made to the template will not be used by persons using their local copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is Microsoft thinking behind this? Why isn't there a fix to return the default option to "New", instead of "edit", and why don't "new", "open", "print" etc. still show as right click options?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>This is NOT something Microsoft has done. The default DOUBLE-click action for a template file remains creation of a new document based on the template. Something is wrong with your installation. Did you try a repair?</p>

<p>This is a rather cryptic reply. "because there were changes made prior to the issue" is not very clear to me. Of course there were changes made... that is why one has to do a sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at the post by Benoit Barabe that you referenced. It recommends installing two patches. The first seems obsolete. I compared the dates of the files in the second patch with the ones on my system and my system has newer versions that presumably came
 via Windows Update. So I don't think I need the patches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't read the whole of that thread but it seemed partly to be dealing with problems being repeatedly prompted for the Microsoft Live account details (this is an issue we saw at one point). Also I think another suggested solution was to update to OneNote
 2013. Something I have been trying to avoid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if it helps, and as I have the same error, here are some facts about my case:</p>
<p>I am using OneNote 2010 on Win 7 x64</p>
<p>The Notebook is shared via Sharepoint by another user (I do not have a 365 account, he does).</p>
<p>The section giving trouble is password protected.</p>
<p>The section was built on a Macbook. It is failing to fully synch to me.</p>
<p>I have tried closing and re-opening the section on Win7.</p>
<p>A few new pages are not synching. Everything else looks like it is synching.</p>
<p>[There was one page which would not synch before but I moved it's contents on the Macbook to a new page and deleted it]</p>

<p>I also found this response to not be helpful in any way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is very similar to yours. My work computer has office 2010 on Windows 7 x32&nbsp;professional on it. (Updating it to a newer version isn't a option for me because it's a company computer)&nbsp;My home computer has windows 10 home with just the&nbsp;onenote app
 installed. My phone and tablet both have the onenote app installed. I have a password protected section that was updated via my home computer and the office 2010 version of onenote won't update the password protected section but all other sections do update.
 The phone and tablet have no issues updating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would say that the office 2010 version of onenote needs to be fixed/updated!</p>

<p>It does seem to be an issue with OneNote 2010 and password protected sections.</p>
<p>I upgraded to OneNote 2016 and was able to sync the problem notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In upgrading I rediscovered some of the reasons I'd rolled back a previous attempt to upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I wanted the sections down the left hand side of the page (there are far too many for it to be practical to have them as tabs). This issue was overcome with the help of my brother. You have to do two things: (a)&nbsp;go into File - Options - Display and tick
 the checkbox against "Navigation bar appears on the left" (b) Click the notebook drop-down at top left and then click the pin to pin the Notebooks to the Navigation pane. Although only Notebooks appear in the drop down, the sections appear once the notebooks
 are pinned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The Notebook and Section names in the Navigation pane take up more vertical space than they did in OneNote 2010. This was presumably done to improve accessibility, particularly on touch screens. I am not using touch but I cannot find a way to reduce the
 size of this list so I have to do some vertical scrolling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Heading styles have changed. I preferred the way they were (using bold font)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, OneNote 2010 (part of Office) and OneNote 2016 seem to be able to co-exist. I can run them both at once on the same machine. They seem to be staying in sync with each other... though it is probably better to just use the 2016 version.</p>

<p>I have this problem every time I change anything in a password protected section using the latest Android client or the Windows 10 App client, after a change was made using a OneNote 2010 client on a Windows 7 machine, even though
 I do a sync all on the OneNote 2010 machine before trying to edit on the Android or Windows 10 App client.&nbsp; The cloud copy of the notebook, which is resident on OneDrive Consumer, gets updated with the change from the Android or Windows 10 App client.&nbsp; Following
 that, the OneNote 2010 client cannot sync the section.&nbsp; The Notebook gets "incomplete sync" error&nbsp;0xE0000579 and the previous contents of the section are still in the OneNote 2010 resident copy of the notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Opening and closing notebooks, and copying and moving sections, is not a valid solution.&nbsp; I have over 20 notebooks, holding several hundred mb of content, and I'm
 trying to demonstrate that this solution will be robust enough to support several gb of content, but I keep hitting roadblocks relating to syncing and passwords between all of the different platforms that OneNote is supposed to be compatible with, including
 Windows 7, Windows 10, Android, iOS, Mac, and the various different versions of Office that are deployed; with some notebooks hosted on OneDrive Consumer, some on OneDrive for Business, some on Sharepoint, and some on local but networked PCs.</span></p>

<p>Hi Frank,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For us to identify what is causing this issue, we need to confirm some information. Please answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did you first encounter this issue?</li><li>Are getting the same error code 0xE0000579 when syncing your OneNote?</li><li>Any changes that took place on your computer before this issue occurred?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we suggest that you perform the troubleshooting steps below to help isolate the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Check if there is an available update for Office. Detailed steps are provided on this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link.</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If the notebook that won’t sync is stored on OneDrive or on newer versions of SharePoint, try opening the notebook in OneNote Online (at www.onenote.com). This can help determine if the problem is caused by the server or by OneNote.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. In OneNote, click File &gt; Info.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Right-click the URL shown below the name of the affected notebook, and click Copy.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. In your Web browser, click inside the Address box, and then press Ctrl + V to paste the copied URL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Press Enter to load the notebook in OneNote Online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result and please provide the required information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you. </p>

<p>Hi Anna,&nbsp;<br />
</p>
I followed your instructions, but the problem persist .....<br />
If you reviewed earlier posts, you can find that the sync problem is with notebooks with sections with key security.&nbsp;<br />
In my case, my notebook sync with windows 7 (where I use with more frequency the notebook) , IOS 11, IOS 9 (Ipad outdated), and for me is very exhausting save the section, copy and sync whenever I make a change.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
PS. Apologize for mi English, I hope that you understand me, if anything doesn't clarity, please tell me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Regards,&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>Gustavo</p>

<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>**Update**</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the next steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Close notebook from app OneNote in my iPhone (IOS 11.2.5)</p>
<p>2. Try sync the notebook from app OneNote in my laptop (Windows 7).... <strong>
Result:</strong> Sync Fail&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Remove the password in the section with protection and sync again .... <strong>
Result:</strong> Sync OK</p>
<p>4. Setting a password in the section and sync... <strong>Result:</strong> Sync OK</p>
<p>5. Make a change into the password protected section and&nbsp; sync ... <strong>Result:</strong> Sync OK</p>
<p>6. Open the notebook in my iPhone and&nbsp; sync from the Windows OneNote (I don't change from iPhone app)&nbsp; ...
<strong>Result:</strong> Sync OK</p>
<p>7. Open Protected Section from iPhone App and sync from the Windows OneNote. <strong>
Result: </strong>Fail. it's generate the Error Code 0xE0000579 Incomplete Sync to Protected Section.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>The error is produced when iPhone app sync the protected section, something happening in OneDrive don't allow to sync again the protected section from Windows app.<br />
</p>
I try to remember since when it error is produced , and my only association is with the upgrade of IOS (version 10 to 11)
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope that this test help to developers to generate a error solution</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>

    <title>Outlook 2010 attachments sending as winmail.dat to Mac users - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gemma mclean  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 attachments sending as winmail.dat to Mac users</h2>
                    <p>I had an issue arise where my hotmail account on Outlook 2010 would send attachments (Word documents, PDFs etc) as winmail.dat files to my mac recipients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I applied this registry edit (https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/kb/958012) and restarted my PC but to no avail. Then I removed one of the mac users from my contacts/address book and deleted them from the auto-complete address list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon sending a new email, it finally worked as intended with the correct attachments. I tried again, using the newly added auto-complete entries and again all was fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I then tried adding them as Outlook contacts again, making sure to select "Let Outlook decide the best sending format" as per this article:&nbsp;http://www.slipstick.com/problems/outlook-is-sending-winmail-dat-attachments/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sent a new email with an attachment and it's back to winmail.dat again. This is even when I don't use the contact as the actual recipient, but use the auto-complete email address as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I remove the contact and the auto-complete entries and start again, it works again, but as soon as I add the contact...it's back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how I can solve the problem AND have my mac recipients as contacts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Gemma,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To help you resolve the issue, we suggest that you run the OffCAT Tool from this

<p>
</p><p>1. Open <strong>Outlook </strong>-&gt; <strong>File </strong>-&gt; <strong>Options </strong>
-&gt; <strong>Mail </strong>and scroll to the bottom of the dialog and choose <strong>
Convert to Plain Text format</strong>. </p>

Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.<br />
<br />
I need more information to help you better.<br />
<br />
1) What do you mean by re-opens to the menu? Does Word&nbsp;re-open as a blank page? <br />
<br />
2) Do you receive any error when this issue occurs? If&nbsp;yes, what is the complete error?<br />
<br />
3) Does this issue occur with other&nbsp;Office application files like Excel or PowerPoint?<br />
<br />
We look forward to your reply to assist&nbsp;you further.<br />

            <p>Today I started to have the exact same problem as SharonCalcutt describes, but instead it is with Word documents on my computer or on mapped network drives. Double-clicking on any Word document in explorer results in Word launching itself and then closing
 itself, and then relaunching itself and displaying the blue page with the recent docs on the left and on the right the various options for creating new Word docs. No error messages are displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that my problem may have started after receiving a Word doc via email which may have contained code which altered registry or TrustCenter settings for MS Office or Word since full scans of my computer with two different antivirus products produced
 zero hits.This is just a hypothesis at this point.</p>

            <p>Hi Doug,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is on my list of things to try tomorrow since I had read a similar thread on another web site which mentioned that this may work. The computer with this issue is at another location, so I can't test this scenario until tomorrow. Tomorrow I will also
 try the FixIt tool which is supposed to reset Word (Office) to all of its default registry settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply,</p>

            <p>Hi Doug,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I tried your suggestion of first starting Word and then trying to open documents via both File&gt;Open and via double-clicking on a Word doc in windows explorer. Same problem. I also ran a full AV scan of the computer's hard drive by booting from a USB
 stick with an AV scanning program with latest updates. Nothing except remnants of the Ask Toolbar PUP which it removed, but those remnants have been on the computer for months. I recall reading somewhere else that an Outlook update may be the cause of the
 problem and that uninstalling a KB update might fix the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>

<h2>            Could I dial in a sip server or h.323 ip address systems from skype &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi:</p>
<p>
</p><p>recently i've been wondering if i could get rid of my old videoconference gear like a polycom vsx7000 endpoint and replace its functionality with skype for business (which i already have). one of the main features i need is to dialin a videoconference bridge
 over the internet; I just dial its ip address. is there anyway to do this with skype for business ?</p>

<p>Hi FranciscoGarcia,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am taking over this thread now. You want to dial in a IP address to connect to a audio conference directly as what you did with the polycom, right? According to my experience and research, Skype for business has not the releted settings to meet your goal.
 In Skype for Business, we can organize the meeting as the following article shows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/video-schedule-a-skype-for-business-meeting-69a3716c-7eaf-42fe-907e-4b63ce13565d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/video-schedule-a-skype-for-business-meeting-69a3716c-7eaf-42fe-907e-4b63ce13565d</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a workaround, you can send a <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up-a-skype-for-business-meeting-in-outlook-b8305620-d16e-4667-989d-4a977aad6556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
meeting request</a> via Outlook to the attendees and invite to the meetings. If I misunderstand you, please feel free to let us know. Thanks for your time and efforts.</p>
