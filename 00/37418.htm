                    <p>original title: I need SP1 </p>
<p>I just reinstalled Windows vista and lost all my updates and files, now I can get updates because you no longer offer SP1, tried downloaded SP2 and I CAN'T. You want users to upgrade to windows 7, but Why should I have to pay 120 because you decided not
 to support it any longer! What benefits are there for your customers that have VISTA?</p>

<p>I'm afraid your only recourse will be another format &amp; clean install of Vista. Melissa.</p>

    <title>Getting Service Pack 1 on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Getting Service Pack 1 on Windows 10</h2>
                    Hi There, I am currently running Windows 10 Technical Preview, as you are aware the Official Windows 10 is to be released very soon. Therefore I wanted to reserve a free upgrade. However, The little Windows logo in my notifications has not appeared, so
 i tried updating and checking for any windows updates. I also turned on Windows automatic Updates, but this did not help the sittuation. I had heared that to upgrade to windows 10 you require service pack 1. I went onto my computer properties but it does not
 tell me which service pack i am running. I Really need help urgently as time is running out and i will loose my copy of windows should this problem not be solved.

</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you will be able to upgrade from the Windows Insider Preview to the RTM build for free.</p>
<p>Company officials have noted though if you join the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso-update?os=win10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Latest confirmation:</p>
<span>
<p>When asked if there would be a cut off date for Insiders before Windows 10 reached RTM, Microsoft's Gabriel Aul stated that preview builds would continue being delivered up until the final release.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"We expect to keep flighting builds to Insiders all the way up to RTM. More details to come, but no cutoff planned."</em></p>

    <title>Play music in .WMA format - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Play music in .WMA format</h2>
                    <p>I have just upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10.</p>
<p>I have a large library of music. All of the files are in .WMA format. </p>
<p>In Windows 7 &nbsp;&nbsp;I could play these files by using Windows Media Player. </p>
<p>In Windows 10 the new version of Windows Media Player will not play them. It gives me the following message: “Can’t play.&nbsp; Choose something else to play. This item is in a format we don’t support.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If I click on ‘Find Help for this’ I get help for Xbox – Not very helpful.</p>
<p>If I start Windows Media Player by the following procedure:</p>
<p>Press Windows key + R</p>
<p>Type: wmplayer.exe</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">Hit Enter</p>
<p>I get the following message:&nbsp; “Windows Media Player cannot play the file. The Player might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file.”</p>
<p>Groove Music does not play this format either.</p>
<p>How can I play my music in&nbsp; .WMA files.</p>

Edit: Now the system restore suddenly worked, half of the time when I get to desktop none of the programs are openable, I can't even open a right click menu. It also often prompts a sorttbls.nlp error in the beginning. And then when I restart it, startup stops
 working again. I tried turning off autoupdate (when programs were opening) after one of my system restores, but it didn't change anything, startup started not working again.<br />
Also there is a microsoft.net shim error but I'm unable to open it's tab, I can merely see it on the taskbar.<br />

&nbsp;1. I recently downloaded a torrent<br />
<br />
( I know, probably stupid), I did not make any hardware changes. I'm assuming I caught a virus from the torrent, although the computer was working fine for about 3-4 days after I had installed the torrent.<br />
2. Since it's a notebook, I often connect it to a monitor, speakers, a usb charger.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, safe mode seems to work, I will try all of the above and to run a virus scan with malwarebytes.</p>

<h2>            USB Media Descriptor Request Failed &#40;code 43&#41; - Western Digital MyBook WD10000-U-00</h2>
                    <p>I am receiving the following error when attempting to connect my WD MyBook to my computer after installing windows 10:</p>
<p>USB Media Descriptor Request failed (Code 43)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unsure as to the cause. I am attempting to connect a model WD10000-U-00 via USB to my computer. It was previously functional under windows 7 and only stopped working after my upgrade to 10. The drive was completely functional and had no issues previously
 so I strongly doubt it is a hardware problem on the part of the drive. I could attempt to cannibalize the drive and run a direct SATA connection to the internal drive's connector but I'd rather keep it intact in it's casing for the time being if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            Forza loyalty cars&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>For those of you who received your "Forza Loyalty Cars" from the game, at what point of the game did this occur?&nbsp; Does it only look for FM4 profiles?&nbsp; I've only got an FM3 profile, and haven't received anything (though I only started playing last night and
 have only done a few events so far).&nbsp; Am I just "not loyal enough" for not having played FM4? lol</p>

<p>It happened for me the first time I was at the festival. I was working my way around all the hubs there, paint, car club, marketplace etc and they opened up there. I think it was at the auto show stop. I do know it was right at the start of the game for
 me.</p>

<p>Thanks, Fyerball. &nbsp;I got mine last night. &nbsp;Odd...I got the achievement for visiting all of the shops at the festival, but there was no mention of loyalty cars. &nbsp;I went out, ran a few races, got a few barn finds, and I think when I came back to collect my
 green wristband was when they popped up. &nbsp;Some pretty decent rides...free is always nice!</p>

<p>This has probably been posted elsewhere, but for those who are interested, the cars you get are:</p>
<p>2011 MINI Cooper S</p>
<p>2011 Citroen DS3 Racing</p>
<p>2012 Dodge Charger SRT8</p>
<p>1969 Chevrolet Camaro SS Coupe</p>
<p>2008 BMW M3</p>
<p>2012 Jaguar XKR-S</p>
<p>2009 Gumpert Apollo S</p>
<p>2012 Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4</p>
<p>I believe I read somewhere that these cars are tied to the level progression of your prior Forza save...so for instance if you hadn't gotten very far, you might only get the Mini...whereas if you had completed the game, you'd receive all of the above.</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Not sure what you mean by that, but the 2012 Charger SRT8 is definitely sitting in my garage, and I didn't pay a penny for it, and it has the little "gift" icon in the upper left of it's thumbnail, so it certainly is a loyalty car.&nbsp; I don't know if you can
 get this <em>particular</em> car through normal game progression...maybe a different model year or slightly different configuration?&nbsp; I haven't really looked into it since I'm not much of a Mopar fan.</p>

<p>Well from what I have seen it's in the game. I have a fellow Moderator who has never played F3 or F4 and he has one as well. Maybe it is a loyalty car but I dont think that matters. I think you can buy it from the store in Horizon. That's what I was getting

<h2>            &#34;WMS Idle&#34; preventing computer shutdown- fix it</h2>
                    Since yesterday, when I try to turn off my pc, a "program not responding" window appears, saying "WMS Idle" is not responding.&nbsp; This program isn't listed in my Control Panel and I have no idea what it is or how to fix it.

Thanks for the suggestion. I remove the Nero7 completely to get rid of this nagging problem.

Lots of similar results implicating the Nero Scout Service, so maybe you can keep your older Nero 7.<br />

<p>It's probably a Zune tag then, and not being used on Xbox Live. They have the same "user pool" when it comes to names. Alternately, if you're using spaces, or no spaces, or something spaces-related, the system makes no distinction between "My Gamer Tag"
 and "MyGamerTag" (for example).</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t print PDF files anymore, Word documents etc are fine. Why&#63;</h2>
                    I used to be able to print all types of files including PDF. &nbsp;Now I suddenly can't print PDF files anymore, the rest are fine. &nbsp;Error message that comes up is "There was a problem connecting to the printer. &nbsp;Make sure it is connected and try again". &nbsp;But
 the printer IS connected because I can print other files. &nbsp;Tried restarting, didn't help. &nbsp;Only thing I can think of that changed is that I updated to Windows 8.1 from Windows 8 not so long ago. &nbsp;Any suggestions?

<p>From where?&nbsp; In the case of IE it seems frequently the only workaround is to print to XPS Document Writer and then print from the XPS Viewer.&nbsp; So, incongruous as it may sound, see if you can print your PDF file to XPS Document Writer and then print the resulting
 .xps.&nbsp; &nbsp;(Actually in W8.1 the default file type is .oxps but same idea.) </p>

<h2>            Computer doesn&#39;t recognize new photos</h2>
                    In the past, my computer would automatically pull my new photos from my iphone when I synced and put them in a file with the date.&nbsp; It's no longer doing that and when I connect my iphone (and reconnect, I've done this repeatedly with the same result),
 it shows that there are no new photos in my device.&nbsp; I loved the convenience of the automatic updates and would like to have that again.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

<p>Hi Marjorie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I just like to isolate this issue that you're having right now with your device recognizing the photos on your iPhone. Did you make any changes on your device before having this issue? Have you already check if there's an update from iTunes app? Are there
 any option on your mobile phone to select whenever you connect your phone to the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will wait for your response.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Mandeep,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to&nbsp;run the built in Audio troubleshooter which should be able to detect and fix most of the audio issues. Open the control panel, click on the 'View by' option on the top and right and select 'large icons'. Click on 'troubleshooting'
 and then select the 'View all' option in the left pane, click on the 'Playing Audio' troubleshooter and run it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, then I would suggest you to visit the PC manufacturer's website to download and install the drivers available for the latest operating system and check if the issue persists. Let us know the results for further assistance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the steps provided in the below link</span></p>

            <span>Edit. UPDATE<br />
What i did is, i don't know this will work for all or not, the solution is just a trick,<br />
Downloaded realtek drivers officially, from<br />
ftp://ftp3.realtek.com.tw/Realtek/Ge..._Win7_WHQL.zip<br />
username : spcust<br />
password : hwwk758z&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Install fresh windows(not compulsory but this is what i did, exact steps)<br />
Install drivers which i gave link,<br />
After installing you will still have no sound,<br />
What you need to do is,&nbsp;<br />
Now there is trick,<br />
Install extra speaker jack or headphone jack on front jack panel,<br />
(Dont unplug original one, mobo one)<br />
Then i got sound, this works for me,<br />
I hope this will work for you..</span>

            Hi Tyler
<br />
<br />Jar files are Java files, ordinary exe files cannot be converted to jar files, because the original application would not have been coded in Java . . 
<br />
<br />Jar to exe can convert a jar file to an exe, by including the java runtime inside the exe file, that does not work the other way around . .. 
<br />
<br />What difficulty are you having running exe files on your PC?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you run the web or offline installer for the .NET Framework 4.5, 4.5.1, 4.5.2, 4.6, 4.6.1, 4.6.2, or 4.7, you might encounter an issue that prevents or blocks the installation of the .NET Framework.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>An example is the error message: "Setup may not run properly, because the Windows Modules Installer Service is not available on this computer."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your issue is more complex than what is typically answered in the Microsoft Answers forums. It is better suited for the IT Pro audience on TechNet. Click
 to post your question in the TechNet Windows 10 Networking forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

<h2>            Laptop randomly shuts off especially when unplugged</h2>
                    My laptop is an Alienware 14 running Windows 10. Every few days or longer, it automatically turns off without warning, and does it a lot more often until I unplug it and wait a long time. It happens even more often whenever it's unplugged at any time.
 There's nothing wrong with the battery, I already replaced the old and broken one last year.

<p>Tried that, didn't work at all. There's nothing different on how it's doing. It also always had a ridiculously short battery life even on the best power settings and even after I replaced the battery. It's an Alienware 14 from late 2013.</p>

<p>I'm running directx11. I understand that Windows 7 comes with it and that directx11 may not have all components of previous directx versions, making some games unplayable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Im having this issue with my game: http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistagaming/thread/f31308d2-3165-47c8-9dc8-61a89ac926a7 and i believe it's a directx issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>however when i visit this link to update my directX i get the following error : "This version of directx is not compatible with the version of windows currently installed."</p>
<p>I have a legitimate copy of Windows 7 Pro 64bit I received from my school. Any ideas anyone?</p>

<h3> igofficenesa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Run a non Windows 10 app at boot</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to find out how to run a program at boot in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The program is not a "modern app", but is a regular old Windows program. I have tried this at home with no luck. (I think while I was at home I was trying to get some system monitoring software to run).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now installing a Time Clock program for a client, and it is an older program. If I place a copy of the shortcut in the startup folder it does nothing. It used to work in Windows 7 with no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I start this program at boot? There is no "start at login" setting in the program. I would like the system to start it up if there is a power failure, but all over the net there is no explanation for why older programs won't start in the startup
 folder.&nbsp; All I can find is, if you right click on the "app" in the start menu, and there's no "open folder location" then they claim it can't run at startup, which I find exceedingly silly. It's a Windows program, and it shouldn't take a rocket scientists
 to get it to run when Windows loads. I hope I don't have to learn how to use some obscure piece of software to get such a simple thing to work. Can't I just add it to some startup script somewhere?</p>

    <title>DLC. Things Need to Change. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> isturbo1984  say:</h3>
<h2>            DLC. Things Need to Change.</h2>
                    
<p>You got DLC coming out for all types of games. From map packs to full-on singleplayer chapters that extend a story to simple access to an additional weapon or item... DLC comes in all types. And they also come in all sizes and prices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, who wouldn't want a complete package? Whether its on release date or a year down the road, what gamer would deny wanting any additional content to a game they own or have access to? The only factor that is present is: "Is the price right?"
 If all DLC were free, it wouldn't be an issue. Not only that, but most games<i> do
</i>have some tidbit of DLC available. Even the crappy B-rated games that don't see decent sales.--But still... Who wouldn't want the complete package? Maybe the issue should be "Is it worth it?" I know I buy DLC to my games if it is worth it. I think I've
 downloaded some packs at 1200 MS points before, but at the high(er) cost, the question of whether or not what I wanted was too pricy was the dominant issue. But it's not really about the money either. I have money. Not really an issue. Everyone does. People
 spend money on what they like, that's how the world is. Bums with a bad smoking or drinking habbits always get theirs, lol. Not gonna stop. Likewise, gamers who can't really afford the new CoD and Halo map packs will still buy and download them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think, as the title says, things need to change. You can't always fall back on the money argument. "If the consumer keeps buying the games and content, then the developers and publishers will keep pumping them out." Not an infallible truth, nor was it
 always the way of the video game industry. But a major adjustment in the way DLC is made needs to be had. For starters, every extra piece of DLC that cost money needs to be worth it. And not by a little either.--By a lot. Either that or go back to the old
 school: Include all the DLC on disc. Don't save the good ideas for a rainy day to squeeze an extra dollar. And instead of extending every dead game far beyond its point of expiration, put all those good ideas in for of a good sequel. and just for clarification,
 I am not supporting any pushed sequel as an excuse to lack of DLC. thoughts?</p>

<p>Like I've said before, the biggest protest any one individual can make with regard to DLC is not to buy it. &nbsp; i don't mind purchasing certain DLC and if i think the content justifies the purchase, i really have no qualms doing so. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My main issue with DLC is micro transactions (stuff like guns, hair styles, alternative costumes, map packs, player modes etc). &nbsp;It's obvious these are ripped from the game as to allow the likes of EA, Capcom, Lionhead etc an extra buck or two and is the
 sole reason i haven't bought a Capcom game and the reason I'll never purchase another Lionhead game. &nbsp;It's just a pity BioWare are currently in bed with EA otherwise I'd stop buying EA products too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used to absolutely love the Street Fighter and Resident Evil series, but because the games are heavily stripped back when released, i simply refuse to give Capcom my money.</p>

<p>Gizmo said it. &nbsp;Certain games I have I will always but the DLC, just due to the game being a favorite, but other games that offer DLC are not worth any further investment. &nbsp;It all depends on the person. &nbsp;Until these DLC installments restrict us from playing
 our original purchase, I have no concerns, it's all choice.</p>

<p>Its all in the eye of the be holder. 1 person might think that certain DLC is not worth the price and another person may&nbsp;think its completely worth the price. A friend of mine just bought the COD BO: Newest map pack but&nbsp;they dont play the online multi player,
 just zombies, to me that's a lot of cash for one map, but to them its totally worth it for the amount of&nbsp;fun they will&nbsp;get out of the map.<br />
<br />
DLC is to keep a game alive and keep the fan base playing it. It takes millions to make a game and thousands to keep serves running and support like bugfix's and DLC keep developers profits up to keep on making and supporting more titles.
<br />
<br />
My idea for DLC like weapon, items, the small stuff&nbsp;is to not charge for them, have them achivement locked. So say you would need to get 1000G on that games score to unlock the extra stuff. It would still keep people playing the game at no extra cost.<br />
<br />
But you guys are&nbsp;about companies like EA &amp; Capcom making stupid DLC instead of adding it the game on release. I support DLC that is designed to make a game better or more fun, I hate DLC that is made just to increase the profits without giving anything back
 to the gamer. <br />
<br />
Take EA's Fight Night Champion for example, when you fight online weather you win or lose, you gain XP then you use that XP to increase your stats on your fighter to make them better. But EA allows you to buy XP packs for MSP,&nbsp;so you don't have to earn the
 state points. Pay to win.<br />

<p>[/quote]Yet Valve give out free DLC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Sacrifice for example is free on the PC for both Left4Dead games but because of Microsoft rules it was charged for on the 360.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a developer/publishers wants to offer content for free, then surely Microsoft should let them.</p>

<p>[/quote]You know that if you get BF3 limited pre order all DLC maps are free right? Just like with BC2. How is EA ripping you off? And Bioware gives you 5-6 hours of extra game time with there DLC.</p>

<p>I agree with IS. &nbsp;I would rather buy an expansion with all dlc's that keep waiting for more content. This DLC "tradition" and the achievements are the worst idea in games IMO. Sometimes devs cut content from games to sell later as DLC.</p>

    <title>Windows camera won&#39;t turn on for facial recognition - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows camera won&#39;t turn on for facial recognition</h2>
                    <p>The facial recognition sign-in (or "Windows Hello") has worked fine ever since I bought my Samsung notebook a year ago. Now, every time, I get a "can't turn camera on" message and need to sign in with my pin.&nbsp; If I recall right, a Windows update ran shortly
 before this happened. How can I get this function working again?</p>

            Hi. SallyJohnson
<br />My name is Ben
<br />Independent Advisor
<br />I hope to help.
<br />
<br />	To solve this incident you must log in to the computer and press the Windows + I keys, and enter the option Accounts and Login Options, where you must find a corresponding slider to Use my login information to finish configuring automatically the device after an update or a restart.
<br />
<br />	Disable this item and restart your computer.
<br />
<br />	After this, you can also reconfigure Windows Hello from the beginning.
<br />
<br />	To do this, disable the feature by going to Start&gt; Settings&gt; Accounts&gt; Login options, select the camera or fingerprint reader, then click Remove to remove the face scan or fingerprint reader.

<p>I appreciate your very clear response.&nbsp; I followed all the instructions, but when I went to reconfigure the facial recognition, I got another message that the camera won't turn on.&nbsp; I have no idea what to do next. I don't know why on earth the camera suddenly
 stopped working, except that there was something in that system update that affected it.&nbsp; But I don't know how to get at that, much less fix it.</p>

            hi. that happens when the camera loses the configuration this usually happens sometimes because of the updates, many times the drives are not compatible
