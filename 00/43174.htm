<h2>            Canon Pixma MP160 &#38; Windows 10</h2>
                    Just upgraded from <em>Windows 8.1</em> to <em>Windows 10 </em>on my <em>1 year old HP laptop. Connected my

<em>Device Manager</em>, it's not detected by <em>Paint</em> or <em>Photoshop. Not even by the new

            <p>Hi IN not sure if you have tried&nbsp;using the manufacturers early driver version (from the Canon site that I visited last update was version 1.11) and use Win 10 Troubleshoot Compatibility feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the MP160 ver 1.11 (Win 7/Vista x86 &amp; 64bit) the Win compatibility mode&nbsp;can run it&nbsp;as Win Vista SP2 (unfortunately I can not test the scanner &amp; printer&nbsp;as I do not have this model, currently I'm using MP280 and this model is included or embedded in
 the OS)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If&nbsp; Win Device Manager can detect the printer, how about in Device&nbsp;Manager &gt; Imaging Devices&nbsp;if the scanner listed, in Devices &amp; Printer if you right click the printer icon does it have an option to Scan (this use WIA not TWAIN)</p>

<p>I get the same message on my screen when trying to scan from my Canon MX850 to my PC.</p>

<p>Yet if I open the MP Navigator EX1.1 app on my computer I can scan using the app. I've checked the canon site and no windows10 navigator update yet.</p>
<p>It must be a driver problem. Any ideas?&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>I have a Canon MP160 and was informed by Canon that they do not have or intend to make drivers for that printer. So I went and bought a Canon MP230 which does have drivers available and it works perfectly.</strong></p>

            <p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>I found a way to use the Canon Pixma MP160's scanner under windows 10 like this:</p>
<p>STEP 1:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fc002b26-9845-4f5d-9d30-d501a98ed1f5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fc002b26-9845-4f5d-9d30-d501a98ed1f5" /></a></p>
<p>and STEP 2:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/40dd6f5b-5b99-47df-af80-5201455c9960" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/40dd6f5b-5b99-47df-af80-5201455c9960" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see the Preview is working, and after that when i hit the scan button, i got my image scanned to the computer in the folder:&nbsp;C:\Users\&lt;my user name&gt;\Pictures\Scans</p>
<p>I hope that this helps until Canon will come up with a better solution.</p>
<p>If i did something wrong please accept my apologies, it is the first time when i post in this community.</p>
<p>I made a shortcut of the printer on the desktop, so when i click on it, i see this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/50773bbf-d2fa-48f6-a925-803f3d000c2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/50773bbf-d2fa-48f6-a925-803f3d000c2b" /></a></p>
<p>so i just click on the "Scan Photos and Documents" and i don't have to go to the Control Panel each time when i want to scan something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Janos.</p>

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I got it to work perfectly on Windows 10. (MP160)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: Unplug and turn off the printer</p>
<p>Step 2: Uninstall all the drivers </p>
<p>Step 3: Install the Win7 drivers</p>
<p>Step 4: Connect the printer and turn ON</p>
<p>
</p><p>By doing so, you avoid Win10 to install the "wrong" driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I started to scan normally using "Not another PDF scanner" software. Simple software that does the job right.

    <title>How do I report someone that I believe is a predator&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rtomolillo  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I report someone that I believe is a predator&#63;</h2>
                    My adult son has disabilities. He has an xbox one and plays games. Recently, this person, claiming to be a female, joined a group that he is in. She says, she is from Montana, but she doesn't know where. She is trying to talk the members into drinking,<strong>[Mod
 Removed]</strong>, etc. Currently, she told my son that they are dating. He is supposed to build her stuff in the games, and buy credits to use on her. She said she can only message him, because she doesn't have a cell phone, she's saving money for a kinect,
 and her laptop is so old it doesn't have a camera so she stops skype calls but sends messages through
<strong>[Mod Removed-Personal Information]</strong>. He asked to see her after several family members questioned her motives. The group has other individuals in it with disabilities and they formed so they could role play how to effectively
 communicate with others. Again, my son is an adult, he has disabilities, he won't report her because they are dating (planning on having kids). I have her screen name, and the messages "she" is sending can be seen. Is there a way to report this.&nbsp;

<p>If you believe that this person is actually a predator, report that person to the police with the information and usernames you have from the various services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Telling people to "hurt" themselves by talking them into drinking or whatever the word filter censored in your original post is a violation of the Xbox Live Code of Conduct. So please report that message to the Xbox Live Enforcement Team via the console's
 reporting feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bring up the offending message(s) and use the report feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However when that person is using different services like messaging through "<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>", Xbox can't do anything about it, which is why you need to report that to the actual police.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While you can block the person on Xbox Live, since your son is an adult, he can un-block the person again. Also you can't restrict his account to only talk to people from his friend list, as he could set the online and privacy settings to allow anyone again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So your only real option, if you think the person is a predator taking advantage of your son by scamming money or virtual currency from him, report this person to the actual police, since you say the conversations are not limited to Xbox Live.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi rtomolillo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums for this issue. I would have to recommend all of the steps that have been previously recommended by our wonderful Ambassadors. No one wishes this kind of thing to happen to their loved ones and the first step that should be
 taken, if you believe this individual to be harmful, is the one recommended by Smwutches regarding reporting this person to the
<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Enforcement website</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, we here on the forums do not have the tools that the Enforcement team does and they would be the best at helping in this situation. The information provided by our other Ambassadors (blocking the individual, reporting to law enforcement, etc.) is
 also a good crucial step to take in order to keep your family, as well as others, safe from this potentially harmful individual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this information helps out and wish you the best in dealing with this difficult situation.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>You can also try&nbsp;clearing your 'cache' (temporary internet files' and do not leave the option to preserve favorites checked. Also run a malware (virus) scan.

<p>
</p><p>And make sure the site isn't accidentally 'blacklisted' (listed as a harmful site) by accident (Internet options &gt; Security tab&nbsp;&gt;Click the Restricted sites icon and scroll through the list).</p>

</p><p>If you find a URL listed by accident you can remove it by clicking to highlight it and then the remove button. Make sure you have the right one, those URLs in that list are there because historical evidence of malware or illicit/illegal activities and sites

<h2>            VIDEO_INTERNAL_SCHEDULER_ERROR on new laptop, nothing seems to solve the issue.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the beginning of September I purchased a Lenovo Yoga 530. Unfortunately, on the very first day I got a BSOD while watching youtube. It was the VIDEO_INTERNAL_SCHEDULER_ERROR. As it was a brand new laptop and the webshop I bought it from was known to have
 great customer service, I didn't bother to try solve the issue and sent it back straight away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I received the new one almost a little over 2 weeks ago. Unfortunately, the same error keeps happening. Specifically and solely when watching youtube. And I don't know if it's a coincidence, but the last two times it happened, it was when I was browsing
 Facebook while youtube was running in another tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the following things:</p>
<p>- Updated windows</p>
<p>- Did a chkdsk, said there was nothing wrong</p>
<p>- Updated drivers</p>
<p>All of these things didn't help.</p>
<p>Then I reset the laptop to factory settings. This did seem to help, for over a week not one BSOD occured. However, the problem is still there because I got the BSOD again a couple of times in the past few days.</p>
<p>Then I tried this:</p>
<p>- Scanned performance using windows defender, said nothing is wrong</p>
<p>- Toggled the fast start up settings.</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Updated windows again</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically I tried almost all of the tips on this list:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14238/windows-10-troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors and nothing seems to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know much about computers so please keep it simple :)&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Mar_VH, from your description of events, this is more than likely caused by your video card/chip device driver, however, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .       
        </p>

            Hi Mar_VH
<br />
<br />Yes, the mini-dump file indicates your video card device driver, you should look to possibly installing a slightly older driver which may be more compatible with your system . . .
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />Restart your PC once done . . .
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running

<p>The button Roll back driver is not clickable, unfortunately</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>And if I understand correcty, I have to go to the Lenovo website and install the recommended drivers for the display manually?</p>

            Hi Mar_VH
<br />
<br />That means there is no previous version of the driver installed, yes it would be best to gt the driver recommended on the Lenovo website . . .

<p>Thank you for your advice &amp; time</p>
<p>It took me a while but my not so technical self managed to manually install a slightly older driver that was recommended on the&nbsp; lenovo website for this laptop specifically</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last 2 questions</p>
<p>- Is there any way to find out quickly whether this solution works? Or is waiting all I can do?</p>
<p>- If it does not work and the error occurs again, would you think it's best to send it back &amp; get a new laptop or does that not make any difference at all if the problem is within the operating system?</p>

            Hi Mar_VH
<br />
<br />Your only option is to wait and see if you no longer get system crashes . . . 
<br />
<br />With regards to returning the laptop, Lenovo, might just say it is an incompatibility with a recent Windows Update and that they are not responsible, and in a sense, they are correct.
<br />
<br />It is the responsibility of the graphics hardware manufacturer to provide u to date device drivers that work with the new Windows 10 updates . ..

<p>Unfortunately, got the BSOD again today</p>
<p>There were 2 recommended drivers for my device on the website, I installed one yesterday and it didn't help obviously and now I tried to install another one but for some reason it won't work? I don't know what I'm doing wrong but the driver just won't install
 &amp; show up on the list, every folder I save it to is 'empty' when I search</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else I can do? It's pretty frustrating and knowing that a new laptop might not help sucks.</p>

We are using a Whole Disk Encryption system and the only way you can enter your password in on the Surface Pro is to hold the volume up button in prior to turning on the device. I read that you can get around it on other tablets if you

<p>Gamerscore resets are not done without 100% proof of modification. That being said IF you were not in control of your account at the time of the modification then you should contact support and have them do an UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS INVESTIGATION, at which
 time they will lock the account until it is complete, usually within 7-30 business days. If it is found to have been out of your control they will remove the CHEATER watermark but the reset will stand as issued because unauthorized methods were used to adjust
 the gamerscore. After all, account security is not just MS's responsibility, it is OURS as well.</p>
<p>Your only recourse at this time would be to start over with a new account and earn all of your achievements legit from here on out. You should also take a few minutes to read up on and practice

<p>The only channel for appealing your GS reset is the Enforcers, but since yours was over 6 months ago, I'm betting that isn't going to happen. The only thing you should do about a GS reset is prevent it from happening and not cheat. The TOU is not meant to
 be taken lightly. </p>

<h2>            Why aren&#39;t calls coming through on Skype&#63;</h2>
                    Microsoft forced through an update for the new and less improved version of Skype. Since that has happened calls now Don't push through on my galaxy S8. Instead I get missed call icons on the top of my screen even though no call has rang through. My version
 is up to date, i have uninstalled and reinstalled. Nothing fixed it.&nbsp; Is this issue going to be resolved?&nbsp;

<h2>            amd phenom II 840 on XP 32bit</h2>
                    while tracking other problems on my system theoiru Microsoft Answers, omeone mentioned that XP 32 bit might have issues running a 4 core processor. this sounds like it might explain a lot, but all i can find is articles on XP64 and Server 200X. IS there
 a problem with XP 32 on 4 core 64 bit processors?

<h2>            TABCTL32.OCX file missing</h2>
                    My forest inventory software accepts data but when it comes time to do the analysis, I get the screen prompt, TABCTL32.OCX not correctly registered; a file missing or invalid.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is this a file that can be downloaded and copied to the c:\Windows\SysWOW64\ files?</div>

<p>Hello Bob, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Thank You for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This error is usually displayed to a user when the application throwing this error is unable to find the tabctl32.ocx file or finds that this file is not registered or is denied access to this file by the applied permissions. Most of the time, it is caused
 by an unregistered tabctl32.ocx file. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I am providing a couple of steps below that should help you re-register this file in the computer, please follow them and let us know the results:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open a command prompt with Administrator privileges:&nbsp;</div>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, type in <strong>cmd</strong> in the Start Menu search box,
<strong>right click</strong> on the <strong>cmd</strong> option displayed in the search results, and click on
<strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Allow</strong> or <strong>Continue</strong> at the User Account Control prompt that should be displayed next.</li></ol>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now you should have a command prompt with Administrator privileges open.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong> Execute a re-registering process of the tabctl32.ocx file by running the following commands one after the other. I am providing one command in one line, type them in one by one and hit
<strong>Enter</strong> after each command:&nbsp;</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>cd\</strong></li><li><strong>cd %systemroot%\syswow64</strong></li><li><strong>regsvr32 /u tabctl32.ocx</strong></li><li><strong>regsvr32 tabctl32.ocx </strong></li><li><strong>exit</strong></li></ul>
<div>Once you have finished executing these commands, the command prompt should have closed. Please restart the computer at this point and check if you still get the error once the computer has restarted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you still get the error, I would suggest you to contact the vendor of the Software that is giving you the error in question. This is because if re-registering the file does not help, the cause of this error is most likely an exception generated by the
 software. And for identifying them, the vendor is the best point of contact.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Hope this information&nbsp;helps. Please reply to this response and we will be happy to help you further.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank You.</div>

            Just my two cents, it's clear his name is Bob, but he's in the field of Forestry, so Forester has nothing to do with his name, rather his profession, since he uses Forester Bob as his handle, it would be appropriate to use either part as a short way to
 refer to him, since clearly he's proud of being a Forester.

<p>No matter how hard I try I cannot get hold of anyone at Microsoft to answer my question.</p>
<p>If you have limited software knowledge how can you find your way round this service.</p>
<p>I have tried on many occasions to contact customer service only to be passed from pillar to post.</p>
<p>I really want to complain to Michel Van der Bel CEO but cannot find his email address, any other organisation would have much clearer methods of how to complain about products not fit for purpose.</p>

            <p>than you for your response, I have limited iT skills and really don't know what you have said.</p>
<p>I am suffering because Microsoft have the monopoly and therefore really do not have to worry if their customers are happy.</p>
<p>I have e-mailed, face booked and tweeted Michel van der Bell without success, disappointed with the service wish I had never changed to windows 10.</p>
<p>it would be fantastic if someone in Microsoft would contact me and answer my question , I think it is a dales ploy to make me purchase it again.</p>

    <title>YOUR OPINION ON 15 DOLLAR XBLA GAMES - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reverse liive  say:</h3>
<h2>            YOUR OPINION ON 15 DOLLAR XBLA GAMES</h2>
                    
<p>So basically, I am asking you all to respond to the subject of this thread. What are your opinions on 15 dollar xbox live arcade games? Personally, I think they're too much. I'm not even entirely sure why, there's just something about it. For some reason,
 even 12 dollars would sound so much more appealing to me, even though its only 3 dollars less. I guess that's because, if you go to Gamestop, any preowned game 2+ years old will be 12 dollars or less. Last week I bough Dead Rising, Bioshock 2, and the original
 F.E.A.R. for 18 dollars and change. Thats 3 games, which all received rave reviews when they were released, for 18 dollars. As a person who just recently bought 360 couple years ago, I have the chance to buy hundreds of "retail games" already released for
 under 10 or 20 dollars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This thread comes to fruition (nice word right? ;)) due to Bastion. I played the trial, and I think it's pretty good. But is it worth 15 dollars? As good as any of the Summer of Arcade games look, will ANY of them be worth 15 dollars? I hope so.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yes, I have LIMBO. That is one of the VERY RARE exceptions. After reading about the game, I simply had to buy it. But after beating the game in 3 or so hours, I'm not sure if I would go back and do it all over again, even though it is a nice game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opinions? Agree to disagree.</p>

<p>If the price is worth it. Like <em>Street Fighter III: Third Strike</em>, that's worth every penny.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then again, it's more about if the consumer feels like they are getting their money's worth or not.</p>

<p>Deathspank as way better than Limbo. and with a campaign that lasts about 7-9 hours it's way more value than some retail games.</p>
<p>Trenched is another game worth the price. Better than a lot of retail games.</p>

<p>i agree with all of you in your own respect, there are the few games that will be worth the price, especially the big name games such as street fighter</p>
<p>an 800 pt maximum would be great lol, even 1000</p>
<p>and thanks for the advice, i just wish there were more of those =p</p>
<p>ive always been a fan of the arcade, especially in the summer its a great time to buy these, but i could keep throwin away 10 and 15 dollars so fast id be past a hundred lol</p>
<p>and with games like gears of war3, skyrim, deux ex, battlfield 3 coming out, all at the same time in a couple months, i always think to myself "nah ill save that 15 dollars for gears of war 3, or nah ill save that money for when dead island comes out", etc.

<p>Certain games are worth the price, like SHADOW COMPLEX, Lara Croft, &nbsp;Deathspank, Bastion, &amp; other games that have a full campaign with replay value. &nbsp;Games like Braid &amp; Limbo are good, but I don't think they warrant a $15 price.</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>Clearly XBLA has evolved over time, i've been buying Arcade titles since the 360 launched, I think i'm up to around 100 titles.</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>There are different variants to Arcade titles &amp; the prices go accordingly with most of them. &nbsp;Like BANJO &amp; KAZOOIE or BEYOND GOOD &amp; EVIL are old classic games that are re-released with a standard $10 price which is fitting. &nbsp;While older games like Pacman
 &amp; Frogger are $5.</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>Going on what you said about buying games from retail for cheaper, being that they were all once $60, isn't quite the same thing. &nbsp;The value of buying a disc (physical media) drops over time, unless it is a rare title. &nbsp;Although I do think that the Arcade
 games should go down in price over time, most don't.</p>

<p>I don't think most of these games are worth it. I've played some good ones but they have almost no replayability and they're usually way too short. The problem is people buy them at this price so the devs know they can sell it for that much. Not much can
 be done about it.</p>

    <title>Constantly getting one of two different BSOD messages - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Constantly getting one of two different BSOD messages SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION and IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL whilst playing games&#47;idle, what can I do about this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Alrighty; Seems that /r/TechSupport has failed me so I'm back here. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue has only really come up recently so about a week ago, I was playing Battlefront (Latest drivers and everything, did a clean install too) when I kept getting 'Nvidia display driver has stopped responding' error messages, I spent about up to three
 days looking into the problem but never changed or downloaded anything, all of a sudden I wasn't getting them anymore, but constant bluescreens at random intervals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bluescreens most commonly strike when I'm say a minute or a few in a game, I have had it happen just browsing the web much like what I am doing now, but as I said they are most apparent playing a game - I have tried up to twenty different games to test
 this theory and all came back with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of writing now the machine has taken to just resetting, I've had about one or two bluescreens today in comparison to about the six I had the day prior which is rather odd, I just want this fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Things I have tried:</strong></span></p>
<p>-Using the onboard Win10 Ram check versifier program to see if there's any issues with my Ram sticks, there was no problem with them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-sfc /scannow </p>
<p>-I reset my machine though keeping my files to check if it was just a 3rd party driver that's causing the issue with something else, I re-downloaded all of my drivers completely and let Windows update completely, ran Assassins Creed Black Flag/Battlefront
 to test if it's fixed, nope.</p>
<p>-I opened my computer case to see if it's just something's gone loose or so, I couldn't see anything wrong so I'm positive it's a driver issue.</p>
<p>Today I've only been bluescreened perhaps once or twice, but the last four times I've tested with a game to get a crash dump the computer just reset itself, no bluescreen at all - The last bluescreen
 was when I was watching a fullscreen YouTube video, It could be a audio driver so I'm not 100% certain.

            <p>Since it's a laptop, (with Practically desktop grade components at that) the first thing that comes to mind is some sort of heat induced damage. That being said, your idea of the driver could be correct. Are you sure you checked for an audi driver if that
 fails I'd then try to figure out what audio driver it uses if you hadn't installed that one already.</p>
<p>If that fails, when it happens again try to get a log, and note the system temperature to the best of your ability. You can also try a safe mode boot and see if it happens there.</p>

<p>If it does, you've likely eliminated drivers. (Unless the windows driver is the culprit)</p>

            <p>Well the x51 can be described as a small factor PC, it's got the components you'd find in much larger PC cases but packed together quite conveniently, I've got the first x51 model (2013) if that helps (Though bought it about February 2015 secondhand).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand if it's a heat related issue, I'll try to monitor it all of today to determine if it's that, I do have it kept in a rather cold open area (Well, my bedroom on my desk) but I will keep a eye on it. I did have a previous laptop computer which
 had heat issues but then again only because I put it in a stupid place that didn't allow enough ventilation, currently my x51 seems to be running okay.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alienware do have a 'Alienware Audio' driver that comes with the computer and I believe I do have it installed, it re-downloaded automatically when I reset the machine, I don't believe this is the culprit though I'll keep my eye on it. You can check the
 rest of the drivers here http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/product-support/product/alienware-x51/drivers/advanced</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of writing I've downloaded Open Hardware Monitor to check the temp and it's reading it's sat quite comfortably low, I'll try do some tests in the next hour with Black Flag to see how different the temperatures get.</p>

<p>Noted, I'll try to get another crash dump done to analyze it further, I've got the day off work so I'll try get that sorted.

<p>I'm not sure my GPU shouldn't be that hot. I've checked the cpu which says the max temp only got to near 63 Celsius, though 80 for my GPU is a bit of a concern. Do you think this might be the problem?</p>

</p><p>*Edit* Just tried testing again, seems after near a hour with the gauge reset the max temp now reads 78C, which seems okay. For what it's worth the computer has been running okay all summer, I can try opening it up again to clean out some more dust in a
 bit. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It hasn't crashed just yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked online and the GTX 660 should be fully okay up to 97C - I'll do more tests now.</p>

            <p>Well, i must say if you haven't voided it already, doing so will. That being said and done dusting it it a pretty good idea. Your gpu is a little warm, but it's recommended safe limit is mid 80s and you mentioned the 97c cutoff</p>
<p>It is possible that the gpu is putting out enough heat to slowly bake some component close to the gpu.</p>
<p>However. As that possibility isn't fixable and not too likely, I'm going to place it aside for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next time it throws a BSOD can you post the 0x####### code?</p>
<p>It could really narrow this down.</p>

            <p>It seems to be a okay temp for what I'm reading up on it, I'll try look at what I can do to keep it cooler especially when the weather changes, the x51 is a little fiddly getting into due to it's small size but it shouldn't be that big of a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possibly, the GPU is positioned over the hard drive and that's reading at quite a good temp so I'm not too concerned about it, I will try to keep my eye on it though.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will do, it hasn't crashed yet, rather irritating it bluescreened about two days ago non-stop where now when I need it to it doesn't, ah life.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I wouldn't be too surprised, the situation seems to keep changing at first I thought I was just dealing with a display driver has crashed issue. I did get a notification through the action centre (I think that's what it's called) saying my display driver
 was updated sometime yesterday, that might of fixed it but I'm not too sure. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankfully I've now managed to get the bluescreens recorded, I've had two random resets (No bluescreen) and two bluescreens, which is rather odd - I'm using BlueScreenView to help look at the crash dump files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION had a 0x0000003b bug check code, which was caused by driver ntoskrnl.exe</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with Alienware Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums as there could be known issues with your model. Maybe all you need to do is update the sound drivers though it could also need updates to BIOS, low level chipset
 drivers, and other drivers or custom programs (made by Alienware/Dell). Of course the issue could be hardware.<br />

<p><br />
==================================================<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : <br />
<br />
Run DriverView -&nbsp;set&nbsp;VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without <br />
Dump in their names (and&nbsp;update BIOS and chipset).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>====================================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

            I'd like to add that in my experience of dealing with dell towers, they are pretty solid but have issues with loose ram and pcie slots. I'm going to go on a limb and say it's possible their alienware towers do the same. I would try reseating the gpu. Take
 heed with the pcie retention clip though, it's a bugger to fully disengage on dell motherboards. Obviously, the ram is in well enough as the system hasn't started beeping at you.

            <p>That's a lot to take in;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to clean the machine as much as I can but I don't have much room to take it apart completely just yet, I'll try do as much as I can here before I decide to do that. There is a 0x0000003b hotfix listed in one of the links (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/980932)
 provided, would this be a good bet to try out to fix that bluescreen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way before trying any steps I've set up a system restore point just in case.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That just leaves us with the other bluescreen; I've tested my ram sticks completely they came back healthy with no problems reported at all, there seems to be another hotfix for the other error code (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2807832) would
 I be safe in trying this one too? Should I uninstall my Nvidia drivers before installing them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll keep it noted, thankyou! I hope it's just a driver fix, I do have plans when I've finished with University that I'm going to try get a new computer for some freelance media work, I can't see this computer lasting forever seeing it's got limited upgradability
 but if it does keep on it's feet up until then I'll be more than happy. </p>

<h3> blair harris &#40;blair&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Icons refreshing and high cpu usage when image files in folder</h2>
                    <p>Recently on my computer I have had the issue that if an image file is viewable on either the desktop or in explorer icons will constantly refresh and explorer will use &gt;50% of the cpu. It doesn't matter if the images are viewed as icons or previews, only
 that the image is either on the desktop or viewable in the current folder in explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have cleared the thumb and icon cache as well as running a SFC and DISM, however the issue persists even following a restart.</p>
<p>Any assistance in finding a solution would be most appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Mithin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is a HP Elite desk 800 G2, the default app for viewing photos is the windows photo app.</p>
<p>However this issue occurs when not viewing photos in an app, but instead when they are viewable as files in explorer and it is explorer.exe that is using the cpu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run a safety scanner and nothing was picked up. I also booted into safe mode and the issue persisted in there.</p>
<p>
