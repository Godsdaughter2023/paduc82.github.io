<h2>            Where did my sound go&#63;</h2>
                    Three times in the past month, there has been a white x on a red background where the speaker should be. If I click on it when that happens, I get sent to the troubleshooter. Each time, it finally told me to reinstall the driver. That worked. But why does
 it keep happening?

            This can happen with older or modified\built systems when an update runs it installs a new audio driver that is not compatible with yours.
<br />So windows 10 sees that and tries to help by fixing it.
<br />Really there is not much you can do.

<h2>            Windows 10 DVD-RW drive won&#39;t recognize blank disc&#33; Please help&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Okay so I have a Lenovo touchscreen desktop and it came with Windows 10 of course, and for some reason I can't get it to recognize ANY blank dvds!!! I've tried to uninstall and re install the driver. I've gone to the command prompt screen and nothing,
 I've downloaded burners and the burn process would start and ultimately fail. I've tried different disc and still nothing! It does however read disc with media already on it. I have cleaned the lens and every other trick I could find. Can anyone please help
 me figure out what's wrong??? I can't be the only one with this issue! Thanks in advance!

            Hi Moving Technolog Forward, you can at any time download and create Windows 10 or Windows 7 installation media from the Microsoft Website, it is free and will always be available:
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 4GB) or DVD using that tool
<br />
<br />Windows 7 ISO Download:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />With regards to making a copy of your Installation Media, you can do that with any DVD burning software. The Windows installation DVD's are not encrypted and can be readily copied . . .       
        </p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Use the Media Creation Tool which always has the latest version loaded:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />For older versions or an alternative site use these downloads, burning ISO to DVD by right clicking to Burn Image DVD.  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            As you use the ISO then storing the latest version should also be sufficient backup because you can always burn another DVD from it.  But these change every 6 months with the new version release so I'd use Media Creation Tool unless you're in between versions.

<h2>            My webcam won&#39;t work.</h2>
                    I have a ProBook 440 G1 and my webcam won't work. I've searched "device manager", I tries with skype, and I've tried with the camera app. Nothing is working. There's no sense in e buying a webcam because my phone can serve that purpose. I just want to
 find a way to make my webcam work. My high school gave all of us laptops and it worked when I was in high school. After they took the laptops back to remove microsoft and stuff like that, I discovered that my webcam doesn't work. My computer won't even acknowlegde
 that it has a built-in webcam. Can someone help please?

            1. This is an issue with latest Skype which is v8. 
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you should send this feedback to Skype engineers - Open v8 skype &gt; Click 3 dots on top &gt; Help &amp; feedback &gt; Give feedback 
<br />
<br />Feedback can also be given through Uservoice where you can find the feedback of others and status would be visible to you - <a href="https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-skype-ideas/filters/my_feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-skype...</a>
<br />
<br />2. As a work-around, You can download Classic Skype and use that. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a> 
<br />
<br />Good news is that Classic Skype is not going to be retired. Its last date in service was 1-Sep-18 and it has been decided not stop the services to Classic Skype for some more time. It would nag you for updating to latest version which is v8 which you will have to ignore and tolerate.

            Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

<h2>            Application Hang, Event 1002, Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Hi!&nbsp; I'm so green at this, somewhere my question may have been answered and I don't know it.&nbsp; So, please be patient with me, OK?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell Inspiron E1505 laptop.&nbsp; A few days ago, I upgraded it to Windows 8 from XP.&nbsp; I've had nothing but frustrating problems since.</p>
<p>Comcast/Xfinity is my service provider.&nbsp; Every time I log in to my home page and try to do something, like read email, I keep getting the application hang error.&nbsp; IE tries to reopen it, and sometimes it works, sometimes not.&nbsp; It keeps kicking me back out
 to my desktop.&nbsp; I tried to upgrade to 8.1 but it won't do it, says I don't have enough memory.&nbsp; I don't know what to do about that because about a year ago I installed a new part that gave me GB of space.&nbsp; I'm sorry I don't know the technical names for these
 processes. Please bear with me.&nbsp; I don't understand why I wouldn't have enough space for it.&nbsp; But that's not the urgent issue right now.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All kinds of crazy things have been happening. Like, my cursor jumps to another&nbsp; place on the page when I'm typing, and if I don't catch it, it messes up somewhere in the paragraph.&nbsp; This happens constantly; it's happening right now.&nbsp; If I didn't catch it,
 what you're reading wouldn't make any sense with all the "extra" letters stuck in various places.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I'm in Comcast, the info in the address bar flashes on and off, and the toolbar disappears and reappears randomly.&nbsp; While this is happening, I'm "frozen" until it stops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I signed up with Driver Detective because I kept getting "system messages" saying some of my drivers were out of date.&nbsp; When I called to activate the software, a technician had to log on remotely to activate it.&nbsp; She ran some scans, and told me my system
 still thinks I have XP trying to run with Win 8.&nbsp; I didn't understand everything she said because she had a heavy accent and I have a hearing and understanding disability.&nbsp; She said I had to take my computer to a service center to have it cleaned and restored
 to "like new", BUT there were no authorized centers in my city. So, she said she could do it herself, after she got permission from her supervisor, of course.&nbsp; But the cost was going to be over 400.00 and I couldn't afford it.&nbsp; So, except for activating Driver
 Detective, I didn't get the "one-time clean and fix" service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this question is very lengthy, and I apologize for that, but I just don't know what to do.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have already spent hundreds of dollars upgrading to v8 with all the "supplemental services" I was told I needed to have optimum service.&nbsp; Not from Microsoft,
 though. At least I don't think so.&nbsp; All these things keep popping up on my screen and they sound&nbsp;authoritative, so I buy it, thinking I'm doing the right thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, someone hacked into my address book and sent bogus emails, in my name, to everyone on the list -- even businesses -- with links inside touting some ad or special deal or something.&nbsp; I didn't even know it was happening at first, not till I opened
 my Sent folder to check for something and found it full of these bogus messages (about 200).&nbsp; I think I've gotten that corrected now, through my online tech service, "My Tech Gurus", who logged on and did a scan.&nbsp; It&nbsp;involved a "conference" remote login between
 them, me, and Comcast.&nbsp; No one could explain to me how it happened, but it was the general opinion that I needed to&nbsp;upgrade from XP.&nbsp; That's what actually started&nbsp; this whole business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any suggestions on what to do about this, I would be so grateful.&nbsp; The Event Log is getting longer and longer with errors and warnings and I'm at my wit's end!!&nbsp; With everything I've done, thinking I was supposed to, I've probably not helped
 the situation any, but I don't know how to "undo" any of it now.&nbsp; I'm so "lost"!!&nbsp; HELP!</p>

<h2>            2 year old makes a purchase &#61; NOTHING WE CAN DO&#33;</h2>
                    
<p><span>So, my 2 year old was watching netflix on the tv with me. We do this from time to time - he loves Calliu. I go into the kitchen to grab some tea and upon my return (15-20 seconds later) I notice he's holding the controller and staring at the XBOX live
 dashboard mashing buttons. </span></p>
<p>No harm no foul, he surfs through the videos on netflix all the time. We go back to watching Calliu and I forget the whole thing, blissfully happy with my overall xbox experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple days later my wife calls me to tell me she checked her e-mail and there's a message from microsoft about a 41$ game purchase (halo reach). A 41$ game purchase I -never- made. A little thinking pegged the time-of-purchase to the "Caillu incident".</p>

<p><span>I have xbox live on auto-renew which means my credit card is on file. There was no protection, no parent lock, no password, and not even a way to set one up (remember - I was using netflix which is tied to my main xbox account, this means I HAVE to
 be logged into the same account that has my credit card on file). That couple seconds my son had the xbox live remote smashing buttons had cost me 41$.</span><br />
<br />
<span>So I check my xbox "games" section. No Halo reach. Turns out the download didn't even start (not enough space on the xbox harddrive), I call up xbox live immediately to correct this. I think any sensible person on the planet would say this should be EASY

<span>They tell me the terms of service clearly state all purchases are final, and that there was a warning displayed when my son was purchasing the game. I explain he was two years old and incapable of reading terms of service or making sound monetary policy,
<span>They tell me the terms of service clearly state all purchases are final, and that there was a warning displayed when my son was purchasing the game. I explain he was two years old and incapable of reading terms of service or making sound monetary policy,
 and that he had literally done it while smashing his fingers on the remote in the space of five seconds, well under the amount of time it would take for me to teach my son to read so he could properly respond to said message. Of course, I said all this in
 a much nicer way, attempting to actually get my problem fixed - all while the support agent on the other end of the line is practically laughing as he explains that my son should have properly read the terms of service!</span><br />
<br />
<span>I get to a supervisor. I'm being perfectly calm for the situation but she gets extremely confrontational, telling me I am going to have to suck it up and pay the 41$, and that not only is there nothing she is going to do, that there is nobody above her
<span>I get to a supervisor. I'm being perfectly calm for the situation but she gets extremely confrontational, telling me I am going to have to suck it up and pay the 41$, and that not only is there nothing she is going to do, that there is nobody above her
 anyone gets to talk to. She won't transfer me to anyone else, she says she is the furthest my complaint is going to go and that there is NOTHING I can do.</span><br />

<span>She explains they aren't set up to revoke a digital license for a digital product that I never downloaded and have absolutely no interest in owning. She says I can feel free to call my bank and attempt to challenge the charge but that nobody at microsoft
<span>She explains they aren't set up to revoke a digital license for a digital product that I never downloaded and have absolutely no interest in owning. She says I can feel free to call my bank and attempt to challenge the charge but that nobody at microsoft
 will EVER refund that 41$ no matter what I do. She explains it doesn't matter whether I downloaded it or not, nothing matters, I won't get my money back and I won't be talking to ANYONE else. Period. I had her immediately close my xbox account and remove my
 bank card information.</span></p>

<p>My rage cup overfloweth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A few hours later I figure I'll just calm down. After all, all this basically happened on my birthday. I'll just go ahead and calm down and laugh about the fact that my 2 year old son bought me a birthday present. I'm a reasonable human being, 41$ isn't
 THAT much money, right? I'm going to be the bigger person here. I clear some space off my xbox, finally download the stupid game. I played a few minutes and shut it down. Now I just sit here staring at it's little icon and I start feeling anger bubbling back
 to the surface.</p>

<p>No. I don't accept this. &nbsp;I don't accept this policy. I don't accept this decision. Microsoft doesn't see my thousands upon thousands of dollars spent on their products and services as worthy of fixing something so blatantly WRONG? &nbsp;Fix this people, fix
 this. There has to be someone out there associated with XBOX live or microsoft that's capable of higher brain function. Honestly, how would YOU feel in my position?</p>

<p>There are sensible solutions. Refund my 41$, give me 41$ worth of xbox live gold account membership, donate 41$ in my name to a worthy charity, do SOMETHING. I don't care what it is, just do something that doesn't make me sit here feeling like you've reached
 into my wallet and STOLEN 41$. Yes, this is a pittance for both your company, AND for me, but the principle of the thing is too great to sit here and be quiet.</p>

<p>If that's not reasonable to someone at Microsoft then I give up. When my gold membership expires don't expect me to renew it. Burn me as a customer, watch my whole family never make another Microsoft product purchase, watch me go out of my way to ensure
 EVERY computer I have purchasing power over both in my home and my workplace never coughs up another dime to you. Enjoy my 41$, because it's the last 41$ you'll ever see from me and that will cost you many times that amount in future lost revenues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please, respond to this post. I want to believe that I've just talked to the wrong people. I want to believe that Microsoft doesn't honestly think this is "ok". Keep me as a customer or lose me, just let me know what the OFFICIAL word is on this so I can
 move on either happy, or angry.</p>

<p>If you were watching Netflix and upon your return the Netflix app was still open, how did that game get purchased?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>That would have required your son to exit Netflix, go to the game marketplace, find Halo Reach and purchase it. Then he would have to back out of the marketplace and relaunch the Netflix app and return to the show you were watching.</p>

<p>As I explained, he was at the dashboard when I returned. I put us back into netflix afterward. It is possible and in fact easy for someone to do this with only &nbsp;few quick button taps. Try it. I can easily b out of netflix, tap on the nearest ad, start the
 purchasing process, and end up back on the dash very quickly. The mechanics of this are irrelevant however, because even if he'd done the whole thing right in front of me I would be out 41$ the second he tapped that A button. There is no parental control or
 system for preventing this from happening. I couldn't have had him logged into his own account because it wouldn't have had netflix.
</p>
<p>He could have easily sat there and bought half the xbox live catalog in a very short amount of time. Does anyone honestly think that would have been "ok"? One game or 40 it's absolutely insane to me that there is and was ever a fight over this. Any rational
 person who had this happen would expect the company on the other end of the line to reverse the purchase. Everyone I talked to at xbox support agreed that if it happened to them they would be on the phone too.
</p>
<p>This isn't about taking responsibility for a child's actions, this isn't a 10 year old throwing a baseball through a window. We're talking about a digital product that didn't even have bandwidth expended on it when I called. Were talking about a toddler
 tapping A three times. This could easily happen to ANYONE. Keeping the controller out of his reach is absolutely silly, he lives in a digital world and has his own ipad he carts around the house for gods sake. I've taken measures to avoid this happening again
 (I had to cancel my xbox live to remove my cc#), but that doesn't take away from the fact that it already happened. There would be no damage on either side for microsoft to show some good will here. 41$ isn't going to break me, and obviously it won't break
 microsoft either.</p>
<p>I'm just one customer, and despite the thousands of dollars my actions have funneled through microsoft, they feel shafting me over 41$ is reasonable. I disagree with this assessment, and can guarantee that disagreement will cause a far greater monetary loss
 as I close myself to any future dealings with the company. Yeah, I'm insignificant and despite my purchasing responsibility at home and work, nobody at microsoft is going to lose any sleep if ncinerate stops buying. Still, over time all those little cuts add
 up and someone realizes that maybe treating a customer in this way isn't a good way to maintain a customer base. Change comes fast in a digital world.
</p>
<p>Do me a favor, run my words up the chain, see if you can find a rational human being who understands how insane this is. Feel free to make a joke of it, laughing about how xbox really screwed this guy over. Find me someone with a sense of right and wrong
 along with the authority to make me a happy customer again. Donate the 41$ in my name, refund it, toss me a bit of gold membership, do something more than telling me to stuff it. Put yourself in my shoes. What would YOU do? Roll over?

 left unsupervised is just fooling themselves into a false sense of security. That and the console itself has Parental Controls on it as well as account controls to prevent unauthorized access of your account.

<h3> jesseinsf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 shutdown shut down timer is to short for theme sound to complete</h2>
                    <p><span>Microsoft has been coming out with allot of theme packs lately. I really like that they do this. On the other hand, Microsoft
 needs to also include a shut down timer changer to allow the "Shut Down Theme Sound” to end before it continues to complete the shut down process. So my question is: is there a way to alter the shutdown timer that windows uses to terminate each application?
 Each application seems to only have 5 seconds before the app termination window pops up and some of Microsoft’s new theme pack "Shut down" sounds take 10 seconds to complete. It really annoys me to get these pop-up app termination windows. I like to feel that
 I have a rock solid system that I am doing my everyday tasks on. These app termination pop ups at shut down make me feel that Windows 7 is a cheap piece of junk of an OS that I'm working on.</span></p>

            there is no program issue. it is the shutdown theme sound that takes 10 seconds to complete.This theme was downloaded from the windows 7 theme download site.Windows 7 only seems to give 5 second before the app kill window pops up. there is no app to kill.
 It is the sound file that takes 10 seconds to complete, which is 5 seconds too long..Is there a way to adjust this time window to 10 seconds to allow the shutdown sound to complete?

Set or create DWORD <b>WaitToKillAppTimeout</b> to at least 15000 – this should be sufficient.<br />

            Btw, It doesn't work. I just changed the shutdown sound to a different file. I think that windows isn't trying to kill the service and that it is just informing the user about any app or service that is taking longer than normal to complete.It then will
 kill the service to the time that is set in the regestry. The darkened informing screen seems to have nothing to do with the "time to kill" setting. This informing feature seems to be "By Design".

                    <p>Since upgrading to Windows 10 I am unable to scan from my Epson Workforce 845 to my computer. I get the following error message: The selected device is read only. Select another device in which to save the files. No matter what I do in the Epson control

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm working as a dev in Citrix Receivers (Windows) team. When we open a notepad application(local application), the game bar doesn't appear. However, when notepad is launched via Receiver, the game bar popup appears. This is the case for any app that is
 launched via receiver. Can you suggest a fix that can be done from our end so that the customers need not explicitly turn off the settings ?</p>

<h2>            Charged twice for renewing Xbox live</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p><p>The other day it was suggested to me on the dashboard that I renew my Xbox membership as it would have ran out in April. When clicking on the prompt it brought up a payment option like normal but never actually showed how long I would be renewing my membership for.</p><p><br /></p><p>After paying for this and then finding out that it was only a month, I then went onto the website and cancelled the subscription. After cancelling this I then re-subscribed but using a year long payment.</p><p><br /></p><p>Microsoft has charged me for both of these and I’d like to know if I can get a refund on the month I paid for, as it didn’t give me an option for&nbsp;what I purchased the first time&nbsp;and then charged me for both after cancelling the months payment.</p>

            <p>Hello Rogue,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you make any hardware changes to your computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your efforts towards resolving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to software conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>perform clean boot </strong>and check if it helps.<br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate this fact that drivers are up to date. However, please also <strong>
update chipset drivers of your motherboard from this link:</strong><br />

The answers to the questions in the first reply can be found in my original post, but I'll restate them and add some more details:</p>
<p>- All motherboard drivers are current from the manufacturer's site.</p>
<p>- There have been zero hardware configuration changes. &nbsp;This just started happening one day. &nbsp;It has not moved, been unplugged, etc. &nbsp;It's on a decent UPS unit with surge protection and battery.</p>
<p>- The computer has been running with zero issues in the same configuration for about a year. &nbsp;The ONLY thing to change around the time of the first occurrence was that I created an additional non-admin user account for my daughter to use the computer.</p>
<p>- I have since reformatted the computer with a "Clean" install of Windows 8.1. &nbsp;Again, all drivers are manufacturer's drivers from their websites.</p>
<p>- The issue occurs quite often. &nbsp;Normally, around the first time I load resource-intensive application such as a game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know what you find.</p>

<p>
</p><p>After running verifier, I was able to successfully narrow it down to Saitek Drivers! &nbsp;(I use a joystick and throttle - H.O.T.A.S. Saitek X-55. &nbsp;I was having issues with it before - it would never save manually configured keys - but that's for a different

<p>
</p><p>I was getting BSODs before full startup when running verifier. &nbsp;I systematically reduced the drivers being verified until all that was left was Saitek!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Great! &nbsp;Now I need to take this information to the Saitek manufacturer and find out what's wrong.</p>
<p>

    <title>Near total lockout on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fran t.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Near total lockout on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>...Well, screwing IE11 on W7, I decided to install W10. It was really nice. Unfortunately, just today, my computer was almost totally locked out. First, of my Microsoft Accounts couldn't login because some services weren't running. I logged in a normal account,
 and tried to fix the problem, I was nearly locked out with an infinitely&nbsp;looping blue screen saying something about Remote Desktop Services busy and not being able to sign in the normal account I logged out. I wasn't able to enter the other MA for some apparent
 reason, despite the screen saying that I could have logged in some other account. I had many time rebooted, buy nearly no success; only returning once again to that same blue screen. I only managed logging in with the old Shift Key reboot. I just only want
 to ask on how to prevent this from happening again. </p>

            <p><span>Hi Fran,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand your concern and will guide you in the right direction.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In order to understand the issue better, I suggest you to answer the below questions.</span></p>
<p><span>1. What is the complete error message?<br />
2. Is the computer connected to Domain/server network?<br />
3. What exact error message you get when you try to login Microsoft Account?<br />
4. What troubleshooting steps did you try to fix the problem?<br />
5. Do you get Blue screen of death (BSOD)? </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Remove all external devices except keyboard and mouse and restart the system then check if the error occurs.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to perform a <strong>Clean Boot</strong> and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A clean boot is a troubleshooting technique that allows you to get the computer up and running so that you can perform diagnostic tests to determine which elements of the normal boot process are causing problems<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the link below to do clean boot.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I also suggest you to include the screen shot of the blue screen with error that you receive.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>

            <p>Well, all I just want to know&nbsp;is on&nbsp;how to prevent this from ever occurring, but I will answer the questions.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p><span>1. What is the complete error message?</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Well, when I&nbsp;signed out and the&nbsp;"infinitely looping blue screen" appeared, it said, "Please wait for a&nbsp;moment.&nbsp;Remote Desktop Services&nbsp;are currently busy. You may be able to sign in with another account" or something like that...</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p><span>2. </span>Is the computer connected to Domain/server network?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, In fact, I think my computer wasn't&nbsp;connected when I tried to sign in with a Microsoft Account. I only figured out when I signed in with the normal account.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>3. What exact error message you get when you try to login [with a?] Microsoft Account?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your computer isn't connected with a server. Please try again later. </p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>4. What troubleshooting steps did you try to fix the problem?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Well, first I clicked multiple times OK, and I was supposed to return to the lock screen but I only returned to the error screen mentioned in answer 1. Then&nbsp;I tried to leave the problem fix itself. And after every 5-10 minutes or so, the "Welcome" swirl
 appeared and then once again, I came to the darn error screen. Then I tried to reboot, no luck, and finally, I used the Shift+Reboot, and the problem got fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>5. Do you get Blue screen of death (BSOD)? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I don't exactly think the error screen was exactly a BSoD. </p>
<p>
</p><p>...And finally, no, I don't have any screenshot of the error screen. I'll just give a close approximation of the error screen...<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba496da9-bfda-4d9b-84e3-31e21ac6a46a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba496da9-bfda-4d9b-84e3-31e21ac6a46a" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to perform <strong>start up repair </strong>from Windows Recovery Environment. Follow the below procedure and check if it resolves the issue.
</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>To get to Windows Startup Settings in the <strong>Windows Recovery Environment</strong>. You may follow the steps provided below and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have a disk or USB, download the ISO from a working computer and try creating a bootable disk or USB.
<br />
•&nbsp;If you can't start your PC, follow these instructions to get to the Windows Recovery Environment.
<br />
•&nbsp;Start your computer from the installation media, Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer.<br />
•&nbsp;If you see a message asking you to “Press any key to boot from DVD,” do so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB.<br />
•&nbsp;When you see the Install Windows page, tap or click Repair your computer to start the Windows Recovery Environment.<br />
•&nbsp;In the Windows Recovery Environment, on the Choose an option screen, tap or click Troubleshoot.<br />

<h2>            How can I check how many devices are using my product key&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows 10 Pro key. I bought a Dell laptop which comes a Windows 10 Home OEM which I do not like. I changed the product key and upgraded the new laptop to Windows 10 Pro. Unfortunately, I found a hardware defect in the laptop and I asked for a replacement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got my Dell laptop replacement and try to upgrade the system to Windows 10 Pro again using the same key. However, this time it say the key has been used on other device which is true...but, how can I get it back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I remotely deactivate a device and product key association?</p>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ability to transfer your Windows 10 Pro license to a new computer depends on the type of license you have. By the way, how did you obtain the Windows 10 Pro key? Did you purchase it from a retail store or from Windows Store?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since your laptop has been on Windows 10 Home version, you may have purchased the Windows 10 Pro from Windows Store. However, if you've upgraded it that way, then it will only licensed that specific computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information about your Windows 10 activation, please check out the article

</p><p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>To help you with your issue about thumbnail and icon disappearing when changing view size, please refer to the information below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason why thumbnails and icons disappears when set to large icons is that the resolution of your monitor might not be able to handle the large format setting of these icons. You may either set it and maintain them to medium icons or you may try to use
<strong>Control </strong>(keyboard)+ <strong>scroll up</strong> or <strong>scroll down</strong> (mouse) to set them to your desired size.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>
        </p>

<h2>            Bounce back message to Blocked Sender</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I blocked an email address because I no longer wish to receive emails from this person, and would like to have a Bounce Back message sent to them the next time they send me an email...saying something like "Recipient or Email not found" or something in those
 lines which makes them aware they are either blocked or give them the impression that&nbsp;my email no longer exists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this possible? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            After Installation of Windows 10 Update 1903 my computer crashes with BSOD and the message IRQL NOT LESSS OR EQUAL</h2>
                    <p>I have a new computer (Dell XPS 8930) and have Windows 10 Pro. I did the update on the night of 06/13/19. The next day when I started up my computer it would crash after about two minutes. After a lengthy process of disabling programs through System Configuration
 and uninstalling recent programs; I determined that the program that was triggering the crash was a program called Malware Killer the was part of a Software Suite called Phoenix 360 from iolo.&nbsp; I verified this by disabling Malware Killer one time and twice
 by uninstalling and reinstalling. Each time that Malware Killer was installed and active (even) in the background. Currently; Malware Killer is uninstalled and I do not have any problem with my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have contacted iolo/Phoenix 360 about the issue and I am still waiting for a reply.<br />

            Hi Mark
<br />
<br />Well done on he troubleshooting steps you have taken ...
<br />
<br />Since you have worked out what is causing your system crashes, there is nothing you can but wait for Iolo to come out with a patch for their software, there is obviously an incompatibility with version 1903 and that software and they are the only ones who can resolve this . . .
