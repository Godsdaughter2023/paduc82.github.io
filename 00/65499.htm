<h2>            Kill Confirmed &#40;Crysis 2&#41; Best addition.</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;I find KILL CONFIRMED (a crysis 2 knock off) is a GREAT ADDITION to the game. Infact, It was the most addictive part of my 1 hour online last night. I admit, COD is a bit stale to me, but Im one of the few who play it for the campaign mostly, which is so
 far so good.</p>
<p>But KILL CONFIRMED,,,,,i love it!</p>
<p>For some reason the graphics seem a bit washed and strange looking, compaired to RAGE and BATTLEFIELD.</p>
<p>Still worth the cost, but nothing to say that this is the best.</p>

                    <p>I am having an issue where I have gotten the "No Way? No Way!" Achievement which is to get all the gold medallions in the Blue Spheres&nbsp;Bonus stages but it didn't unlock Full Medal Jacket which is to get&nbsp;silver medallions in the Blue Spheres Bonus Stage. I don't know if this is a bug with the achievements, the game or something I&nbsp;am just missing. So if anyone can help me with this issue that would&nbsp;be great.</p>

            <p>I'm having the exact opposite problem. While the Full Medal Jacket&nbsp;achievement did unlock successfully for me, the No Way? No Way!&nbsp;achievement did not unlock despite the fact that I&nbsp;have every single gold medallion in the game. Proof is in the screenshot below.</p><p><br /></p><p>This was a real pain of an achievement to get and it took me a long time, so I&nbsp;am really not willing to delete my save file just to try this all over again, especially with the possibility that the exact same thing might happen. Would be nice to see this one fixed.</p><p><br /></p><figure><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fimg-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net%3a443%2ftenant%2fxvi%2fentityid%2fRE1keRs.img" /></figure><p><br /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/714801/the-walking-dead-screenshot-shambles-forth-from-telltale-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Source.</a>&nbsp; As to be expected, it's dark and gritty.&nbsp; I'm in no way sold on whether or not it will be worth playing,
 but it's still early.&nbsp; Does anyone know anything about Telltale, the people who are making it?&nbsp; All the games listed on
<a href="http://www.telltalegames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">their website</a> seem a bit iffy, with the exception of a Monkey Island game.&nbsp; I heard good things about that.&nbsp; The others seem a bit cheesy.&nbsp; Seems like a jump to a zombie game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a non-game related note, I'm super excited for season two to start on AMC.&nbsp; If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and go buy it right now, ideally on Blu-Ray.&nbsp; It's worth every penny and then some.&nbsp; It has a superb crew behind it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frank Darabont - Writer/Director/Ex. Producer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Films include Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile (screenplay).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gale Ann Hurd - Ex Producer.&nbsp; Films include Aliens, Terminator 1 &amp; 2, and The Incredible Hulk (producer).</p>

<p>I wonder what they are going to do to make it different from every other zombie game out there.</p>
<p>[/quote]This is my fear as well.&nbsp; With the show's tremendous success, a game was inevitable.&nbsp; You know things are bad when even Capcom is capitalizing on LFD's success.&nbsp; As everyone may or may not know, Raccoon City is pretty much LFD... RE style.&nbsp; I'm starting
 to get sick of all the run and gun zombie shooters.&nbsp; Hopefully it's an ACTUAL survival horror game.&nbsp; In the tv show you don't see them running around like Rambo.&nbsp; They actually fear firing a shot because it draws zombies to them.&nbsp; The show is about surviving,
 not killing zombies.&nbsp; Hopefully they wont make it like RE.&nbsp; The new RE games aren't really survival horror games, at least not like they were in the past.&nbsp; Let us hope it's done with a great deal of thought, and not the simple desire to make money.&nbsp; I'm guessing
 with all the adventure games they've made they'll switch it up a bit.&nbsp; I hope...&nbsp; Nonetheless I'm sure it will be fun and I'm sure I'll buy it, as I'm borderline obsessed with zombies.&nbsp; I play the LFD and RE games strictly to prepare for the upcoming zombie
 apocalypse.&nbsp; Just research people.&nbsp; There's no fun involved.</p>

            <div>Hi Ben, </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>By creating a new user account with your desired Microsoft Account, you may transfer all the data and settings from the old user account to the new user account folder. By copying and pasting to the new account folder, you can retrieve all the previous
 settings and you can enjoy using it with your new Microsoft Account. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Important: </strong>Even though you can transfer all the data and settings from the old user profile to the new one, this is not applicable for the purchased apps. You might need to install and configure them again.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When you save all the settings of apps that you&nbsp;have purchased, it is dependent on the Microsoft account that you are using. And it is different for each user profile.
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-8/microsoft-account-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-8/microsoft-account-tutorial</a></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Perform the steps provided here to transfer all data and settings from&nbsp;the old profile. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
a. Press <strong>Windows and x</strong> together and select Windows Explorer.</div>
<div>b. Click on <strong>View tab </strong>and Click on <strong>Options</strong> at the top right corner.</div>
<div>c. Click the <strong>View tab</strong>, and then click <strong>Show hidden files, folders, and drives</strong>.</div>
<div>d. Uncheck the box which states <strong>Hide protected operating system files.<br />
</strong>e. Click <strong>Yes </strong>to confirm, and then click <strong>OK. </strong>
<div>f. Locate the <strong>C:\Users\Old_Username folder</strong>, where C is the drive that Windows is installed on, and Old Username is the name of the profile you want to copy files from.</div>
<div>g. Select all of the files and folders in this folder, except the following files:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>•Ntuser.dat<br />
•Ntuser.dat.log<br />
•Ntuser.ini</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>h. Right click and Select <strong>Copy</strong>.</div>
<div>I. Locate the <strong>C:\Users\New_Username folder</strong>, where C is the drive that Windows is installed on, and New Username is the name of the new user profile you created.</div>
<div>j. Right click inside the folder and select <strong>Paste</strong>.</div>
<div>k. Restart your PC and check if you have retrieved all the settings back. </div>

<div>Hope this information helps. Reply with the status so that we could help you further.

    <title>Price adjustment for GTAV&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zombies world  say:</h3>
<h2>            Price adjustment for GTAV&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>I just purchased GTAV for the Xbox One on July 11th for $36 while it was on sale in the Xbox Summer Sale. But I noticed today that there's a new promotion where you can get it for $30 if you own the DLC on the Xbox 360 (which I do). So I was wondering
 since I just purchased it a couple days ago if there was any way I could get a price adjustment? Thanks for any help.</span></p>

<p>Hello Mannie70au,</p>
<p><span>If the program is not compatible, then you may try to install and run the program in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<span>
<div>
Run the Program Compatibility Wizard
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Open the Program Compatibility Wizard by clicking the <span>Start</span> button<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows%2520Vista%2fMain%2f4%2ff%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33.png" />,
 clicking <span>Control Panel</span>, clicking <span>Programs</span>, and then clicking<span>Use an older program with this version of
<span>Windows</span></span>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Follow the instructions in the wizard.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>If you cannot install a program, insert the installation disc for the program and, using the wizard, browse to the program's setup file, usually called Setup.exe, Install.exe, or something similar. The wizard is not designed to work on programs that have
 an .msi file name extension.</p>
<p>To change compatibility settings manually for a program, right-click the icon for the program, click<span>Properties</span>, and then click the
<span>Compatibility</span> tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hoipe this helps.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

            Hi Craig, my name is Andrew and I'm an Independent advisor here to help you.
<br />
<br />Do you want to move the photos from one folder to another? Refer to the following article to view all photos through Photo app and Browse to Photos on your PC
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17194/windows-10-see-all-your-photos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17194/...</a>
<br />
<br />Please use cut (Ctrl + x) and paste (Ctrl + V) keys to move the folder to your desired location in File Explorer.       
        </p>

            Hi Craig 
<br />
<br />Do you mean form the Photos App to the Photos Gallery App?
<br />
<br />Those applications do not store photos in them, they are just views of folders, or even the same folder on your PC
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer, on the left, click Pictures
<br />
<br />All the photos on your PC, should be found in that folder, unless you have specifically set another location . . .
<br />
<br />And both the Photos App and Photo Gallery, should look at that folder by default. Are you seeing differences between the pictures shown in both applications?

<p>Here is what I've done, in no particular order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Made sure I was fully updated in Windows</p>
<p>Made sure the app was up to date.</p>
<p>Reset the Xbox app</p>
<p>Reset all network settings, making sure I had no proxies.</p>
<p>Used a Microsoft and local account to login to my PC.</p>
<p>Used different Microsofts to attempt to login to the app</p>
<p>Ran the 'App Troubleshooter'</p>
<p>Cleared Windows store cache</p>
<p>Made sure my time and date were correct</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure I'm missing some things but those were my obvious first options.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Corrupted system files are one of the possible reasons why this issue is happening. We'd like to know if you still need assistance in making a backup disk. If yes, we'd like to know if you are still getting the same error message. Have you also tried using
 other disc or removable drive?<br />
<br />
We'll keep an eye out for your response.

    <title>Error&#58; Black Screen with cursor after Windows Updates have been - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> b m smith  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error&#58; Black Screen with cursor after Windows Updates have been run - Windows 10 &#91;1607&#93; Anniversary Edition</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Anniversary Edition - Build 1607</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Symptoms of Error:</strong><br />
<br />
After Windows Updates has been run, the PC is restarted and either before or after logging in, the screen appears black with just the mouse cursor, which can still be moved around the screen.<br />
The hard disk light on the PC may show activity, but this may only run for a short time.<br />
The PC stays in this state for some time. If left long enough, the screen my turn grey with an active mouse cursor, but the PC doesn't become usable.<br />
<br />
<strong>Diagnostics so far:</strong><br />
<br />
I have managed to Remote Event Viewer several PCs in this state and they all show two events being logged while the PC is showing the above symptoms.<br />
<br />
Event ID 10016:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Source: DistributedCOM</p>
<p>Level: Error</p>
<p>User: SYSTEM</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">The application-specific permission settings do not grant Local Activation permission for the COM Server application with CLSID&nbsp;<br />
{8D8F4F83-3594-4F07-8369-FC3C3CAE4919}<br />
&nbsp;and APPID&nbsp;<br />
{F72671A9-012C-4725-9D2F-2A4D32D65169}<br />
&nbsp;to the user NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM SID (S-1-5-18) from address LocalHost (Using LRPC) running in the application container Unavailable SID (Unavailable). This security permission can be modified using the Component Services administrative tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is followed with Event ID 10010, which repeats twice every minute for at least half an hour:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The server {D63B10C5-BB46-4990-A94F-E40B9D520160} did not register with DCOM within the required timeout.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>All the PCs I have investigated in this state have shown the same identical event error being recorded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People who are not technically minded will not understand that their PC is trying to install a Windows Update while in this "crashed" state and will power down their PC, only to be faced with the same issue when they power it back on.<br />
<br />
<strong>Further Investigation:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked into the event IDs on Technet and other websites. It would appear that this error is generated when a security issue occurs with the DistributedCOM, (DCOM) and there are manual instructions on how to resolve the problem, with stories of failed
 attempts to fix.<br />
<br />
<strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>As I have been trying to resolve this issue since v1607 was released in August, I can only assume that Microsoft are already aware of the issue, so I would very much like an answer to the following questions, as this is having a big effect in my corporate
 environment as I am sure it is to lots of others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions to Microsoft are: </p>
<p>Can you please explain why this issue is occurring, on brand new installations, when Windows Updates are installed?<br />
</p>
<p>What is the expected solution and any time scale as to when we are likely to see it?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Temporary Solution:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>As much as I hate to use the word 'solution', the only way to get around this at the moment is to leave your PC, once in this state, to run for at least 2 hours, so it can finish installing the Windows Updates in the background.<br />
It is very unlikely that your PC will show any indication of recovering from this 'state of operation', so from experience and as much as I hate to say it, if your hard disk light has stopped showing any activity after 2 hours, you will need to power down your
 PC by removing the power cable from the back. I know this goes against ALL advise on using a PC, but powering down the PC with the power switch, seems to reboot it back into the same state. I have found that powering of by removing the power cable and then
 placing it back and powering up shows you the windows update progress, usually at 100%, or may even take you straight to your log in page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DO NOT POWER OFF THE PC IF THE HARD DISK LIGHT IS STILL ACTIVE OR WITHIN THE FIRST 2 HOURS.</p>
<p>If the updates have not finished and you power your PC off, then it will boot back up in the same state and have to restart installing the updates from scratch, delaying the whole process.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Personal message:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>As a PC engineer for 25 years, I have experienced many Windows Updates issues in the past, but none that have given the appearance that the PC has "crashed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information is of use to others and I look forward to a response from Microsoft.</p>

            <p>I noticed this issue because of a video card driver update along with the October Windows update.&nbsp; Even with the suggestions listed I still cannot get the computer to boot with the update and the drivers from Windows update.&nbsp; However, if I install the card
 on another Windows 10 computer it works fine.&nbsp; The main difference between the two computers&nbsp;is the Windows edition.&nbsp; One is Windows 10 Pro and one is Windows 10 Home.&nbsp; The Windows 10 Pro computer seems to be the one that has the issue.&nbsp; It also has HyperV
 enabled.&nbsp; Windows 10 Home does not have HyperV.&nbsp; There are several errors in the event log that mention HyperV errors along with the DCOM errors listed in this post.&nbsp; Is it possible this issue has to do with HyperV RemoteFX and registering the GPU for it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hesitant to do anymore testing on this because I've had to restore my computer from backup several times while testing.</p>

            <p>Thank you for letting us know. We need to check the compatibility of your video and graphic card with Hyper-V.</p>
<p>We suggest that you try these:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Boot your PC in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
safe mode</a>.</li><li>If you can access safe mode, you may temporarily uninstall Hyper-V and check if the issue still persist.
</li></ul>
<p>If that fixes the issue, you might need to update your video and or graphic card or find a compatible driver with Hyper-V.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted. </p>

            <p>John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.<br />
<br />
I am happy to gather together a list of the graphics cards which I have seen this issue occur with, but it has been on so many different hardware models, that it will take some time.<br />
<br />
Also, please consider that the problem is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Intermittent, so not easy to prove a fix for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b) Can occur on PCs which have been running Windows 10 for several days / weeks with no issue.<br />
<br />
c) As stated by CTumbles, this has occurred on Windows 10 Home, which doesn't have Hyper-V installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>d) Often occurs when updates are applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>e) Will usually resolve itself after about 2 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just some points to think about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Barry.</p>

</p><p>Is it likely that multiple machines across a corporate site are likely to have corrupted multiple user accounts?</p>

</p><p>This error has occurred on over 100 PCs on my site alone and has effected multiple users, who can log in to other PCs without issue.</p>

                    <p>Hi, We have implemented Always on VPN (User tunnel) and everything is working as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just only one caviate which we have noticed is that VPN client IP4 address will not register in DNS until we manually select these two boxes on the VPN connection adapter settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tried adding the following in the profile "<span> <span>

    <title>How To&#58; Open NAT to resolve Party and Multiplayer problems. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arminatorx  say:</h3>
<h2>            How To&#58; Open NAT to resolve Party and Multiplayer problems.</h2>
                    
<p>Here is an&nbsp;update to my old NAT guide from the old forums. I added some insight gained from resolving problems in the old thread and consolidating them into this guide.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to find stuff out for yourself, I can also recommend checking out&nbsp;<a href="http://www.unofficialguidetolive.co.uk/faqs/62-my-nat-is-strict-or-moderate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Shad0wmanUK's Unofficial Guide to Xbox Live</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.portforward.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Port
 Forward</a>&nbsp;website.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also try the&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/9/p/48874/editpost.aspx?ReturnUrl=#NATtrouble" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">troubleshooting tips below</a>. However, if you're just curious what NAT is, and why you need it, you can scroll down (or&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/9/p/48874/editpost.aspx?ReturnUrl=#NATexplained" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">click
 here</a>) to an explanation of what NAT is, and why you currently need it to be open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Open, moderate or strict NAT? How do I know my NAT status?</b></p>
<p>Just turn on your console, go to the "Settings" hub, then select the “System” tile in the upper left. If necessary, choose your appropriate connection type (wired or wireless), and then do a network test to Xbox Live.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your console doesn't give you an error message about NAT, you already have an open NAT. Congratulations. You are finished here. Go play! If you experience problems with some friends, ask them to do the network test for themselves, and if they have a strict
 or moderate NAT, direct them here.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your Xbox however tells you something about strict or moderate NAT, read on to hopefully resolve this.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>So how do I open my NAT?</b></p>
<p>That depends on your router. Since I don't know all routers, I will give general instructions on how to get an open NAT. How you carry out these instructions on your specific router, is up to you.If in doubt, check your router's documentation or make a post.&nbsp;<b>BUT!</b>&nbsp;When
 asking here for help, please&nbsp;<b>provide us the exact make&nbsp;<span>and</span>model of your router and modem.&nbsp;</b>Just telling us you have "a Netgear WLAN router" won't help&nbsp;as much as telling us you have "a Netgear WGR614 v3 connected to a Motorola SB2100 cable
 modem", we can (hopefully) find the user manual online and help you out.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't forget to check out Shad0wmanUK's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.unofficialguidetolive.co.uk/faqs/62-my-nat-is-strict-or-moderate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">page</a>, as it has lot's of router makes and models listed.<br />
<br />
<br />
But first, try it yourself. It's really easy with most routers. Especially if they are capable of UPnP.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p><b>Use Universal Plug and Play</b></p>
</div>
<p>Look in your router's documentation to see if it is capable of UPnP (for more information on&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">UPnP</a>, check&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/9/p/48874/editpost.aspx?ReturnUrl=#NATexplained" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NAT
 explanation below</a>). If it is&nbsp;supported, enable it in the router's configuration. Just enable it, and you should be done (the router's documentation should have more info on how to do so).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you continue to have a non-open NAT, look at the&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/9/p/48874/editpost.aspx?ReturnUrl=#NATtrouble" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">troubleshooting tips</a>.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p><b>My router can't use UPnP: Manual port forwarding</b></p>
</div>
<p>If your router doesn't support UPnP, you need to manually create a port forwarding list for your router. This process is different for every router, so again: Please check your router's manual on how to do it.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great resource of information for this&nbsp;is the&nbsp;<a href="http://portforward.com/english/applications/port_forwarding/XBOX360_Call_of_Duty_-_Black_Ops/XBOX360_Call_of_Duty_-_Black_Opsindex.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Port
 Forward Website</a>. Just find your router model in that list, and you will get a guide with pictures and detailed instructions on how to forward ports on your router.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Go to your console, and in the "Settings" hub, select the “System” tile, then “Network Settings.” If necessary, choose the connection type you use (wired or wireless) and take note of the current settings of your console.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if your console is set to automatic, it might have an IP of 192.168.1.23, Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0, Default gateway of 192.168.1.1 (this is the internal IP address of your router), and the IP of the DNS is the IP of your router as well.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take note of the IP of your console (in this example 192.168.1.23) and go to your PC.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>On your PC, go to the configuration page of your router with your internet browser. Either look in the documentation of your router, or simply type in the IP of the default gateway into the browsers address bar (in our example, you would enter "http://192.168.1.1"
 in the address bar).<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If necessary, log into the administration page of your router.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the router model, find the appropriate configuration page for port forwarding. Look for menu items "<b>Port Forwarding</b>", "<b>Exposed Host</b>", "<b>Virtual Server</b>", "<b>NAT</b>", "<b>DMZ</b>" or something like that.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you find something like "Port Triggering" or "Port Mapping", this is&nbsp;<b>not</b>&nbsp;what you're looking for. But you're very close. Instead of "Triggering" or "Mapping" look for "Forwarding".<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should get to a configuration page, that asks for incoming port, protocol and internal IP address.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will need to forward the following ports to the static IP of your Xbox console, that you set up earlier (and made a note of. In our example this was the 192.168.1.23)<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now forward the following ports to that IP:</p>
<ul>
<li>UDP 53 </li><li>TCP 53 </li><li>TCP 80 </li><li>UDP 88 </li><li>UDP 3074 </li><li>TCP 3074 </li></ul>
<p>Sometimes a router allows a setting for "both" TCP and UDP combined. If so, choose that to save you some work.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Whoa! Wait a minute! Opening ports! Don't all hackers use open ports to hack you?</b></p>
<p>Well, yes and no. Open ports themselves are not the real danger. Vulnerable software listening on that port is. Let's make an analogy here. Imagine your router is a large government office building. Like the immigration office, or the department of motor
 vehicles or something like that. Each bureau has a specific number (port number) and a very specific task (i.e. you can't go into department for motorvehicles and ask for an immigration visum or something like that).<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>So imagine a hacker scanning your public IP address of the router's outside (since that is the only thing the hacker can see from the Internet), and he detects that port 3074 is open since you're playing an online multiplayer match on your Xbox console.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>So he goes inside the office with the number 3074 and sees a clerk with Xbox uniform hard at work managing a Halo Multiplayer match.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hacker opens the small window at the counter, and starts to shout exploits and throws hacking tools at the clerk. The clerk just looks at the hacker and says "Sorry kid. Wrong office. I only do Multiplayer here!" and slams the windows into the hackers
 face.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>As long as you only open the ports necessary for the applications you use (and trust), you have nothing to fear. Just think of it that way: Even if you refuse to manually open ports, right now, when you open a web page, the router has already opened an incoming
 port to let the website data inside to forward it to your PC. Otherwise you couldn't read this text.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>So don't be afraid of opening ports. Just be careful to open&nbsp;<b>just</b>&nbsp;the ports you&nbsp;<b>really</b>&nbsp;need, and forward it to the correct device.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>But I have a strict or moderate NAT and am able to play with people. Magic?!!?</b></p>
<p>Not really. The Xbox Live matchmaking service just managed to match you to a player that has an open NAT himself. And in that case it works just like that example below with the PC actively requesting a webpage. Your Xbox console just shouted to the router
 "Hey router! Xbox Live told me about a Halo match at 123.45.67.89, please connect me to that." and the router will do that, and since he now knows, the Xbox requested that, will automatically route the incoming traffic to the Xbox.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, as soon as a second player with a non-open NAT joins that game (or a Live Party), it can lead to various problems.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>So even if you were able to play with some folks while having a non-open NAT, make sure you get your NAT opened.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Okay, so I turned on UPnP. I manually forwarded ports to the correct IP. But it still doesn't work!</b></p>
<p>From the insight I got from the old NAT thread, these are the most common problems you encounter when trying to open your NAT.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p><b>Double NAT</b></p>
</div>
<p>When you signed up for your Internet service, you might have gotten a cheap (or even free) modem device with basic functions from your Internet Service Provider. Now you wanted more comfort and maybe a Wireless router. So you buy a router, connect it to
 the modem you got from your ISP, and all is seemingly well.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>You find that you have a non-open NAT, so you log in into your new WLAN router and set up everything correctly. But it still won't give you an open NAT.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>In that case, the cheap modem you got from your ISP might be a Modem with built in NAT functionality. For example some Motorola Surfboard modems are able to simultaneously connect up to 31 devices to the Internet, despite having just one ethernet port (with
 the help of ethernet switches).<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>So while you told your WLAN router to allow Xbox Live traffic to the Xbox, the Motorola router still refuses to let anyone inside.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>To resolve that, you need to configure your modem for "<b>bridging mode</b>" or "<b>pass through</b>" mode. In most cases, you might even need to call your Internet provider, as a lot of modems get a custom firmware specifically made for your Internet Service
 Provider.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is not possible to configure the modem for bridging mode, try to plug the cable from the modem to the router into one of the router's LAN ports instead of the router's WAN interface. This way you circumvent the NAT routing of the WLAN router, and just
 need to configure the Modem's port forwarding (if possible).<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If everything else fails, you probably need to buy a new "stupid" (i.e. with no NAT capabilities) broadband modem.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p><b>I use my Laptop as a wireless bridge to connect my Xbox to the WLAN router.</b></p>
</div>
<p>See above for the Double NAT problem, as the Internet connection sharing on your Laptop is basically also an additional NAT device. In order for this to work correctly you either need to configure your router to forward the Live ports to your Laptops WLAN
 IP address, and in the advanced settings of the shared connection, you need to forward these ports again to your Xbox console connected to the Laptop.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or, to make things easier, instead of using Internet Connection Sharing, bridge the connection. To do that, select both your LAN and WLAN adapters on your computer (if necessary hold CTRL while clicking on each adapter). Right click on the selection and
 choose to bridge these interfaces.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now just configure your router to forward incoming Live traffic directly to the Xbox's (static) IP address.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p><b>Restrictive Firewall or Intrusion Detection Systems in your router</b></p>
</div>
<p>Some routers specifically have a Firewall running on them. In my opinion this is a simple marketing ploy to convince the buyer in getting this router, since it additionally has a firewall built in.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because, even if you turn off this firewall (or buy a device without firewall), the router itself&nbsp;<b>still is</b>&nbsp;a firewall. Because if you didn't specifically give the router a port forwarding list, the router will reject all incoming traffic. And this
 is the purpose of a firewall: Deny unintended traffic in your network.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>So having a firewall enabled on a router, is like telling one bouncer at your disco to allow your friends inside for a multiplayer match, while telling a second bouncer to make sure&nbsp;<b>no one ever</b>&nbsp;gets past that other bouncer. Not even your friends.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>A similar problem is with Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). These tools are there to defend your network from malicious attacks. But since attackers aren't marking their attacks as malicious (just imagine a terrorist asking the guard if it's OK if he just
 goes in there and blows up the building), IDS systems try to look for patterns, that&nbsp;<b>could</b>&nbsp;be an attack.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now if you initiate a multiplayer match, a lot of different IP adresses are suddenly asking your network if there is still room in your match for another player. The pattern of a lot of "strangers" suddenly asking for access into your network could be mistaken
 as a&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Distributed_attack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Distributed Denial of Service</a>&nbsp;attack, and therefore the router will
 block these requests.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>So just turn off these "security" features of your router.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p><b>Two or more Xbox consoles for multiplayer at the same time</b></p>
</div>
<p>If you have two or more Xbox consoles that are supposed to play online multiplayer at the same time, the router is stuck with the same dilemma as with the quiet listen server in the "What is this NAT thing anyways" explanation below. If there are incoming
 Xbox Live data packets to the router, to which console should these packets be sent? Xbox 1 or Xbox 2?<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's make an analogy: Your router's public IP address is the street address of an apartment complex. In that building you have two men named "John Smith".<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now if the postman comes with a packet for "John Smith" at that street address (but no apartment number), and the postman sees two Mr. Smith on the doorbells, he just throws away the packet and goes away. Both consoles have a strict NAT.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem? You can&nbsp;<b>manually</b>&nbsp;only configure port forwarding rules for&nbsp;<b>one</b>&nbsp;specific port to only&nbsp;<b>one</b>&nbsp;specific destination.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>To keep with the analogy: This would mean that one Mr. Smith puts a sticker on his doorbell reading "All packets to John Smith to me here!"<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>This way, only that Mr. Smith with the sticker on his doorbell will get all packets (the one Xbox having an open NAT), while the other Mr. Smith still won't get any packets.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Placing the other Xbox into a DMZ (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_%28computing%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">De-Militarized Zone</a>) is like the other Mr. Smith camping outside the apartment complex near the doorbells, and grabbing every Packet for any Mr. Smith himself
 before the mailman reaches the doorbells.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on how the router priorizes DMZ or Port Forwarding over the other, the mailman could still tell the camping Mr. Smith, that the sticker on the doorbell reads to deliver packets for Mr. Smith there instead of the camping Mr. Smith.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either way, one of the both Xbox consoles will always have a non-open NAT.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only solution to this problem is to use a router with a&nbsp;<b>very good</b>&nbsp;implementation of UPnP.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all routers with UPnP are able to support two (or more) Xbox consoles. Therefore, Microsoft has tested several routers, and those that were able to support multiple Xbox consoles, got a certification and an official "Compatible with Windows
 7/Vista" sticker.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the support site there is a&nbsp;<a href="http://xbx.lv/pXMn6f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">list of compatible routers that support two consoles</a>.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if your router does not have UPnP, or if it has UPnP and still one or both consoles show a non-open NAT, you need to buy a new router.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also keep in mind, that the Games for Windows Live Client on a PC uses the same Xbox Live ports for multiplayer. Even if you don't have two consoles, this might be the problem.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>I think I followed these instructions correctly, but it still won't work</b></p>
<p>If you think you did everything right, and already checked for the most common problems, specifically the double NAT problem above, feel free to post here, and ask for help.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>But please, in order to help you, you first need to help us, by describing your network setup as specific as possible.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to describe all devices that your Xbox needs to traverse in order to reach the internet. Please use the full model name of the device(s).<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<b>bad&nbsp;</b>request for help would be "HELP! I have that Netgear router, and I can't play online!"<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<b>good</b>&nbsp;request for help would be something like this: "Help! I have a Netgear WGR614 v3 router connected to a Motorola SB 2100 cable modem. My console can connect to Xbox Live, but complains about moderate NAT. I can't play Black Ops with my friends!"<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more we know about your network setup, the better we can help.&nbsp;<b>So please help us help you! Thank you!<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>What is this NAT thing anyways?</b></p>
<p>NAT is an&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym_and_initialism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">acronym</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Network Access Translation</a>. It's purpose is to allow multiple devices
 in your home to access one internet line and be connected online simultaneously. Those with enough networking knowledge, please keep in mind, that this explanation is intentionally kept simple, and oversimplifies the whole process, so the average "I don't
 want to become a Cisco Certified Network Associate, I just want to play Black Ops with my friend!" can easily relate to what's happening in his home network.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>While&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipv6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">IPv6</a>&nbsp;resolves most of the problems described below, keep in mind that currently nearly all Internet Service Providers (and Xbox) still only use&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipv4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">IPv4</a>&nbsp;for
 private home users, and will do so for quite some time.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you might already know, each device on a TCP/IP network (and the Internet is just a very large network) needs to have its own unique&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">IP
 address</a>. When you sign up for Internet service with your Internet provider, you usually get one connection to the Internet, and it's only&nbsp;<b>one</b>&nbsp;IP address. But since you want your Laptop, your PC, your Xbox 360 and many other Internet aware devices
 in your home to connect online, you may begin to see the problem. It's not possible for your Internet provider to give all your devices unique IP adresses, as you would need to tell him about each new device you buy, and IPv4 adresses are basically "sold out".
 All IPv4 numbers are currently given out.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>To resolve this, you usually get a router from your Internet provider, that does NAT. The interface, that connects to the Internet (called WAN Interface, for&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Wide
 Area Network</a>) recieves this unique public IP address visible from the Internet. I's basically the "street address" of your home for the Internet.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the "inside" of your home, the router gives&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">private IP adresses</a>&nbsp;to the devices connected to its LAN ports
 (for<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp;Local Area Network</a>). So your PC, Xbox, Laptop and internet aware fridge will get an IP address from
 certain reserved IP ranges. Usually IP Adresses in the range of 192.168.XXX.YYY or 10.XXX.YYY.ZZZ.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better explain what NAT does, let's make an example.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are sitting on your PC and want to go to http://www.xbox.com, while your sister is doing homework on her Laptop and wants to do some research on Wikipedia. Both of you type the adress of the websites into your browsers and hit Enter.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your PC now shouts to the router "Hey router! I'm the PC, and I want to fetch http://www.xbox.com!". The router now takes the order, writes in a list, that the PC wanted to see Xbox.com, and relays the order to the Internet. The laptop shouts: "Hey router!
 I'm the laptop and want to go to http://en.wikipedia.org!", and the router also writes in the list, that the laptop wants to see the Wikipedia homepage. It then shouts to the Internet "Hey Wikipedia! I'm the router at the public IP Address 123.45.67.89 and
 am requesting the page for a device inside my network!".<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now xbox.com answers, and sends data to the public IP address of the router. The router now looks at its notes, and remembers, that the PC wanted to see Xbox.com. So the router forwards the incoming data to the PC. When Wikipedia answers, the data gets routed
 to the Laptop.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far so good. Now there are some multiplayer games, that use so called "listen servers" (imagine an ear the computer uses to listen to incoming other players) to host a game.This means, that if you for example start a game of Counterstrike on your PC,
 your PC will silently listen on it's internal IP 192.168.1.20 for other players.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is: No one knows that the PC is simply listening to incoming requests. In the previous example, the PC shouted out it's order to fetch Xbox.com. Now it's quietly sitting there, listening for other players.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now imagine a router being a bouncer of a popular club with gaming consoles inside, and you, inside the club, use your cellphone to invite your friends over to the club for a gaming session.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>When your friends arrive, they are stopped by the bouncer: "Stop! You are not on my guest list, and with these pants you don't get inside here."<br />
Your friend: "But I am invited! See? My friend sent me that message, that he's playing Halo here!"<br />
Bouncer: "I don't know you, and I don't know of any Halo match. So beat it, before I beat you!"<br />
Your friend: "Okay, calm down! I'm going already..."<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inside you're wondering why your friends don't show up.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Had you told the bouncer that you are doing a Halo match and awaiting your friends, he could write your friends on the guest list, let them inside and direct them to the gaming area where you're waiting for your buddies to arrive.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>In router language this "guest list" would be forwarded ports. So in natural language you would tell the router: "If there is incoming traffic on port 27015, this is data for a counterstrike game on the PC, and if data arrives on port 3074, it's for the
 Xbox 360, so please forward it that way."<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The router will then do exactly that, and your console won't know a router is there, which results in an open NAT.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this clears up a bit about the confusion what NAT is, and why it's not in Microsoft’s hands to "get rid" of NAT. Maybe in the (not so distant) future, the use of IPv6 gets more popular. With IPv6 any IPv6 capable device has its own unique publicly
 accessible IP address, so NAT isn't necessary. Until then you need to rely on UPnP or manual port forwarding to resolve your NAT issues.</p>

<h3> donsingles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Wireless Network Issues</h2>
                    
<p>I have a laptop with Windows 7 Pro&nbsp;32 bit&nbsp;that is having issues connectiong with one particular wireless network.&nbsp; The network in question recently had the router replaced.&nbsp; The new router uses the same SSID as the old and is setup for WPA/WPA2.</p>
<p>Other laptops in the same area also running Win7 have had no issues connection to the new router and getting to the internet but this one laptop refuses to work.&nbsp; It will either grind away on the network identification or, once in a while, it will allow
 you to identify the network.&nbsp; When I identify the network as a work network, it ignores my selection, sets it to public and then proceeds to list the network as having limited connectivity even though all of the DNS settings are correct and the laptop is getting
 a new IP address via DHCP from the router.</p>
<p>I have teied completely deleteing the connection, rebooting and rebuilding the connection as well as deleteing the network location to no avail.&nbsp; This laptop works fine on other networks but chokes on this one router every time.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Assuming that the Router's Wireless is configured correctly that there is a strong signal and the Wireless card on the Computer is<strong> physically on.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maybe this can Help.</strong></p>
<p>Go over these steps and tell us where the breaking point is.</p>
<p>Check the Device Manager for valid Wireless card entry.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a></p>
<p>If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wireless card's Drivers.</p>
<p>Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Wireless Network Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg</a></p>
<p><br />
------------------</p>
<p>Many Wireless cards' drivers also install the vendor's Wireless utility.</p>
<p><strong>Make sure that if there is a vendor's Wireless Utility thes Not Running together with the Windows native Wireless utility</strong> (WLAN Service) .</p>
<p>----------------</p>
<p>Make sure that No Firewall is preventing/blocking the Wireless components to get to the Network.</p>
<p><em><strong>Some 3rd party Software Firewalls/AV/Security suit,s keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled).</strong></em></p>
<p>If possible configure the Firewall /Security suit correctly, otherwise totally uninstall it, and get rid of its residual processes to allow clean flow of local network traffic.</p>
<p>If the 3rd party software is uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>
<p>3rd party Network mangers like Bonjour, and NetMagic can block local traffic too.</p>
<p>---------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Working TCP/IP stack should look this way.</strong></p>
<p>Right click on the Wire card Network Connection, choose Status, Details, and see if it got an IP and the rest of the settings.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/status-nic.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/status-nic.jpg</a></p>
<p>Description is the card manufacturing data.</p>
<p>Physical address is the card's MAC number.</p>
<p>The xx should be a number from 0 to 255 (all xx same number).</p>
<p>yy should be from 0 to 255</p>
<p>zz should be from 0 to 255 (all zz the same number.</p>
<p>The lease date should be valid to the current time.</p>
<p><strong>*Note 1. IP that starts with 169.xxx.xxx.xxx is not valid functional IP.</strong></p>
*Note 2. There might be an IPv6 entries too. However, they are not functional for Internet traffic or LAN. They are needed for Win 7 special HomeGroup configuration.
<p>---------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>A message in the Wireless little Window that says Connected does not means that your are really have a valid functional connection.</strong></p>
<p>If everything above is OK you have to be able to connect to the Router.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting to the Router means that you can enter the Router's core IP into an address bar of a browse, be able to connect, see, and configure the Router's menus.</strong></p>
<p>If it does not connecting to the Router, log from any computer that can connect to Wireless Router with a Wire, disable the Wireless Security, make sure that the Wireless broadcast SSID is On,&nbsp; and try to connect with No Wireless security.</p>
<p><strong>Enable the Wireless security after you mange to establish a functional connection.</strong></p>

<h2>            Profile not authorized to play on Xbox Live</h2>
                    
<p><span>Had an issue yesterday where my account did not recognize my profile and kept asking for my email address and password to log-in. Found a very useful process for deleting my profile and reloading it. That worked fine and I no
 longer have the email / password issue. However, after completing that, I was unable to play Modern Warfare 3 because the game said my profile was not authorized to play on Xbox live. I had a Gold membership but now my profile showed Silver - Free membership.
 I talked on-line w/ an Ambassador about the problem and he/she informed me that the server was down and that was why I had a problem yesterday w/ my email / password and why today I cannot play on-line. There was not estimate as to when it would be up and
 running again.</span> Not sure if this is correct but that's what the Ambassador told me......</p>

            <p>Hey there BAZINGA70! I'm seeing you as a silver member as well. Did your Gold membership perhaps expire? If you believe that you should be a Gold member but are not being listed as such, I would use the <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Us</a> page to set up a support call. I hope that helps! ^_^</p>
