            Dear Energy,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />Try to clear your Office credentials for macOS
<br />
<br />Sometimes your credentials can get corrupted, causing Office apps to continually prompt you to enter your password. To clean this up, do the following:
<br />
<br />Quit from all Mac Office Applications, except for Word
<br />
<br />In Word, sign out. This only logs you out, and all the notebooks will still be there.
<br />
<br />Quit Word.
<br />
<br />Launch "Keychain Access" and search for all items that contain "Office15". There should be only a couple items, one for each account you have logged into.
<br />
<br />The name will be a long alpha-numeric code and the kind will start with “MicrosoftOffice15…”
<br />
<br />Delete these items. It is only deleting the authentication credentials, no data. Once you sign in again, they will be re-created.
<br />
<br />Launch Word and sign into your accounts.
<br />
<br />Since all the office apps share the credentials (Word/Excel/PowerPoint) you will have to sign in again with those apps as well.
<br />
<br />Please share the results

<p>Right click on the time scale when in Day view and choose a new time scale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that when you use the New appointment button, the time will be based on 30 min when you are in Month view or create a new appointment when in any other folder.</p>
<p>You can type the new end time in the time field in digits. ie, 9 for 9:00 AM or 10.30 or 1030&nbsp;for 10:30 AM. It's a little faster than using the time picker. Use a or p to force times outside of your normal working hours: 9p, 6.30a</p>

<h2>            how to set defaults on global.mpt</h2>
                    <p>I am creating a new global.mpt to set my font type and have all new tasks AutoScheduled. With the font, it doesn't accept the change even from the OK button. It just goes right back to Calibri. Once I start typing, then I can make the change. With the New
 Tasks: option I make the change to Auto and it stays for that file. When I exit and start a new project it returns to the Manually Scheduled default. How can I make these changes stick?</p>

            Hi JAC-BPA,<br />
<br />
Please note that it is expected that the changes will only apply to the previous Project file.
<br />
<br />
However, there is a template that you can "create". If you want to have it changed for all your project files, change the font in a blank project file and then save it as a template (File &gt; Export). Use this template when you create new Project files (File
 &gt; New &gt;New from existing project &gt; choose the mpt file).<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jim

<p>Hi QuangQuac,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question in our community. I assume that you have a workbook that contains a macro, which opens a workbook in a SharePoint Online site. After you ran the macro, the workbook in SharePoint Online is opened in Read Only mode, and
 when you click edit, it shows a "Unknown error trying to lock file" error. If so, as this happens on your browser, I'd suggest that you may change the settings of your browser by the following steps to fix this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Please add the SharePoint site as a trusted site on your browser. For example, on IE, you may click the gear icon &gt; select Internet Options &gt; Security &gt; Trusted sites &gt; click Sites &gt; enter the URL of the site and click Add.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Please click "Edit in Excel" to edit this workbook with your Excel desktop application to see if it would work;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. In order to check if this is related to the settings on the SharePoint site, please check if you could encounter the same issue with opening the other workbooks in this SharePoint sites, and whether your colleagues encounter the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if there is any update so that we may further assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Nathan</p>

<p><span>Hi QuangQuac,</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please check if you can edit the workbook on your browser. If you can edit it on your browser, it may be related to the settings on your PC. Please try clicking on the OneDrive icon &gt; select More &gt; Settings &gt; Office &gt; uncheck Use Office application to sync
 Office files that I open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the workbook cannot open on your browser, then it may be also related to the settings of the workbook. You may open it with your desktop Excel application &gt; go to File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protect View &gt;
<strong>uncheck </strong>Enable Protected View for files located in potentially unsafe locations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above steps couldn't help, please also check if your colleagues use the same version of Office applications as yours. If not, you may suggest them go to File &gt; Account &gt; Update Options &gt; Update Now to update the Office applications and see if it could
 fix the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because it's important enough (read can cause massive outage and generates a lot of support calls to Microsoft) and because it still requires you to update the metadata even after the certificate has automatically rolled over. You can automate that part
 too if you want: <a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Office-365-Federation-27410bdc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

You should not use Avast &amp; MSE concurrently on the same computer.</p>

<p>Pick one to use and uninstall the other.</p>

    <title>Cannot add non-Microsoft email to OL 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> colinb-netluca  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot add non-Microsoft email to OL 2016</h2>
                    <div>In Outlook 2016 an email address in the form *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (major local ISP) was previously working correctly. After the user ran a Microsoft Office 365 repair tool (unnecessarily) the email account was changed to one in the form outlook_(16 character
 alphanumeric)@outlook.com, which contained no mail items.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The issue with the strange outlook.com address was covered in a Microsoft support article, explaining that</div>
<div>it is a result of using a non-Microsoft email as the primary alias on your Microsoft account. I have therefore created a new outlook.com mail address, set this as the primary alias and removed the bluewin.ch alias.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Following this I deleted the existing Outlook 2016 profiles and data files (after making precautionary backups) in the hope that I could now start fresh and add back the original bluewin mail account. Unfortunately this is still not possible, either with
 automatic or manual setup - I just get the message 'Connection to the incoming server (IMAP) was dropped. Please check settings..', when I know&nbsp; for certain that the settings are correct.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have discussed this with the ISP's technical support and from their side there is no indication that anything is wrong with the account (also webmail still works). They have no solution but did say that they have received dozens of similar complaints
 since recent Microsoft system changes.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Finally, I have just tried adding the same bluewin mail account to Outlook 2016 on a completely different machine. Even there it does not work!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There appears to be some link still between this account and outlook.com but I have no idea how to correct it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We urgently need a solution to this problem. Please help.</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

<p>You have an outlook.com mail account and you added the other mail account as an alias hence the 'odd' mail address</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick response but adding the bluewin mail account to MS Outlook has not been possible. I just get the error message mentioned, although I know for sure that the settings are correct.</p>
<p>The only thing I can imagine is that the changes I made to the alias settings may take a long time to propagate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem is not restricted to&nbsp; my user's PC.&nbsp; I have tried to set up the account in Outlook&nbsp; on a completely different machine and still get an error. Also the ISP's technical support said that they have had many similar reports recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have any further thoughts.</p>

<h2>            Multiple Line Formulas in Formula Bar in XL2003&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>When i use any multiple line formula in Excel 2003, say 3 line formulas, it displays in three lines in the formula bar and not a single line like Excel 2007, due to which anything written in the first row of the sheet gets hidden when the cursor is placed
 on the formula containg cell.</p>
<p>I am fed up, Is there any <strong><em>MACRO</em></strong> Solution that may work to fix this issue.</p>
<p>Kindly help!</p>

Warm regards Dharmesh

            The formula bar cannot be manipulated in Excel 2003 VBA. The suggestion in your previous thread (<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/excslcreate/thread/10e7edf5-d52b-4a4c-9ec4-57bdf662c69d/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/excslcreate/thread/10e7edf5-d52b-4a4c-9ec4-57bdf662c69d/</a>)
 is the best you can do.

<p>I followed the link offered by Jomel and all I can say is that this is one of the main sources of dissatisfaction towards Office at this point in time.</p>
<p>The logic behind it makes some sense from an architecture point of view but it brings with it more cons than pros. It strains to much the OS, works poorly with non SSD drives and whenever you have someone with a more dense and complex folder structure in
 Onedrive.</p>
<p>For people not using Onedrive yet this is a requiremet if you need to use colaboration tools but a pain has the thresholds are not set properly.</p>
<p>From a user point of view this should be seemless, weightless and on demand. Rather than forced upon you.</p>
<p>it is also distasteful the arrogant lack of interest from Microsoft regarding this high impact issue (if you don't believe me just google it).</p>
<p>Collaboration wise the cache needs to be on the server side not the client. I face on a daily basis countless episodes where this solution causes problems with shared files forcing users to colaborate the old fashioned way (creating new files) to be able
 to work (and i am just referring to people and server in the same network).</p>
<p>Sadly I see the same issue at home has a O365 user. There i am growing even more displeased both with Office uploader and Onedrive file management.
</p>
<p>I am starting to see my O365 investment as a costly mistake and currently considering my options.</p>

<p>I hate jumping in on a topic but have spent over 8 hours of debug and test verification proving the issue is related to the poor sync and file recovery of Upload Center when using O365- Office 2016 with Wiin10 clients.&nbsp; &nbsp;While we appreciate using a nonprofit
 version of O365, Upload Center is getting in the way of our office workflow&nbsp;- where we use a very simple, flat directory structure on a workgroup or shared cloud drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's typical to get a client file (cache) update out of sync with the server. Its possible to the supposed server copy out of sync of the actual file residing on the cloud service. Now add to the mix staff that are not highly proficient to comprehend&nbsp;recovering
 the correct copy - its a nightmare. We are down to manually recovering files that get overwritten when someone makes a choice to&nbsp;keep their&nbsp;version or the server version is not in sync.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm about to consult with another nonprofit, and I will be warning them of the limitations of file sharing given the&nbsp; situation with Upload Center</p>

            thanks, but the problem Is there whether the auto capitalisation Is on or of. if i start a sentence like this one with auto cap off, then as you can see, the if at the beginning Is not capitalised, but any word like is, in, if Is capitalised. it has happened
 in this reply for some of the words that start with i, but in Word, it happens to every i whether at rhe beginning or in the body of the sentence.

            <p>Thanks! Tried those things. Finally this morning, Outlook offered me "open in safe mode". This let me delete the email in the deleted emails folder. That worked rather than crashing my Outlook as trying to do so had previously done. While I was "on a roll",
 I then tried deleting the duplicate copy from my Inbox, it deleted normally from my Inbox and then deleted email folder. Now I have to find a way to "disinfect" my computer from this annoying critter "Rodolfo Feliciano PO#137376" and its attachment, which
 I did not open. Cheers, Chris aka Const Koala - my husband's humour there.</p>

<h2>            Display a message to the user</h2>
                    I created an order form years ago.&nbsp; It works great, however, now I need to change a feature, but can't locate the right spot to edit.&nbsp; I have viewed the code behind the worksheet, but no success.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is what I need to change:&nbsp; currently when the user
 enters the quantity to order, the system compares that amount to a validation list.&nbsp; If the quanity requested is not a multiple of the bulk quantity for that item on the list, they are presented with an error message telling them they must order in multiples
 of the bulk quantity.&nbsp; Once they do order the correct amount that amount is multipled by the rate and the extended cost column is filled in.&nbsp; Sounds simple enough.&nbsp; I assume I used an IIF statement.&nbsp; The code isn't that long and I have searched&nbsp;it with every
 word I can think of, but can't find anything.&nbsp;Am I looking in the wrong place?

<h2>            Bombarded with Ads, pages jump&#47;shake</h2>
                    <p>This is about the countless variations of mpstat.us that keeps hijacking IE searches, searches on popular craft sites, etc. I have been flogged with ads of items items that I have looked at sales sites, major dept. stores...no matter where else I may be
 on IE or GOOGLE search results ads APPEAR. My Lumia 620 lte usually takes me back to the start screen, shutting down any malicious attempt, I assume. But, what a pain to be doing something, reading an article, and suddenly be staring at icons on your start
 screen. Also I've noticed my pages jumping around, up and down, or shaking like a room full of kindergarteners. I've already done a hard reset twice, in an effort to rid the phone of intruders. I get apps from Windows, or Microsoft. But I must be doing SOMETHING
 to allow the uninvited to continuously bug my Windows phone! Thanks for listening.</p>

            Hello
<br />I was investigating and I think you should contact the EPSON HOME CINEMA Projector support team. I understand before you must validate which files you can view using USB storage devices.
<br />
<br />In the following article you can validate them.
<br /><a href="https://epson.com/faq/SPT_V11H849020~faq-0000886-hc660_1060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://epson.com/faq/SPT_V11H849020~faq-000088...</a>
<br />
<br />Types of free files for PCs supported
<br />You can project this type of files using the PC Free function of the projector.
<br />
<br />Note: For best results, place your files on media formatted in FAT16 / 32. If you have problems projecting from a formatted media for non-Windows file systems, try formatting the Windows media. You may not be able to use security features on certain USB storage devices with PC Free features. When connecting a USB compatible hard disk, connect the AC adapter supplied with the unit.
<br />
<br />I hope it will be of great help or clarification on the subject presented. Let me know if it was useful or if I can get a response from the support team.
<br />

            Thanks for the clarification. Please try formatting the USB as Windows FAT format as suggested by the Epson site. You can do this with
<strong>Applications&gt;Utilities&gt;Disk Utility</strong>. Select the USB stick, go to the
<strong>Erase</strong> tab and choose <strong>MS-DOS (FAT)</strong> Format.<br />

<p>According to the information in the link dyamiperez posted, the projector can display image files from USB but it says nothing about being able to display PowerPoint files.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could, however, save your presentation as a series of JPGs, which the projector will be able to display so long as the images and the USB stick formatting match the specs (again, see the link above).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This wouldn't preserve any transitions, animations, links or other interactivity features from the original PPT file.&nbsp; Another option would be to save the presentation as a movie file.</p>

<h2>            No Morph Transition, No New Features</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm running Office 365 ProPlus on Windows 7 Professional, 64-bit, and I need some assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
<p>I'm not getting access to new features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, in PowerPoint 2016 (the latest version, 16.0.6001.1061), There is no option for me to use the new morph transition. I can't apply the new "Dark" theme to Office either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Excel, I can't use any of the new functions, such as IFS, either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand what my problem is. I thought that the Office update that I installed earlier this morning would fix the problem, but it didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless I'm mistaken, because I'm running Office 365 ProPlus, I should be receiving these features as soon as they come out of insider testing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What's my problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi Tracy,
<br />When deleting emails to permanently remove them so they do not go into the Recover emails folder select email or emails for more than one either select individual emails by holding down the CTRL key while clicking on emails to highlight them. Then Select the SHIFT key while holding it down press delete. You will get a pop up are you sure... Click yes if you do not ever want to recover these emails. 
<br />To select a block of emails Hold the SHIFT key down select the first email while still holding the Shift Key down use the scroll button to the right and select the last email this will highlight all emails in between, then hit the delete button. 
<br />I always look for the biggest emails by Clicking on Filter Select All then Sort by Size the largest emails will appear. You can always if you want to save the attachment click on the email and download all or save to OneDrive. 
<br />Again select as above and delete. 
<br />Once I have done all of this go into your Deleted Items folder and look under Deleted Items for the Recover items deleted from this folder. 
<br />Select here the emails you want to delete as above or if wanting to just delete them all Click on the Circle with the Checkmark besides Recoverable Items. 
<br />Close out of outlook open your browser and clear my browser cache. CTRL SHIFT and Delete keys will bring up the where you can clear your cache in most browsers. 
<br />Close out of the browser and restart your computer.
<br />Click on link below and check your storage. 
<br /><a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/general/s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/general/s</a>...

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />Check the following:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manage-my-mailbox-size-792b521c-3f4e-404e-b436-9c197bad6f45" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manage...</a>
<br />
<br />few simple ways to reduce mailbox size are:
<br />
<br />Delete large Outlook emails and attachments
<br />Use Mailbox Cleanup utilities
<br />Compress the Outlook data file (PST)
<br />Try third-party Outlook management tools
<br />
<br />Delete large Outlook emails and attachments:
<br />
<br />Open Outlook. In the folder list, click Search folder, then select New Search folder.
<br />
<br />Scroll down the list and under Organizing Mail, select Large mail. Click Choose under Customize Search Folder.
<br />
<br />Specify a size in the ‘Show mail greater than’ box (for example 6000 KB). Click OK to continue.
<br />
<br />Click OK again and a folder named ‘Larger Than 6000 KB’ is created under Search Folders. This newly created folder will get updated with the mails of size more than 6000 KB automatically.
<br />
<br />When you face mailbox size issues, just go to the Search Folders. There, click on the newly created folder, and delete your mails which are not so important. If you need, you can save the attachments to your drive before deleting it (by right-clicking on the attachment and then clicking ‘Save As’ or ‘Save All’ option). Continue doing this, until the mailbox has enough space for new emails.
<br />
<br />Delete large Outlook emails and attachments
<br />Deleting large emails, undoubtedly, is the wisest technique. Rather than randomly deleting large-sized files, you can follow a systematic approach to manage Outlook attachments . The steps are:
<br />
<br />Open Outlook. In the folder list, click Search folder, then select New Search folder.
<br />
<br />Scroll down the list and under Organizing Mail, select Large mail. Click Choose under Customize Search Folder.
<br />
<br />Specify a size in the ‘Show mail greater than’ box (for example 6000 KB). Click OK to continue.
<br />
<br />Click OK again and a folder named ‘Larger Than 6000 KB’ is created under Search Folders. This newly created folder will get updated with the mails of size more than 6000 KB automatically.
<br />When you face mailbox size issues, just go to the Search Folders. There, click on the newly created folder, and delete your mails which are not so important. If you need, you can save the attachments to your drive before deleting it (by right-clicking on the attachment and then clicking ‘Save As’ or ‘Save All’ option). Continue doing this, until the mailbox has enough space for new emails.
<br />
<br />Use Mailbox Cleanup Tools
<br />You can trim the size of your mailbox using the options in the Outlook Cleanup Tools (you can access it by following File ? Info ? Cleanup Tools).
<br />
<br />
<br />Three options are available in the Cleanup Tools dropdown list:
<br />
<br />Mailbox Cleanup
<br />Empty Deleted Items Folder
<br />Archive
<br />
<br />Using the Mailbox Cleanup Option, you can view your mailbox size/mailbox folder sizes. Also, you can find items larger/older than a specified limit.
<br />
<br />Mailbox Cleanup also provides you the facility to archive the older items which are not needed anymore. Click AutoArchive to move your unwanted items to a separate folder automatically. With its advanced options, you can filter the items you need to archive. And you can Browse and select the location where you need to save your archived items.
<br />
<br />With the Empty option, you can delete all the items present in the Deleted Items folder permanently. Before that, you can view the deleted folders and subfolders (if any) and their sizes.

            <p>Hi Kenny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the information that you have provided. Did you enable the two step login of your account? If so, you will not be able to use the online password as a login key on a mobile device. You may need to generate an app password that will be use as
 the password on your email app. For more information, please refer to this <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/two-step-verification-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, you can just turn off the two step login in order to use the online password when configuring your account on a mobile device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, please provide us your affected email address so we can investigate your account. Please indicate your email in the private message, take note that you need to login to view the private tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Number of allowed subfolders is limited -- will be impossible with - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wingnut_1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Number of allowed subfolders is limited -- will be impossible with unlinked accounts</h2>
                    I just tried to add a new subfolder to my folders list in Outlook, but I got an error message stating that the max number of new folders has been reached.&nbsp; This is not workable AT ALL.<br />
<br />
I do have a lot of folders; however, I have many more that need to be created, so I was extremely dismayed at this limitation since I use my Outlook folders as a filing system to easily find things I need to refer back to.<br />
<br />
Why is there a limit?&nbsp; If you must have a limit, then I would like MS to consider greatly expanding this limit in a future release.<br />
<br />
An even greater concern in addition to needing more folders in the <b><i>current </i>
</b>view is that our accounts links are going to be taken away, whereby we will have to have multiple accounts forwarded to our primary account.&nbsp; We will need many additional folders for these forwarded e-mails since we will need one primary folder for each
 of those unlinked accounts, in addition to all their subfolders.&nbsp; How are we going to be able to forward messages from different accounts and keep them organized if we have already reached the max number of folders allowed?<br />
<br />
Is MS going to expand the number of allowed folders to accommodate four or more other forwarded e-mail accounts and all their subfolders?<br />
<br />
Also, in conjunction with that -- MS MUST fix the default folder view which is always expanded.&nbsp; Currently I have over 100 folders and subfolders, and with them always expanded, it is extremely unwieldy to sort through the entire list of unnecessarily expanded
 subfolders.&nbsp; When the other e-mail accounts get unlinked and must be forwarded to additional folders in our primary account, it is going to create a worse logistical nightmare.<br />
<br />
Unless this gets fixed, the situation is going to become much worse than it already is, with the forwarding of the unlinked accounts.<br />
<br />
We need to be able to create more folders, and they need to function in a user-friendly way so as to be less unwieldy, such as not auto-expanded as a default.<br />
<br />
This is a HUGE problem that needs to be addressed.<br />
<br />
Thank you!

<br />
This issue has been going on for over a year with people continuing to post in those dead threads.<br />
<br />
IMO I suspect that since there is a very small percentage (less than 0.0001%) of users that run into this problem, and that Microsoft has not "changed" it by now, It is going to stay that way.<br />
<br />
I do have a question.&nbsp; Since you're using your Online folders as a storage cabinet, do you have a backup locally in Case????<br />
<br />
Far too many people have lost things because they dont.&nbsp; That is something to be concerned about.<br />
<br />
I am sure Microsoft "appreciates" your feedback as I do.&nbsp; It was well written and concise.&nbsp; Thanks.<br />

            Hi ZigZag,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your response -- I didn't even realize there were dead threads on this topic since I thought it was a relatively new problem (since the switch-ever to Outlook), and now a greater concern with the unlinking of the other e-mail accounts.<br />
<br />
I have been using "drafts" subfolders as a way to store online references that I create because it is way more convenient and fast than creating, storing, and managing separate files on my hard drive simply to note a reference; plus I like accessing them from
 my e-mail too.&nbsp; So I have to admit that I may be using my e-mail folders in a capacity that "expands" outside that for which they were intended.&nbsp; It seems that I will have to stop doing this and do the slower method of creating files on my hard drive.<br />
<br />
However, with that said, I can see that with the advent of the unlinked accounts, and forwarding all the e-mails to the primary account, that the problem will be recreated and become more of a concern with more users who will need to manage many e-mail accounts,
 and all their subfolders, from one primary account.<br />
<br />
I suppose MS will consider the issue in the future if it becomes a problem with enough people.<br />
<br />
You make a very good point about the back-up; it is a concern I have had, and something I definitely need to do.&nbsp; I know I shouldn't put blind faith in the system.&nbsp; Can you please suggest how we back up our e-mail accounts?&nbsp; I don''t even know how to do that
 since the messages remain on a server, right?<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />

            Hello again, ZigZag &amp; Forum Mod. Team,<br />
<br />
I should have read the old threads first -- I usually do -- sorry about that.&nbsp; However, by doing so, it is apparent that this is a problem for others as well.&nbsp; It also appears that this issue was never resolved, and there were different answers from different
 moderators that didn't agree with each other, and those answers also didn't agree with the experience of the users.<br />
<br />
From what I see in the other threads, more than one moderator states that there is a limit of 128 top folders, and
<b><i>unlimited </i></b>subfolders; however, the users are experiencing a cutoff after 128
<b><i>total </i></b>number of folders, <b><i>including </i></b>subfolders. This is my experience as well.<br />
<br />
And apparently those having the earlier problem seem to have never received a satisfactory response even though moderators said they would access the accounts and "fix" it.<br />
<br />
Even if I stop using my drafts folders in the manner I stated above, the folders list would quickly refill in the manner in which they are intended to be used -- to sort e-mails -- especially with the forwarded mails from the up-coming unlinking of accounts.&nbsp;
 It is very easy to fill up 128 folders if the mail is being sorted.<br />
<br />
This is a great concern, and with the unlinked accounts, I believe that this is going to be a bigger problem for many users than the 0.0001% that you state.&nbsp; I am sure that in reading these threads on the topic, users probably realize posting about it has not
 yielded results, and therefore perhaps do not complain; however, if we need more folder space now, we will need even more folder space when the accounts are unlinked.&nbsp; I think this is a problem that MS should address.<br />
<br />
BTW, why is the number of folders limited when it doesn't impact the space on the server?&nbsp; What is the reason for MS restricting it?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
        </p>

Before I go any further I think you should be aware that this is a peer to peer site staffed mostly by volunteers (like me).&nbsp; We (the volunteers) are here to help where and when we can but dont have access to the "inner workings" of the system and are often
 as much in the dark as the user. The inconsistencies you have seen (and documented) in total folders may be a function of time (when it was written) or experience on the part of the people (usually a forum moderator) in dealing with this issue.&nbsp; Many of the
 FM's havent been here as long as this issue has.<br />
<br />
I have been following this issue for over a year and while it doesnt affect the majority of the users the ones it does affect it affects severely.
<br />
<br />
People develop their own system for dealing with the system and data and when a big change is made some users will be affected and be forced to figure another way to do things that work for them or find another service that works the way they would like.&nbsp; Since
 I am a volunteer here I can also volunteer at the other "big" free email services and find the similarities in the problems here and there are striking.<br />
<br />
The folder issue here may be a limitation of the way the program was written (and when) as there is also limitations in legacy operating systems in terms of folder structure etc.<br />
<br />
In short, I have escalated threads on this topic and followed the lack of progress and wish there was more I/we could do.<br />

            Thank you, Team ZigZag, I appreciate the help and you taking the time to explain. I'm sure I can speak for a majority when I say that I especially appreciate volunteers like you who help fill in with the assistance.<br />
<br />
Well I guess if we, as users, don't "squeaky-wheel" this issue, it won't get addressed, so MS can consider me another squeaking wheel that needs to have this problem fixed.<br />
<br />
I hope they will listen since this is going to be a huge problem when the accounts are unlinked and we have to start forwarding hundreds or thousands more e-mails into our primary account, for which we will need many more folders and subfolders.&nbsp; 128 won't
 be nearly enough for 5 e-mail accounts when it already isn't enough for one. (Simple math = 25.6 folders for each of 5 accounts -- definitely not close to enough)<br />
<br />
For a smoother transition, user functionality, and keeping the complaint level as low as possible, MS should address this issue before the change occurs.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for escalating this issue, although I get the feeling you meant prior escalation that had no result.<br />
<br />
PLEASE bring this issue to their attention again, with the new insight that with the unlinked accounts, this will be a much greater problem that will affect many more users.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Have a nice day/night.<br />

            <p>Hi <font color="#0072c6">Wingnut_1</font>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your issue here in our community. I will be glad to help you with your issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be reminded that the reason why there is a limit on sub folders being used in the web interface is for the server to actually save space and maintain the space availability for all users. As a workaround to your issue, you can always use Windows Live
 Mail, an email client which needs to be installed in your computer if the web interface version is not
satisfying </span>your needs. You can create local folders on your PC to sort your emails. That way, you have no limitations in your folders because the folders are being stored in your computer's hard drive.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if you have more questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sergs P.</p>

            Thank you, Sergs P., that info. about Windows Live Mail is helpful to know as a workaround because I do not have that set up and was not even aware of it until recently.<br />
<br />
In Windows Live Mail, are all e-mails automatically downloaded to my computer, or only the ones I choose?&nbsp; If it's automatic, I am concerned this could become a space issue quite rapidly because I have an older computer.<br />
<br />
If I create a Windows Live Mail account, are all existing e-mails that I have in Outlook going to dump on to my PC?&nbsp; If so, that is a concern because with thousands of messages, I am afraid that could crash my computer. Is there a way to control this?&nbsp; Please
 help shed some light on this for me.&nbsp; Thanks.<br />
<br />
In reply to the other part of your message where you state the limitation on the subfolders is to save space...&nbsp; I do not understand that explanation because I did not think that the creation of additional subfolders would require extra space on the server.&nbsp;
 If the e-mails exist regardless, how does dividing the e-mails between more subfolders take up more space? I.e. what does it matter if 1000 e-mails are divided between 5 folders or 25 folders or 100 folders?&nbsp; Don't those e-mails take up the same amount of
 space regardless of the number of folders they are in?&nbsp; This was discussed in other threads in which it seemed to conclude that adding subfolders is unrelated to space issues.&nbsp; If you could please clarify, that would be appreciated. Thanks.<br />

            <p>Hi Wingnut_1,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Windows Live Mail, you don't have a option to choose how many emails or what specific emails are you going to download on your computer because once your account syncs to Windows Live Mail, all the emails will be downloaded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding your question with subfolder limitation, sorry for the confusion but it is by Outlook.com design that you cannot create more than 128 folders regardless if it is a main folder or a sub folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you&nbsp;have any other concerns, feel free to post back</p>
