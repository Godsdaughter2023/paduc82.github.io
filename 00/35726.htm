            <p>Most unhelpful answer.&nbsp; Doesn't solve the problem nor does it really tell you how to solve it, it merely gives you some blanket troubleshooting issues that are not targeted to the actual complaint.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, when I type in "troubleshooter" Cortana, i get a web search, and cannot find "Systems Maintenance Troubleshooter"&nbsp; - why isn't this an easy option to find in settings?
</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows Update not working any more in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Update not working any more in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Windows update (in Windows 7 Home Premium) tells me there are updates available but if it hasn't installed any automatically.</p>
<p>I've tried to install them manually and I get an error. When I first click on "Install Updates" the screen seems to freeze for a few seconds, then it appears to be trying to download updates but doesn't actually get as far as starting to download anything.</p>
<p>It just sits there saying Downloading 22 Updates (0KB Total, 0% complete) for quite a few minutes with the green bar moving across the screen.</p>
<p>It then comes up with "Some Updates were not Installed. Failed: 22 updates" plus "Error(s) found: Code 8024AFFF Windows Update encountered an unknown error". If I click on "Get help with this error" it brings up Windows Help and Support but not with that
 particular code. The first on the list is "Install Windows Updates in Windows 7" which is what I'm trying to do!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've then downloaded the Windows Update troubleshooter and run it for which at the end says "Troubleshooting was unable to automatically fix all of the issues found. Problems found:</p>
<p>- &nbsp;Windows Update error 0x80070057(2015-09-01-T-01_51_09P) &nbsp;Not Fixed</p>
<p>- Problems installing recent updates &nbsp;Not fixed</p>
<p>- Problems installing recent updates &nbsp;Not fixed</p>
<p>- Service registration is missing or corrupt &nbsp;Fixed</p>
<p>
</p><p>It still won't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried running the Fix It program and other changes (i.e. turn off auto, close Windows, turn on auto again etc) but nothing seems to fix it. The Fix It program said there were things that couldn't be fixed.</p>
<p>How do I get Windows Update working again without having to reinstall Windows?</p>
<p>This starting happening maybe 3 or 4 weeks ago with no other issues or problems noticed.</p>
<p>This is also stopping my free upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Martin</p>

            <p><span>There is nothing wrong with your computers!&nbsp; The problem is a hopelessly inadequate Windows Update service.&nbsp; Likely it is overwhelmed sending millions of 5 gigabyte Win10 files to unwilling
 Win7 computers, using the same equipment and network that normally services you and I.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From Microsoft’s perspective, the updates you want are an extremely low priority.&nbsp; They do not want you updating Windows 7.&nbsp; They want you replacing it with Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have seen cases where the green bar continued overnight and finally found the updates, then spent many more hours downloading those updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My advice:&nbsp; don't even bother until the September updates, or be very, very patient.&nbsp; Stop trying to fix your computer.&nbsp; You are likely to make a mess of it for no benefit.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Trying to fix your computer is pointless, when the problem is your supplier.&nbsp; Sort of like taking a part your car's engine because it does not start, when the problem is the gas tank is empty.</span></p>

            Hi,
<br />Try updating manually.
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

            Hi 4x4pizzadude, 
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .       
        </p>

            I recommend you upgrade offline manually using the ISO or the Upgrade Assistant or Media Creation Tool.

<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />

<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option.

<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.

    <title>Master Mechanic Achievement not Unlocking&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greigadeth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Master Mechanic Achievement not Unlocking&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I've managed to unlock everything except for the Master Mechanic Achievement (Create all 10 Combo Vehicles). &nbsp;Which I have done so many times that my total combo vehicles made is over 500. &nbsp;I have all the vehicles and blueprints and even the achievement
 for creating 5, but for some reason I can't unlock this one.</p>
<p>Has anybody else had this problem, or know a way of sorting it out.</p>
<p>I've tried making all 10 combo vehicles in story mode on every chapter, overtime mode, nightmare mode, co-op, offline, after hard restarting, after latest Patch (DLC), during Broken Eagle DLC, in garages and outside garages and nothing has worked.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>This happened to me. After I 100% the game, I went through and created all of the combo vehicle again, checking off each one I did. I ended up getting the achievement. I believe it is a bit glitchy. Best advice is to redo the combo in the main chapter after
 unlocking everything (unlocking all of the vehicle perks is a plus). Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Cheers for the reply. &nbsp;I have all the perks and skills unlocked also and I've even went through a list of the different vehicles for example making the mobile locker with 2 vans, 1 van and party van, 1 van and firework van, 1 van and ambulance etc and still
 nothing, I've completely run out of ideas.</p>
<p>Do you know if creating one of them is supposed to put the % up for unlocking the achievement because mine is stuck on 0% and I'm not sure if that's supposed to go up for each combo vehicle made.</p>

<p>To be honest, I'm not sure how the % works. If it's stuck at 0%, that might be a problem.
</p>
<p>If you're talking about the % for the achievement, I'm still not sure. On that vehicle achievement, I never noticed mine going up, it was staying at 0%, so I don't believe it keeps track through the achievements. Some achievements do keep track, but I found
 a few glitches here and there.</p>

<p>It's weird, I should definitely have gotten the achievement by now, I even make all 10 combo vehicles in-between missions just to see if it will work but I did notice when I start a new game that a few of them flash up new like they did when you first find
 the blueprints, is that supposed to happen?</p>

<p><strong><span>Original title:MS Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000 v1.0<br />
<br />
I have just had to install a new had disk after a catastrophic disk crash. &nbsp;I have a MS Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000 v1.0. &nbsp;I no longer have the pass key required. &nbsp;I seem to remember that is was something like 0000 or 1234 when I installed it last, i.e. a
 generic standard number. &nbsp;Can you cast some light on this or tell me where I find it on the device, please? &nbsp;I no longer have the&nbsp;literature&nbsp;or paperwork that came with it.</span></strong></p>

            I don't know if there is something that can fix this problem for windows 10, because its been connected since windows 8 , but recently it disconnected and it wont reconnect. &nbsp;I specifically remember it being 0000, but it doesnt work anymore (I also tried
 1234 and other things like that) but none of it works.

<h2>            Since downloading Windows 10, no dvd maker</h2>
                    Since installing Windows 10, I am missing my Windows DVD Maker. I know that the new version of Movie Maker has a burn disc option, but unfortunately, it isn't allowing me to do this. I need to burn a disc of the movie for a wedding project and have reached
 the time crunch. Any suggestions? I've looked into 3rd party installs but I'd like to stay with a trusted program operator like MicroSoft. Not sure whats out there and how well it works.

            <p>Windows DVD Maker was only installed on Windows Vista and Windows 7. Support was dropped in subsequent versions of Windows (e.g. 8, 8.1 and 10) and it won't be coming back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Movie Maker was run on Windows Vista or Windows 7, it detected the presence of Windows DVD Maker and added a menu option to "Burn to DVD". But as noted, on later versions of Windows, you will not be given this option. If you absolutely need this older,
 legacy format (standard definition optical disc in MPEG-2 format, 480p NTSC maximum resolution) then you'll have to look to other software to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are more modern ways to distribute video and to maintain HD quality rather than having to down-rez to the video DVD format. While perhaps too late for this project, if you want to explore those options, please reply back with reasons why you wanted
 to put the video on a video DVD in the first place.</p>

            <p>Hello -</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not Alicia with the original question to you but I have the same problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 years ago, at age 63, I created my first movie ever with Movie Maker on Windows 10.&nbsp; This was to be a gift to many family members.&nbsp; This took me hours over the course of many months to complete.&nbsp; It was a real challenge for me but I'm proud of myself for
 finishing and my good work.&nbsp; Upon completion I expected to burn to a dvd. Darn!&nbsp; Can't do that any more. I had only gotten a new pc w/ Windows 10 just weeks before starting the project.&nbsp; (should have saved the old computer!)&nbsp; Consequently, I had to haul my
 computer to the party for a view session.&nbsp; Just imagine,&nbsp; 12 people huddled over my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You ask why not use another media than DVD.&nbsp; My first thought is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
price</span>. A stack of DVDs is a heck of a lot cheaper than 17 flash drives - one for each family.&nbsp; You say "share from a cloud".&nbsp; Sorry, but maybe only 6 of the 17 families has the know-how to get into a cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please - give us back a burn to DVD option and please let me know when this "upgrade" is available!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>DVDs are a legacy format. Even Apple dropped support for iDVD in their iLife Suite back in 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, if you still need to use this format, you can find 3rd-party options for burning a video DVD such as DVD Flick, DVD Styler, Freemake Video Converter, etc. Just be sure you know what you are installing if you choose any of these freeware
 options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also purchase DVD burning software from Roxio, Nero, Wondershare, etc. And don't forget to check if your PC already came with some DVD burning software; it's often included with systems that have a DVD burner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for waiting for an upgrade to Movie Maker to include this, don't hold your breath. Windows DVD Maker isn't coming back and no features seem to be planned for Movie Maker... the version (2012) should give you a hint on how rapidly Microsoft is making changes
 to it (i.e. probably no updates).</p>

            First of all, when you see that message, the problem is very rarely with the hal.dll file in spite of what the message says.<br />
<br />
The problem is usually your NT file system (NTFS) has somehow gotten corrupted and XP just can't find the file.<br />
<br />
Or, your c:\boot.ini has gotten corrupted and XP just can't find the file where it is being told to look.<br />
<br />
What you need to do first is tell us about your system, or you are going to quickly get off in the weeds following advice from people that may have good intentions, but have no idea what the problem is or how to properly fix it.<br />
<br />
Since the Microsoft Answers forum does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked so we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving
 these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
If you do not have a genuine bootable XP installation CD from which you can boot into the XP Recovery Console, you can make a bootable XP Recovery Console CD (no XP media required).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have never seen a Microsoft Support Engineer explain how to create a bootable XP Recovery Console CD when there is no XP media available - why is that when so many systems do not ship with Windows media? &nbsp; I think it is because there is no Microsoft KB article
 for them to link to.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
However, maybe with this new insight, some Microsoft Support Engineer will be able to help.<br />
<br />
From the Recovery Console you need to first run chkdsk /r and that will usually straighten things out - if not, then you start looking at options like rebuilding your boot.ini file, but the MS KB articles leaves out several things that, if you were to follow
 the article, could result in more anomalies you won't like.<br />
<br />
Answer the questions listed above, figure out how you are going to get into the XP Recovery Console, then you can look forward to helpful ideas that will work and do not involve trying things that might work sometimes maybe.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You cannot just copy or expand the hal.dl_ file from your XP installation CD and call it hal.dll - here's why:<br />
<br />
When XP gets installed, it selects and expands the proper hal.dll from seven possibilities of compressed hal.dll files on the installation CD:<br />
<br />
Size On XP Disk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expanded<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;53,248 HAL.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 105,344&nbsp; (generic for VMWare)&nbsp; 5.1.2600.5512 (xpsp.080413-2111)<br />
&nbsp;47,091 HALAACPI.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 131,840&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (likely for some systems and laptops)<br />
&nbsp;40,194 HALACPI.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 81,152<br />
&nbsp;51,368 HALAPIC.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 150,528<br />
&nbsp;48,531 HALMACPI.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 134,400&nbsp; (Likely for more robust systems)<br />
&nbsp;52,563 HALMPS.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 152.576&nbsp; (multiprocessor)<br />
&nbsp;37,780 HALSP.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 77,696<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Each one of those can expand into a file called hal.dll file, so if it is your intent to replace your hal.dll, you would have to either figure out or know in advance which one is the right one for your hardware, motherboard and CPU.&nbsp; If you just picked one
 at random, you would have a one in seven chance (14%) of getting the correct one.&nbsp; Maybe you will get lucky.<br />
<br />
If you just expand the hal.dl_ from the XP installation CD, that is the simplest, most generic of all the choices (probably not the right one).<br />
<br />
The hal.dl_ file on the CD is the most boring of them all:<br />
<br />
HAL.DL_<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Standard PC<br />
<br />
<br />
That is a good choice for some virtual machines where there is no real "hardware" (like VMWare), but it is a very poor choice for most other environments.<br />
<br />
You system may in fact boot with it, but you will be missing a lot of functionality that is built in to the other hal.dll files.<br />
<br />
For example, if I wanted to replace the hal.dll file on one system here, I would need to expand this file:<br />
<br />
HALMACPI.DL_<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Standard PC<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) PC<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * ACPI Multiprocessor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * MPS Multiprocessor<br />
<br />
<br />
If I wanted to replace the hal.dll file on another system here, I would need to expand this file:<br />
<br />
HALAACPI.DL_<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Standard PC<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) PC<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * ACPI Uniprocessor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * ACPI Multiprocessor<br />
<br />
<br />
One of those two are what you will probably find on most modern systems desktops/laptops.<br />
<br />
If you check the Properties, Version, Internal Name of the hal.dll on a working system, you can see which kind of hal.dll file you have and it is probably not going to be just "hal.dll" (check yours and see).&nbsp; It is either probably halmacpi.dll or halaacpi.dll.<br />

            Excellent Binging!<br />
<br />
Unless you are running XP on a virtual machine, you don't want to copy the hal.dl_ file anyway.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Fall Creator Update fails to complete&#59; 0x4000D error code&#59; restart function error suspected.</h2>
                    <p>Good afternoon!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My father's computer repeatedly fails to complete the Windows 10 Fall Creator Update (from version 1703 to 1709).&nbsp; Upon attempting to update, the system gets to ~80 - 89% complete, then freezes (the mono-color screen's rotating six sphere animation halts
 entirely).&nbsp; When this happens, the only option is to manually power down/on the computer, which subsequently abandons the update and rolls back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance to help complete this update would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Please see notes below on what I've attempted, and what I suspect may be the root cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the Computer:</p>
<p>The computer is a Gateway Desktop PC DX4870-UR11P.&nbsp; We bought it in December 2012.&nbsp; Its hardware specs remain sufficient for basic computer use (it is older, but not nearly to the point of being obsolete).&nbsp; The computer was initially installed with Windows
 7, and likely other Gateway inclusions.&nbsp; When Windows 10 was released, we did not perform a fresh install, instead we installed it "on top of Windows 7" so that all existing files and settings would remain.&nbsp; This worked well enough until Windows 10 released
 its first major update (I believe this occurred in mid- or late 2016).&nbsp; The update caused significant errors and I was forced to perform a clean installation of Windows 10 via flash drive.&nbsp; Since that time, there have been no major problems with the computer
 (however, note later discussion on the restart function).</p>
<p>
</p><p>About Efforts Thus Far:</p>
<p>I initially tried completing the Fall Creator Update through the standard Windows Update process.&nbsp; This failed with no error message to analyze.&nbsp; After this failed a few times, I then tried to initiate the same update through the Microsoft website (I forget
 the link used, but this effectively results in the same update being downloaded, albeit in different windows than the standard process).&nbsp; This still failed, but provided the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>We couldn't install Windows 10<br />
We've set your PC back to the way it was right before you started installing Windows 10.<br />
0xC1900101 - 0x4000D<br />
The installation failed in the SECOND_BOOT phase with an error during the MIGRATE_DATA operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using this error message, I have tried all of the suggestions mentioned in the links below.&nbsp; These links (especially #2) feature several sub-links as well, which were also considered.&nbsp; Unfortunately, these have not resolved the problem.</p>
<p>1) <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3132" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-</a><br />
2) <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/windows-10-upgrade-failure-error-code-0xc1900101/dcf8bbe2-6b82-4588-87a8-e3bd9ec2b421">
https://answers.microsoft.com/</a><br />
3) <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-upgrade-to-windows-10-version-1709-fall/617a37da-8fc0-4f33-a3eb-59fe9082f925">
https://answers.microsoft.com/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>To be absolutely clear, as it's been awhile since we've attempted some of the suggestions in these links: I've certainly performed some of the typical steps (i.e. uninstalled anti-virus, disconnected all USB devices, disconnected from the internet while
 the installation is underway, etc.).&nbsp; As one of the links discusses, I did even go so far as to download the ISO from the Microsoft website, and run it from the desktop.&nbsp; As the goal is to not perform another fresh install of Windows 10 (so as to retain the
 computer's current settings), I have not done anything resembling a clean install (i.e. USB boot device).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Restart Function:</p>
<p>As seems to be the case identified by the 0x4000D error code, in all attempts the system consistently reaches ~80 - 89% complete, then freezes (the mono-color screen's rotating six sphere animation halts entirely).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This "restart freeze" also seems to occur in normal situations outside of the update.&nbsp; That is, with any given restart, there is a (fairly high) chance that it will freeze.&nbsp; This has not caused my father any problems up to this point, because 99% of the
 time he simply shuts down.&nbsp; In addition, when the restart freeze does occur in a normal setting, it is never problematic.&nbsp; It does not prevent Windows 10 from booting, etc., it simply just requires someone to manually power down the computer, then power it
 back on, because of the freeze.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, the Windows Creator update requires multiple restarts.&nbsp; There are a number of restarts that occur before the installation reaches the ~80 - 89% section.&nbsp; These restarts have also resulted in the restart freeze, however, once the computer is
 booted back up it continues the update process as if no freeze occurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to further assess this issue, with no success.&nbsp; I've run the following checks on the computer (in tandem with the suggestions from the earlier links):</p>
<p>chkdsk (no problems)</p>
<p>sfc /scannow (no problems) </p>
<p>Adjusting the number of programs that run on startup, using msconfig, to the absolute minimum required for Windows needs (no noticeable effect)</p>
<p>Running a Startup Repair through the Advanced Startup Options Menu (although I believe a restart freeze occurred while attempting this, and I had to forcibly boot into Safe Mode to get the computer working properly again)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>I feel that I've gone through some fairly intense research trying to resolve this issue, but the update continues to fail.&nbsp; Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated.&nbsp; I would prefer to successfully complete the update.&nbsp; However, if this is absolutely
 not possible, then I could use advice on how to permanently disable Windows 10 from trying to initiate the update.&nbsp; My father says that about twice a week, Windows 10 will try to complete the update without any real permission; and this effectively locks him
 out from using it for a few hours as it the computer tries, and predictably fails, to complete the update.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<p>I did not read all your reply, but for can not complete Creators v1709 update. windows update is not the way to do it. Too many issues for it and other major updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go here and you can try the update assistant&nbsp;or &gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;media creation tool, which I would use and burn to DVD instead of USB if possible.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You probably have to download and create it on another PC&nbsp;since this one is stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be sure to keep your personal files and settings during install.</p>
<p>You may have to enter boot start up options in EFI and select DVD or USB as first boot device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may not work as it is stuck in process of current install and you most likely have EFI which makes things more difficult to over ride this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this fails, we can try something else.</p>

            Thanks for the response!&nbsp; Unfortunately, I believe I already tried this link (this seems to be the "through the Microsoft website" process that I did not explicitly link above).&nbsp; I definitely agree that this was somewhat smoother/faster than the standard
 Windows Update process, but it resulted in the same failure.&nbsp; I at least think this is what eventually spat out the error code.

<p>From the link you provided, I did not actually create installation media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I definitely recall trying the first sub-link (Windows 10 Fall Creators Update Now Available" that launches an update assistant).&nbsp; I also definitely recall trying the second sub-link, and choosing the "Upgrade this PC now" option, but not the "Create installation
 media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO file) for another PC)."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently doubtful that creating installation media will overcome the obstacles I've faced, as I would imagine this process still causes the computer to restart multiple times (and thus run into the restart freeze).&nbsp; Also, while following advice in link
 #2, I downloaded an actual copy of the ISO to the computer's desktop (by updating a User Agent String in the computer's browser), and tried running the ISO, without success.&nbsp; However, if you have further insight to why using the DVD/flash drive option would
 be more successful, I'm interested (just a bit wary).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help!</p>

                    <p>I've recently been given the "Avoid Me" reputation due to a club on Xbox Live who have began targeting me because of my character choice in the game "Overwatch"&nbsp;If you browse through the public leaderboards of the game you will also find that all but one person who plays this character has an "Avoid me" reputation. This is ridiculous. I&nbsp;pay for this service and to have it taken away due to the false reports of other players is infuriating. I will be leaving Xbox if this isn't resolved.</p>

<p>One of the last minidump files showed a BAD_POOL_HEADER (19) stop error but no third party driver was named as causing the crash.</p>
<p>That may indicate a hardware problem rather that a software problem with the first suspect being the physical RAM, even though the RAM tested OK.</p>
<p>What you could try is to take the RAM down to one 2GB module and see if stability improves.</p>
<p>If not, alternate the modules.</p>

<h2>            Files stuck in F Drive &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>My admin was working in Word and Excel, saving files (she thought) to the desktop, but they're not there. When I look at "recent files" both in File Explorer and Word, the files are there, but in an F: drive. When I try to open the files, I get the following
 message: "The directory name is not valid."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked in Disk Management and the F: drive doesn't show up there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how to recover these files?</p>

<p>OK. My admin was my administrative assistant. She has since left the company. She was taking notes at a meeting on an older HP laptop running Windows 10. Saved the file to the desktop (she thought) but it now only shows that it's saved to the F: drive.

<p>You put yourself into a difficult position, using a PC while skilled with Apple Macs and no longer having a Windows-competent person to support you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do not really know what this mysterious drive F: might be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The crashing PC is another issue. Windows must not crash. If it does then there is something wrong with it that needs fixing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your admin assistant was competent then she would have followed standard practice and used some backup tool to perform daily backups. This is where you would be able to retrieve your files from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend that you get a consultant to advise you how to set up a robust IT environment in your office.</p>

<p><span>Hi Rodney,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I checked for the compatibility of <strong>Treasure Hunt game</strong> and it is only compatible with
<strong>Windows 8.1</strong>. You may check the same by going to <strong>System Requirements</strong> section from
<em><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-treasure-hunt/9wzdncrfhw9g?activetab=pivot:regionofsystemrequirementstab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Microsoft Treasure Hunt</span></a></em>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, you may try the below methods and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1</strong>: <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Fix Problems With Apps From Microsoft Store</span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>Please follow the steps mentioned in <em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/microsoft-store-fix-problems-with-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Fix problems with apps
 from Microsoft Store</span></a></em>, <strong>restart the computer once</strong> after performing each step, and check for the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2</strong>: <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Check For Windows Updates And Game Updates</span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>Check if the Windows is up-to-date by going to <strong>
Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Update and Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Windows Updates</strong> and install all the Windows Updates if there are any.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, <em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026259/microsoft-store-check-updates-for-apps-and-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Check updates for apps and games from Microsoft Store</span></a></em>
 and install the updates if there are any.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 3</strong>: <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Delete Temporary Files</span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt;
<strong>Storage</strong> &gt; <strong>This PC</strong> &gt; Click on <strong>Temporary files</strong> &gt; Choose
<strong>Temporary files</strong> &gt; Click <strong>Remove files</strong> &gt; <strong>
Restart the computer once</strong> and check for the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><span>If you are still facing the same issue after trying the above methods, I suggest you to post your query in
<em><a href="https://community.microsoftcasualgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Microsoft Casual Games Community</span></a></em> as the issue is within the game and not with the Windows Operating System.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope it helps.</span></p>

<h2>            Too Many Windows Updates - coming everyday</h2>
                    <p>Almost every day now when I come to work&nbsp; my PC installs a window updates.</p>
<p>It often means I have to wait 15 to 20 &nbsp;minutes or so as the computer will then automatically reboot.</p>
<p>When I look at the settings&nbsp; ( Start menu/ updates/ windows updates/ change settings) it says "Install new updates Every Sunday at 3:00 a.m."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So why am I having to wait for updates to be installed all the time?</p>
<p>I have Windows 7</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Yes, the computer is mine ( I'm a consultant, I leave a PC at the client site)</p>
<p>Yes it is turned on and connected to the internet</p>
<p>Yesterday I came in, it was on 'sleep'</p>
<p>It did its updates</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, same thing</p>
<p>Installed windows updates</p>
<p>Then it shut down</p>
<p>When I started it up again&nbsp;it was 'applying updates'.</p>
<p>Then it was 'configuring windows updates'</p>
<p>It took a full 12 minutes to do all&nbsp;this</p>
<p>If I go to a start and type updates, and click on windows updates and then view&nbsp;update history I see that it has done updates almost every day (although it did not do any the past 2 Sundays).&nbsp; Some of these updates say failed, some say successful.</p>
<p>If I click on Change States,&nbsp; under Important Updates it says it says Install updates automatically and then Insall new updates every Sunday at 3 a.m.</p>

            your just going to have to turn windows updates off then just manually go and get the updates once every 6 months windows&nbsp;updates are one of the most annoying things about running&nbsp;windows &nbsp;they most definitely need to figure out something different and
 I just hope they figure out a way to do updates without rebooting by the time windows 10 comes out or I will be&nbsp;gravely&nbsp;disappointed &nbsp;

            Not that I am aware of. Microsoft does not make one and I have not seen any third party ones either. I've only seen overlays for Macs and for traditional full size keyboards. 
<br />
<br />I don't know if keyboard stickers might work - something like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Russian-transparent-keyboard-lettering-computer/dp/B002CCDEIY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/Russian-transparent-keyb...</a> (there may be others).

<h2>            WhatsApp Desktop Stopped Working on my Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I tried to start WhatsApp on my Windows 10 machine. it shows me the following screen. Nothing happens after that.</p>
<p>FYI: My phone is already connected to the Wi-Fi network.<br />
So, I am wondering what stooping WhatsApp working normally. It was working quite fine few days back.</p>
<p>I already tried by re-installing it and checked battery setting as well as the antivirus setting. It's the same as it was.

<h2>            Computer does not recognise speakers or headphones</h2>
                    I have a new, refurbished&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">HP DC5800 SFF running Windows 7 Professional 64Bit with Logitech 5.1 speakers.</span>

            <p>I have a ProBook 4710s running windows 7 pro 32bit&nbsp; The system tells me there are on speakers plugged in.&nbsp; I installed the audio&nbsp;driver sp45115 downloaded from the HP website.&nbsp; It gets almost done then tells me the driver isn't compatible even thou it was
 the one recommended.&nbsp; The audio icon has a red X and says no headphones or speakers are plugged in.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm stuck on what else to try.&nbsp; I did manage to get it to install once but still had no sound and had the same message on the audio icon.&nbsp; I did test the sound card which says it is working correctly.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any Help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<br />
</i>Windows could be right, but it ain't necessarily so.... ;). <i><br />
</i>If you are using Device manager to update the audio drivers, don't.<br />
<br />
</span>For HP's integrated audio you would want to download the driver for your model HP<br />
from the HP web site downloads section.<br />
<br />

 audio drivers</a><br />
<br />
If after installing the drivers you still have no sound verify it is <i>enabled</i> in -<br />
<i>Control Panel &gt; Sound &gt; Playback, Speakers</i> (or headphones).<br />
If Speakers is enabled and your 5.1 setup is verified functional then the audio chip may be bad.<br />
Is there a warranty on the refurbish ?<br />
<br />
The alternative would be a cheap sound card. You can get a decent sound card for as little<br />
as $15- from on line retailers. Something a bit more flash (still not 'audiophile' level) for up to $45-.<br />
Be careful not to get older sound cards if buying second hand as a lot of them don't have Win7 compatible drivers.<br />
