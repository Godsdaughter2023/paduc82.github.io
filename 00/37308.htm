<h2>            Suspension Not Showing Up</h2>
                    <p>My&nbsp;Xbox live account has an active suspension, but the suspension is not showing up in my enforcement history and I was never sent an email with any details about it, and because of this the option for a case review is not there. Hopefully someone can help me out here.</p>

    <title>After update, unable to connect to XBOX Live - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steves89  say:</h3>
<h2>            After update, unable to connect to XBOX Live</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Support,</p>
<p>So, I can no longer connect to XBOX Live after doing the update.</p>
<p>I already have a post here (http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/2388/t/157038.aspx) and at the end of the thread, it was recommended that I post in this forum instead, though it is a post-update issue, one that it seems to have happened to
 quite a few people so I am hoping there is some patch coming out soon.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the previous thread, this is one of 2 of my XBOX 360's.&nbsp; I have an old model and a new model.&nbsp; The update for the old model seems to work fine.. the update for the new model (internal wireless adapter) has created the issue where I cannot
 connect to XBOX live regardless of what I try.&nbsp; It does not produce an error code, though I did add the status below, if that helps.&nbsp; All it says is (a) "can't connect to XBOX LIve" when I try to and (b) "Network : Error" when I try and test the connection.&nbsp;
 I put the old and new side by side and only the old one works, when trying to connect.</p>
<p>I have tried the LB/RB/X/LB/RB/X thing and I have tried a USB drive with the update on it and neither worked (the LB/RB/X thing didn't show any indication of working after I pressed yes.. just restarted the 360).&nbsp; I have played around with my router, but
 the bottom line is the 360 right beside the broken one has no problem... only this one does.</p>
<p>Also, as I mentioned on my previous thread, I bought this newer model on Dec. 26th of last year, so if I need to send this to Microsoft prior to the warranty running out, please let me know.&nbsp; I suspect that's probably my best course of action at this point,
 but it really was a result of the update (right after, I could not connect again) so it seems silly to me to have to do so..&nbsp; just looking at the forum, I am not alone on this issue -- is there any patch / fix coming in the very near future?</p>
<p>Thanks much for any assistance.</p>

<p>I am in Montreal, Canada.</p>

<p>Hey srbshawerk, thank you for your thorough post! Okay, I'm wondering if you had any special network settings on the console before applying the update? If so, can you try resetting the console to factory defaults, and then re-configure those settings?<br />
<br />
To reset your console to factory defaults, go to the settings hub &gt; system settings &gt; network settings &gt; wired/wireless network &gt; configure network &gt; additional settings &gt; Restore to Factory Defaults. Please let me know if this helps! :-)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Mister Fitzer,</p>
<p>I actually tried that and then took one more step -- I formatted the hard drive. &nbsp; Still no luck, sorry. &nbsp;I want to add that I feel like the update must not have completely finished.. is this a symptom of the update not finishing? &nbsp;After format and restore
 to default, and without a patch, I feel like I must return the 360 before my warranty runs out.. should I?</p>
<p>thanks for the suggestions</p>

<p>Hey Hawker, from what you're describing, it doesn't sound like your console will require a repair--but of course, it's completely up to you if you would like to take advantage of the repair process before your warranty runs out. When you run that LIVE connection
 test, is there anything listed under 'more info' that you can share? Also, can you try connecting wirelessly with all other wireless devices disabled?

<p>The 'More Info' reports "IP Address Error" - Different suggestions based on whether I select automatic or set a static IP manually from the 360. &nbsp;There is one thing on the router that it is suggesting that I haven't checked, but I haven't set up MAC filtering
 so I'm a touch skeptical that this would end up being the issue.</p>
<p>I made sure that it was the only connected device to my router and still no luck. &nbsp;I don't think that there are 2 devices getting assigned the same IP. &nbsp;As mentioned, the other 360, with the update, has no troubles. &nbsp;I was thinking I could set this up at
 a friend's house and see if it will connect to his wireless network.. if that doesn't work, would it prove some more critical issue perhaps? &nbsp;I will give this a shot.</p>

<p>I just opened up my network and now the 360 gets to the NETWORK &lt;-&gt; Internet step and fails on "my DNS server can't resolve Xbox LIVE server names". &nbsp;I set to Automatic, manual (with the same DNS server that my PC uses) and I even tried the ol' google 8.8.8.8
 with no luck. &nbsp;I then set it back to Automatic and got ready to prepare my next email, and it worked! &nbsp;It worked once because, while I was testing the connection, it flipped the screen and re-downloaded the update ( I suppose because I formatted the drive
 -- see previous post) and looked like I was back in business!...</p>
<p>but once the update was downloaded, and avatar was selected, it went back to can't connect and "My DNS server can't resolve Xbox LIVE server names" -- which is odd again because my other 360, when I turn it on right beside this newer model that doesn't work,
 works just fine.</p>
<p>I am getting pretty fixated on this issue, so I also tried a completely different network as I had said I would. &nbsp;Went across the street, tried my friend's unsecured network and got the exact same issue -- "DNS server can't resolve Xbox LIVE server names".
 &nbsp;For kicks, I then tried the older model (which, to reiterate, is also updated) on his network, and just like with my network, it works perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Is there not anything at all with this update that might have caused this? &nbsp;It just feels like it did.. the second that I finished the update a couple days ago, I started having this issue.. It somehow magically worked for a second tonight, but again once
 done, boom, nothing again.</p>
<p>Thanks for any assistance.</p>

            <p>Hey there! I'm not seeing it your posts, so forgive me if you've tried this, but can you try connecting the console that is having issues directly to your modem? This would bypass the firewall on your router, and at the very least allow the console to connect. If it does indeed connect, then we can assume that there may be an issue with this console and your wireless network. Thanks! </p>

<p>srbshawker - I know official Xbox staff are assisting you on your issue, but after the update I literally had the same problem. I normally connected through Wireless N on my Xbox. Neither Microsoft's Networking Specialists or myself could resolve the issue
 wirelessly. &nbsp;If I did a direct modem connection, it worked fine. &nbsp;If I tried wireless, it did not... and I hadn't adjusted any settings whatsoever. So it left me and even Microsoft very confused. &nbsp;So I experimented on my own and forced my router to broadcast
 Wireless G ONLY. &nbsp;...and for some reason it worked and my xbox was fine after that. I honestly have no idea why the update caused my Xbox to not cooperate with Wireless N. It's disappointing though considering Wireless N is supposed to be the best performer
 in terms of speed and reliability. &nbsp; So this sounds weird, but if you are going wireless (even if you are going Wireless A, B, or N)... Force your router to broadcast G-only. It's worth a try for you. &nbsp;</p>

 program OS has been wanting to be validated as genuine. I have put in my original product id and key but that hasnt worked as valid. I am certain that windows was not reinstalled over my preinstalled version. What can I do to make this original install take
 its original&nbsp; key code. thank you<br />

<h2>            Windows Easy Transfer no longer on 8.1 -- anyone recommend a great alternative program</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have read and asked about a very good feature (at least I thought so) for moving from one computer to another or an OS to another version, WET.&nbsp; I bleive it kept your settings and moved the proper things around so you did not have to start from scratch
 positioning the Ribbon, etc.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now that MS has decided to deprecate WET for 8.1, would anyone know of a third part product that does the same thing.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A Bing search provides both too much and too little information...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>

            I had a brand new 8.1 machine fail today and I was responsible for migrating the account to a new unit also running 8.1. I *very much* needed Easy Transfer for that, and it wasn't there so I had to physically pull the drive and manually copy the user profile.
 This is unacceptable.&nbsp; Machine to machine migrations still happen, and Microsoft never should have removed WET.

            I face exactly the same problem, I need to move a user profile to a new machine that also running Windows 8.1, but there is no facility to achieve this other than copy the data files. It used to only take a few clicks &amp; there user didn't know the difference,
 now it's not possible, talk about a backwards step.<br />

            Respectfully, it does not. Attach two Windows 8.1 machines together with an Easy Transfer cable and try to migrate a profile, or even try to get the old PC to make an Easy transfer file the new one can read-- it won't do it. Did it in 8.0, but not 8.1.
 And before you say it, no, not every user has the skydrive&nbsp; cloud sync that supposedly obsoletes this tool.<br />

I don't use SkyDrive, so even though it appears to be active anyway, except for storing any files, it should not be relevant.&nbsp; But I have no idea how it and a Easy Transferred system might interact.<br />
<br />
Windows 8.1 seems to be a little different regarding profiles than earlier versions.&nbsp; It might be related to the Windows Store and the configuration of some of the Apps, but not really sure.&nbsp; The Sysprep tool does not seem to be able to prepare and upgraded
 8.1 system, which might also be related.<br />
<br />
All I am saying is, the utility still appears to be available... &nbsp; Is it not functional and from what OSes are you using it?<br />
<br />
If you use the utility, I can see why you would want it continued. <br />

            I am a computer technician at retail, so I use WET on a variety of different machines, especially when a customer retires an old XP or Vista unit and needs to get a new Windows 8 machine with data migration.&nbsp; But in this case my scenario was this: A windows
 8.1 machine that had customer data on it was returned due to a manufacturer defect. We had to swap in a new 8.1 machine to replace it, and migrate the data. WET would no longer work with the cable to go from one 8.1 machine to another. Nor could I get the
 old machine to make an easy transfer file to open on the new one. It cost me a lot of time opening the machine and copying the profile, which doesn't cleanly integrate with the new machine when copied by hand. There is no reason that two modern machines shouldn't
 be able to be connected and a profile easily transferred. <br />
<br />
WET wasn't broken in 8 and below and should not have been broken in 8.1 just because someone thought the cloud was the only way forward. WET is very, very useful still and needs to be brought back, even if as a hidden power tool. As it is I have to work around
 it by using a copied version of WET from a Windows 8 machine, but this is suboptimal.
<br />
<br />
Edit: To clarify, yes *a* version of WET is in 8.1, but it is crippled compared to the one it replaced from 8.0.

            Thanks Microsoft.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>So what are we in the Enterprise supposed to do? I'm running Win8.1 Enterprise, I'm not going to ask my users to set up a Microsoft account so they can use SkyDrive to migrate from one computer to another, in addition to their enterprise e-mail account.
 That's absurd.
<div><br />
<div>What were you guys thinking? Seriously. This is remarkably lame. It's like Microsoft
<i>wants </i>to go out of business.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Removing WET functionality so we can't move accounts from one machine to another (over the network, using the easy transfer cable, etc.) cuts us off at the knees. Now we have to scramble to find an alternative, necessarily non-Microsoft.</div>

<h2>            Reset and update</h2>
                    <p>This is a 3 part question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) So i have been having issues with my computer restarting on its own with no warning due to "power loss", according to my event viewer; and also BSOD with a multitude of error codes all of which point to drivers or my ram. i have tried every diagnostic
 program and routine that i can think of, to no avail of detecting what the route cause of the bsod and random restarts are. and yes i have checked my power supply and had it changed to a new one and had only bsod's for a week before both issues returned. is
 there any way that i can detect the cause of the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) i also have been having trouble updating my windows to 1903. i am currently running 1803 but when every the install is complete and i get the prompt to restart my computer it just restarts with no changes to the os build. what could be going on with it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) with the reset feature if i select "remove files and clean the drives" does that mean that i will need a clean copy of windows to install off or does it mean that it is reset to when i first installed windows 10 onto my pc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>any help with any of the issues is appreciated.</p>

            Hi FossilCupid8
<br />
<br />1
<br />BSOD's are generally caused by a corrupt or incompatible device driver, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />2
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />3
<br />A Windows reset will roll Windows back to the last major version installed on your PC, you can choose to keep your files, or remove your files. Either way, you will need to re-install all 3rd party applications, including Microsoft Office (if applicable)
<br />
<br />A Reset is basically the same as clean installing Windows, with the exception of the version No. you will end up with

<p>There is no option to buy a new subscription when you are turning off renewal so I cant see how you bought a new sub when doing that? Plus you have to confirm the purchase 2 or 3 times where it tells you what you are buying, how much it is and what payment
 instrument would be charged. Please pay attention to what you are doing because you could have purchased something that was non refundable and support would not be able to assist.</p>
<p>But in this case. as mentioned already, call support and they will assist. </p>

Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.<br />

The issue seems to be due to some .dll file corrupted. I would suggest you to run SFC scan.<strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Click <strong>‘Yes’</strong> if it prompts for permission.<br />
c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the <strong>command prompt</strong> type in the following command and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">sfc /scannow</span></strong></p>

<p>Laptop worked great until about 2 week ago, when it began to crawl&nbsp;with each new&nbsp;file or progam open.&nbsp; Been using&nbsp;Kaspersky, and I'm waiting for an answer from them too.&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Kaspersky and Mswinext.exe, I can only open one or two other files before I
 start to crash.&nbsp; Have 1G of memory, and between these two files, I'll have .5G used at all times.&nbsp;&nbsp; Searching on&nbsp;bing, I get answers that mswinext.exe is a virus and should be removed immedatly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, these are sites who want me to buy&nbsp;their scan product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure if mswinext is even my problem, as something else may be wrong...but can anyone tell me what this file is and how I might have&nbsp;loaded it on my&nbsp;laptop?&nbsp; Thanks&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Mswinext.exe, unless it has been replaced by malware, is part of the MSN Toolbar. if its causing performance issues, then it could be a conflict with another toolbar or addon to IE, you can disable the toolbar to see if it helps. try this, go to the "start
 menu&gt;All Programs&gt; Accessories&gt;System Tools&gt;Internet Explorer (No Add-ons) try starting IE with no add-ons and see if that helps, if it does then you need to find out which addon is causing the problem and disabling it by re-enabling them one at a time until
 you get to the one(s) that are causing the issues

<p>There are several issues which could cause this problem. One is a failing hardware. Another potential cause is malware. Mswinext.exe is the MSN toolbar. It should not be using any processes when inactive. I would first recommend you download Malwarebytes,
 update it and choose a quick scan. The fact you have Kapersky is irrelevant. No anit-virus or anti-malware software has a 100% detection rate. Added protection is always necessary. If the scan comes back clean try doing a clean boot of windows.</p>

<p>Sometimes, programs fail to release a file when done using it.&nbsp; If there is no obvious program that might be using the file in question (e.g., if it's a *.doc file, close Word), there are utilities that will force a file to be released.&nbsp; One of the better
 known ones is Unlocker:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/unlocker.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/unlocker.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than using something like Unlocker, there are a few things you can try.&nbsp; In order of increasing disruption to your workflow:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Open Task Manager, select "explorer.exe" in the list of processes (NOT IExplore.exe) and click "End Process."&nbsp; Then, still in Task Manager, click "File &gt; New Task (Run...)" type explorer.exe in the "Open" box and click OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Log off (click Start, click the arrow to the right of the "Shut down" button, click "Log off").&nbsp; Then log back on to your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Shut down the computer.&nbsp; Remove the flash drive (or other device).&nbsp; Turn the computer back on.</p>

<h2>            Missing .dll file.</h2>
                    <p>Hello All. I have inadvertently corrupted or removed file MSASN1.dll. This has resulted in a floating box on my screen. I can move this to the bottom of the screen so it does not intrude on my activity, but clearly I have caused a problem and would like
 to put it right. Are there any solutions that a non-technical type like me can use to correct this? The message in the box is:</p>
<p>"VMStillMnt: VM332_STI.EXE - System Error- The programme can't start because MSASN1.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem."</p>
<p>I have no idea where I might find this file. Perhaps I have deleted it.</p>
<p>With thanks in anticipation. NZted.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Check first of all to see if the file is located in the Recycle Bin. There's a shortcut to the Recycle Bin on your desktop in the top left hand corner of the screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the file is in there, right click it and choose "Restore" from the menu. Windows will replace it in the same location it was deleted from. You don't need to do anything else afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the file isn't in the Recycle Bin, do the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click the Start button and go to "Command Prompt (Admin)".</li><li>Next, copy/paste the following command and hit Enter.</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>DISM.exe/Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>DISM will download original system file(s) from Microsoft servers and replace those which are missing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After it finishes, using the same command prompt to run the following command:
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a screenshot of both commands when I ran them on my own machine recently.</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Have you made any chnages in the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>2. Have you checked issue status in safe mode ?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggets you to try the following methods.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Check the issue status in safe mode.</strong> </div>
<div>Start your computer in safe mode </div>

<div><br />
Keep the computer in a clean boot status and check for the error message. If everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third party services are causing the problem.</div>
<div>Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service. After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program, if you seldom use that software you can consider uninstalling
 it.<br />

<p>Sorry, I don't understand what you mean by "Will not let me access the driver files in the link." Please explain. What link? Where are you looking for a driver? Exactly what happens when you try? If you get an error message, please quote it verbatim.

Go to the OKI web site, find the driver you need there (Windows 7, 32-bit or 64-bit, whichever you have), download it from there and then install it.

            Hi Guys, FYI for win 7 users. After Clicking Installing the new driver package, click on add a new printer. When the installer finish's searching, it will show 1 oki driver that has a model number that isn't yours (OKI OkiLAN8300e Rev04.01 10/100BASE,
 ect). Click on it. You will then be given the HAVE DISK button. This where you can choose your model.
<br />
The install instructions don't tell you this step and drove me nuts trying to figure out were the Have Disk button was and couldn't find the driver when i hit the Browse button.<br />
One last note. these steps worked for the network printer setup. These steps should work for the Local printer setup as well.<br />
<br />
I hope this works for you and good luck.

<p><strong>Hello,</strong></p>
<p>So recently I installed a driver for a printer and since to start off. The computer kept giving this first error code.</p>
<p>BAD_POOL_CALLER</p>
<p>Technical Information:</p>
<p>*** STOP 0X0000000C2 (0X0000007, 0X0000110B, 0X00270026, 0X85749918)</p>
<p><span>After&nbsp;attempting&nbsp;to restart the only way I could load up was via safemode.</span></p>
<p><span>I can't System Restore because all my dates have been deleted&nbsp;unknowingly.</span></p>
<p><span>Now I get the error that's in the Title</span></p>
<p><span>***STOP 0x000000C4 (0X0000003D, 0X00000000, 0X00000000, 0X90FA4695)</span></p>
<p><span>A device driver attempting to corrupt the system has been caught. The faulty driver currently on the Kernel stack must be replaced with a working &nbsp;version.</span></p>
<p><span>I have even un-installed the driver and it still doesn't work... I dont know what else to do.</span></p>
<p><span>Any advice would be greatly received.</span></p>

<p>Hi <strong>Steven.C.C</strong>,</p>
<p>I would suggest you to boot your computer in safe mode and perform hardware clean boot and restart your computer in normal mode and check.</p>
<p><strong>For doing a hardware clean boot do the following steps:</strong></p>
<p>Unplug all the external Devices.</p>
<p>Start the System in Safe mode.</p>
<p>a. Go to Device manager by clicking on start and type ‘<strong>devmgmt.msc’</strong>.</p>
<p>b. Right click on the following devices and click on disable:</p>
<p>1. Video Cards.<br />
2. Sound Card.<br />
3. Network Card.<br />
4. CD and DVD.<br />
5. Modems.<br />
6. Ports (serial and parallel).</p>
<p>After doing this if you are check if the computer does not crash try to enable the device one by one and check out which device is causing the issue.</p>
<p>Also refer the below provided Microsoft KB article.<br />

Could this be a heating issue with the xbox that cause over heating which in turn cause damage to the disc? How can i begin to prove/disprove this hypothesis.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks :)</p>
