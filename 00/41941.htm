<p><span><span>Hello jlopicic715378,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I am glad to know that you were able to fix the issue by reinstalling Kaspersky.</span></span></p>

 that will automatically diagnose fix the issues related to Aero: </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the search box, type Troubleshooter, click Troubleshooting, and then, under Appearance and Personalization, click
 Display Aero desktop effects.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi connieking1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that your cat has pressed the <strong>Windows, Ctrl, and C</strong> keys which have enabled the
<strong>color filter</strong> option in Ease of access. To undo this either press the
<strong>Windows, Ctrl and C</strong> keys again to disable the color filter or follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows and I</strong> keys simultaneously to open <strong>
Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Ease of Access</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Color &amp; high contrast</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Apply color filter</strong>, click on the slider to turn it on or off.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if this answers your question.</p>

    <title>Unable to scan files to folder from my network printer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ben90ch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to scan files to folder from my network printer</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need some help. I have a very frustrating issue at hand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically I was able to scan files to my shared folder on my laptop, using my network printer, 2-3 months ago. Recently I am unable to scan anything to my shared folder from the same network printer. No settings has been changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried:</p>
<ol>
<li>Re-sharing my folder to "Everybody" with "Read/Write" permissions</li><li>Re-installing my network printer on my laptop</li><li>Configure the same advanced sharing settings as the other laptops in the network</li><li>Turned off Firewall</li><li>Reset my network on my laptop (With the help of Microsoft chat support)</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm able to connect to other laptop's shared folder through the network, but others can't see my laptop/shared folder on the network.</li><li>Tried on 2 network printers at 2 different places of work. Both not able to scan to my folder.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Update(5.41pm):</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded the port scanner by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Result:</p>
<ol>
<li>Port 445: Listening</li><li>Port 139: Not Listening</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I went to check my NetBIOS service if it's running. But it's not there in "Services".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p />

</p><p>I have gone to ricoh's site to download the printer driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able:</p>

<li>Print from my laptop</li><li>Scan to email from my printer</li><li>Etc.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I am not able to "Scan to Folder"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a screenshot of my findings from the Windows Troubleshooter:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/06292279-433a-47ba-b745-7f654d260497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/06292279-433a-47ba-b745-7f654d260497" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This, to me, implies the firewall is blocking the connection. However I went to check my firewall settings:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/13e522aa-d85e-4f24-9f4d-9d4056f3731f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/13e522aa-d85e-4f24-9f4d-9d4056f3731f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have no idea what is the problem.</p>

            Yes it is.&nbsp; If you do not have the scan software for the printer you can not scan to a folder.<br />
You may be able to scan and print without the software.

<h2>            key board not recognized by recovery disk</h2>
                    <p>No keyboards are not recognized by the windows 10 recovery disk. I have a Lenovo h415 desktop. When using the recovery CD, the mouse is recognized but the keyboard isn't. I have tried different keyboards in different usb slots and there is no ps2 port (as
 some listings have suggested using). I even used a mini wireless keyboard with a track pad and the track pad works but the keyboard doesn't. The keyboard driver in windows is "pluralinput keyboard 0.8.6". Is there a way to add this driver to the recovery CD.</p>

            <p>Thank You for your quick response</p>
<p>
</p><p>Requested Information:</p>
<p>1. Keyboard works in Bios and after Windows 10 loads.</p>
<p>2. There are no error codes.</p>
<p>3. Computer model Lenovo h415 desktop.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Keyboard works in Bios and after Windows 10 loads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps tried per your instructions:tried</p>
<p>1. Tried 4 different keyboards (3 usb connection and 1 wireless) in many different usb ports and there is no PS/2 connection or I would have tried that.</p>
<p>2.The CD booted no problem until the keyboard became necessary (at the command prompt).</p>
<p>3. I'm not exactly sure what this request is but when windows boots there is no problem. this whole scenario is to see if the repair desk works before needed.</p>
<p>4. This gets back to my original question of how to add drivers to the "repair CD". The driver needed for the keyboard is pluralinput 8.6.0.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The CD I tried was made from Windows 10 release 10240. Made new repair disk this morning from Windows 10 release 10586 and the keyboard now works. I believe Microsoft fixed the problem with the new release and didn't send me the memo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also couldn't use the system restore that is on hard drive before because the keyboard didn't work there either, so couldn't enter password. This problem I checked today, also, and low and behold keyboard is now working there too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conclusion both problems solved.</p>
<p>Thank you for time.</p>

            Hi Kyle4083 ... so to make sure that you have tried this... First you will need to force your machine to get into the recovery screen.
<br />To do this boot up and wait for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle, when you see that press and hold power button to shut down.
<br />Boot up again and do the same thing by waiting for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle then shut down, power up for the 3rd time and you should get repair screen.
<br />Let it run.
<br />You will then get a screen with the Automatic Repair, select Troubleshoot - Advanced - Restore point... go back to a previous point.
<br />Have you tried that?       
        </p>

            Darn... okay the only solution i can suggest is to reset the PC.
<br />Try reset and keep files.
<br />It will wipe your apps but at least your data wont' get wiped.

            so you can not get into recovery?
<br />If not then you will need to find another machine to create a recovery disk to boot to and then i would suggest a restore point before  reset once you boot to recovery disk.
<br />See link..

            Hi Little_JonW, please try this:
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

<p>Thank you for your reply, good info, I shall keep. Actually I left it running for about 30mins with black screen and then with no prompt it came on !! I went through several options and decided to remove a few of my recent software upgrades including one
 for a hp printer that i am still using from the xp days but was upgraded to each new operating software and windows 10.</p>
<p>Guess what..as soon as i removed it. The pc started correctly.</p>
<p>So why i dont know, but i solved it..just took me all afternoon !!</p>
<p>I have since reinstalled the hp software withthe windiws 10 driver and software as before...All good. Thanks for your effort, really appreciated it. I will keep ur info just in case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards Jon.</p>

<h2>            Windows can&#39;t find printer, finds nonexistent printers</h2>
                    <p>Tried to set up new Surface Book today. That means adding a driver for my networked Xerox Phaser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It cannot find the Phaser but it does find an HP Officejet that doesn't exist. Yes, I've made sure I'm on the right network. And when I force Windows by directing it to the IP address of my Phaser, suddenly it works. . . but it also insists there is a HP
 somewhere in the house.</p>

</p><p>We suggest that you check if the HP Officejet is in the list under Settings:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click<strong> Windows key</strong> and then select the <strong>Gear</strong> Icon or
<strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Devices</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Printers &amp; scanners</strong> look if <strong>HP Officejet</strong> is in the list.</li><li>If yes, you can click <strong>Remove device</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>And while you are on <strong>Devices</strong> window, you can also try to check if the
<strong>Xerox Phaser</strong> is in the list and click <strong>Set as default</strong>.</p>

<p>
</p><p>But every single time I search for printers I see DIRECT-47-HP OfficeJet Pro 8710 which I don't have and which is not attached to my network. I do NOT see Xerox Phaser 6180N, which I DO have and which IS attached to my network.</p>

    <title>how to prevent typecover from disabling when screen folded back - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jwsmith100  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to prevent typecover from disabling when screen folded back</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible to prevent the typecover keyboard from being disabled when the screen is folded back in tablet mode. I know this goes against what is designed, however I have a client who wishes to plug the Surface into an external monitor and use the typecover
 keyboard to type on. &nbsp;(He does not want to use an external keyboard via USB connection) &nbsp;I notice in another thread that someone had their Surface doing exactly this - their typecover was not disabled when they flipped the screen back so I know this must be
 possible - maybe a soft switch in hardware setup? &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your question! I appreciate you taking the time to ask us whether it's possible to still use your Type Cover when the Cover is folded back while the device is connected to an external monitor.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please clarify which Surface device and Type Cover you or your client uses? There are Surface 2, RT, Pro, Pro 2, and Pro 3. For the Type Cover there are 1 (original) and 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">There are a few options for you to use the Type Cover:</span></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Use the Cover as designed. (Surface is standing up, the Cover is unfolded, as you would in your normal use)<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Fold the kickstand, and lay the screen flat facing up (if you choose this option, please be careful with overheating as the device has nowhere to release the air)<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Use a Bluetooth adapter so that the Cover can still function while it's detached to the device</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately since the keyboard will stop working once the it is flipped back, I would suggest choosing one of the options listed above.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

<h3> jenmmay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 Feedback and Comments</h2>
                    <p>I'm new to this board as I am... &nbsp; errrr&nbsp; was a diehard&nbsp; Win 8.1 user&nbsp; so I posted on those boards.&nbsp; I swore I wouldn't upgrade to Win 10 as I happen to be one of 'those' people who like Win 8.1, using keys for smilies (not emoji's)&nbsp; and really wants 'select
 all' back in the right click in Word. But as it happens my battery went out on my Laptop and I had to take it completely apart and put it back together again.&nbsp; I decided to do a clean install on my 8.1 as I have done many a time,&nbsp; and after loading it wanted
 my key.&nbsp; I put in my key, nope didn't like that.&nbsp; Since my laptop came with Windows preinstalled it's stored in the BIOS no more little tags on back of computer.&nbsp; So I decide I'll use a handy dandy key program and presto.&nbsp; But because I had removed the battery,
 yes you guessed it I lost previous information.&nbsp; Which brings me here.&nbsp; You can no longer get a 8.1 key anywhere, you are pretty much pushed to upgrade.&nbsp; I happened to have bought Win 10 awhile back so I took the plunge.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first it's OK, and I push forward.&nbsp; There are lots of changes and of course I'm willing to change, but I didn't' want my default folder to be user.&nbsp; Its Jen, its always been Jen.&nbsp; It took me trying 20 different suggestion before happening upon one that
 works.&nbsp; There's lots of advice and if it were simply right click on folder and rename, Id have done that.&nbsp; 17 of the informative posts said just that.&nbsp; Next, when setting up windows, you are asked to pick your preferences etc.&nbsp; As I always do, I selected let
 me choose when to update Win.&nbsp; As I live in a itty bitty little teeny town in MT there inst a lot of bandwidth, so I update at night when everyone is asleep. (yes I know about metered)&nbsp; So I select let me choose, and 4 times over the next 2 days it's updating
 during the day when i need access to the computer.&nbsp; I check my setting great.&nbsp; Starts updating again the next day, so I look in the forums and it clearly is stated by many that the user in Win 10 home can't&nbsp; control the updater any longer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's my issue.&nbsp; It just shouldn't be so difficult to do <em>anything and everything</em> , especially the smaller stuff.&nbsp; AND if you give me a choice and selection to make a decision on updater, then your program just ignores the selection... THEN WHY
 give me the choice.&nbsp; Wouldn't it be easier and frankly more honest not to mention a lot less calls to the call center , to just say, we took that selection from the average user etc etc&nbsp; Even though some of us know a little bit.&nbsp; And why when I try to do a
 work around is gpedit now gone from Win 10 home too, only available on Pro.&nbsp; So its frustrating.&nbsp;&nbsp; I find the putting the choice there and then ignoring it a lot problematic.&nbsp; So those are this persons thoughts so far.&nbsp; I won't come back and whine, but I had
 to say something about the updater at least.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now heading out to learn anew and make this work.&nbsp; Thanks for listening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jen</p>

<p>No quoting selection&lt;???&gt; this time... Oh well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I name my user folders as part of a "clean" system install.</p>
<p>They (OOBE) take "some of" the first letters used to name the user.</p>
<p>(I see that because my main (OOBE) admin-user is truncated.)</p>
<p>Example: user = " suppo "</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later, adding users goes better. (Longer names allowed.)</p>
<p>Example: user =&nbsp; &nbsp; " Rick-StandardUser "</p>
<p>Note "This" name included the description of the account type.&nbsp;&nbsp;(manually typed)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those names ORIGINALLY get hard coded into the OS and registry and it is VERY hazardous to<br />
go in "filemanager" and change them manually on a whim....</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLUS/but, IF changed "correctly", (the MS way), the folder name always seemed to stay the</p>
<p>same and the "friendly or logical" name "sticks" and is/was visible most places a normal</p>
<p>user would see it... (Techs will see the "old" name some places...)</p>
<p>Note: Since I set up the names originally and NEVER change them any more, this might be different now...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above possibly has nothing&lt;???&gt; to do with the actual hidden superuser root admin...</p>
<p>(Yes, I'm still talking about Windows.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Extra point:&nbsp; I always have two user-admins in case one gets corrupted... (In addition to the</p>
<p>hidden the superuser-admin.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dizzy yet? &lt;grin&gt;</p>

<p><em>"So here's my issue. It just shouldn't be so difficult to do anything and everything, especially the smaller stuff."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>It isn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First let me say that I was a huge fan of Windows 8.1. I thought it was the best version of Windows ever. Still do. But eventually I replaced it with Windows 10 and here's why: Like it or not, technology does not stand still. On the contrary, it moves very
 quickly, which is due in no small part to the 'release first, fix later' approach that rules the industry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft didn't invent this. It has to respond to the same market pressures as everyone else or get left behind. I don't want to be left behind either, so now I have Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About your point above: I've taught myself a great deal about computers - usually by doing things the wrong way and finding out later - and I've learned many lessons. I'm going to share one of the most valuable lessons I have learned:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>There is nothing intuitive about operating a computer.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless of whose operating system is on it, a computer does not work the way you and I think it
<em>should</em> work. It works the way it was coded to work, or to be less technical, it works the way it was designed to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you and I don't agree with the design. Maybe you and I think the design is, in many ways,&nbsp;<em>stupid</em>. It's fine to express an opinion - it's a free country. But we will get nowhere fast (if we're lucky) or into a big mess (if we're not) by working
 against Windows' design.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the keys to my success with computers is that I study how to do something before I try it. That's how I learn how it really works vs. the way I think it's supposed to work. I ask questions first and shoot later. That's why things seem simple to me
 when other people find them so hard.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Pro version 1607 Updates KB3211320, KB3214628, and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marcia sanford  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro version 1607 Updates KB3211320, KB3214628, and unidentified Feature Updates Causing numerous issues.</h2>
                    <p>After 6 of my Windows 10 machines auto updated (I have deferred upgrades; and unless I am mistaken there is no official way to turn off automatic updating in Windows 10, nor is there a straightforward way to disable Windows Update altogether)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After Windows updated I experienced the follow issues:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Default applications are changed. </p>
<p>Examples:.PDF files are changed from Adobe back to Microsoft Edge</p>
<p>Web browser default goes to Microsoft Edge</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Display issues with Dual Monitors</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. IE will no longer store passwords even thought the settings are correct and you are prompted to save password info for that site</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. SAGE100 PDF converter breaks.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Users can no longer send electronically through paperless office in SAGE100.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The fix is to uninstall the SAGE
 PDF Converter and then reinstall it on the affected PC using an admins credentials. You have to uninstall and reinstall using the pl_advancedoptions_ui menu.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Microsoft Office programs lock up and become unresponsive i.e. Excel and Outlook. (using office 365 installed on client machines-not the web version)</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Loosing saved wifi connections</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Start menu and Taskbar configurations are altered. So have been removed completely, other have just one or two applications missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Not saving the selected default printer</p>
<p>
</p><p>When managing multiple clients without the added benefit of WSUS or equivalent, it becomes very difficult to deal with constant break fix issues after a windows update. As an administrator we really need the ability to shut off windows updates on an individual
 PC level. This way we can manage the issues by selecting a few users who act as a beta group that receive the updates. Than way when something breaks we don't have multiple users affected all at once.</p>

            <p>I was posting the issues based on a suggestion from another thread, not necessarily needing a resolution for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the info on WUFB, definitely worth considering after having so many issues. I was a bit deterred from using it because of it limitations on controlling the updates. It might seem like a adequate amount of time for most, but in my case when
 you are a one person IT shop 30 and 60 days sometimes isn't long enough. But it might be a viable option; I wonder if you can repeat a pause?</p>

            <p>I had two systems I was tasked with trying to fix after this update, one personal and one business.&nbsp; The personal machine was easy, I removed the nVidia video card and resorted to standard VGA allowing me to use the machine.&nbsp; I then downloaded the latest
 driver for the quattro 5000, did a system restore.&nbsp; On reboot, I powered the system down completely, reinstalled the video card, on boot immediately before the update reinstalled, I installed the latest driver and it was recovered.&nbsp; The business machine wasn't
 so lucky, the video card is the built in Intel HD 530 with two HDMI ports out.&nbsp; I tried the system restore, but it failed because of McAfee and is no longer an option, I had to disable the video driver allowing for basically a standard VGA mode losing the
 ability to use dual monitors or have quality HDMI display.&nbsp; I would love to find a solution to
<span>
remove KB3211320 at least long enough to install a more current driver which might not be the case because every driver I tried to install directly from Intel kept failing saying my processor was not supported.&nbsp; This is a native windows 10 machine not upgraded,
 except by Microsoft and their constant failing updates.&nbsp; To have to run third party software make adjustment to group policies and spend hours learning how to stop their untested and failing software is a drain on IT resources, businesses are losing hundreds
 and thousand of dollars to this failing, lousy operating system.&nbsp; It is worse then the original 98, ME and Vista combined.&nbsp; HOW CAN I REMOVE
</span><span>KB3211320 manually and restore this system without the business incurring thousands of dollars in expenses, including buying a new computer and hours of installation
 and configuration time to get it functional again.</span></p>

<p>I am so glad that you don't have any issues. Thank you for pointing out that this information has been available for quite some time. That is helpful feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may come as a shock to you, but there are some businesses out there that chronically run well behind the current operating systems and just do there best to stay as up to date as possible, and fiscally able to. You should know that in a lot of cases the
 IT person wears numerous hats and will find it very difficult to be up to date on all this information that "has been available for quite some time".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forgive me for thinking that this community was for helping and leaning from others issues;problems;or resolutions. This is only the second time I have ever posted a thread but I have read many in search of solutions. I was always offput by how many people
 choose to respond using such a "Holier than thou" attitude in their posts. I should have known better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You showed me....I'm so dumb...You're so smart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you could think it through first before you post snarky and condescending replys; and take a step back and think about the little people that are doing there best and are just looking for a little guidance. After all I am sure you did not come out
 of the womb as an IT genius.</p>

            <p>I hear things like what you have posted here, very often, in my own organization, when reviewing recordings of exit interviews. I read things like what you have posted here, very often, in forensic reports concerning well publicized technology breaches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The increase in the number of IT professionals (you do get paid to perform) that do not exhibit the personal responsibility and integrity to care for their own continuing education, is disheartening. Over the past four decades, IT has presented itself as
 an industry with the integrity to be self policing. It seems that there may now be reason for more invasive legislation to better ensure the coherence of what has become a core competency requirement for every industry on the planet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, I "did not come out of the womb as an IT genius." I paid dearly in both time and money for my education. I spend many hours each month to ensure the current validity of my education. The investment has been very worthwhile. You may want to do the same.</p>

            The system is an HP Envy Desktop 750-114.&nbsp; Purchase date was 11/15.&nbsp; The only change made to the system from factory specs is it was upgraded to Windows 10 pro.&nbsp; I tried many different scenarios to attempt getting the video back on two screens including
 disabling the Samsung Monitor drivers, When I disabled the video driver I am able to use one monitor.&nbsp; I then connected an HDMI TV and enabled the video driver that worked, so I connected a second HDMI TV and again no video.&nbsp; The business is now purchasing
 a different brand of computer, that doesn't have integrated video.&nbsp; I will apply the group policies stopping any updates to any of the drivers on the new system.&nbsp; I will implement deferring windows updates on the new system.&nbsp; After I migrate the business data
 and programming to the new system I will attempt a clean installation of Windows 10 restoring the old computer to its native environment of Windows 10 Home and transferring the purchased Windows 10 Pro to the new system.&nbsp; The business has suffered a&nbsp; financial
 outlay because of this.&nbsp; $400.00 in IT costs, two days without their system and $1050 for a new system.&nbsp; I also question why McAfee Internet Security would not only stop a system restore from working and completely removing the system restore from the the
 system.&nbsp; Also why would MS release an update that can not be uninstalled through conventional means.&nbsp; It really did and does cause more problems, because the computer is now stuck with it and the problems that it created without any recourse other then either
 doing a system refresh or clean installation?<br />

            <p>Srfreeman</p>
<p>I have to agree with Marcia Sanford, though I appreciate the information about
<strong>WUFB</strong> as I was unaware of it before now, it is truly because I live in a small community, that many YES many people are still running XP and Vista.&nbsp; Businesses are small local businesses that don't know the difference between a Home and Pro
 version.&nbsp; Many of them going to the only store in town that sells computers and buying one.&nbsp; What do you think you get when you buy a computer from Walmart?&nbsp; Since Windows 10 has released, I've only had about 10 Native Windows 10 machines come into my shop
 mostly for data transfers.&nbsp; Over 80% of the systems I get in are Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have paid dearly as well for my education, I worked for the big companies and even worked on the Microsoft Campus in Redmond managing HP RnD labs for the Officejet and Deskjet divisions.&nbsp; I'm a certified beta tester, and I have worked on some really big
 projects like the senior test lead for the web portal supporting MS international sales team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was fun but very taxing and destroyed my marriage.&nbsp; I love the slow moving non stress pace of a small community.&nbsp; But I also have to realize that I'm not on the cutting edge of technologies anymore.&nbsp; I have more then enough work to keep me busy and I
 make decent monies doing so.&nbsp; The biggest problem is that because it is a small community, people talk, I am the go to person, having created a name for myself.&nbsp; It becomes difficult to have to charge people high rates to fix something they didn't cause, not
 because I don't like the monies ( I DO ) but because these people are also friends, people I see every so often, have dinner with or drinks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Working in a small shop I see all kinds of issues, but when a release such as this is causing so many issues, it takes me away from my shop.&nbsp; I've got 6 hours on an onsite trying to fix this issue.&nbsp; that is almost an entire day away from the shop where I
 could be working on 10 machines at a time instead of just one.&nbsp; At one point I brought the machine to the shop to test some things, it boot straight to a generic monitor so I thought it was working just fine.&nbsp; During that time at the shop I stopped and changed
 a fan in laptop for a person that travels and was only in town for a day or so.&nbsp; And I fixed the other Windows 10 machine that had come in with the same issue.&nbsp; Started updates on 3 windows 7 machines, and started taking the digitizer off of another.&nbsp; I found
 answers to a storage system for a security system I'm installing at the local gas station, and worked with a company to get another 10% off on the cameras.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many of us do not have time to sit and learn all the ins and outs of new technologies until we are presented with the issue, we learn as we go because the technology around us is what we have to work with.</p>

            <p>That is because the Xbox One uses a different file system format than the PC. If you need to use the drive on the PC again (and NOT use it on the Xbox One), you can use the drive management console, to erase the drive's partitions, and re-format it to NTFS again (erasing all content on the drive).</p><p>In order to get to the drive management, open up an Explorer window, and (depending on your Windows Version) right click on "My Computer" or "This PC", and in the context menu choose "Manage". Confirm the UAC prompt, and then go to the drive management console.</p><p>Find the USB drive, and delete the partitions on it. Be careful to double check that you are doing that on the correct drive. Then create a new partition and format that for NTFS to be able to use the drive on the PC again.<br /></p><p>You can't use the drive for Xbox One storage and PC at the same time. <br /></p>

                    <p>* Original Title: M/S Store</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I uninstall M/S Store in Windows 10? I have no use for it. I'm using Windows 7 pro on my main computer that I use for work and I don't need or want the store or cloud on my work computer. Will there be a way to uninstall both apps? I have several laptops
 with Windows 8.1 and know how to turn off apps but can't find a way to shut down the M/S Store app or the cloud app. I only use a local account on all my computers. &nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no option to uninstall the Microsoft Store on Windows 10 or&nbsp;pervious Windows&nbsp;8/8.1. You can simply ignore these built in&nbsp;apps if you are not using them.

    <title>Very slow downloading speed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> badfish grove  say:</h3>
<h2>            Very slow downloading speed</h2>
                    
<p>It's taking around 3-4 days of constant downloading to get any full game downloaded, This is definitely not right.</p>

<p>Under the 'detailed network statistics' I'm getting between 25-35mb/s download speed and a steady 20mb/s upload speed. However the 'content usage' is always between 50kb/s-750kb/s along with the 3-4 day download times, I think it's safe to say something
 isn't working. Any ideas?</p>

<p>So far</p>
<p>I've reset everything several times</p>
<p>Updated everything possible</p>
<p>Disabled any/all firewalls</p>
<p>Set my xbox up in the DMZ anyways</p>
<p>and plugged it into the modem</p>

<p>No changes whatsoever, My modem can broadcast in three separate frequencies as well, all of which seem to have the same issues.</p>

<p>Anyone else had this issue before?</p>

<p>For a faster download you should now how the xbox live network works.</p>
<p>It delivers the content (downloads) over akami Servers. Your DNS Server is responisble wher you connect.</p>
<p>I would try to use an alternate DNS Server for your xbox.</p>
<p>The best would be openDNS or google DNS. If open DNS has Servers in your country I would use them instead of google. You can set it in Network Settings for your xbox so only your xbox uses the new DNS Servers.</p>
<p>IP:</p>
<p>208.67.222.222</p>
<p>208.67.220.220</p>
<p>www.opendns.com/.../opendns-ip-addresses</p>
<p>www.opendns.com/data-center-locations</p>
<p>Since I changed to open DNS all things on my xbox one are much faster - also the Dahboard (I don't know why....)</p>

<p>I had a breakthrough with the slow download speeds I was battling with since I connected my external hard drive, I seem to have fixed the issue. &nbsp;Before I got my new hard drive I could install digital games super fast, download times were great, then after
 installing my new external drive, I couldnt download and install a 400 mb game in under an hour (used to be 2 min). &nbsp;After struggling with this for the past few days, it dawned on me, I rested my new external drive on the top left hand corner of my Xbox one
 system, maybe that was interfering with the Internet connection to the Xbox one system itself. &nbsp;I moved the drive off of the system, to the side of the system and the download immediately sped up. &nbsp;Now after 10 min, I am 10% through a 40 gb game download that
 took all night to get to 15% yesterday. &nbsp;It may be that most people who have an issue with the Xbox one downloading speed may have electronic devices too near the system, causing interference. &nbsp;It fixed my problem, so I hope this message reaches others and
 helps them with their painful download speeds! &nbsp;And if this isn't news to anyone, I apologize, but I didn't find this answer anywhere else when I was searching.</p>

<p>This is 1000000000% microsoft's fault. After EXTENSIVE testing on my network and friends, this i definitely microsoft's fail to provide adequate bandwidth or server power to it's user base. I have a 150mb down connection. So If I download a game on steam
 to my pc, it's downloads at 18mb/s (150mbs/sec). On xbox, im lucky to get a 1-2mb/sec connection. A 700mb update to a game should take under a minute, but instead takes over an hour. I have been doing multiple tests of downloads. Including Steam, various bittorrents
 and usenets. This is definitely a Microsoft server/bandwidth issue. A company that can afford all the bandwidth it wants/needs is lying to you.</p>

<p>Do what Rozilla said.</p>
<p>Change the DNS. It does work.</p>
<p>I agree there is a problem with available bandwidth in some of the xbox servers particularly in the UK.</p>
<p>Changing the DNS can force you to connect to a different and hopefully faster server.</p>
<p>Using OpenDNS works for me. </p>

<h2>            Kodak Printer Won&#39;t Print After Major Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer at my workplace updated on Thursday. &nbsp;It installed the Creative update that gets rid of Paint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the update I have been unable to print. &nbsp;It says Printing Error and nothing else. &nbsp;I can scan and tell the printer to print a test page, from the computer, but not print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried reinstalling the software/driver, but didn't help, also tried in compatibility mode (Windows 7), again no help. &nbsp;Also tried manually installing it via the older model printer feature, but the green bar just keep scrolling and never seems to
 finish installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need this sorting because the printer is required for the business to run (send parcels etc).<br />
</p>
<p>Computer is a Compaq CQ230EA, running Windows 10 Home, Version 1703, OS Build 15063.483.<br />
</p>
<p>Printer is a Kodak ESP 1.2.<br />
</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
Since your PC updated, have you checked your printer manufacturer's website if it still supports the
<strong>Windows Creators Update</strong> version? Make sure that the driver is specifically compatible with the
<strong>Creators Update</strong>.<br />
<br />
To make sure that you're not experiencing an account specific issue, kindly <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/instantanswers/5de907f1-f8ba-4fd9-a89d-efd23fee918c/create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create another administrator account</a></strong> and observe if the
 issue will still be present.<br />
<br />
Let's see if any application is causing the issue. <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clean Boot</a></strong> helps eliminate software conflicts that occur

<strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</em><br />
<br />
Oh, by the way, is your printer a corded or a Bluetooth printer?<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.<br />

<p>There is only one driver available on the Kodak website and as I said previously the printer has worked on all the other previous versions of Windows, it is this Creators update which has screwed things up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is already an administrators account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try that tomorrow and will let you know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's connected by USB.</p>

    <title>Minecraft command blocks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a spartoi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Minecraft command blocks</h2>
                    <p>I sort of have two questions about the same subject.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorta new to the command block thing on minecraft bedrock because I now just moved from Xbox 360 and I been working on a adventure map for 8 months. I have noticed that some of the commands that JAVA players use don't work on bedrock. Is this true or
 am I messing something up?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My 2nd question is very complex. My adventure map is like a dungeon crawler map and I want to make it if you are playing multiplayer and you die,you are in spectate mode where you were killed and you cant spawn in until your teammates are away from any enemies
 20 blocks away. And once they are, there will be 15 second delay until you can spawn back. If all players die within the given time frame.. .game over. So it is sort of like halo campaign multiplayer if you know what I am talking about. If anyone knows how
 to do this or can answer my previous question, iIwould gladly appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Maybe try and look up a command block tutorial for timers and player effects on YouTube, I'm sure there are plenty.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your first question though. Java and Bedrock are actually two different but very similar game clients. Bedrock is more or less the vanilla version, its basically the one Microsoft "owns" and pushes. Its, to be blunt, the Windows 10 version. Java
 is the one everyone who makes Minecraft videos use. Its interfaces with mods and stuff are more friendly and easier to work as well as it receives updates and snapshots first (not always but a lot of the time) before W10 and console. The likely explanation
 for why you can do those commands on Bedrock is simply because Java is basically a different running version of Minecraft, if that makes sense?</p>

            For all questions Minecraft I go to AntVenom on YouTube. But yea, also, Java and Bedrock are the same game but they aren't. The differences are small... but they are there. Java is like a PC legacy kind of thing.&nbsp;

<p>Java and Bedrock uses 2 different gaming code engines. They look similiar in gameplay but the code is completly different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which means that commands that work on Java wont work on Bedrock and vice versa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is some youtube videos on command blocks for Bedrock. Just need to look for them.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            I have some issues while moving from Windows 10 to Windows 7.</h2>
                    <p>&lt;Original Title: Moving from Windows 10 to Windows 7&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had Windows 10 for a long time, and things are just not working out for me. I want to go back to Windows 7. I have the installation disc, and I tried to go back, but I was disallowed. I don't remember what the exact error message was, but I took a screen
 capture of a dialogue that popped up when I booted to the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bd50dcae-f403-4aef-b4e9-60c29553b2f4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bd50dcae-f403-4aef-b4e9-60c29553b2f4" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And so I checked my compatibility, and I was recommended to install a custom installation of a 64-bit version of Windows 7. That's exactly what I did originally. When I tried to go through the installation process again, I instead tried the other option.
 When I did, I got this error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6e115880-3446-497c-a1c0-5eda21399533" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6e115880-3446-497c-a1c0-5eda21399533" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It says that it can create a new copy of Windows 7 instead of an upgrade, but there is no option to proceed. Am I stuck with Windows 10? I want it off my computer for good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help me with this?</p>

            I wasn't able to transfer all that information onto a blank disc. There wasn't enough space. But even still, I tried running the setup of that download you linked me to, and the same thing happened. On the bootup, I had two options; Setup Windows or Windows
 10. If I went to Setup Windows, I was told that there was malicious software installed and I wasn't able to proceed. But that can't be right. My computer is at the best of performance. I had to go to Windows 10 since I wasn't able to move forward with the
 other option.
