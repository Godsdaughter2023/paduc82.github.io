            <p>Thank you. Yes I have tried some of the suggestions, I will try with a second computer later this week.</p>
<p>When I plug the Kobo (device) in, the kobo says it is connected, when I look in computer the Camera part (Arc)&nbsp;is listed. It works&nbsp;as I have moved photos. when I switch to media, Arc goes, so I I am unable to load music.&nbsp; When I have tried to&nbsp;troubleshoot,
 the message I get is: - Driver for the arc is not installed, install the latest driver for the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            <p>Dear Sandeep</p>
<p>All sorted now, I have just re plugged in the Kobo and did a troubleshoot scan, and guess what,
</p>
<p>it works on both the Camera and the Media settings.</p>
<p>Listen, have a great week. THANK YOU</p>

            <p>&nbsp;I still have been trying to solve and resolve this problem. When I first received my Kobo Arc tablet, it worked like a charm when I connected it to any USB port, and I could transfer files back and forth to my heart's content. Then one day, it just stopped
 being recognized after I plugged it into a USB port and going to Start/My Computer and then seeing it listed as a storage device as it had been. I started getting the famous MTP errors to which no one including Kobo nor Microsoft can answer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have tried every trick in the book and then some. I followed the instructions given here to the letter, I get the little yellow caution sign next to both MTP and WPD drivers in my device manager. Anytime I search for a new driver, it just tells me I have
 the most current driver installed, even after I have uninstalled it. That being somewhat confusing prompted me to run a battery of virus programs, use some registry cleaning software. Then spending about a week doing a manual read of my registry. I have run
 malware programs, and corruption detection software and I am still baffled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have put enough pressure on the technical staff at Kobo, but they just keep throwing the same generic troubleshooting processes at me.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am running a Gateway NV54 series laptop that came with OEM Windows 7 Home Premium. The only other laptop I have is an old Toshiba with Windows XP and it won't recognize my Kobo tablet either because it can't or like this one, it won't.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I wish there was an answer. I don't like to be told to upgrade or buy an new tablet because they have decided to stop shaking hands with each other. I can still send and receive things in a round about way through WIFI, emails, and clouding. That's not
 the point, the point is the whole MTP snafu and its assorted error codes that no one cares to be straight forward in resolving.

<h2>            Xbox One Game Download Codes</h2>
                    
<p>Hi NZ gamers!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have purchased a couple of Xbox One Consoles recently which came with some included new games &amp;&nbsp;downloadable game codes.&nbsp; As I already own these games, I'm hopeful that I could&nbsp;swap one of the following titles for another title&nbsp;that anyone else may have?&nbsp;
 The titles&nbsp;I have available are Fifa 16 (digital download code), Grand Theft Auto V (digital download code), Rare Replay &amp; Gears of War (double-pack retail discs), Forza Motorsport 6 (retail disc) &amp; Forza Horizon 2 10th Anniversary Edition (retail disc).</p>
<p>I am after Rise of the Tomb Raider or Fallout 4, possibly other digital code games also.&nbsp; I am only after digital download code versions (not discs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone is interested&nbsp;I will set up an auction through Trade Me to conduct such a trade.&nbsp; This forum purpose is just for&nbsp;discussion.&nbsp; Otherwise if anyone knows of a reliable site for trading games or games codes within NZ&nbsp;please let me&nbsp;know. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Thanks everyone.&nbsp; :)</p>

<h2>            Chinese Xbox One Changing the language</h2>
                    
<p>OK, so I live in China but I am English. I have recently brought an Xbox one and everything is in Chinese (my Chinese is crap). I have followed tutorials and xbox support has talked me through how to change the language but I only have Chinese and a language
 option and China as a country option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how do I change my xbox to English, an update? VPN?</p>
<p>Any help would be extremely&nbsp;appreciated</p>

                    <p>I have been trying to add an account using an email to my ASUS laptop but I get the message&nbsp;"We can't add a user to the device right now. It's probably our fault. Please try again." I waited a day and the message still showed up. I looked up a fix but it
 appears I am the only one experiencing this that would post a thread. Any way I can fix this?</p>

<p>Try adding the user as a Local Account in the 1st place (don't enter an email address).</p>
<p>
</p><p>That does not require any on-line process to actually create the account and then you can try converting it to a Microsoft Account afterwards.</p>

    <title>Canon LiDE 120 - Issues with Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> odings  say:</h3>
<h2>            Canon LiDE 120 - Issues with Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Good day everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having issues getting my Canon LiDE 120 scanner working with my Windows 8.1 (64bit) PC. I have tested the device using a Windows 7 PC and it worked fine there. I also know that several people have also got it working on Windows 8.1 devices so the issue
 must be with my PC. I would greatly appreciate any advice that will help me get the scanner to work on my PC as I really do not want to go through the hassle of another reset :(.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After contacting Canon support I was told that the issue lies with Windows, and not the scanner itself. Using my event log, they got this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Every occasion when you try to install or plug in the Scanner to this computer the Windows documents the source of the problem":</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The description for Event ID 123 from source Microsoft-Windows-DeviceSetupManager cannot be found. Either the component that raises this event is not installed on your local computer or the installation is corrupted. You can install or repair the component
 on the local computer.</li></ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The Issue</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply put, the PC seems to have trouble communicating with the scanner, with it often displaying error codes:
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">2, 156, 182, 55 and 77</span>. I have tried a number of different programs to scan my documents and pictures but the problem persists. Below are some examples of what happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>The scanner does not 'react' to my request to scan something (Via software or physical buttons on device)</li><li>The scanner 'warms up' and remains in this mode for a couple of minutes before displaying (some of) the errors above.</li><li>The scanner warms up, begins to scan and manages to scan anything up to (about) 90% of the scanning surface before failing and displaying the above errors again.</li></ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">What I have tried</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Installed accompanying software with the included 'Installation CD'.</li><li>Downloaded the entire content of the installation CD directly from the Canon website.</li><li>Downloaded the 'Driver' only via Canon</li><li>Plugged in the device to Windows and let it download the Driver on its own.</li><li>I have tried VueScan (Free), Windows Fax &amp; Scan, Scan (Windows 8.1 App).</li><li>Uninstalled all traces of previous scanner (A HP Scanner)</li><li>Used Revo Uninstaller after every uninstall&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>Thank you for your time, I look forward to your posts!</p>

            <p>Dear Amit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your post, my apologies for the late reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can confirm that a clean boot did nothing at all to help. I also made a fresh install of Windows 8.1 on my PC in the hopes that it would work but it still does not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so confused. How can it not work on a 8.1 PC but it works flawlessly on my Windows 7 PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely there must be a solution to this. I would greatly appreciate any help on this matter please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Windows Keeps Connecting to Wrong Ethernet Router</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>When I run Windows, it connects to the wrong router that is not configured for using the Internet. &nbsp;However when I connect using the Linux or Macintosh operating system, they both connect to the correctly configured router on the network. I am not using
 any network configuration files on the operating systems, just plug and play, however windows concerns me because hackers can exploit this vulnerability and snoop on this school's campus network.</p>
<p>Key: &lt;network&gt; - connection a, connection b, and so on</p>
<p>Internet - Router A</p>
<p>Router A - Router B (potential malicious router), Computer 1, 2, 3, and so on...</p>
<p>What configuration is Windows missing that Linux/Mac has? I mean literally anyone can just walk up to the network and plug in the said malicious router.</p>
<p>Thanks for any suggestions or help,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brian W. G.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Mail App Not Syncing my Outlook Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stankubis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mail App Not Syncing my Outlook Account</h2>
                    <p>I installed Win 10 on 3 PCs.&nbsp; The Mail app works on 2 PCs running Win 10 Home.&nbsp; The Mail app does not work on the PC running Win 10 Pro.&nbsp; Calendar and People, however work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I start mail and click on Settings / Accounts, I can see my Outlook account (I am registered in the PC with my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account).&nbsp; This is the same account I use on the other 2 PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on Change Mailbox &amp; Sync Settings I get a message - Oooops Something Went Wrong.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I try to change the settings using the drop downs on Download New Content and Download Email From, but when I click on the down arrow there are no selections shown, so the values in those fields are blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Mail Server name is pre-filled with the same one used on my other 2 PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can add my Gmail account and all of these fields work as designed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions for how to get this working?&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I decided to look at the MSFT email app registry settings on my three computers. The one running Win10 Pro is different than the two running Win10 Home - it has fewer entries (registry keys).&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 7 freezes at login screen</h2>
                    I have recently ran into a problem at the login screen. When I start up my laptop, everything freezes. If I boot into safe mode networking, it does the same thing. However, safe mode command prompt and regular safe mode works fine. So it's not a hardware
 issue. I have tried a system restore to a privious date, system repair with the DVD. I am a little lost, it might be something that is failing or the registry. Is there something I might be overlooking?

<h2>            Toshiba Satellite Touchscreen Not Responding</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my laptop to Windows 10 a while back and have noticed that my touchscreen function no longer works, after a frustrating period of searching and trying many fixes I have come to the end of my patience and need some help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the following:-</p>
<p>uninstalled and reinstalled the HID Human Compliant Touchscreen Device in Device Manager</p>
<p>Enabled and re-enabled the HID Human Compliant Touchscreen Driver</p>
<p>Installed an older version of the driver</p>
<p>Disabled the Graphics card and tried disabling and re-enabling the Touchscreen driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I attempt to reset or recalibrate the touchscreen, In Tablet PC Setting, the Reset button is greyed out, and when I try to recalibrate, the calibrating screen appears but will not accept any finger presses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Laptop is a Toshiba Satellite Radius 15 P50W C - 10E running Windows 10 Home 64 Bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any Help would be very greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>

            Hey JoeD,
<br />
<br />How old is the laptop? It sounds like to me the digitizer is on its way out, if nothing works on the software side, it could very well be a hardware issue and it needs special attention. You could send your laptop in for service with Toshiba or go to a third-party PC repair shop and see if they can replace the digitizer (or the layer of the display that accepts touches).
<br />
<br />All the best, good luck with your issue. Here's a link to Toshiba support: <a href="https://support.toshiba.com/repair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.toshiba.com/repair</a>

<p>Hi Ethan</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply, I think my laptop is 4 or 5 years old, maybe not worth wasting any money it and just get another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try the link you provided and see what happens there.</p>

    <title>Qube 2 wont start - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexanderharper  say:</h3>
<h2>            Qube 2 wont start</h2>
                    <p>I have an active xbox live gold subscription, last december I downloaded the game QUBE 2 as a part of my gold membership, I even played for a few hours. After a few weeks without playing, I tried to start the game and every time I try
 to open it, there is a message saying that "the person who acquired this needs an active subscription". I was the one who acquired and I have an active subscription. I reported my problem on xbox live and tried to contact the support on twitter but I had no
 response. Please, dont tell me to delete the game and install it again because I have tried it more than once. Also, I downloaded Celeste this month with Games with gold and I was able to play it (great game btw), Qube 2 is the only game I have problem with.
 Please help.</p>

            No, I did not. Even if I I was using another account by accident, I would not be able to download the game from the start because my account is the only one with gold on my xbox.

            <p>I found Risen to be pretty bland and boring. Amalur, the little I played of it, had a rich art style, a decent story (side quests were better), and a truly great combat system. The combat system truly helped make Amalur shine, as it was fluid and responsive. You reminded me to go back and revist that game. I'd suggest that over Risen 1, but you can always check out some Youtube videos to see if you can find which one you might like more.</p>

            I would wait a few days and check it again, it's likely just a glitch on the website, since it's showing different results for the date in two separate browsers. If it's still not correcting, I'd try to delete the key again, reboot you PC, then upload it again. You can also print out the key from the PC or back it up onto a USB drive, for peace of mind.

<h3> anthonycasorso  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t let me go back to Windows 7 after only 4 days</h2>
                    <p>I have had Windows 10 for only 4 days and I am not liking it at all. I went to the recovery settings and told it to go back to Windows 7. It tells me that the needed files have been deleted but I never deleted anything. The Windows.old directory is still
 there. Please help me get my old system back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I don't like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. No help unless you use Cortana.</p>
<p>2. Cortana forces you to use Bing, Microsoft account. Forces you to change PC login to a Microsoft account. Switch back to PC login and Cortana quits working.</p>
<p>3. Windows update doesn't allow you to choose updates any more. It just does it.</p>
<p>4. Huge list of privacy issues that are not clearly advertised.</p>
<p>5. I can't go back after 4 days after being told that I could.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel really stupid for trying this. I did it because it was free but something told me that you get what you pay for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might have given it a little more time but once I found out that I can't go back, I am going to find a way to go back and I'm never going to try it again.</p>
<p>

            Thanks! I got through but they needed to escalate it and wanted me to give them a time when they could call me back. My schedule is chaotic and I can't easily set up a time for to do that unless it is in the middle of the night. Looks like I am in trouble
 unless I can find a guaranteed time when I can sit and wait for a call in the next couple of weeks.&nbsp;

            <p>I was not suggesting that it would. I meant that I only had a few weeks to find time in my schedule where I can wait for a call. Longer than that and Windows 10 will delete the files I need to revert back to windows 7. The tech who looked at my issue last
 night saw that Windows.old was present and populated. He confirmed that the attempt to go back was unsuccessful with a message saying that files have been deleted. He also asked if W10 was installed with the free upgrade method and I confirmed that it came
 through the update process after signing up ahead of time for the upgrade. He checked to see that I was activated. After that, there wasn't anything he could do except escalate. Hard to believe that I am the only one who has run into this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to make a copy of Windows.old on my NAS but the directory can't be copied and the permissions can't be altered in any obvious way at least.</p>

            I can see why that had to be escalated. &nbsp;This kind of problem popping up is why Microsoft is using the notifications. &nbsp;It slows down the rush to Windows 10 so that Microsoft has a chance to fix such issues ahead of some of the next waves.

            <p>I found a thread about this on reddit yesterday and the problem appears to be related to using the media creation tool after you have done the upgrade. In my case I ran the media creation tool to make an install disk to use for future recovery. I ran the
 tool from my new windows 10 machine. Apparently this overwrites the ~BT folder which seems to be needed along with Windows.old to do the rollback. I don't know if the lost information can be recovered somehow. Hopefully, Microsoft will make a comment about
 it at some point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted the reddit link in a response to another person on this forum with the same problem. So it is recorded on here somewhere.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Computer randomly freezes minutes after startup, usb devices become unresponsive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Im using an Alienware x51 computer that is currently on Windows 10, BIOS A03</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a problem ive been living with for about a month or two where my computer will freeze on my desktop, causing my keyboard and mouse to become unresponsive (both have LED’s that helped me indicate wether they were powered or not).
</p>
<p>There is no BSoD to indicate that there was an error... so I restart the computer by holding down the power button until it turns off, and then i turn it back on. Sometimes it will give me a consistent singular beep, sometimes it doesnt and starts up normally
 working fine for the rest of the day until i turn it off and back on the next day.</p>
<p>I was attempting to troubleshoot this problem today in hopes of finally fixing it while i was running the Windows Memory Diagnostic it has once again frozen..&nbsp;</p>
<p>Normally I would restart the computer again but i dont want to cause any problems in case doing so while its frozen on the WMD Tool breaks something</p>
<p>
</p><p>omething to get it fixed.</p>

<p>today i called microsoft about it and they were able to help</p>
<p>1. download the update from a pc and put it into a usb stick thats 1gb+ and has nothing esle in it remeber to unzip and put it in though</p>
<p>2. put the usb into your xbox and it should detect the update and update by itself let it all run and you should be able to join xbox live after that
</p>
<p>appartently its because some isp doesnt let your xbox update on its own</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t wake from sleep, monitor won&#39;t turn back on</h2>
                    I recently put a new hard drive in my desktop PC and did a clean install of Windows 10 on it after having my old hard drive fail. &nbsp;I am having one huge issue with Windows 10 though, whenever my PC goes to sleep it will not wake up! I have to do a hard
 reset every time I want to use my PC. &nbsp;I thought I could get rid of the problem by going into power settings and changing "Go to sleep after" to "Never." &nbsp;I left "turn monitor off after" at 15 minutes. &nbsp;But Windows will still not wake up even with only the
 monitor turned off! &nbsp;I have no idea what to try now. &nbsp;I'm hard resetting my PC five to ten times a day, that's got to be killing it. &nbsp;Can anyone help?

                    I am trying to buy vc for nba 2k14 on Xbox one. When I try to download anything it says "change your account settings, your account doesn't have permission to purchase free or paid content, blah blah blah etc." I am a child account and my mom is the parent
 account, so I got her to sign in on her account and change my account to an adult account in settings, and also changed it to where I can buy anything. So I go back on 2k and get the same message even though my account is set up where I am supposed to be able
 to download anything. I signed out and tried it again, I restarted the xbox, nothing works. I have no idea how to fix this, it seems other people are having similar issues. Like I said, my account's birthdate is set as a child account, but my mom changed the
 privacy thing, or whatever it is, to adult so I should be able to buy anything. And also I do have $10 on my account so that isn't the problem. Anyone else having this problem? How can I fix this, can I change my account sett

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Free apps only</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Free or paid apps</p>
<p>To change the default setting for your child:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Press the Xbox button to return to the Home screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Press the Menu button and select Settings (or select Settings on the Home screen).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select the family member’s account whose settings you want to change, and then select Custom privacy template.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Change the Buy and download setting.</p>
<p>Hope you get back to gaming soon.</p>

<p>G'day Wamzainy, sorry to hear about the purchase issues! Have you tried to buy anything else with your account since the settings were changed? Can you buy and download any free content?

<p>This worked for me! On your parent's account change purchase settings to nothing. After the changes took place, change it back to Anything. It should le t you purchase then.</p>

<p>We are having the same problem at our house too and many others as well. &nbsp;It has been one week now and hours and hours of reserach and phone calls. &nbsp;Can't add my son to the family because it says he already belongs to another family. &nbsp;Have spent hours on
 the phone with Microsoft Support and have had two escalated cases. No one has an answer. &nbsp;There is an error code that appears and the search feature cannot find this code. &nbsp;Support doesn't know what it means either. &nbsp;Code is 0x80bd007. &nbsp;Microsoft should be
 able to dissociate the account (with Microsoft ID, gamertag and password) from any phantom family. &nbsp;Tried using the parental account on 360 to remove him from family and it's not showing up there either.&nbsp; They tell me to have my son start a new profile. &nbsp;We
 refuses since he has years of achievements under his gamertag and would rather go to PS4 than exercise this option. &nbsp;In addition to buying the One console, we have purchased BF4 Premium and COD Season Pass for $100. &nbsp;The money is in his account and he cannot
 use it.&nbsp;&nbsp;What a waste of time and money. &nbsp;I thought Microsoft was smarter than this. &nbsp;Please write if you have a solution.</p>

<p>thank you so much it worked perfectly. Just to clarify to everyone, switch to nothing, let the changes apply, then change back to anything and let those changes save. It worked for me and i have had this problem for months.</p>

    <title>Unable to share a child folder while sharing from the parent faolder - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to share a child folder while sharing from the parent faolder in windows</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
There are several child folders in parent folder on windows 8.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Times ago I shared some child folders and accessed them from from other devices without problems. Then I removed all child folders shares and instead shared their parent folder.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
During the parent folder sharing the window appeared listing some of the previous child shares and asking "some of the folders were previously shared. you can replace their current settings with the same setting you just applied to the folder you shared".</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
If I click change settings after processing for a while it ends up with "folder can not be shared".</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Despite the message the parent share folder is present in shares list and is accessible. However those few shares listed before and some others are not.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
There are no such windows with "previously shared folders message" displayed if I share from computer management or from command line, but the same problem persist.</p>
