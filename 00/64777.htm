<h2>            Disk controller Event 11 - can&#39;t identify failing disk</h2>
                    
<p>I'm recieving frequent error events stating in the system event log but can't match the error source \Device\Harddisk2\DR2 with an actual disk listed by the DiskManager. What steps should I take to identify what device the error is referring to? Is there
 a powershell query that could do the job?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

Open device manager</a></div>

<div>b. Expand disk drives</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>c. The second drive that you see in there is the harddisk2.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>d. Right click on it, select properties, go to volumes and click populate, you can see which drive letter is in the hard drive partition.</div>

<div>If your computer has TV tuner hardware installed, use the following steps to troubleshoot the error messages so Media Center can use the tuner driver. After each step,<strong>open Media Center and try to view or set up live TV.</strong> Continue using
 the steps until the error no longer displays and you can view television:<br />
1. If you are using a cable card and the computer is resuming from a sleep or standby mode, wait at least 20 seconds before starting any software that uses the tuner, including Windows Media Center.<br />
2. Restart the computer to resync the driver to Media Center:<br />
a. Click Start . <br />
b. Click the arrow on the toolbar, and then click Restart .<br />
c. Wait for Windows and all startup items to load before opening Windows Media Center.<br />
3. If you added a new tuner card, make sure the tuner card is compatible with Windows 7 Premium or Ultimate. Look for Certified for Windows 7 on the product packaging or go to the following Web site to check for compatibility:<br />
Microsoft Support: Windows 7 Hardware Compatibility List (in English)<br />
4. Change the Windows Media Center Receiver Service from a specific account name to a Local System account:<br />
a. Click <strong>Start</strong> , and type <strong>Administrative tools </strong>
in the Search box. Click Administrative tools in the search results.<br />
b. Double-click<strong> Services .<br />
c. </strong>Scroll down the<strong> Services</strong> list and find <strong>Windows Media Center Receiver Service</strong> . You might have to widen the<strong> Name</strong> column by clicking and dragging the right side of column title.<br />
d. Right-click <strong>Windows Media Center Receiver Service</strong> , and then click<strong>Properties.<br />
e. </strong>Click the <strong>Log On tab</strong> , and then select <strong>Local System account</strong> .<br />
f. Click<strong> Apply</strong> , and then click <strong>OK</strong> on the Services message.<br />
g. Restart the computer.<br />
h. Click<strong> OK</strong> again, and restart the computer.<br />

            Hi, sachindongarkar
<br />
<br />My name is Smith and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try entering Safe Mode to repair
<br />
<br />Turn off your computer; then, turn it on. 
<br />As soon as you see the Windows logo with the spinning dots, press and hold the power button until your computer turns off. Do this process twice.
<br />.-Turn on your computer for the third time, and let it load.
<br />.-You should get this message: Preparing Automatic Repair.
<br />.-On the next screen that would appear, click on Advanced Options.
<br />.-Select Troubleshoot.
<br />.-Go to Advanced Options.
<br />.-Click on Startup Repair.
<br />.-Wait for the repair to finish.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

            Hi Sachin
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous build of Windows
<br />If available, this will be the best option . .. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

<p>The April update kept failing on one of my computers.<span>&nbsp; </span>Here’s what I did to fix it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hide the April update and recheck for updates.</p>
<p>2.<span>&nbsp; </span>It now wanted to install the March update, which I tried.</p>
<p>3.<span>&nbsp; </span>That update also failed so I hid that one and checked for updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had to repeat these steps a few times.<span>&nbsp; </span>For me, the first update to successfully go through was the November 2016 update.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that, I restored the hidden updates and checked for updates again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Now there were 4 updates that I restored, but after checking for updates again, the only one it wanted to install was April’s.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This time, the update went through successfully and it doesn’t have any more important updates for me to install.<span>&nbsp;

<p><span><span>Hello DrSci,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To address your concern, kindly help us with the following queries:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>What is the make and model of the computer?
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Have you checked with the PC requirements before trying to install Windows 10?
</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Ideally, before upgrading your PC, it’s mandatory to check if the PC is compatible with Windows 10. To know if your PC is compatible, you may refer to an article on
</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028142/windows-10-system-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span>Windows 10 system requirements.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This particular error could occur due to games that use
<strong>anti-cheat software</strong>. If you have any such game installed on your machine, I would suggest you to remove it.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>However, if your PC is compatible, you may unplug all the external devices except keyboard and mouse and re-plug the USB drive to install Windows 10. Later, download
 the ISO file from the website </span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">here</span></a><span> and follow the instructions under ‘<strong>Using the tool to upgrade this PC to Windows 10</strong>’
 section and proceed with the installation. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Kindly help us with more information. Will be glad to assist you further.

            Hi Afzul.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If all you saw was the Recycle Bin then it may have started up into a Temporary Account because your account couldn't start.  In that case your files might be under C:\Users in your old account which might be slightly renamed.  Check there now.  
<br />
<br />If not then Your files should always be backed up because the hard drive can die at any time.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  
<br />
<br />Google Drive has a new Backup that allows you to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/download/backup-and-sync/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/dow...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can manually drag or copy them to another hard drive, USB external or flash drive.  
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />A better automated file backup to external disk is free Macrium which is the choice of the experts:
<br /><a href="http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/Backing+up+files+and+folders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/B...</a>
<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>

<br />Let us know if there's anything else.

<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks for replying.</p>
<p>Tried that it say "C:\Users\sonek\desktop\may2018 is unavailable, if the location is on the PC, make sure the device&nbsp; or drive is connected or the disc is inserted, and then try again, if the location is on a network, make sure you're connected to the network

            It's likely a fatal error but there are reports today that there are some solutions here if you can navigate to them:  <a href="https://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2018/05/solution-broken-windows-10-computer-after-april-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2018/05/soluti...</a>
<br />
<br />If not create the bootable media which is always the most stable method for repairs anyway, to try to Go back to Old Version. If it fails then you can try the Reset or use the media to Clean Install with our help. 
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then More Options, then Go back.  If that fails go back to Troubleshoot options to try Reset. 
<br />
<br />At any time you can also access via Advanced Troubleshoot Options the Command Prompt to try to rescue any files you don't have backed up properly.  Look under C:\Users or C:\windows.old.  Here's how to copy them out:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If all else fails proceed with the booted media to do the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br />
<br />Close out repairs and try Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I gave you in my two posts above every place possible to look for them.  Did you check in those places?  
<br />
<br />If so and they're gone then they must have been overwritten by a step which was given to you by the support agent.  Did you tell him/her that you needed your files protected? They should have been there somewhere in the locations I specified.  
<br />
<br />If they are gone now and not under C:\Users in any user account shown, or C:\windows.old, then I gave you priceless steps to avoid this in the future by backing up in the best ways possible.  If files are not backed up externally or to the cloud then they are valued as worthless.

            Hello xtramile,<br />
<br />
Thank&nbsp;you for posting your question to the Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
If you are interested in using a Themed Slide Show you can do so within Windows Photo Gallery.<br />
Review the link below on how to set up Themed Slide Shows. You’ll need to make sure that the video card in your Vista system supports the
<br />
Vertex Shader 2.0 feature and has a Windows Experience Index score of 3.0 in the Graphics category. If your video card doesn’t meet these<br />
specifications, then the Themes feature will be unavailable.<br />

<br />
This may not be exactly what you are talking about, but I don't know of a way to save the Slide Show from the Photos folder.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Thanks,

    <title>Use a different way to pay - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chyld989  say:</h3>
<h2>            Use a different way to pay</h2>
                    
<p>Anytime I try to purchase any games for the Xbox One (on the system or on xbox.com) I get the message "Use a different way to pay. &nbsp;Your purchase can't be completed with this payment option. &nbsp;Try a different or new way to pay."</p>
<p>I tried deleting and re-adding my credit cards (even though it's worked for years on my Xbox 360). &nbsp;I even tried linking my PayPal account to see if that would work, but nothing works. &nbsp;I don't have a 'different way to pay', but since I was planning on going
 all digital this just means I'm sitting here with nothing to play.</p>
<p>Any advice?</p>
<p><em>What are you trying to purchase? </em>&nbsp;Tried both Ryse and Assassin's Creed<br />
<em>What error code or message are you receiving (from the console)? &nbsp;</em>Use a different way to pay. &nbsp;Your purchase can't be completed with this payment option. &nbsp;Try a different or new way to pay.<br />
<em>What region is your account? &nbsp;</em>US<br />
<em>What region do you physically connect from? &nbsp;</em>US</p>

 doing. You will need to go to a game store and buy the prepaid currency cards and redeem them the cards online they come in $5,$10,$15,$25, and $50 cards. I hope this has help you have a great night.</strong></em></span></p>

<p>I don't live too close to any stores that sell the currency cards, so that isn't a very good option (not to mention it'd be a pain in the but to have to buy and redeem a half dozen of those). &nbsp;I called my bank and they said that nothing was wrong and they
 weren't blocking anything on their end.</p>

<p>Don't know if it's related but I can't remove a credit card from my account because there is an outstanding balance. Turns out a cancelled order for an XBOX one and then I reordered and the first order hasn't cleared out as cancelled...don't know if or why
 this would affect trying to pay with Microsoft Currency but we'll see. Microsoft can really use some help in simplifying there billing options...even the Microsoft store won't let you adjust or cancel orders online.</p>

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div>Thank you for the reply.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>You can uninstall Net Framework 3.5 from the computer and then install Net Framework 4.0.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>However, I'd suggest you reconsider on uninstalling Net Framework 3.5. The reason being, there can be applications that will specifically require Net Framework 3.5 to work correctly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;
<div>You can refer to the link to uninstall .Net Framework 3.5 completely using .NET Framework cleanup tool:</div>
<div><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2008/08/28/8904493.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2008/08/28/8904493.aspx</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can then install .Net Framework 4.0 on the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Feel free to contact us if you have any other Windows related issue and we would be glad to assist you.</div>

    <title>exFAT on microSD card corrupting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> symbiatch  say:</h3>
<h2>            exFAT on microSD card corrupting</h2>
                    I have Surface RT 32GB and I bought a 64GB SD card for it. The file system is exFAT and it gets easily corrupted. I think I've narrowed down when it happens (it has happened five times already).<br />
<br />
I start copying files from the network onto the card. If Surface goes to sleep in the middle and I wake it up later, the filesystem is corrupt. And it's really corrupt. I run chkdsk, it claims that there are errors and it fixes them. The errors are in folders
 like "A\B\C\D\(102)" even though the folders A, B, C and D are siblings, not inside each other. Naturally FOUND.00x folders contain files ranging from 10 megs to 2 gigs (the files copied are all 10-30MB, so it just jumbles them together).<br />
<br />
After running chkdsk and it claiming everything to be in order, I cannot use the card. Every file I copy onto it will cause corruption and the files will not work. So I have to reformat the whole drive.<br />
<br />
The card is also in a corrupted state even if I run chkdsk on Windows 8.1 on a "real" PC. If I copy files onto it on this PC, they still get corrupted. So there's probably something wrong in the whole exFAT implementation, or chkdsk, if the errors happen this
 easily and can't be corrected without reformat. I might even get a persistent "An error occurred while examining files and directories" even though chkdsk says it performed corrections.<br />
<br />
I do not believe the SD card to be faulty, I ran a full slow format and got no errors, I can use it perfectly as long as the Surface RT doesn't go to sleep while using the device.<br />
<br />
Anyone else seen this? I can't find anything on the net, can it just be me or some fluke with the card? I think I'll switch to NTFS and see if that helps. Once again copy the files off and back onto the card...<br />

<p>Sorry to hear you are having trouble with Surface RT and transferring files on an SD card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you get the same results if you keep Surface awake through the whole process?&nbsp; Have you tried different cards?&nbsp; How about USB storage?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 - Driver Verifier catastrophe - how to return to bootable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bmelloni  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - Driver Verifier catastrophe - how to return to bootable state&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was having minor bluetooth driver issues and I followed the advice to setup Driver Verifier to discover what the issue was. &nbsp;That is where the problems started:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Now every every boot fails because of a DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION.</li><li>I tried to reconfigure driver verifier so that it would not check anything... the error still happens at boot.</li><li>I tried to completely remove driver verifier with a command prompt command I googled... the error still happens at boot.</li><li>I tried several repair options from the boot failure menu... all fail.</li><li>Frustrated I made bootable media for Windows 10 hoping for the Repair option like in prior versions of Windows. &nbsp;It doesn't exist. &nbsp;The only options are to reset to a completely blank version of Windows 10 or to "keep my data" but all installed programs
 will be lost. &nbsp;This is insane!</li><li>Worst, I figured "to hell with Windows" and was going to restore using image backup software that is supposed to make daily image backups... and found out that it wasn't running.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>What is most frustrating is that I had a working install of Windows. &nbsp;All I did was configure Driver Verifier. &nbsp;So, I *should* be able to revert it , but I can't seem to figure out how. &nbsp;Moreover, in prior versions of windows you could always do an install
 that "wrote over" windows but didn't destroy your existing programs... and that doesn't seem to exist any more. &nbsp;Even booting in Safe Mode doesn't seem to exist any more, F8 does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am starting to fear that Windows 10 might just be the most horrible pile of garbage that Microsoft ever put out and that maybe I'm out of luck and all my work is lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am quite desperate. &nbsp;I can't afford to lose over 2 weeks trying to reconstruct all of the software setup on my PC, even if I remove the drives, hook them up to another PC and back them up to a USB drive from which I can try to salvage my data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there ANYTHING that I can do to make this PC bootable again? &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>From the boot failure AdvancedOptions Command Prompt I get: the following</p>
<p>
</p><p>verifier /querysettings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- None of the flags are enabled</p>
<p>- Boot mode = persistent. &nbsp; (this is probably the cause of my problems)</p>
<p>- Rules = "All rules are using default settings"</p>
<p>- Verified drivers = none.</p>
<p>
</p><p>verifier /query:</p>
<p>"No drivers are currently verified."</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>-----</p>
<p>never mind any more. &nbsp;I just made the mistake of choosing "go back to previous build", thinking that it would restore to the point of the last automatic update. &nbsp;Nope. &nbsp;It went back to Win7. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Chances are high that if you have software that uses it, it will work just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can verify that your system knows it is there and thinks it is working by checking in Device manager</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Start globe (bottom left)</li><li>Type device into the text box that pops up</li><li>Click Device manager</li><li>Click Imaging devices</li><li>If the camera is there and working, you will see it listed, right-click on the listing and choose Properties</li></ol>

    <title>Memorex exPressit Label Design Studio Installation File and - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Memorex exPressit Label Design Studio Installation File and Compatibility</h2>
                    <p>I'm new here but I saw 2 locked threads about&nbsp;<span>Memorex exPressit. Someone needed the installation file and someone had trouble with compatibility. I know the installation file is tricky to find so I backed it up on just
 about every hard drive and flash drive I own. I posted it on Drive which you can download here:&nbsp;</span><span>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vPKfqBRUvbgOlbWeEHbFyhY4CRlP7uWH/view?usp=sharing&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>As far as compatibility goes, it needs to run in Windows Vista (Service Pack 2) Compatibility Mode which you can set after it is installed by right-clicking the stcd.exe file which will be in found in Program Files( X86)/&nbsp;Memorex exPressit Label Design Studio/STCD
 folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I couldn't reply to the locked threads, I hope this proves helpful to others.&nbsp;</p>
