<h2>            Task Pane on Desktop, How To Get Rid Of-</h2>
                    
<p>There's a Task <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Pane</span> occupying a 3 inch column on the left side of my desktop. How do I get rid of this nuisance? There's no little 'X', no way to right click delete it, no way to move its border. It's just there...
 IN YOUR FACE!</p>
<p>I'm running Windows XP SP3.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Tariq Babri,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I see that you want a driver for Thompson router for XP. I will help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us follow these steps to check the status of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1-Open "Device Manager”. Open the Control Panel from the Start menu. Click on the "Performance and
 Maintenance" icon, and then click on "System". Click on the "Hardware" tab in the "System Properties" window. Click on the "Device Manager”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2-Please note Control Panel offers two "Views": "Classic" and "Category." If your Control Panel is
 set to "Classic View," the window with the "Performance and Maintenance" category name will not appear. Instead, after accessing Control Panel, go directly to "System," and follow through with clicking on "Hardware" and "Device Manager”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3-In the "Types" listing of devices find the "Network Adapters" category. Click the "Plus" sign to
 expand the list of network adapters. Identify the router driver by deduction; if an adapter's labeling includes the word "wireless" along with a brand name, most likely that is it. An example wireless adapter is, "Intel PRO Wireless." Left-click to highlight
 the wireless adapter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4-Update driver. Right-click on the highlighted driver and select "Update Driver" from the pop-up
 menu. In the "Hardware Update Wizard" dialog box, select the "Install the software automatically" radio button. Click "Next." The instructions are intuitive; read and wait for Windows XP to connect to Microsoft to obtain any updates that may have been published
 and released.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>5-If the following message appears: "The wizard could not find a better match for your hardware ..."
 visit the manufacturer's support site. Use the wireless adapter's brand name, such as "Intel PRO Wireless", to look up and visit the manufacturer's support site for potential updates.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Let us know if you need further help with any windows issue. We will be glad to help.</span>

<p>OK, what if my or your laptop does "kick the bucket" &amp; you buy a new laptop or desktop, but you prefer to run the older system with the previous versions of software that you already paid for without going through the cost &amp; time of upgrading every single
 software package you ever used.&nbsp; Can you restore the "image" onto the new computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been told that WINDOWS licensing will somehow recognize "new" computer hardware &amp; not allow the old system image to operate.&nbsp; Is that true?&nbsp; This is a particular topic of interest to me because I have a dual boot XP/WIN 7 system &amp; I am fretting over
 the possibility of the computer hardware failing &amp; have to replace the computer itself &amp; can no longer have the dual boot capability.</p>

<p>The dual boot system originally was XP &amp; a DELL machine so I guess OEM, but not sure since there is no OEM partition.&nbsp; I do know the laptop I experimented with is an OEM because there is an OEM partition.&nbsp; So the PARAGON software circumvented OEM licensing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should add that restoring the laptop did go from a DELL to a DELL, but they were not the same model.&nbsp; I first did the restore process &amp; had to do a repair install to get it to boot up, but there were a bunch of quirks with the system that made it behave
 enigmatically.&nbsp; However, when I used PARAGON I was able to boot successfully on the 1st attempt &amp; by all accounts seems to function fine.</p>

<p>I have covered Licensing already and you can not transfer&nbsp; Dell to different&nbsp;Dell and you will eventually receive a message that&nbsp;it is&nbsp;non-genuine</p>

</p><p>If the Laptop/Computer came with the Windows Operating System preinstalled (Dell, HP, Acer, etc) or is an OEM System Builders License, that Product Key that came with the Laptop/Computer is for the preinstalled OEM License and is non-transferable.</p>

<p>The OEM License/Product Key&nbsp;(preinstalled Operating Systems&nbsp;on Dell, HP, etc&nbsp;machines) and OEM System Builders License&nbsp;are tied to the first machine it is installed on and dies when that machine dies.</p>

            Have you installed the 64bit version of W7 (during which your printer driver would have been changed for a new, 64bit, version)? I ask because I have a similar prob (see Network printing fails... below)

<br />
<br />Try using Skype ID (nick name) associated with that account and password to sign in.

            Ciao, 
<br />
<br />I'm Ugo, a Microsoft Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />Regarding your question, if you didn't already, can you please update your Nvidia drivers NOT FROM DEVICE MANAGER  but manually downloading and installing them from Nvidia website?
<br />
<br />If this doesn't work, can you please uninstall all the recent updates and hide them (if this works) to avoid this problem in the future?

<p>I updated the nvidia driver from geforce experience and it is the latest update as of now. Do i need to uninstall it and install the one from the nvidia website?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I just have one question: It is ok to disable HP programs on the startups such as audio devices or message service?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And no, im just running on an HDD and it has the latest driver(although the driver dates back to 2006 which i dont know if its normal).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also cant find processor idle disable in the power management settings. There is just 3 options there min processor state, max p.. state and system cooling policy.</p>

            You can use your discretion and not disable everything. If you are not seeing the option to adjust your CPU power management, it likely is not available. You can move on to the next steps.

<p>I have tried most of the suggestions but unfortunately it is still not solved. The only two things i have yet to try are erasing the problem reports and disabling microsoft services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But im wondering, could this be something which can be fixed in a later update of windows or hp drivers. Ive checked and noticed that my hp drivers are supported on the windows 10 v1703 build while im running on the latest windows 1709 build. If so, i dont
 mind just waiting it out until updates are released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, ive just updated the nvidia driver around the same time. Do you think it can be conflicting with the system and i should revert to the previous driver?</p>

            Copy and paste "flash9e.ocx" to the same folder C:Windows\.....Flash (use the
<br />
Explorer for the full path) so you get "Copy of flash9e.ocx". Then rename it <br />
"flash9b.ocx". <br />
&nbsp;I suspect that flash9b.ocx is now redundant but no-one thought to remove the <br />
entry in the Registry when designing the installation program for the later <br />
version (duhhhhh), so Norton One Button keeps looking for it. Providing you <br />
still have flash9e.ocx the extra file shouldn't do any harm.

            Hi Cheermom51, <br />
<br />
Thanks for posting. If your SFC /Scannow came back with errors it could not fix as ECBender your solution would be to either reinstall or attempt an inplace upgrade. Please see below on steps how to do an inplace upgrade on Vista.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Put the <span>Vista</span> DVD into the drive while your existing
<span>Vista</span> OS is already up and running. <span>
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">DO NOT</span> boot off the DVD</strong></span>; you cannot do an
<span>upgrade</span> <span>repair</span> that way.</p>
<p>2.When Setup.exe has started, click the “Install Now” link. Choose “Do not get the latest updates for installation”. Your
<span>upgrade</span> will be faster, and you can always get them later from Windows Update.</p>
<p>3. IMPORTANT: On the next screen, “Type your Product Key for activation”, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
DO NOT type in a product key</span>. If you type in the product key that you already used to activate your existing installation, you can end up running in Reduced Functionality Mode. REPEAT: DO NOT type in a product key!</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the “Automatically activate Windows when I am online” checkbox <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
UNCHECKED</span>. </li></ul>
<p>4. When prompted “Do you want to enter your Product Key now?”, choose “NO”.</p>
<p>5. Select the edition of <span>Vista</span> that you have from the list, and make sure the “I have selected the edition of Windows that I purchased” checkbox is CHECKED.</p>
<p>6. On the following screen, click on the “<span>UPGRADE</span>” choice (not the “Custom (advanced)” choice).</p>
<p>7. Follow the instructions while <span>Vista</span> is installing. You now have sufficient time to leave and enjoy a nice spaghetti dinner and some wine, or possibly even take in a whole movie.&nbsp; When done, remove the DVD.</p>
<p>8. Windows deposits leftover and unused files in several folders it creates, like C:\Windows.old, C:\$INPLACE.~TR, and C:\$WINDOWS.~Q.&nbsp; Check these folders for any personal / user files, which you can copy back if desired.&nbsp; You can now safely delete these
 folders (you may have to disable UAC to do this).</p>
<p>9. Activate! Open Control Panel in Classic View, click on the System icon, scroll down, and click on “<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Activate Windows Now</span>”.&nbsp; You are done!</p>

<h2>            SD card keeps disconnecting and reconnecting</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to look for this issue all over, but couldn't find a solution</p>
<p>
</p><p>So 2 days ago I got this update for windows 10. And since the restart this weird problem came up where my SD card reconnects randomly every few minutes. It stops for a while but then happens randomly. It just shows that the card is removed and inserted again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand what to do anymore. I checked whether its the SD port but no it seems to be working fine (not 100 percent sure). I cleaned my SD card and I did not try to use another SD card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Acer Switch 11 and running windows 10 build 10586.318</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me guys! and I also noticed that, if I play songs on Groove Music, the issue seems to disappear....but if I browse my SD card and do other stuff, I get the message of it being reconnected. Even if I leave the pc ideal, it happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The last update on 15th was a security update for Flash player which is very unlikely to cause this bug of unmounting the SD card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When I eject the card from the system, it does not reconnect which means there is less likely to be a hardware problem. If so the sd card should reconnect. (if there is some sort of a loose connection).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The card works perfect with no trouble when I run Groove Music or the Video player from Microsoft with no unmounting. Checked this by playing a video for 4 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Tried a different card and the same thing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I also tried to uninstall the SD card driver but seems does not resolve the issue. Plus the SD card is ALWAYS in use when I try to unmount it.</p>

<p>I use the 610 PRO.&nbsp; After the Win 10 update everything works as usual.&nbsp; In your case I suggest the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Make sure the USB cord is securely attached at the computer and tablet.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Make sure you have the latest driver from Huion.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; In the lower right corner of your screen under "show hidden icons,", do you still have the graphic tablet icon? If no, then you need to start the driver again.&nbsp; If the icon is visible, right click on&nbsp; it, select "exit."&nbsp; This unloads the driver.&nbsp; Then
 start the driver again.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; If still not working, is your pen fully charged, and, can you move the cursor with the pen?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Hard Drive activity light constantly blinking - new WIN7 Ultimate Dell - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hershey444  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hard Drive activity light constantly blinking - new WIN7 Ultimate Dell PC</h2>
                    I've been troubleshooting this problem off and on for weeks on my brand new WIN-7 64 Ultimate Dell XPS 8000 (I7-860 1TB HD 8GB Ram).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Searching around has found many recommendations and a couple of resolved issues, (more non-resolved), but none of the
 recommendations has helped me.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I got a feeling that this may be a Dell-specific issue, but I got no response in the Dell forums. &nbsp; I'm sure if I call Dell support, all I will get is recommendation to put it back to factory default.&nbsp; no thanks!&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have disabled all the suspects, at least temporarily to see if it has an affect:<br />
<br />
Windows Indexing &amp; Search<br />
Windows Firewall<br />
Windows Defender<br />
System Restore<br />
Remote Differential Compression<br />
Windows Fax &amp; Scan<br />
Superfetch<br />
Seaport<br />
<br />
With all these off, the blinking was clearly less busy, but there was still a steady heartbeat type of blink.&nbsp;&nbsp; I since re-enabled Defender and System Restore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Even if they were to blame, that is hardly an acceptable solution/workaround!!!)<br />
<br />
I've studied disk activity in PERFMON and there is some occasional kernel activity and event logging.&nbsp; I took a couple of window snapshots I can post (if I can figure how).&nbsp;&nbsp; I also created HijackThis log.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Sometimes the disk activity PERFMON window is blank but yet the light continues to blink!!!&nbsp; huh???<br />
<br />
I have not disabled hibernate (there was a suggestion somewhere it could be involved).&nbsp; I use it regularly.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I can try that too you think it might help.<br />
<br />
I am at my wits end and a little overwhelmed at all the data to study and search for.&nbsp; I hate diddling with services and the registry, fearful of getting in over my head and creating a mess I can't get out of.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Also, there is no additional security software and I did not install any preinstalled trial crapola.<br />
<br />
Help!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
I will post the hijack this log in the next post<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Update to clarify:&nbsp; What I reported above is basically about out-of-the-box behavior... not application or CPU-bound related. The system was pretty clean with minimal extra software/hardware installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Hard drive light blinks quckly because Microsoft does what is called something like&nbsp; Write Cache Flushing ... flushes disk drive writes that might be in that cache to disk?&nbsp; Simple.</p>
<p>The reason is .. if you have a power failure.. you will lose some data from that cache and/or corrupt something that may be important.&nbsp;&nbsp; Takes a hit on drive performance and life expectancy too.&nbsp; So some of the experts say.</p>
<p>If you have a battery backup.. or most laptops with a battery can.. Disable it!</p>
<p>.. In device manager the hard drive properties usually has a check box for enable write caching ..&nbsp; and some will have another check box...&nbsp; Disable Microsoft Write Cache Flushing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;&nbsp; add a check to that guys&nbsp;box...now look at your non very often blinking
 Hdd light...&nbsp;works &nbsp;same with some of the DVD/CD drives,&nbsp;same controllers probably.&nbsp;.</p>

            Hi Alberto.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Please post a screenshot of Disk Management, which I read like a doctor reads X-rays.  Follow the steps here so we can see everything we need to advise you:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/post-a-screenshot-of-disk-mgmt/04a8ef8c-c882-404e-a26b-89867c4ddf55?tm=1441932228382">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/foru...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also run Disk Cleanup to get at most temp files, choose System Files to remove staging files for Updates and Version Upgrades:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/disk-cleanup-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/d...</a>

            Hi  Alberto
<br />
<br />That actually sounds about right for system and reserved . . .
<br />
<br />Windows 10 itself will take anywhere from 15GB to 25GB of your hard drive space!
<br />
<br />
<br />Windows Explorer is useless when it comes to working out where your hard drive space is being used . . .
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility called Treesize. Using that tool, you will instantly see where this space is being used
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />
<br />Once you have worked out where this space is being used, please let me know so I can advise on what is safe to remove . . .
<br />

<h2>            SSD locked in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows 10 locking ssd</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a new ssd today as well as windows 10. The ssd is a samsung 850 pro. I conected the new ssd to my pc and detatched all other hard drives. I boot windows installation from the disk and installed it. Everythi g seemed to go fine. Got al the way throught
 the i stall and initial setup and started to download drives for my motherboard, vc, etc. Then windows starts to become unresponsive not allowing me to click on anything. Aboit a minute later i get a sceen saying that a critical process has failed. I restart
 my pc to find that it no longer recognizes the ssd. Doesnt show up on bios. If i attemp to repair with windows disk it tells me that the drive is locked and it cant repair it. I can completely reinstall windows and have done so about 3 or so times with the
 same results. Everytime it starts to become unresponsive at seemingly different times. Sometimes im installing drives or games. Other times im just surfing the web. Ive installed the ssd software and it was all up to date and it still happened. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, permission appears when opening a PDF document. For better assistance, we'll be needing additional information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any recent changes on your computer prior to the issue?</li><li>What is the exact message displayed when it's asking for a permission? If possible, can you send us a screenshot?</li><li>Are you trying to access or open a PDF document?</li></ul>

<h2>            HP 3055 printer not discovered on network</h2>
                    <p>I am using, or trying to use, an HP 3055 all in one on my computer which is also HP, running windows 10.&nbsp; This printer is connected to my home network router by Ethernet cable.&nbsp; This configuration worked in the past, for years on windows 7, for nearly a
 year with this computer on Windows 8, but now will not work with windows 10.&nbsp; I have run the printer troubleshooter, and downloaded and installed the latest software from HP, I have delete and tried to reinstall the printer using manual settings (auto detect
 did not work). The driver is installed, I get a message saying the printer was installed successful, but when I try to print a test page, an error message pops up saying "unable to print"; the job appears in the printer queue, but does not print. Curiously,
 my Canon wireless printer installed automatically and works fine. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>

<h2>            How can I log in as an administrator&#63;</h2>
                    I am the only user on my computer and am thus listed as an administrator.&nbsp; But I'm trying to install a new program and I received the following message: "You do not have access to make the required system configuration modifications.&nbsp; Please rerun this
 installation from an administrator's account."&nbsp; So what do I need to do so that the system will recognize me as an administrator?

<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type regedit and hit Enter to open the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />Navigate to:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software
<br />
<br />Then right click Software and choose permissions
<br />
<br />Allow Full Control for the Administrator, Administrators, and SYSTEM Groups
<br />
<br />Then navigate to:
<br />
<br />HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID
<br />
<br />Then right click CLSID and choose permissions
<br />
<br />Allow Full Control for the Administrator, Administrators, and SYSTEM Groups
<br />
<br />Restart your PC

            Tried this method.&nbsp; It didn't work for me.&nbsp; (Could it be because there was Administrator group listed in either location?)&nbsp; Any&nbsp; way, after trying this, I tried the Clean Boot method recommended in my other response, and that did the job for me.&nbsp; So All
 is now Good.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.

<p>Hi <em>bluenosehughes</em>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A corruption with the <em>netplwiz.exe</em> might cause this kind of issue on Windows. The
<em>netplwiz.exe</em> manages the user accounts in a Windows system. That being said, can you tell me if you're using a local user account or a Microsoft account to sign into your Windows 10 PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, I suggest performing the troubleshooting steps suggested by <em>Greg Carmack - Windows MVP</em> from this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hello/windows-10-not-accepting-password-after-updating/15410fd3-8f35-495a-b445-af177f0c8e48">
<strong>thread</strong></a>. He provided helpful links on how to access your system when it's not accepting your password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your reply.</p>

<p>I dont have a password associated with my PC logon thats the annoying thing. &nbsp;I boot the PC straight into windows. &nbsp;After applying the update it requests a password that I dont have therefore its impossible to login. &nbsp;It slso appears to reset all my graphics
 back to basic. &nbsp;I therefore have to unapply the update by shutting down.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone into the netplwiz.exe and ensured the box is unchecked for ‘Users must enter a username....’. However, when the update is applied it asks for a password. &nbsp;Just in case i try all the ones I know to no avail. &nbsp;I have also tried setting a password
 then apply the update. &nbsp;It does not accept the password. &nbsp;There is a problem with the update.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Windows 10 does an upgrade to the system and at start-up asks for the password and then writes it again and asks for the password again and until now it still reverts the status. The password is not rejected, but it repeats again and again</p>

<h2>            windows 7 professional - logon failure&#58; unknown user name or bad password.</h2>
                    <p>I have to new identical dell xps 8700 computers running windows 7 professional.&nbsp; The new dells are replacing older dell dimension windows XP professional computers.&nbsp; I easily mapped&nbsp; a network "f:" drive to my windows 2000 server from the first window 7
 professional machine.&nbsp; But when I tried to map the network "f:" drive to my windows 2000 server from the 2nd new windows 7 professional machine I got the following message: "Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password."&nbsp; The computers are identical.&nbsp;
 After setting up the first windows 7 professional machine successfully and mapping the "f:" drive to my server, I cloned the hard drive so that all my applications and settings would be the same on the second windows 7 professional machine.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried changing
 the 2nd windows 7 professional computer's name, but I still consistently get the "Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password."&nbsp; Any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>
