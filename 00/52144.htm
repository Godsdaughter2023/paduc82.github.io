    <title>WoT Spotting System is TERRIBLE&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            WoT Spotting System is TERRIBLE&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Can someone explain to me just how tank A can "spot" &nbsp;tank B, when A is looking forward &amp; B is approaching from behind?</p>
<p>The last time I inspected a tank, there wasn't a WINDOW in the back of the turret.</p>
<p>You will alos know that tanks will "spot" you when you are behind a building, or behind giant rocks (which only SUPERMAN can do).</p>
<p>When you are looking at a tank at 400 yeards, how does it disappear for a few seconds &amp; then reappear? In real life, you can easily spot a car at 700-800 yards &amp; EVERY tank is MUCH bigger than a car.</p>

<p>Really, this is all true &amp; when you ask anyone connected to the game, they will reply with LIES &amp; EXCUSES.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>is the way the game is build dude.....if ur close to a tank certain amount of meters it will show on the map no matter what..(means ur in one side of the building and he es in the other side; u cant shoot him or see him for that matter but u can see him
 on the map as well as everyone else in ur team and his).. and they disappear from ur sight cause they get spotted and u lose them cause they brake line of sight with whoever spot them or they kill (or someone else) the guy spotting him and every tank has an
 amount of view range some more than others, some have equip the enhanced sight or the binocular equipment (u can buy those in the store for silver) so they add to what they already have wich mean they probably will see u before u see them and the only way
 u can see someone that is outside ur range of sight is if he gets spotted and ur radio is on the range of the tank that spotted him.. yet again if the guy that is spotting him get kill u only have like 2 seconds before he disappear... u can increase ur view
 range with ur crew (training them on skills and perks) and also u can train ur crew commander with the six sense perk that give u a warning that an enemy is about to spot u giving u a few seconds to back up and &nbsp;brake the possible line of sight before u get
 that warning that u have being spotted... hope it helps a bit.... go check BohemianEagle or QuickyBabyTV channels on youtube for more explanation (they play the pc version but the concept apply the same for xbox version)... &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>not going into big detail but max spotting range is 445.</p>
<p>this game wouldn't be fair if EVERYONE had 800+m spotting range because then we would all die at the start of the map. I have a leopard light tank with decked out gear. He spots everything. there's a wiki on this game. about the size of Lord of the Rings
 trilogy if you wanna read it.</p>

<p>I know how it works, as does everybody else who thinks it's a joke. It's just the WORST play mechanic (along with the least accurate guns) in the HISTORY of video games &amp; I have the guts to say it. Maybe it's because I understand Newtonian Physics &amp; I'm
 NOT being paid to defend it. It seems pretty straight forward, to me.</p>

<p>Just like the idiots on TV news, you should gather ALL of the facts before you go out and make an "Al" of yourself. LOL</p>
<p>I'm trying to inform people, so that they won't throw their hard earned (at least by some of us) money away on a poorly performing product. If you want to do the opposite, then go right ahead!</p>
<p>Have you ever asked yourself why a player of my high skill level EXPOSES the flaws of the game (as a FREE service to the public) rather than just cleaning the "clocks" of idiots who throw money at the game?</p>
<p>My friends &amp; I have given the game thorough testing throughout the BETA &amp; beyond (uncovering numerous flaws that the developers DENIED existed, but later made adjustments...hmmmm). &nbsp;Perhaps if your nose wasn't pointed so high in the air, you might have discovered
 that. </p>
<p>As BETA testers, we tested PREMIUM rounds &amp; PREMIUM (junk) tanks compared to the normal tanks, as well (Premium tanks earn more fake silver than a FREE tank, but you can't BUY skill). Driver perks are of minor help, but won't compensate for the bad guns
 &amp; arbitrarily bad game physics (which I studied as a Math &amp; Physics major). If you want to spend a lot of $$$$ to lose at a game (which WILL happen), then this game is AWESOME! I prefer to pay ONLY for EXCEPTIONAL products, which is why I own American made
 firearms that I shoot with U.S. ARMY training. I hit my targets with real bullets, so I know what it is like.</p>
<p>These are nice looking CARDBOARD tanks, firing CARDBOARD rounds from a CARDBOARD "gun". It's a very mediocre (Russian "quality") game for FREE. What they try to do is ensure that you have enough BAD GAME RESULTS that you will "try" to fix by buying something
 from their store (that's how they hook you). It's just too bad that NOTHING in their store is any better than the free JUNK that you can get.</p>
<p>It has nice attention to accurate tank graphics, but that's where the accuracy ends. Their guns are literally the WORST guns in any video game that I have ever played. I can explain EVERYTHING that is wrong with the game construction (but that would take
 a while). </p>
<p>It's curious how WoT NEVER shows the disappearing tanks, the impossibly bad aiming system &amp; the random damage done by their guns in their ads. Their TV commercial shows things that can NEVER happen, but look cool &amp; enticing. They never show you the HARD
 GRIND of struggling to get a better gun than your stock trash tank has at the outset (just wait until you get to tier 8, sucker!). Why do you think that they HIDE these bad elements of the game? (If they weren't bad, they wouldn't hide them from their commercials.)</p>
<p>An objective analysis shows a game with tremendous potential (the early BETA was vastly different) that was squandered &amp; a company that exploits the ignorance of the consumer base BETTER than anything that I have ever seen. They sell GARBAGE to suckers for
 a PREMIUM price &amp; their are a lot of pigeons, it seems.</p>
<p>I know a lot more about this game than you do, "Al" (not a shocker, really). You are welcome to your opinion, even if it differs from mine. I speak a simple truth &amp; &nbsp;I am aiming to help inform people to save their $$$ for a REAL game, because this isn't
 "it"!</p>
<p>Good luck out there!</p>
<p>There's a reason that only one of us is a legend...and it ain't you. </p>

<p>"Have you ever asked yourself why a player of my high skill level EXPOSES the flaws of the game (as a FREE service to the public) rather than just cleaning the "clocks" of idiots who throw money at the game?" &nbsp; - I think maybe your ego is a bit out of control...
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; you obviously don't like the game, we get that. &nbsp;you say you only want to warn people? &nbsp;a single thread post would have taken care of that, and why not let them download the "free game" and see for themselves what it's all about? &nbsp;you're unselfishly saving
 us all from the horrible experience of downloading a "free" game we may or may not like? &nbsp;your posting makes you sound like a spoiled child throwing a tantrum. &nbsp;like I mentioned above perhaps you should grow up and move on back to whatever title you choose
 to dominate with that huge ego/skill set you supposedly enjoy...</p>
<p>&nbsp;once again it's a free game, so nobody has to pay for the game you seem to bash for some personal reason that is not posted in your rants, why not go over to the official forums and post and see if anyone over there cares what you think? the dev's do read
 those forums and suggested changes are being made to the game. &nbsp;I suppose they probably have already given you the boot over there though, so you're only option is to wage a slander war on these forums right? since you are a highly skilled veteran beta tester
 they'll no doubt put extra weight on you opinions right?&nbsp; from your attitude I'd say perhaps your opinions would not go over well, but if you really want to make the game into something better then that(the official forum) is the route.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; my opinion is that people should try it for free and make up their own minds rather than read the spiteful post you make tearing the game down unfairly and then never give it a free chance.</p>
<p>&nbsp; ok, now flame on cuz I wear a fireproof suit....&nbsp; and just what has being a vet and knowing how to shoot have to do with anything? this is a video game....</p>

<h3> plaidcyclops  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;The drive where Windows is installed is locked. Unlock the drive and try again.&#34;</h2>
                    I was trying to fix my laptop after an error that won't even let me go into my computer. I can go to boot settings etc., But that's it. I installed a copy of windows 8.1 onto a flash drive, and put it in my computer, ran it, and it said "Install Windows"
 or "Repair Windows". I clicked repair Windows, and it brought me to the advanced settings. Whenever I did this, I went to refresh my PC, but it gave me the message:&nbsp;"The drive where Windows is installed is locked. Unlock the drive and try again". I proceeded
 to look up some things, but found some stuff to do with command prompt, and it wouldn't work either. It kept giving me messages about how it wouldn't work. At first, the only issue was a disc issue, which I repaired easily with the startup repair. Then, it
 came up with a new error "Hard Disc Error Please run the Hard Disc Test in System Diagnostics. Hard Disc 1 (3F1). I did that, but when I did, it said: "SMART Check: Not installed Short Dst: Not installed. I don't know what to do! Please help!<br />

            <p>Hello Plaid,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are unable to boot to your computer and you are getting the error "Windows is installed is locked. Unlock the drive and try again".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><div>I suggest&nbsp;you&nbsp;to perform check disk from advanced recovery options. Check if it helps.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
a) Insert the media such as (USB or DVD) and restart the computer.</div>
<div>
<p>b) Press F12 key (typically this is F12, but it can differ between computer manufacturers) and choose the drive that you inserted the installation media into.</p>
<p>c) Once the Windows Setup window appears, follow these steps:</p>
<div>d) Click Next and select Repair your computer.</div>
<div>e) You will then see a blue screen and an option to choose. </div>
<div>f) Choose the option Troubleshoot and select Advanced options.</div>
<div>g) You may choose Command Prompt from Advanced boot option.</div>
<div>h) In the command prompt, type ‘chkdsk /r’ and press Enter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Important: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the information helps to fix the issue, if you have any further queries, feel free to post. We are here to assist you.

<h3> cjmetcalfe  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I verify a SAM Audit Contact is legitimate&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been contacted by what appears to be a SAM audit. &nbsp; I've called the Microsoft Volume Licensing help number 3 times now, each time to be told we'll get back to you, but they don't. &nbsp; Another time they said to call the Partner Program number. They said
 they can't help me because I'm not a partner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a way to verify that this contact is legitimate before I go giving away company information, downloading spreadsheets, going to unknown websites, or running programs from non-microsoft sites. &nbsp;Emails can be faked or stolen, cold calls almost always
 are faked. &nbsp;All I want to do is verify this is legitimate. &nbsp;If this contact is from&nbsp;&nbsp;"Microsoft License Verification Program" &nbsp; then why is it so hard to verify the contact? &nbsp;All I want to do is call a
<strong>known</strong> Microsoft number and verify they contact.</p>

            I would suggest you can download Winamp,this is a free program,when download winamp,most of your songs and video will transfer to winamp automatically where you can rip and burn song,your songs from limewire will be on winamp, not all songs from limewire
 will be on winamp,but you&nbsp; can export them from winamp,I hardly use windows media player as you will not get it on windows media player.I had that problem before,using winamp is a good software you can use as this will help you with your problem.

    <title>How to stop active directory username from automatically capitalizing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to stop active directory username from automatically capitalizing on startup</h2>
                    <p>My username is automatically being capitalized on startup. I am joined to an active directory domain so I'm assuming Windows is looking up the active directory entry for my account and getting the capitalized username from there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can update the registry at&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Authentication\LogonUI\SessionData\1]</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">and set the LoggedOnSAMUser and LoggedOnUser to lowercase and my username will then be lowercase until I restart my computer.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Is there any way to stop the automatic capitalization? I don't think I can change the active directory entry since this is a work computer and the company probably has a standard way of adding those entries. This is a pain because
 ssh-ing now uses the capitalized username and fails key authentication.</p>

<h2>            Suface 3&#58; Surface app not updating</h2>
                    <p>I absolutely need to be able to customize the buttons on my new Surface pen, but first I need to update the Surface app from the Windows store. There is no update available on the store page. Now, hear me out: I know that the solution is to go to the Windows
 update section in Settings and update my firmware, but it is saying that I am up to date. Then why isn't the Surface app updating? I just need to customize my pen buttons, guys. Please help me out! Examples below in case I'm not making much sense</p>

    <title>why would i loss access to single player content when EA shuts down - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the immortal d  say:</h3>
<h2>            why would i loss access to single player content when EA shuts down the server for the saboteur&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>EA is shutting down the server for the saboteur. first of all, why would a single player game with no MP mode even have a server? and when they do this, i will lose access to the midnight club. its a club hidden under the moulin roge style club that is your
 hide out. there is a lot of cool stuff down there. when i replay it, i go down there and mess around. i can understand MP modes being cut off, but single player stuff? this makes me scared to buy DLC of any kind from EA. i don't want to buy the mass effect
 3 DLC only to not be able to access the DLC years later when i decide to replay mass effect 3. you may say big deal, but this was a pre-order bonus that was given with the game if you buy it new. not to mention people that paid for this DLC to access the midnight
 club, when they bought the game used. i bought it new and i like going into the hidden club when i replay the game. why should i loss access to single player stuff? am i going to loss access to DLC for games like mass effect 1 and 2 and dragons age as well?
 all of that is single player, not MP. don't get me wrong, i am against any servers being shut down for any game. if you buy the game and the DLC, you should always have access to all the games modes, areas and DLC. as i see this type of stuff happening, i
 become less inclined to buy DLC. its stuff like this that also has me against digital downloads. this may seem silly, but it can lead to loss of access for other single player content in future games. it starts small and next thing you know, you can't access
 the cat woman levels in arkam city anymore. you can't use your pre-order guns in FPS games you bought new anymore. you can't access those cool cars you bought for frozza 4 anymore. you can't access the DLC levels for gears 2 and 3 when you wanna do horde anymore.
 and so on.</p>

<p>its an underground club. there is a secert entrance in the corner of the club where your hideout is. there is a game down there you can play that allows you to win a very cool car. there is dance shows in the back. you pick which of the 3 girls you wanna
 see dance. it is good sized club to run around in. i like to play the game and mess around seeing the dace shows and stuff. you could proably find a video on youtube of the place. i just don't see why EA would lock this content back up. its single player.
 the game has no MP modes. why does it even have a server? as i see this stuff hasppen, i start to consider never buying DLC &nbsp;anymore. i don't wanna pay for content i could lose access too. and if i will lose access to content giving to me when i buy a game
 brand new a few years later, i might as well just buy used.</p>

<p>Totally agree. I have this game and I'm pissed because I still haven't gotten that car. The mini game is also a blast to play if you actually play it like a drinking game! I don't understand why it had a server either. EA has been a *** for a long time,
 but this takes it to a whole nother level.</p>

<p>all i know is the DLC for mass effect 3 is the last DLC i will buy for an EA game. if i even buy another EA game. i won't be buying syndicate DLC. thats for sure. i am not gonna buy extra MP missions that i could lose access to 3-4 years later because EA
 shut down the servers for the game.</p>

<p>Some people are just cry babies.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Severs get shut down all the time. If you want the servers to stay up for so long, why don't you play the game? Keep the community active. Make it WORTH EAs time to keep the servers up and running. It's a complete waste of time and resources for a developer
 to keep servers running for a game that NOBODY plays. Nobody is going to be playing the game 3-4 years after it's released and the few poor souls that are are so few that it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>More servers need to be shut down more often. It's completely pointless to keep them going for so long when nobody plays their games. You had your chance to play these games, you failed to do so. Quit *** because you took your sweet time trying to play a
 game and expect to be able to hop on and play multiplayer after the game has been out for 3-4 years.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>and DLC is DLC. It's yours. You keep it. You should not lose access to the content, unless what you're trying to access streams online content such as leaderboards for example. I didn't play much of that awful game to know much about the content.</p>

    <title>USB drive disconnect during large transfer... also affects Win7 32bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> virgilstar  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB drive disconnect during large transfer... also affects Win7 32bit</h2>
                    So I am having a similar problem as that described in this thread... http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7performance/thread/5462b4dc-9c9d-4a57-8111-d7363a0baa79<br />
<br />
BUT... most of the discussion over there appears to be about nVIDIA motherboards, and the 64 bit version of win7 running on a computer with &gt;4GB RAM.&nbsp; My system is 32-bit, and only has 2GB RAM.&nbsp; It's a Biostar NF61V Micro AM2 motherboard, and I'm running Win7
 home premium.<br />
<br />
I'm getting the same problem, i.e. when I try a large transfer (backing up an iTunes library)&nbsp; to my external USB drive (120GB), it hangs after the first few hundred MB, and the drive appears to disconnect and reconnect.&nbsp; Here are the things I've tried so far,
 to solve the problem:<br />
<br />
1) Reinstalled all drivers for the USB controllers.<br />
2) Reinstalled drivers for the motherboard (from Biostar) and for the nVidia nForce 4100 and geForce 6100 components onboard (from nVidia)<br />
3) The drive works well on other computers for large transfers, including a laptop.<br />
4) Double checked that USB selective suspend is disabled in power settings.<br />
5) Am logged is as administrator with full control and permissions for both source and target.<br />
6) Tried a new connecting cable, and even a cable which uses 2 ports, so I know the drive is getting enough power.&nbsp; Like I say, it gets enough power from a single USB port on other computers to work just fine.<br />
7) Tried it on all 4 rear USB ports (direct into motherboard) and on both front ports.<br />
8) Tried using a 3rd party program (TeraCopy) to manage the transfer - it hangs too.<br />
9)&nbsp; Other USB devices (8GB thumb drive) work perfectly OK on this computer.&nbsp; Another external HD however (with its own power supply) also does not work.<br />
10) Tried the hot-fix mentioned in the above thread, even though that was for 64 bit, it installed fine but the problem persisted.<br />
11) Analyzed the drive for errors - none found on a detailed scan.<br />
12) Reformatted the drive.<br />
13) Turned off virtual memory, to bring total RAM including page-file down to 2MB.<br />
14) This NEVER was a problem running Vista on the same machine.&nbsp; Only happened since I put Win7 on it.<br />
<br />
The drive spins up and works perfectly OK, until I try and do a large transfer, then it bonks.&nbsp; I can copy the files in small chunks (about 100MB at a time), but the files I want to copy total about 30GB, so this is not an option unless I want to be there clicking
 away for 12 hours!<br />
<br />
The problem here appears to be with buffering the files during the transfer.&nbsp; It just can't seem to handle anything more than a couple hundred MB and then it stops, un-mounts the drive, and then re-mounts it, but of course by then the copy cannot be resumed.&nbsp;
 Even in Tera-copy (which has automatic resume in case of disconnect), it&nbsp; re-connects a couple of times, but then eventually stops at around 500 MB.<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions?<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Virgilstar,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Windows.</p>
<p>I would suggest you to suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below and check if you come across the same problem.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to check your disk for error.</p>
<p>You can solve some computer problems by checking a drive or drives for errors. For example, you can check your computer's primary hard disk to fix some performance issues, or you can check an external hard drive if it's not working properly.</p>
<p>You may follow the steps mentioned below to check your disk for errors.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Computer by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Computer.
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click the drive that you want to check, and then click Properties.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Tools tab, and then, under Error-checking, click Check now. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>To automatically repair problems with files and folders that the scan detects, select Automatically fix file system errors. Otherwise, the disk check will report problems but not fix them.<br />
To perform a thorough check, select Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors. This scan attempts to find and repair physical errors on the drive itself, and it can take much longer to complete.</p>
<p>To check for both file errors and physical errors, select both Automatically fix file system errors and Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start.</p>
<p>For more information on checking a disk for error, you may visit the link mentioned below:<br />
<strong>Check a drive for errors<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors</a></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:<br />
</strong>After checking the disk for error, I would suggest you to run Microsoft ’Fix it’ from the link mentioned below:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/hardware_device_problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/gp/hardware_device_problems</a></p>
<p>After following the steps mentioned above, you may restart your computer and check if you come across the same problem.</p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

            Thanks, as detailed in point #11 of my initial post - I already did this.&nbsp; I used exactly the method you described, and no errors came up.&nbsp; Also the drive works perfectly on 3 other computers.&nbsp; The problem is not the drive, it is the way win7 is handling
 the USB transfer.&nbsp; This problem repeats with 2 different USB drives (one 3.5" powered, one 1.8"&nbsp; powered by USB alone).<br />

            Hello Virgilstart,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your post. &nbsp;What is the file format of your external drive? &nbsp;You can try converting your drive to NTFS if it's not already (Conversions shouldn't incur data loss, but it is recommended to back up your data beforehand). &nbsp;Another thing you
 might try is downloading/running Microsoft's Memory Diagnostic to pinpoint any errors if they exist (found&nbsp;<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2008.09.utilityspotlight.aspx?pr=blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>).</div>
<div><br />
<div>If those proposals don't yield results, you can look into a free product (Microsoft SyncToy) that will backup data from Drive-to-Drive and should be a sufficient workaround. &nbsp;You can find the SyncToy&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=c26efa36-98e0-4ee9-a7c5-98d0592d8c52&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please let us know if this did or didn't help to resolve the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Cheers</div>

            I know this is 2 years old but I am having the same problem. I tried running a Windows backup to a 500GB Western Digital external hard drive, and about mid-way through the backup the drive disconnects and reconnects, which then, of course, kills the backup.
 The backup I am trying to run is a system image backup.<br />
<br />
I wish I had another external hard drive to test and make sure it isn't the drive, but this poster's problem seems identical to mine. I formatted the drive and tried it again but it didn't work.<br />
<br />
One caveat: I am running Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit on a Bootcamp partition (140 GB) of my Early 2011 MacBook Pro. I don't think that should make a difference but I figured I'd add it to see if anyone else has problems.<br />
<br />
If the OP ever figured our a solution to the problem I'd greatly appreciate him sharing it.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            this is absolutely ridiculous! i see tons of users reporting this issue online for years and no valid fix other than to buy an internal USB card? I've tried using SyncToy (not either a real solution) and it doesn't work either. 



I have Win7 64 bit on 8 computers. Every time I try to copy files to a USB drive - flash or hard disk - the drive gets disconnected before the first file even copies! What kind of garbage is this? I've never had such a problem with Windows XP or Windows 98. Currently, I'm trying to copy some MP4 files. I'm trying to run a business and this is the most ridiculous problem I've ever experienced.  



We should be demanding Microsoft either compensate for USB cards on each system or provide a Windows 8 upgrade for free - hopefully the problem is solved there. What the ****? I can't copy files using this lousy OS.  



You can't advertise a capability and then expects millions of users to spend hours trying to do the most basic of tasks, and then spend hours troubleshooting

            so after about three hours tinkering with the suggestions here and on other forums with no luck, i went ahead and unplugged my printer from the adjacent USB port. magically the transfer worked! my guess is that two process/power heavy devices could cause
 the hard drive to lose power momentarily causing it to disconnect. they were both plugged in the front ports on my Dell XPS8300 computer which is basically a USB hub from what i've read - rather than a direct connection.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
i'm still confused though as i had previously attempted unsuccessfully to transfer over the network, plugging the hard drive into another network computer. so i don't get why the USB issue mentioned above would be a problem. maybe these USB drives are simply
 configured to draw more power than some cheap dell computers can handle causing them to disconnect. maybe a powered hub would do the trick.

<p>
</p><p>The problem is when ever i'm playing the card drawing stops working after few minutes. I just can't draw anymore cards so I can't finish the game.</p>
<p>

<p>We can analyze the minidumps if you make them available from the SkyDrive or other file
<br />
sharing sites (such as MediaFire). If you have problems uploading the minidumps copy
<br />
them to the Desktop or the Documents folder and upload them from there.<br />
<br />
Zip or upload the contents of C:\Windows\minidump</p>
<p>Use SkyDrive to upload collected files <br />

<br />
<strong>BCCode: 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000050<br />
<br />
References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>Have you added any hardware lately? Have you updated any driver just before
<br />
these started? (Check Control Panel - Windows Updates to see if any drivers <br />
were updated there about the time this started) Main likely culprits are Video <br />
driver, other major drivers, memory, and antivirus/antispyware/security products <br />
could be at fault as well as drive issues.<br />
<br />
Use the troubleshooter below and refer to the next message for drivers and<br />
memory when you get to those sections and then return back to the trouble-<br />
shooter as needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000050</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong><br />
<br />
The BCCode&nbsp;50 usually occurs after the installation of faulty hardware or in the event of failure<br />
of installed hardware (usually related to defective RAM, be it main memory, L2 RAM cache, or
<br />
video RAM).</p>
<p>Another common cause is the installation of a faulty system service.</p>
<p>Antivirus software can also trigger this error, as can a corrupted NTFS volume.<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p><em>Resolving a faulty hardware problem:</em> If hardware has been added to the system recently,
<br />
remove it to see if the error recurs. If existing hardware has failed, remove or replace
<br />
the faulty&nbsp;component. You should run hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer.
<br />
For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a faulty system service problem:</em> Disable the service and confirm that this
<br />
resolves the error. If so, contact the manufacturer of the system service about a possible
<br />
update. If the error occurs during system startup, restart your computer, and press F8 at
<br />
the character-mode menu that displays the operating system choices. At the resulting
<br />
Windows Advanced Options menu, choose theLast Known Good Configuration option. <br />
This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time.</p>
<p><em>Resolving an antivirus software problem: </em>Disable the program and confirm that this resolves
<br />
the error. If it does, contact the manufacturer of the program about a possible update.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a corrupted NTFS volume problem:</em>&nbsp; Run Chkdsk /f /r to detect and repair disk
<br />
errors. You must restart the system before the disk scan begins on a system partition. If
<br />
the hard disk is SCSI, check for problems between the SCSI controller and the disk.<br />
</p>
<p>Finally, check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help
<br />
pinpoint the device or driver that is causing the error. Disabling memory caching of the BIOS
<br />
might also resolve it.<br />

<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />

<br />
<br />
Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />
Recovery Options if your system has that installed by the maker.<br />

The log might give you the answer if there was a corrupted driver. (Does not tell all the possible<br />
driver issues).<br />
<br />
Also run CheckDisk so we can rule out corruption as much as possible.<br />

<h2>            Computer will not start and Repair Disc not working, getting error 0x0000e9</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a Windows 7 64-bit PC from Toshiba. I tried to start it from hibernate earlier today, but I just got an error (something like "Could not resume from Hibernate"). I &nbsp;hit "delete restoration data and continue" and waited for the PC to boot up. After
 15 minutes or more, it still had not started, and the Windows logo had stopped pulsing like it should. I decided to do a&nbsp;shutdown&nbsp;with the button. I tried to boot it again, but this time I got an error "Windows could not start" and it listed choices to Start
 Normally or Startup Repair. Tried both, but they ended in an error (0x0000e9, Hardware I/0 problem it said in description). Tried safe mode, but it froze and gave the same error. I called a friend who has a 64-bit Windows 7 Home Premium PC as well and asked
 him if he could make a system repair disc. He made one and I have tried it 3 times, but it freezes every time while loading options for fixing Windows (Repair from Image, etc.). What should I do?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advanced!</div>

            Thanks for the reply!
<div><br />
<div>I do not have the Install disk (it was preloaded on the laptop and the install disk was not in the box), I have the system repair disk you can make from the Control Panel. It only has system recovery options on it. Here is what my friend did:&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/is-IS/windows7/Create-a-system-repair-disc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/is-IS/windows7/Create-a-system-repair-disc</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>I also cannot get any recovery options to load successfully from that disk.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sorry for the confusion.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>So basically, that disk loads the language select, I choose English, then it freezes, trying to load the next step. The next step never loads. Loading the repair options built-in to the laptop does not work either. It just stops and gives an error while
 it says "Loading Windows Files...". The error is an I/O error and its id is 0x00000e9. I have tried safe mode, last known good config, basically all the steps listed on the F8 menu, besides Debugging Mode (I am not brave enough)! Nothing has worked!</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, what should I do!?</div>

            <p>Hi The3Js,</p>
<p>At this point, it really does sound like a hardware issue.</p>
<p>I would suggest going through Toshiba support to see if they have hardware diagnostic tools that you can use to check your laptop:</p>

<h2>            My reliability history contains nothing</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I'm having a problem with the Reliability Monitor not recording anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I have installed Windows 7 Ultimate (Clean) I have had several program crashes (mostly ie8 compatibility problems) and have successfully installed several updates, etc. All of which appear in the reliability
 monitor for my laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a shot when I first installed - which I consider normal</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.members.optushome.com.au%2fwendycostello%2fReliability1.PNG" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few days later this is what I get (which I don't consider normal)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.members.optushome.com.au%2fwendycostello%2fReliability2.PNG" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my laptop the Reliability Monitor is filled with info such as crashed programs and successful updates etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.members.optushome.com.au%2fwendycostello%2freliabilitylaptop.PNG" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both were installed on the same day. Here is what I have tried so far on the PC (in order):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) A SFC</p>
<p>2) Clearing out the data from 
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\RAC\PublishedData &amp; 
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\RAC\StateData (the data was replaced again by W7 within 24 hours)</p>
<p>3) An upgrade install over the top.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.members.optushome.com.au%2fwendycostello%2fracp.PNG" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing seems to have worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any other solutions people can think of? Any services that should be running that maybe aren't etc? Possible problems with permissions on certain folders etc?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically I'm at a loss and any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>As soon as I finished posting I had an idea to change permissions for the RAC folders and it seems to have worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Got rid of inheritable permissions and installed the following with full control and ticked "replace all child....."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.members.optushome.com.au%2fwendycostello%2fracsecurity.PNG" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Changed the owner to system</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.members.optushome.com.au%2fwendycostello%2fracowner.PNG" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The result</p>

<p>Any advice to what I have done would be appreciated. e.g., have I left any security holes? If so, any other solutions that may work etc?</p>

Bug check description: This bug check indicates that the power policy manager experienced a fatal error.
<br />
This is likely to be caused by a hardware problem. This problem might also be caused because of overheating (thermal issue).
<br />
The crash took place in the Windows kernel. Possibly this problem is caused by another driver that cannot be identified at this time.

<br />B. Third Party Drivers
<br />1. secnvme.sys - Samsung NVMe driver
<br />Driver Date - 12-Feb-2018
<br />
<br />C. Recommendations
<br />
<br />1. Create a system restore point so that if something wrong happens you can revert. 
<br />Type restore point in Cortana Search &gt; Create a Restore point &gt; Check whether against your drive, Protection is ON or not. If not ON, click Configure button below to Make it ON &gt; Now press Create to create a restore point 
<br />
<br />2. Update Samsung NVME driver (If you don't need this, uninstall it)
<br />
<br />3. After point 2, if BSOD is still caused - Is there any other driver involved - To know if a driver is one of the causes - Enable Driver Verifier and generate dump files and upload to Onedrive and share the link here (Don't forget to turn off Driver Verifier after the job is done). Do read the instructions carefully particularly how to get back into Windows when you get the crash.

<p><span><span>Hi,<br />
Welcome to Microsoft answers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to go to the manufacturer’s website, download the latest drivers for your webcam which are compatible with
 windows7.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to check if the camera is compatible with Windows7, here is the link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;s=Sony%u00ae Visual Communication Camera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;s=Sony%u00ae%20Visual%20Communication%20Camera</span></a><br />
<span><br />
You can also try downloading drivers from the below link:<br />
</span><a href="http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/swu-download.pl?mdl=VGNSZ650N&amp;upd_id=2876&amp;os_id=29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/swu-download.pl?mdl=VGNSZ650N&amp;upd_id=2876&amp;os_id=29</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;I also suggest you to scan for hardware from device manager and check what happens.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;Install the driver in vista compatibility mode and restart the computer and see what happens, here are the steps</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Open the Program Compatibility troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter,
 and then click Troubleshooting. Under Programs, click Run programs made for previous versions of Windows.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the instructions in the troubleshooter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you cannot install a program, insert the installation disc for the program and, using the troubleshooter, browse to the program's setup file,
 usually called Setup.exe, Install.exe, or something similar. The troubleshooter is not designed to work on programs that have an .msi file name extension.

    <title>Cannot remove app from Windows Firewall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot remove app from Windows Firewall</h2>
                    <p>I've uninstalled a few servers that I was using for testing some new features.&nbsp; I also want to remove them from the Windows Firewall allowed apps interface.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps I take:</p>
<p>Open Control Panel -&gt; Click on "Allow an app through Windows Firewall"</p>
<p>Click &lt;Change settings&gt; button (Upper right)</p>
<p>Uncheck the apps I don't want to communicate through windows firewall</p>
<p>Highlight said app then click &lt;Remove&gt;</p>
<p>Then Click &lt;OK&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I go back to the same interface the apps are back and allowed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read some of the other articles and it's not cosmetic, I want to remove them completely so I can test some other features of the servers I am testing, but want to have a fresh slate.&nbsp; I want the message to pop up from Windows that I have a new app trying
 to communicate each time I recompile and run the servers.</p>

My problem is that 50% of the time when my computer first starts up I keep getting this error message for windows media player on my desktop, when I click on trouble shoot or online help or close the error window, my CPU usage goes up to 100% and stays there,
 my computer then runs very slow, have run many online virus scans with the hard drive removed and isolated, but nothing major was found,<br />
I am using windows 7 ultimate</p>
<p>Below is the same signature data that appears each time,</p>
<p>Does anyone out there have any suggestions on how to fix this problem?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help,</p>

<p><span>Hi Michael Marysej,<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>“wmpnscfg.exe” is Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service Configuration Application - it's a part of the Windows Media Player Sharing system
 that shares the library even if Media Player isn’t open</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>From the error log, the faulting module appears to be “ntdll.dll”.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow the steps listed below:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 1:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>I’d suggest you to perform a System File Checker (SFC) scan</span></span><span>on
 your computer. SFC tool</span><span>scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files by using the correct versions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>See&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>How
 to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</strong></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 2:&nbsp;</strong><span><strong>Start the computer in a clean
 boot state</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Start the computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

 to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong></span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note:</strong> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in<strong>Step 7</strong> in the above KB article.</span></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Rewards Points Did Not Redeem In Cash</h2>
                    Hi<br />
I don't know where else to go, because the Xbox Support doesn't really have this kind of problems in their choices.<br />
Anyway,I just redeem 23,900 Microsoft Rewards points for a gift card of 25$, but I got nothing in my bank account.<br />
When I go see how many MR points I had left, I don't have the 23,900 points that I'd just spent and I still have nothing added in my bank account link to my gamertag.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Microsoft, can I please have what I paid for, there's some really good discount in the Microsoft Store right now

<p>Hey there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you redeemed your&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;Rewards point for a $25 gift card right? An email&nbsp;should have been sent to your email&nbsp;with a code that you will redeem to get the&nbsp;points on your account. So check your&nbsp;email&nbsp;for a code!&nbsp;</p>

            Did this ever get resolved? And if so how? Because I'm having the same problem and no one at Microsoft rewards have gotten back to me and I never got a confirmation email but it took my points.
