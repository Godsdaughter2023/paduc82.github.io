    <title>desktop running Windows 10 does not display text - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            desktop running Windows 10 does not display text</h2>
                    <p>After accessing a website with popups I got an obvious malware notice about my computer being infected and telling me to contact Microsoft support and giving a phone number.&nbsp; Then, I couldn't get rid of the massage, nor was I allowed to exit Edge.&nbsp; I was
 able to cancel it using the Task Manager, but on opening Edge again it went to the same site/message.&nbsp; I was able to get Edge to go to Google.com and exit normally, and all appeared fine.&nbsp; The next time I turned on the computer, videos displayed poorly with
 green pixels flickering in all dark/black areas.&nbsp; So, I went to settings to try and resolve the issue, at which point I lost all text, not only for my files/folder but also on the web.&nbsp; Settings do not show up -- nothing displays.&nbsp; Files show up blank, but
 if I click and drag I get white letters in a purple background rectangle.&nbsp; Similarly, if I hover over a setting, I can see the text, but it disappears immediately when I move the mouse away.&nbsp; I've run a complete virus scan using my old program, AVG, and a
 registry scan.&nbsp; Took 3 hours, detected nothing.&nbsp; Likewise Windows 10 troubleshooters.&nbsp; A clue: on startup the display goes from Win10 blue purple to white.&nbsp; The truncated 8 of the welcome screen goes white and does not display any text.&nbsp; If this is a virus
 or malware it's a doozy and needs to be addressed.&nbsp; This issue has come up&nbsp;before with a laptop running Win7</p>

<p>
</p><p>back in 2013.&nbsp; No resolution that I could find.&nbsp; I have reset the computer with the "keep my files" option.&nbsp; Took an hour - no improvement, and I lost all my apps including AVG.&nbsp; Another clue:&nbsp; Windows 10 will is not letting me change display options (though
 I can't find any entry for "text," except for size which does nothing) nor will it let me turn off Cortana.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; The reset dispensed with my video card, so I don't thing that's it.&nbsp; My big old, highly capable desktop is pretty useless, and I'm writing
 this using my laptop.&nbsp; Thanks for any help you can offer, 'cause I'm out of ideas.&nbsp; Been working with computers since mainframe days.&nbsp; Never seen anything like this.</p>

            <p>Basically, I posted in the hope that someone, perhaps at Microsoft, would have seen the problem before and would know how to deal with it. Obviously, this is not happening. To restate, I have already run Reset with no positive effect, even though this should
 have reset my computer to factory spec. It did, however, discard almost all of my programs, including FlightSimulator with all of its addons and iTunes. A positive was that it deleted my virus scan software so that I can now scan with Windows Defender, a process
 which I had to discontinue after 3 hours, because I had to leave (it was half finished). Will try to get through it tonight. Apparently, the problem can be one of the following, or perhaps multiples occurring simultaneously: 1)&nbsp; a virus infection or operation
 of malware; 2) a failing monitor; or 3) a setting that I simply messed up. The most pressing is the lack of text which impedes all actions. I can see how a misapplied setting could cripple text display for local activities, text documents and file/folder manipulation,
 but how it could affect webpages is hard to fathom. This is a devastating problem, rendering my expensive desktop computer unusable and even eliminating the possibility of on-line help. Be aware that all I need to do to get, at least local functionality is
 to change the color of the text or even the background, in that the text is apparently being displayed as white on a white background. It would be helpful, if someone could address the aftermath of the malicious message I got on the Internet just before all
 this started. I know others have experienced this. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Oh, in case you think I'm not listening to your advice, please be aware that I am. I downloaded the security scanner on this laptop, copied it to a thumb drive, and ran it on the affected desktop. It gave me a blank box which was the EULA. I was able to
 read it by holding the shift key while scrolling down (white text on a purple background). The checkbox, however, was accompanied by no text and clicking it gave no visible response, so I clicked it again. Figured out that the check was just not appearing
 (clicking again erased the check, though again not visible). Clicked the box and clicked "Next." Was presented&nbsp;with 3 options, again no text, and I was unable to display with any selecting or hovering. Again, selecting one of the circles did not result in
 a dot in the circle (and selecting again erased the selection, though again, not visible. Clicked next. Software showed three distinct scan lines and then showed a green checkmark icon with again no text. Rebooted the computer with minimum drivers. Problem
 persists. Could be that the problem lies in high contrast mode. Personalization settings show that high contrast mode is in effect, and I therefore and inhibited from changing background colors. When I try to get out of it by selecting "none" in the high contrast
 box (as per instructions), I get the red "x" telling me the setting cannot be changed. If this is malware or ransomware, it is exploiting a fundamental vulnerability of Window - the ability to disable text in a way that I cannot access. Am running Windows
 Defender. Not holding out much hope at this point. Suspect there is an "inhibit text" setting somewhere, and I don't know how to, or can't change it.</p>

            <p>IF you keep your files your computer will not be reset to Factory Condition. Viruses can (and do) hide in files and folders and cheerfully remain untouched by less than a full reset.</p>

            <p>Granted, but you try the easy things first, right? Can't see how this is a hardware problem. I've scanned the files 5 ways from Sunday - always show "clean." Ran Windows Defender. Took around 4 hours. Couldn't read the results, because...&nbsp; text does not
 display. But it gave a caution saying to download the latest virus definitions. I had disconnected the computer from the Internet. When I plugged it back in to download the new definitions, it would not connect saying there was no connection. Ran the troubleshooter.
 It said it could find no problems, so can't reinstall Windows 10 or my old Windows 7. Seems like a simple situation: what could prevent text from displaying? Another potential clue is that Windows will not allow me to change the names of items on my desk top.
 Any key stroke erases the entry. Hitting return reinstates the old entry with the additional key strokes. I do feel special, though:&nbsp;of the hundred million Windows users, I am one of two who has experienced this problem.</p>

            Okay. I decided to try this support venue in the hope that this very fundamental problem was one that someone had seen before and 1) knew how to solve it, or 2) knew what was causing it but there was no fix for. I now have the answer to this.&nbsp;It is no.
 The key to the nature of the problem (and its solution) is that on startup the screen shows the Windows logo in white on the blue (purple) background with no text, then changes to a white screen with the truncated 8 person graphic in grey with no text. So,
 the background color, white, masks the text because the text is also white. Also, on the desk top the items are all labeled, but when I hover over an item it displays in a purple rectangle with a blank white label and clicking it makes the purple rectangle
 disappear with the label display with white text on a purple background. Whatever would cause this is the culprit. It is a setting that I cannot access but may have been set by malware. Also, on my taskbar the items are now outlined. I a

            Profound apologies to all. I sincerely did not mean to yell at anyone, ever. I am very sorry if it sounded that way. I've been working steadily since my last post, because I want to get of the bottom of this, so that no one else experiences what I have
 gone through ever. Cassie, thank you for taking the time to answer my post. Please be aware that if anyone needs yelling at it's me for getting myself into this in the first place. I have a long list of the things I did wrong. I did not think for a moment
 that you were saying or even implying that this was a hardware problem. At present, I have lost Internet access and can no longer get into safe mode (with or without networking). I'm not trying to fix this yet, because I'm on a home network and am uncomfortable
 with even a possibility that this could affect my wife's computer. Assuming this is malware or a virus, it is effectively inhibiting all means to detect or correct. I cannot defrag; the command is simply ignored. I could run disk cleanup

            OK, to sum up for those who may, in future, encounter this phenomenon - and it is my fervent hope that no one does - the problem occurred immediately after encountering a disproportionately large popup online, text on a white background, telling me that
 my computer was infected and to call Microsoft support at a telephone number.&nbsp;I could find no way to dispense with the popup, the only button being "OK" so I pushed it, and the popup did not go away. I suspect that pushing the "OK" button downloaded the virus/malware.
 I had to use Task Manager to close Edge, but upon opening Edge again, the popup was still there. I found information about this on the web that the way to get around the popup was to use the Windows 10 search box on the task bar to search for a website like
 Google.com to switch open Edge with another location. I tried it, and it worked. I was feeling really good at this point, so I proceeded to shut down my computer to go run errands. Upon turning on the computer and while wai

            <p>Remember in the future, Mike, these few things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Use the Pop-Up Blocker. Yes, Edge has it too. If you click the three dots on the right of the Edge toolbar a menu will open. Scroll down until you see the words "Settings". Click that and a new menu will&nbsp;open.<br />
&nbsp;"View Advanced Settings" and click that: <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/20aa15b5-4136-4f17-8ccd-31aab59d7e23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/20aa15b5-4136-4f17-8ccd-31aab59d7e23" /></a>&nbsp;Now yet a THIRD&nbsp;menu will open...this one:
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0d4a91ba-171e-4ee8-beb2-0d2e0c18513b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0d4a91ba-171e-4ee8-beb2-0d2e0c18513b" /></a>&nbsp;There is your pop-up blocker. Also your Adobe Flash Player...which I keep turned OFF most of the time because
 when it is ON it can allow drive-by malware access to your PC through your active x controls. Finally, about Pop-Ups. NEVER click on them...not even to CLOSE them because hackers usually reprogram the "x" to install the malware on your device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You did the right thing when you used your Task Manager to close Edge but you did it too late. It should have been the FIRST thing you did. You should never have touched the Pop-Up.</p>

            Mike,
<br />This sounds alot like <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/adding-folder-to-automatic-backup-causes/dac1db00-592e-4613-a3e9-99a43a9384d2?auth=1">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a> 
<br />
<br />You could try mounting the microSD card (has to be NTFS formatted) as a non removable drive and see if you still have this issue. See method 2 <a href="https://www.easeus.com/partition-manager-software/mount-sd-card-as-permanent-storage-local-drive-in-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.easeus.com/partition-manager-softwa...</a> 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. If it was of assistance, please DO mark as Answer.

    <title>Surface Pro 4 TypeCover completely not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sz-insider  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 TypeCover completely not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need some helps on my Surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been used the Surface Pro 4 with TypeCover for almost 2 years, Now the TypeCover stopped working completely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the device manager, I can still see it here (see below screenshot), but the keyboard itself is not working at all. None of the backlit, keyboard keys, touchpad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did my research for troubleshooting the problem. Based on the below topic, I reset the Surface, erasing everything. Thanks to OneDrive, all my data is on cloud, I don't need to worry about the data restoring. However, the TypeCover is still not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried UEFI, it is not working in UEFI neither, but I do able to see it in Device Manage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help suggest what shall I do?</p>
<p>

            <div>There are unfortunately many people with this issue (including a neighbor and a</div>
<div>friend). For most, the problem occurs after some random Windows Update. My</div>
<div>theory is that it isn't a particular update, but something in the update PROCESS</div>
<div>that corrupts the firmware somehow. Microsoft has not commented on this, nor</div>
<div>have they come up with a fix. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it does not work in the UEFI, no amount of reimaging will fix it. Cleaning</div>
<div>the contacts has not fixed this for anyone. </div>

<div>Your only official solution is to spend $450US for an out of warranty refurb</div>
<div>exchange. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can also investigate 3rd party type covers that use Bluetooth like</div>

<div>(one of these is for SP4, the others are for Surface 3). I have no firsthand</div>
<div>experience with these but Amazon has a good return policy. And there is also</div>

            Hi William, not a good sign . . .
<br />
<br />Have you tried plugging that hard drive into a non-Windows 10 PC and see if you can access/copy files on/to it?
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />diskpart 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter (Note down the disk number of that disc):
<br />
<br />list disk 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter (replace DiskNo with the disc number noted earlier):
<br />
<br />select disk DiskNo
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />attributes disk clear readonly 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt when that command completes
<br />
<br />Check if the  drive is still write protected!

<h2>            windows defender allowed threat isn&#39;t saved</h2>
                    <p>I allowed a threat through windows defender but It eventually gets removed from allowed threats and reappear waiting for me to take actions. I don't intend to exclude it because it won't get detected even if it got infected with other malware. I only want
 to allow this specific threat in this specific file. I think it was working well till win 10 1709. It occurred after fresh installing win 10 1803</p>

            Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I am getting the same error but with Error code 0xb0070005. I have had major blue screen and screen freezing problems 2 weeks ago and allowed Win to restore to a safe point. Now I dont have blue screens and freezes, just no or limited&nbsp;administrator&nbsp;rights
 on a lot of standard Win 7 settings, like pinning to the task bar, sound problems.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have done all I can in the last 2 weeks. Luckily I have a note pad on Win 7 that is keeping the business running, but its a poor&nbsp;substitute&nbsp; for an i7 64 bit desktop!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am at the 'I will pay to get it done' stage but its not easy to find experts to do this as its all self service now.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I need help and fast</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>

<h2>            windows 10 registry problems</h2>
                    On my start menu when I click on Photos nothing happens. So when I click on my pictures&nbsp;they appear but&nbsp;cannot access them as a banner with "invalid value for registry" appears. Been on lots of websites with so called success dealing with problem but problem
 remains.

<h2>            Bluetooth headset not working</h2>
                    <p>i just bought a Digitech Bluetooth/NFC headset today and a digitech Bluetooth4 smart dongle, the head phone works flawlessly (speakers, Microphone, Music control, calls) on my Note Edge, but when i connect it to my pc (Win10) via the dongle, i can only get
 sound and no mic, </p>

<p>i have tried disabling, re-installing, rebooting, swearing, googling, when ever i click "Headset AA2124 Hands-Free Disconnected" and select connect, it does nothing, i have tried disabling and removing the Headphones AA2124 Stereo" and trying to activate
 "Headset AA2124 Hands-Free Disconnected" but that doesn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>all my drivers are up to date, i have tried different USB3 and usb2 ports, i have tried power cycling, i have tried it on a Win XP and Win 7 machine, i have created a few more swear words im pretty sure didn't exist. nothing is working?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>There may be more than one thing going on here. You say you bought the laptop second hand...was Windows pre-installed or did you install it?&nbsp; Was there an antivirus application on the computer when you bought it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd suggest you do the following, in order:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Run an antivirus scan on your computer (I&nbsp; use and recommend avast): <a href="http://download.cnet.com/Avast-Free-Antivirus/3000-2239_4-10019223.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.cnet.com/Avast-Free-Antivirus/3000-2239_4-10019223.html</a>&nbsp;quarantine and then delete any infections it finds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Run the antimalware application Malwarebytes' Antimalware: <a href="http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html</a>&nbsp;quarantine and then delete any infections it finds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Run the antimalware application SUPERAntispyware: <a href="http://download.cnet.com/SuperAntiSpyware-Free-Edition/3000-8022_4-10523889.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.cnet.com/SuperAntiSpyware-Free-Edition/3000-8022_4-10523889.html</a>&nbsp;quarantine and then delete any infections it finds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Go to Control Panel, Mouse Properties, open that applet. Does it also have the touchpad function tab? If yes, look for a line that says something like, "Disable touchpad when an external mouse is detected. Make sure it is checked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) Reboot your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How is the computer responding now? Is it functioning as you want it to? Post back here with how its functioning and what other symptoms you want to get rid of. OK?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

            I brought the laptop second had yes, it says Windows Vista basic on the unit but when I brought it had Windows 7 Ultimate, a member of Asus suggested this may of caused a problem.
<div>I do have a anti-virus Microsoft Security Essential which is ran on the other 3 systems in the house.</div>
<div>When I open the control panel and select the mouse button the hardware tab as a device code 10 error, This device cannot start, on the device setting there is no mouse detected. I don't see the line you mentioned.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have downloaded Asus Live Update but when I try to open it seems to recognise in the windows task manager but no actual window appears.</div>

            <p>You downloaded ASUS Live Update!!!!!!</p>
<p>WHOA there!</p>
<p>That's a BIOS 'update' program.</p>
<p>If you don't know what yo're doing with it....you can cause a lot of damage to your computer.</p>
<p>LEAVE WELL ALONE!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have ISSUES with..............................</p>
<p>the Mouse controls!</p>
<p>Focus on that.</p>
<p>Again, it seems you do not know what you are doing with those controls. </p>
<p>You are just making matters worse, with your 'fiddling around'.</p>
<p>TAKE your lap-top....to a computer-store, and, get them to FIX it properly for you!</p>
<p>That's the best bit of advice you'll ever get.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(I'm not worried about how much it WILL cost you...to get the lap-top fixed! It does need FIXING and that's your problem, too! Not mine or anyone else's.)</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Is cookie right, and Live Update is a BIOS update program? I too stay clear of those even on well running machines as the potential for screw-ups far exceed any potential gain unless you know before hand that you need a specific&nbsp;feature the BIOS update will
 fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having said that the question I have for you is this:&nbsp;&nbsp; who and when was Windows 7 Ultimate installed? My reason for asking is&nbsp;to see if you've checked out whether it has all the right drivers. You go about this my going to the Asus tech support site. This
 is the support page for a X58L Notebook running 64 Bit Windows 7 (go back a page and change OS if yours&nbsp;OS&nbsp;is&nbsp;different)&nbsp;-
<a href="http://support.asus.com/Download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;m=X58L&amp;p=3&amp;s=131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.asus.com/Download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;m=X58L&amp;p=3&amp;s=131</a>&nbsp;.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compare the 32 files that are listed for your machine, and make sure you have the same file names and file date. Any file date that is after the date you purchased your machine is a newer driver that you need to download and install on your machine, rebooting
 periodically to make sure everything "plays nice" with each other. Only after that is done can you truly test your machines level of functioning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realize that its a lot of pain-in-the-butt work to go through, but given the problems you're having.....Post back here when you are finished, let me know how you fare, and certainly earlier if you have any questions while doing the driver comparison.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            I have&nbsp;uninstalled&nbsp;Asus Live Update I was told to use by a staff member at Asus. The laptop is faster now I cleaned the Hard Drive so that is one less problem to worry about. But the mouse cursor still ins't moving. I&nbsp;uninstalled&nbsp;my old driver and installed
 the mouse driver on the laptop that I am typing from now (Asus X101CH)&nbsp;<a href="http://drivers.synaptics.com/Synaptics_v16_3_15_1_C_XP32_Vista32_Win7-32_XP64_Vista64_Win7-64_Signed_Acme_Inc.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://drivers.synaptics.com/Synaptics_v16_3_15_1_C_XP32_Vista32_Win7-32_XP64_Vista64_Win7-64_Signed_Acme_Inc.zip</a>&nbsp;but
 I am still getting a code 10 error which is preventing the mouse from starting.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>2nd to last paragraph:&nbsp; In order to make sure your drivers are the correct ones for your laptop, you compare the driver files that are listed on the page I gave you the link for with the driver files that are on your laptop currently. Any driver file that
 has a date after the date you purchased the laptop on is a "newer" driver and you would download and install that on&nbsp;your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, say the mouse driver file on your computer is dated 4/1/2012, and you purchased the laptop on 5/1/2012, then any file with a date after 5/1/2012 is going to be a newer driver than what you have on your machine. So you would download that file
 to your computer and install it. Conversely, if a driver file is dated 4/30/2011, then its not newer and you wouldn't need to download and install it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And what you'll need to do is go through all of your driver files and compare those file dates with the file dates of all the 32&nbsp;driver files that the website has. Such that those with newer dates are kept for&nbsp;installation, and those with older dates are
 gotten rid of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does that make it clearer for you? Let me know if you have any specific questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter

<br />Run these codes:

<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv

            I would try installing the update manually:

<br />
<br />Download the following: choose the right architecture for your system
<br />
<br />64 bit
<br />2019-02 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1803 for x64-BASED Systems (KB4487017)
<br />
<br />Follow instructions to install manually:
<br />Learn how to manually install it:

<br />
<br />If you still continue to experience problems...
<br />
<br />I recommend you block it until the next cumulative update is released. Many are reporting the same problem too and it looks like this update is buggy.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>

<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.

                    <pre><p>If I sign in to my PC with my usual local account the following window appears: <a href="https://gyazo.com/b407f70aef540cc87f438c2514ed452c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://gyazo.com/b407f70aef540cc87f438c2514ed452c</a>. And I don't really seem to be signed in with my account as I can't access any of my files and programs. I believe that Windows created some kind of temporary account, as when I go to "C:\Users" there are a bunch of folders named TEMP and similar, and I can also access my files through clicking on the folder of my account in "C:\Users", however when I just go to my libraries they are empty. I've tried already: signing out and in again, restarting.</p><p>Can anyone help?</p></pre>

            <p>Have a look at the following answer:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/bluetooth-peripheral-device-driver-not-found/7d14b9b9-d2d2-484a-9d05-13f70512c6cc?tm=1317990980836">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/bluetooth-peripheral-device-driver-not-found/7d14b9b9-d2d2-484a-9d05-13f70512c6cc?tm=1317990980836</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After I installed the 'Windows Mobile Device Center' I didn't see the 'Unknown Device' named 'Bluetooth Peripheral Device' in 'Device Manager' (see answer above). I had two items under 'Bluetooth Radios' in Device Manager'. One was the 'Microsoft Bluetooth
 Enumerator'.</p>
<p>To make the&nbsp;'Unknown Device'&nbsp; visible I did the following:</p>
<p>1. Renamed C:\Windows\inf\bth.inf to C:\Windows\inf\bth.inf.old.</p>
<p>2. Uninstalled the 'Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator'.</p>
<p>3.Then&nbsp;a new 'Scan for hardware changes'.</p>

<h2>            Mouse lag</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been having a real trouble with my mouse. The lag is really bad. I have tried almost everything: changing my graphic card drivers, uninstalling and installing again mouse drivers. I am really frustrated; I cannot work properly. Windows 10 really
 sucks and customer service at Microsoft too. Their help looks more like walking around without any concept of really understanding the problem not to mention about a solution. It seems there are so many people complaining about that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any working ideas???<br />

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very sorry to tell you, there is no improvement whatsoever. The mouse works alright for some time and suddenly is just lagging who knows why. I think there is most probably some conflict between mouse software and graphic card software, but just
 guessing.</p>

    <title>Windows Media Player CD identification lookup has become extremely - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> s42bta  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player CD identification lookup has become extremely unreliable</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>I have been ripping CDs by the hundreds to my computer and other than the occasional missing album art or year of production, for the last few years that I have been doing this, I have found the "lookup" CDDB used to identify the CDs, to be very accurate.
 But I have become so frustated of late (last 3 weeks or so) as now accurate CD identification has become the exception, I would say it has been only getting 1 out of 10 correct, the problems are wide in their mis-identification,</p>
<p>From it not being able to identify anything about the CD (all info as unknown) to getting the artist right but the album wrong i.e. all the track info is wrong, or it identifies the album but it displays in arabic or chinese symbols, or the album title is
 correct but it is by some other artist, I can almost guarantee that with a 2-CD set it will get 1 CD right but the 2nd completely wrong and the clincher for me that something is up is that if I insert a previously successfully ripped CD done a&nbsp;long time&nbsp;ago
 it cannot re-inentify them anymore and that after I know my personal WMP databas has been rebuilt from scratch after being instructed by Microsoft to troubleshoot a different, fixed problem - you name the scenario&nbsp;and I will have experienced this pathetic
 CD identification ability. Thankfully the info is available on the AMG&nbsp;database (CDDB) it just has stopped matching the info correctly. So my process has now become that I have had to turn off "automatic CD ripping" as I was just getting garbage connected
 to the ripped CDs.&nbsp;Now I insert a CD to see what a mess it makes of automatically identifying&nbsp;it's content, I then right click the album art (or lack thereof) and select "find album information" from the context menu, I then add, change or&nbsp;replace&nbsp;the&nbsp;"search"
 data&nbsp;that it&nbsp;pre-fills and search for the album, the "best match" that it displays is not, as far as I can tell, ever the one it automatically chose, and sometimes that "best match" is the one I want, but frequently I have to select the second or third match
 it found or try a different search&nbsp;to get the most accurate info. So I have a number of questions, firstly why has the process gone from 99.9% accurate to 90% inaccurate? And secondly surely if the info is there it should be able to do a much better job of
 selecting CD info (at least equal to the way it was behaving a few weeks ago when&nbsp;I ripped approximately 100 CDs without a single mis-matched title, artist or song).</p>
<p>Also whatever has caused this problem, does not appear to be Windows or WMP release related as the problem is occurring cross platforms and across WMP releases, it just seems to be the CD lookup database process that has gone haywire!</p>

            Thankfully for about the last 10 days, the Windows Media Player Database lookup is back to being 99.9% accurate. Due to the lack of comments from Microsoft support and the timing of when the database&nbsp;lookup was poor and then back to being accurate; My
 guess is that there is some monthly database reorg that failed in May but was clean in June and this problem would only be picked up by someone like me who is in the process of ripping six or so CDs to my PC every day, such that a glitch like this is real
 obvious, but to the casual user is not. I am so glad the problem was temporary, but during the last month I picked up a number of valuable skills in using the database to accomplish user-directed CD data retrieval for when the automated process is broke&nbsp;!&nbsp;

<p>Hi NemanjaMarkovic1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting a yellow exclamation mark on your Multimedia devices may indicate that there are no compatible drivers installed on your system. For us to verify this, please check the status of each device. Just right-click
<strong>Multimedia Controller</strong>, then click <strong>Properties</strong>. Take note of the error code and its description under
<strong>Device status</strong>. If possible, take a screenshot and share it on the thread. Kindly do the same with the Multimedia Video Controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the error you received states that there are no compatible drivers, then please get the device's Hardware ID and use it to search for the appropriate device drivers which you can use to manually update the drivers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more driver update options, please check out <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Thanks for providing the screenshots, Nemanja. As what the device status, states, there are no drivers installed for the device so you need to manually search and download the driver for your multimedia controllers. To do that, the device's Hardware ID should
 be obtained first. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In <strong>Device Manager &gt; Other devices</strong>, right-click the <strong>Multimedia Controller</strong>, then click
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Details</strong> tab.</li><li>Under Property, look for and select <strong>Hardware ids</strong>.</li><li>Copy the first item under<strong> Value</strong>. It serves as the <strong>Hardware ID</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Search for the device driver online using the Hardware ID and save it on your PC.</li><li>Do the same for the <em>Multimedia Video Controller</em>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once the drivers are saved, you may now go ahead and install or manually update the drivers for your Multimedia Controllers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Thanks for getting back, Nemanja. Since only Windows 7 driver is available, you can still try installing those drivers in compatibility mode. Please download the Windows 7 drivers for your
<em>Multimedia Controller</em> and <em>Multimedia Video Controller</em>, save it to your desktop, and install it in compatibility mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To install it, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click the driver file, click <strong>Troubleshoot compatibility</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Troubleshoot program</strong>.</li><li>Check the box that says <strong>The program worked in earlier versions of Windows but won't install or run now</strong>, then hit
<strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Click on Windows 7, then hit <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Test the program</strong>.</li><li>If you're asked for a permission to install and allow the driver manufacturer to make changes to your PC, just allow it so the drivers will be installed.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once installed, try checking your Device Manager and check if both multimedia controllers no longer appear under Other devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community and giving us an opportunity to help you.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As per the issue, you are unable to add printer HP DeskJet 9650 on the computer as it shows the printer under unspecified device category when you try to click on ‘Add a printer’ option.<br />
<div><br />
Since, you are unable to add the printer to the device list, let’s check for the status of this issue by performing the printer troubleshooter and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can follow the methods:<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

    <title>The Age Old Tale Called Modding - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            The Age Old Tale Called Modding</h2>
                    
<p>Yeah, I know, old topic. But there has been an overwhelming rise in modding. I actually spent an hour convincing a 10 year old that modding gets you no where. I don't mod. I used to use a modded gun only when friends and I would *** around, but no more.
 Once an hour had passed, I made a good point and every time I talked, he said "Shu-yo-mouff". (Shut your mouth) Eventually I got pissed and muted him (I didn't leave because, though I'm against modding, I was racking up EXP) . He sent me a message that consisted
 of threats to kick me and ban me.</p>

<p>a waste of time, there is no rise, it's just duplication of the three stock weapons really just two shot and mg, and a stock shield. I played a game with a new player who kept saying they did not care that they were using the cheater weapon and shield, but
 they sure cried a lot when they constantly kept getting gun downed in an arena match.</p>

<p>u can never change there mind all u got to do is get along.if they dont follow your rule as host you kill them in a duel which i do and then blast yourself with a rocket launcher once they see your shield goes down two of the things might happen 1. they
 ask where to get your weapon and have your respect &nbsp; or 2. they leave on their own (vast majority is this hate to say) my old rule was kick with extreme prejudice why bother when they duel they will die.your happy and the other person is annoyed.stock weapons
 are slow by the time u shoot someone they used u for target practice already.</p>

<p>That within itself is just priceless. But the "rise" you may be talking about is people getting the game of the year edition. More newcomers exposed to already existing modded weapons, wanting them and duplicating non stop. You don't need to be frustrated
 with them. Solution is simple: Hunter &amp; Trespass skill. There is another alternative method for all classes but for that as Cosmic says: "on the need to know!"</p>

<p>It's simple to avoid really. Never join anyone else's game, always host your own, and kick anyone who's using modded equipment.</p>

<p>I learned that lesson the hard way, when modders joined my game, and screwed up one of the armoury missions by glitching inside it without setting the timer off. Couldnt complete the mission then, and had to start the dlc over.&nbsp; Always host, and boot anyone
 you are suspicious over or anyone not playing fair.</p>

<p>^^^that itself is exploiting a glitch to get in the armory and doing it wrong .u can still fix the issue spam the blast door so u can fallthrough .get close to the far right crouch jump "when you reach the edge to fall of to the armory you look up see that
 steel gratting get close to the far right corner and double jump wiggle the controller a bit and if you did it right you should see the elevator switch in front of you and blast door that is still closed behind.probably need about 45-85 medkits to put close
 to the far right side. </p>

<p>Same thing happened to me on my Siren. I wound up having to delete her and start fresh again, and now I make sure that I always do both of the missions that let you into the armory by myself.</p>

<p>I know it was a glitch. Point is, while i was fighting the devastators, modders joined, killed Knoxx in one shot, then ran ahead to exploit the glitch.&nbsp; The above doesnt work. Timer wont start. Not for me anyway.</p>

<p>Use Willowtree to reset the mission and then complete it offline so that doesn't happen again. Seriously same thing happened to me and willow tree fixed the broken mission. Took like 60 seconds to fix. Was happy that I could finally complete the DLC and
 get that last achievement.</p>
