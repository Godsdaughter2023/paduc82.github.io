    <title>Windows 10 Mail Live Tile doesn&#39;t sync. Notification doesn&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Mail Live Tile doesn&#39;t sync. Notification doesn&#39;t notify.</h2>
                    <p><span>I recently updated from Windows 7 to Windows 10. I used the mail app included in the start menu and imported my outlook account. I found out that when the email arrives, the live tile doesn’t show
 anything and I did not receive&nbsp;any notification. I searched online for solution and found no solid answer. Here what I did so far.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Use Microsoft account instead of local account to sign in.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Lower the privacy setting at least allow to access calendar.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Turn on the notification setting to allow mail app.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Under the mail app, change the sync option to "as soon as it arrives" and under the option turn on receiving notification.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Obviously, turn the live tile update function on.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
And of course, all&nbsp;app/OS are update to date.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>

</p><p><span>When the first time I allow the calendar access,
<span>&nbsp;</span>I got my notification. However, it disappeared the next day. So I delete and add back my account. No success.</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>I got my notification. However, it disappeared the next day. So I delete and add back my account. No success.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I setup my outlook account to retrieve email. Funny thing is when I do that, with both mail app and outlook open, I can receive notification AND live tile update but only when they both open.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>There’re many complaints over the internet regarding live tile issues since 8.1 but there no solid solution offered.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Can someone share any good suggestion to fix it?</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Thanks!</span></p>

            <p>It is interesting though. When I have my outlook open and send an email to itself, the notification will notify. The outlook banner will show up but no mail app banner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I have both open and send an email via outlook, mail banner will show up, notification will display properly and live tile will sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, any idea?</p>

            <p>I did more digging and I found something interesting. In order to make it work, here what I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. To receive notification, banner and live tile update, in addition to those steps I mentioned above, I first open the mail app (minimize it or not doesn't matter).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Make sure the action center is not in the quiet hour mode. The action center by default, for whatever the reason, is set to be in quiet hour mode. It means every time I turned on my computer, it is in the&nbsp;quiet hour mode. To activate it, I need to click
 the quiet hour icon <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">twice</span>. The first click will do nothing and the second click will deactivate it. Obviously it's a glitch and someone&nbsp; already and posted over the internet. Not sure when the fix is coming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. After that, I can receive email banner,&nbsp;notification in the action center, and live tile update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is however extremely stupid. The purpose of the mail app is to receive banner, notification or live tile update PRIOR to open up the application itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I'll leave this to Microsoft to see if they have any answers.</p>

            <p>Actually about #2, it is just a tray icon visual glitch about quiet hours being on at bootup. &nbsp;It is not really on, can see so in the action center popup that the quiet hours tile is not highlighted. &nbsp;It does display as expected once you get the first notification
 from anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reported this in the feedback app a few times, still not fixed after the November2015 upgrade either. :/

            Hello i just had the same problem two seconds ago and it was from the exact same thing the netgear wireless adapter. i booted it in safe mode and tried to uninstall it how ever it would not let me so what i did was do a system restore which means you restore
 from another point in time before you install the net gear wireless adapter and it works perfectly fine hope this helps :)

    <title>Surface pro 4 keeps dying - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface pro 4 keeps dying</h2>
                    My surface is over a month almost two months old now, and only been used a handful of times. I decided to take it to work with me one day, closed it in sleep mode and put it in a sleeve. When I got to the car I took it out and plugged it into the car charger
 adapter with the cord that it came with (battery was low) laying in back seat. When I got to where I needed it (maybe an hour or so later) it wouldn't come on after I unplugged it. So I plugged it back in and it came on showing a charge. I unplugged it and
 it died again. Ever since then it keeps dying when it's unplugged and it says it's charged 81% plugged in, not charging. It will &nbsp;randomly when it's on a always dies when the charger is removed. I have tried resetting &nbsp;to factory settings, I've tried Uninstaller
 he battery driver, and I've tried changing his sleep settings. I'll also add that when it &nbsp;dies while on charge, it's got a black backlit screen instead of completely dead. Any suggestions are appreciated!

 test and exchange if necessary. if not in the US, contact support <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            How to get Google Chrome &#40;Version 44.0.2403.157 m&#41; working under Windows 10 build 10525</h2>
                    <div>
<p>There are many reports of Google Chrome crashing. This seems to be because the version used is an old one</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10 build 10525 this is&nbsp; Solved by the following procedure to download (<strong>dont
</strong>use an <strong>old </strong>version on disk) and install<br />
&nbsp;Google Chrome Version 44.0.2403.157 m </p>
<p>Login as <strong>Administrator</strong></p>
<p><strong>Settings</strong>-&gt;<strong>System </strong>-&gt;<strong>Apps &amp;Features</strong>. In Find bar type
<strong>Google</strong>. Select <strong>Google Chrome </strong>Click Uninstall.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Delete <strong>ALL </strong>settings nothing to remain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>In Microsoft Edge open new tab enter "google.com/chrome".<br />
&nbsp;Make sure you download the version for <strong>Windows 10!.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(</strong>Google Chrome Version 44.0.2403.157 m)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Edge&nbsp;Click <strong>Run </strong>button&nbsp;to install. </p>
<p>Desktop will show Google Chrome shortcut.</p>
<p>Click to start load/setting up Chrome web pages.]<br />
On Google Chrome Menu select "About Google Chrome" and check for at least Google Chrome Version 44.0.2403.<strong>157
</strong>m</p>
<p>
</p><p>version&nbsp; 44.0.2403.<strong>155</strong> m <strong>will NOT work</strong>. Uninstall as above and Download the latest version 21 Aug 15 20:00 GMT</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update : Google Chrome x64</strong> can possibly be fixed by adding</p>
<p>the switch "--no-sandbox" to the shortcut, but to be safe download the latest version</p>

    <title>Blue Screen after using Advanced SystemCare Free - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Blue Screen after using Advanced SystemCare Free &#40;Unmountable_Boot_Volume&#41;</h2>
                    Wont boot into safe mode or original windows OS disc (which worked previously).<br />
I'm using UBCD to try fixing this issue but still having problems. Ran hard disk and memory tests without errors.<br />
Disk is accessible using G-parted and all files are still there. The only thing i have noticed once the error started is that the label on my local disk (c) changed to blank but i then changed it back and still nothing, also made sure that my windows partition
 was set to "boot". I'm assuming its partition editing that i must do, but don't know where to start exactly, and I'm also assuming that it was a registry cleanup that caused this error.
<br />
I am currently using Ubuntu on my cousins laptop to surf the web for answers. I cannot create a repair disc from here. I should also add that my own computer is a laptop and that I have installed then uninstalled a lot of programs. When i try booting from OS
 disc or repair mode, it stays in a blank screen with just a pointer to move but nothing else shows up. Tried fixing MBR, already backed up all of my files, I dont want to format and reinstall, is there a way to fix this issue?<br />

            Per the SMART data the hard drive is failing. 100 pending sectors in conjunction with 10 reallocated previously and one uncorrectable error indicates a seriously failing drive.&nbsp; It may have a bad boot sector as well as many other bad sectors.&nbsp; Back up
 your data as soon as possible and replace the drive.<br />
It may still be possible to clone the system and repair it on the replacement.&nbsp; <br />

<h2>            Migrating Windows 10 to another machine with VMWare Fusion</h2>
                    <p>I moved my VMware Fusion with Windows 10 to another temporary machine while my previous one is worked on. &nbsp;Fusion seemed to transfer, but Windows 10 won't start up. &nbsp;It keeps telling me that my PC did not start correctly. &nbsp;Do I have to reactivate Windows
 10 somehow and how do I reactivate it without a key since it was a free upgrade?</p>

            Hi rkick1,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers community.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I would suggest you to answer the below questions for better understanding of the issue.<br />
<br />
a.&nbsp;What are the names of these dll files?<br />
b.&nbsp;Did you have these files on desktop before upgrading to windows7?<br />
c.&nbsp;Did those dll files appear as soon as upgrade completed?
<p>Usually the dll files are placed in system 32 folder.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I would suggest you to run an online malware/virus scan on the computer.<br />

<p>You could try doing this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a.&nbsp; &nbsp;remove every instance (i.e. any files) that may have been installed when you set up the wireless mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b.&nbsp; &nbsp;find a USB port that works (e.g. you could plug in another piece of hardware to check that the port is working).</p>
<p>
</p><p>c.&nbsp; &nbsp;shut down the computer completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>d.&nbsp; &nbsp;insert the wireless transmitter into the USB port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>e.&nbsp; &nbsp;boot up the computer and check the mouse operation.</p>

            <p>Thanks for replying and sorry I could not get back sooner.</p>
<p>I did not have a thread previously and I think it is different from that one.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>My computer was updated to 8.1 back in December and I have received and installed updates since then. The problem is with RB3000850.&nbsp;&nbsp; It actually installs and ONLY on the restart it does not complete (Couldn't complete install) then it uninstalls the update
 and reboots.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Update History screen it shows as INSTALLED&nbsp;in a couple instances and in others as&nbsp; FAILED.&nbsp; The last time as FAILED.&nbsp; The code it is giving for failing is 80240440.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is due to my trying to install it several times while trying
 different things, i.e. removing my firewall. security software, changing to manual updates and updating manually and restarting manually.&nbsp;&nbsp; NO SUCCESS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the "Installed Updates" screen it is NOT listed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I reset my windows&nbsp;update to automatic and it keeps showing that I have one critical update RB3000850.&nbsp;&nbsp; This, of course, is the one I am having trouble installing.&nbsp;&nbsp; All further help would be appreciated.

You replaced a Norton application with a Bitdefender application in April of&nbsp;2013,&nbsp;"upgraded" the Vista 32-bit computer to Win8 in December (<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-hardware/i-upgraded-from-vista-to-windows-8/d83dcb49-46ca-43bb-9082-d427a1aaf3ee">not
 October</a>)&nbsp;of 2013, and then installed Win8.1 in December of 2014, is that correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. In Windows Explorer [<strong>WinKey+E</strong>], navigate to &amp; right-click on:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>C:\Program Files\</strong><em><strong>Bitdefender</strong> &lt;=this folder</em></p>
<p><br />
Select PROPERTIES: What's the CREATED date displayed on the resulting GENERAL tab?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3a. Had the Norton subscription already expired by the time you replaced it with the Bitdefender application?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3b. <em>I know it was a long time&nbsp;ago but... =&gt;</em> Did you (a) uninstall the Norton application AND THEN (b) download/run the Norton Removal Tool &amp; reboot (c) BEFORE you installed the Bitdefender application (and, by extension, before you upgraded to Win8)?</p>
<ul>
<li>Fact: Norton (and McAfee) applications are <em>notorious </em>for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly. The "leftovers" may be your troublemaker here.</li></ul>
<p>4. Open Internet Explorer Desktop then execute the keyboard shortcut <strong>ALT+H+A</strong> =&gt; Does the second line of text in the resulting ABOUT tab read
<strong>Update Versions: 11.0.16 (KB3021952)</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Do you have backups of ALL the changes&nbsp;that "Registry Cleanup, Optimiser, and tune up" have EVER made to the computer? [1]</p>
<p>
</p><p>===========================================================<br />
[1] Injudicious use of registry cleaners may be playing a role here, as well. TIP: If you ever again think your Registry needs to be cleaned, repaired, boosted, tuned-up, cured, tweaked, fixed, maximized, "swept" or optimised (it doesn't),

<h3> jd76_76  say:</h3>
<h2>            surface pro 4 clicking&#47;crackling noises</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a Surface 4 pro I5 265SSD 8GB earlier in the year and the screen developed a fault.&nbsp; This was returned to Microsoft and a replacement unit was supplied.&nbsp; The problem I'm experiencing with this replacement unit is a clicking or crackling sound
 emitting from it.&nbsp; I engaged MS and we fully updated the drivers etc and tests were ran on it.&nbsp; The noise abated however it is back intermittently.&nbsp; The issue I have is that this is not a cheap device over £1,000 pounds in the UK and I'm very unhappy with
 the devices I've had to date.&nbsp; Can I return this device for a new device as I'm not confident that this will correct itself and I'll be left with a unit out of warranty.&nbsp; I'm not exactly sure what is causing this sound hence the reason for posting this under
 the 'Sound and camera' thread.&nbsp; Please feel free to move if I have logged this in the wrong category.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else experienced this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks John..<br />

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, this is likely a hardware-related issue. Can you tell us when do you hear this clicking / crackling noise? Is it a continuous&nbsp;noise or does it happen randomly?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you return the Surface device, it will be evaluated by our technician and they will make the final recommendation. To clarify, how did you process the product replacement last time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to hearing from you.</p>

<p>Thanks Edjay, first I'm sorry for the delay in replying.&nbsp; I returned my original unit through the support function on the microsoft website.&nbsp; I was asked to packaged and this was shipped to Germany.&nbsp; The turnaround was reasonably quick and a replacement
 was sent out.&nbsp; White boxed.&nbsp; From what I gather I'm not sure if these replacements are new machines or refurbished tablets?&nbsp; From what I can see on the forums these are refurbished.&nbsp; When I received my new device it was in excellent condition, however as you
 know when you receive a new device it has to perform various updates to bring it to the current level.&nbsp; It was during these updates that the device began making a terrible noise.&nbsp; Genuinely I thought it was going to catch fire or something similar.&nbsp; I contacted
 MS and a support agent took me through various steps and the noise went away.&nbsp; If you review this ticket you will see what was performed and I sent a MP3 file or equivalent with the noise I was experiencing.&nbsp; Since then it has been intermittent and harder
 to pin down.&nbsp; I'm more than happy to run any diagnostics against this machine, however personally I don't think this should be the case.&nbsp; I spent good money on this and it is an expensive purchase.&nbsp; I'm just not confidant that this'll not raise it's head in
 the future and by this time my warranty will have expired.&nbsp; I'm sure you'll agree Edjay that I'm not being unreasonable and if I buy a brand new product I'd expect the replacement to be brand new as well.&nbsp; I'm getting the keyboard, Pen and mouse for my xmas
 and I just want to feel confident that the surface will last a few years at the least and I'm afraid after 2 units it's not looking very well.&nbsp; Can you advise on the next steps I should take?&nbsp; Thanks again for all your help John.</p>

 the drivers 50+ times and no effect. I have the drivers from here: Im choosing Windows 8 64-bit as i have and "<span style="color: rgba(61, 61, 61, 1)">Atheros LAN driver&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(61, 61, 61, 1)">2.1.0.7"</span>
<div>When the issue began i had Windows 7 64-bit so i went to upgrade to Windows 8, and hoped to get this problem fixed. But the same problem appeard in Windows 8 :/</div>

<strong>1.</strong> Check with Gigabyte Support, their on-line documentation, and drivers. Double check for</p>
<p>even newer versions of that driver. Also check with Atheros Support and their drivers to see<br />
if there are newer versions available.<br />
<br />
BiosVersion = F12e<br />
BiosReleaseDate = 11/21/2012 &lt;-- check for updates to the<strong> BIOS</strong>, <strong>

<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Are you running Daemon Tools or Alcohol which uses SPTD.sys which has been known to<br />
cause issues. Remove/Disable SPTD.sys to see if that has an effect. You can try re-enabling<br />
it when the issues are resolved.<br />

<strong>BCCode: D1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000000D1<br />
<br />
</strong>Think Video drivers mainly though it can be others. See the driver section in my generic

<strong>BCCode: D1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000000D1</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Bug Check 0xD1: DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL <br />
<br />
</strong>The DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL bug check has a value of 0x000000D1. This indicates that a kernel-mode driver attempted to access pageable memory at a process IRQL that was too high.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code</strong> </p>
<p><br />
If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call the
 manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.</p>
<p><br />
If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p><br />
These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>
<p><strong>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL Parameters</strong> </p>
<p><br />
The following parameters are displayed on the blue screen.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Cause</strong> </p>
<p><br />
A driver tried to access an address that is pageable (or that is completely invalid) while the IRQL was too high.</p>
<p><br />
This bug check is usually caused by drivers that have used improper addresses.</p>
<p><br />
If the first parameter has the same value as the fourth parameter, and the third parameter indicates an execute operation, this bug check was likely caused by a driver that was trying to execute code when the code itself was paged out. Possible causes for the
 page fault include the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The function was marked as pageable and was running at an elevated IRQL (which includes obtaining a lock).</p>
</li><li>
<p>The function call was made to a function in another driver, and that driver was unloaded.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The function was called by using a function pointer that was an invalid pointer.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p><br />
To begin debugging, use a kernel debugger to get a stack trace.</p>
<p><br />
If the problem is caused by the driver that you are developing, make sure that the function that was executing at the time of the bug check is not marked as pageable or does not call any other inline functions that could be paged out.
<br />
<br />

<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click
<br />
UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right
<br />
Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to<br />
show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

    <title>How to rename External HDD in Window 8&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carina8592  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to rename External HDD in Window 8&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have <strong>Seagate Backup Plus Portable Drive</strong> (500 GB) and <strong>
WD Element</strong> (1TB). I am using Window 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I plug in either one of them, their original names got auto-changed by the Computer. For example,
<strong>Element</strong> auto-changed name to <strong>Local Disk (H)</strong> and
<strong>Seagate</strong> to <strong>Local Disk (G)</strong>. I tried to rename both the HDDs but it doesn't work. But both HDDs functioned properly (I can opened it and transferred files). I even tried using
<strong>Disk Management</strong> to rename the HDD but it won't change at all in the Computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not only that, when my friend plug in her <strong>Pendrive</strong> or me plug in my
<strong>Smartphone</strong> usb connection. Both got auto-changed names too. For example, when I connected my
<strong>Vivo X5</strong>&nbsp;in Computer, it usually appeared <strong>Vivo (I)</strong> and
<strong>Sd Card (F)</strong>. Then sometime later, it auto-changed to <strong>Removable Disk (I)</strong> and
<strong>Removable Disk (F)</strong>. As for my friend part, after she plug in her
<strong>Pendrive</strong> into my Computer, her <strong>Pendrive</strong> name changed to
<strong>Removable Disk (J)</strong>. When she plug in her <strong>Pendrive</strong> into her own Computer, she couldn't rename her
<strong>Pendrive</strong> at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this because of <strong>Bug</strong>? or <strong>Virus</strong>? Does that mean, I have to format my
<strong>Compute</strong><strong>r</strong>,<strong> HDDs</strong>,<strong> Pendrive</strong> and<strong> Smartphone</strong>???</p>
<p>I did performed <strong>Window Defender Scan</strong>, but it didn't detect anything. So, I tried off my
<strong>Window Defender</strong> and used <strong>Panda Antivirus Scan</strong> but detect no virus at all too. What should I do?</p>

<h2>            Unable to enter password at UAC prompt</h2>
                    I am the only one on this computer, no other accounts show up and yet when I try to install software I"m asked for a UAC password but there is no place to put the password in and the "Yes" button is greyed out. How do I make myself the administrator of
 this computer in order to be able to enter a password?? So frustrating!!!

            There are two effective fixes for that issue.    The first involves adding the User back to the Administrative group where it may have been lost.  If that doesn't work then enable the Hidden Admin used only in emergencies to create a new User Account to replace the old one, moving files over before deleting it.  <br /><br />First fix here:  <a href="http://troubleshooter.xyz/wiki/fix-yes-button-grayed-out-in-user-account-control/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://troubleshooter.xyz/wiki/fix-yes-button-g...</a><br /><br />Second fix here:  <a href="https://winaero.com/blog/fix-yes-button-disabled-in-uac-dialogs-in-windows-10-windows-8-and-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/fix-yes-button-disable...</a><br /><br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Xbox One Power Boost option - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tropicaldr dank  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Power Boost option</h2>
                    
<p><span>I sent a copy of this to Microsoft and they need Community Validation, well from the Community. You can skip the first few paragraphs, my idea originally came from Microsoft a few years ago when they were going to build 2 different Xbox's
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;To whom it may concern,&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My name is Brandon Donnelly I am a Digital Science student at Kent State University In Ohio. Over the last 20 years I have been playing Video Games and absolutely love being able to escape the day to day grind and dive into a game
 with friends. Over the last 13 years I have seen Microsoft Xbox division grow by leaps and bounds, I have enjoyed countless hours with friends and family because of and thanks to Xbox Live (The Best Online Service for consoles). I have seen a bunch of different
 shapes and designs for the systems themselves as well as for the controllers and have a pretty good understanding of what a gaming console should do and be. That is also my opinion so i am writing this email for a couple good ideas on the Xbox One console.
 For starters I believe that consoles are here to compete with gaming PC's otherwise gaming consoles would not exist if it wasn't for how expensive Gaming PC's are. Competition breeds creativity!</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>My first idea actually came to me from Microsoft a few years ago you at Microsoft were entertaining the idea of making two consoles, one a Cable set-top box that interacts with you're TV and plays casual games such as Arcade games or even mobile versions
 or lite versions of games, it also interacted with other media devices in the household. The second was a gaming powerhouse console made for gamers by gamers, this was like music to my ears I had waited 8 years for what sounded at the time what was to be the
 best console ever made in my mind. Fast forward a couple years I have a system that like the PS3 is a "media" console which failed because consoles are for gaming first and foremost.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>&nbsp;Now I will go back 13 years when the original Xbox was made it was intended for male gamers 18-35 years of age and the same rang true for the Xbox 360.&nbsp;The Xbox division at Microsoft is and always will be a "gaming" division of Microsoft and I believe
 is trying to be something that it is not, A media console! SO I own the original Xbox, I am on my 7th Xbox 360 due to abuse and malfunction, and purchased a Day One Xbox One. You could say I have spent thousands of hours scouring dungeons and playing games,
 all my life loving them as well as a true passion for gaming and don't like when something has the potential to be great only to be let down by someone whom doesn't know anything about games, making decisions about "Gaming" consoles, and making them "media"
 consoles. I believe This goes against the Xbox brand which is a gaming division, so when things like a media console are made I scratch my head in curiosity wondering who would do such a thing and will I ever see a "gaming" console again from Microsoft? I'll
 be honest, I didn't get my Xbox One to play Kinect and plug my cable box in, I bought it to play games which is what it should be intended for. I also believe you have gone against what made Xbox, well Xbox in the first place, "gamers"! Not Mothers and children.
 My uncle owned a Sporting Goods Store he started in Ohio called Koenig's Sporting Goods in the 80's and 90's. He made good money was a great businessman and smart as well. When he was selling the business he told me that he had tried to please everyone of
 his customers and as a result he thought of selling the company to Champs sporting goods whom as you know is not doing so well. He warned me of what would happen If you try to please all of your customers with one product, chaos. It is unrealistic to please
 everyone and I believe is a bad business model to think that way especially when the Xbox Brand was built on a platform of gaming not media.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>This is where my idea comes tied in with the two different consoles I mentioned above I have come to the conclusion that Microsoft really does have a wide range of customers and I get that. With the release of TitanFall you at Microsoft are preparing
 an update which will free up some CPU/GPU power in the 8-12% range from Kinect to the gaming aspect of the console. Which Is a really cool Idea, SO as a gamer I wonder how much more of that power can be unlocked or specifically tailored to do specifically
 gaming or Multimedia. My idea is technically a combination or series of updates designed to optimize the console dependent on whether you are a gamer or more of a multimedia user on the console like the idea you had of making two consoles this is more of a
 software update instead a hardware overhaul of consoles.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>&nbsp;Let's say a non-gaming soldier in the mountains of Afghanistan Is trying to contact his family using Skype via his Xbox One, and because the console does have the majority of it's power dedicated to gaming and left overs for the Kinect and operating
 systems he is having issues like lag and packet loss disrupt his Skype call with his family or when he is using Facebook or maybe playing an Arcade game on top of being in the mountains this is frustrating occurrence. Another Soldier whom is more of a gamer
 is in Iraq and trying to play an all night Battlefield event with his brother or friends in the states. He is having issues with his console because alot of the power in the console is tied up in non-gaming aspects like cable-box tie ins, Social Media aspects,
 or multimedia functions that I'm just giving examples. These are two totally different users of console that want the console to do different things. I would like Microsoft to develop or like myself to help develop a system identity if you will, geared towards
 either gaming or multimedia so that when you first power up a New Xbox One Console you have the option to use minimal power for things like Social Media, Skype, and more for gaming or Vice Versa. The second would be the opposite for a person whom doesn't game
 that often or plays games from time to time and the majority of the time uses Facebook or chats via Skype to friends or family. These are issues I believe both soldiers deserve to have fixed and they should be able to optimize his or her console to there specifications.
 This idea came to me from gaming on PC's where you are able to balance power from to CPU or GPU for when you want to get the most out of your game or balance battery power to conserve energy. Nvidia has something like this and they call it Optimus technology
 and I just call mine your "Xbox Identity" and believe this idea and I would be a major asset to Xbox Division and Microsoft as a whole. I also believe a software update would be able to fix alot of complaints and issues that will ultimately be a better or
 happier experience for customers with the Xbox One. This isn't the only idea I have and would like to share more but won't get ahead of myself, Let me know what you guys think I am looking forward to hearing from the Xbox division at Microsoft!</span></p>

<p>Only reason I do not see this working is that the games written for consoles target the system and expect that power to be there. &nbsp;This is opposed to PC where there are just so many different builds. &nbsp;It may work to allow someone to turn off the game power
 when not needed so that all resources (or at least a decent amount) was catered to only the social features. &nbsp;But when games are played the setting have to be such that they are consistent across all consoles. &nbsp;The biggest headache with PC gaming and developing
 those games is that one person may have much weaker hardware or hardware catered to doing certain tasks. &nbsp;That can cause unwanted performance issues. &nbsp;Same would happen here. &nbsp;Only option may be to let the system dictate the hardware usage when different things
 are going on. &nbsp;That way if someone is doing only social/tv/other things outside of gaming the system is totally dedicated to this. &nbsp;And when games are going it is totally dedicated. &nbsp;If you give the user some option and they want both at different times that
 would be an unnecessary hassle and something I do not think many would want to see on consoles.</p>

<p>I'm confused because I'm not sure whether you're suggesting that the console's resources be moved 1 way or the other (media vs. gaming) permanently from the moment of purchase or that it can be changed at any point AFTER purchase. If it's the former, I will
 not support it; if it's the latter, then I'm okay with it &amp; you can consider having my support (which admittedly won't be worth much). That being said, I do think it works fine just the way it is now &amp; see no reason for them to change it 1 way or the other.
 Personally, I'm more curious about what they have planned to announce at GDC &amp; at E3 that will change the way people see the Xbox One console.</p>

<p>"that it can be changed at any point AFTER purchase"</p>
<p>Well, I would think you would have to let it be changed at any point if it was a setting. &nbsp;He mentioned PC and you can definitely change setting on there depending what you need. &nbsp;But really no setting is needed. &nbsp;MS could do this with software. &nbsp;Have the
 OS determine what is going on and power accordingly. &nbsp;My laptop will save power when it is not needed and ramp up when it is. &nbsp;And you can do that on a desktop to conserve draw power if you want. &nbsp;And it allocates resources as they are needed. &nbsp;Why not here?
 &nbsp;When no game is playing you do not need it for gaming. &nbsp;When games are playing they get the resources. &nbsp;When a game is paused and you are doing some other thing the game runs in a minimal mode to keep it active. &nbsp;This kind of thing is done all the time. &nbsp;No
 need to do something special at all really. &nbsp;Doing this means you cover all avenues. &nbsp;Kinect is a great example. &nbsp;Allow the devs to use that power for games (I read that they are) if so desired. &nbsp;If not, then leave it with Kinect. &nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no "power problem". The issues surrounding Xbox One are not things that can be solved by flipping a switch or making some sort of magical partitioning change at boot or on the fly.</p>
<p>Xbox One is not a PC, it's a 360 on steroids. If devs don't treat it that way then they're not going to wring much performance from it. The same problem exists (albeit to a lesser extent) with the PS4.

<p>IceStorm, I may have read him wrong but I think he is talking about letting the user chose how the system resources are used more than saying there is a power problem. &nbsp;Sort of like letting the user decide if they want to use the system more for social/media
 type things and the system allocates resources more for that. &nbsp;Or a gaming option which allocates those resources for that. &nbsp;Still unneeded as the system should be doing that already.

<p>@Icestorm I know they don't listen to this post they only allow 250-500 words maximum so I sent an email I received from Microsoft , A manager at Microsoft said my idea needs validation from the community, if you skip to the Guerrero Ultimo he understands
 what i'm trying to say. Actually the Xbox One has the same exact Architecture as PC so in theory If you read into exactly what was updated in this months Titanfall update, Microsoft took 12% &nbsp;of the CPU/GPU power dedicated to the Kinect and they released this
 power and allocated it into gaming and I believe this same thing can be done with the rest of the system when I won't be putting my cable box into the Xbox and never use the Kinect so I think more power could be allocated elsewhere as well as other programs
 running on the OS in the Xbox. This power allocation was done through a software update and I don't think it should be that big of a problem. Also I want this theoretical software update able to be reversed at will with a reboot of the system. I don't have
 all the kinks worked out and have yet to finish school but I know for a fact this is somehow possible and have Microsoft Management telling me it's not out of the question, it's an early stage concept that has to be refined and will be looked at again after
 i get validation.</p>

<h2>            You do not have permission to schedule Skype meetings on behalf of the owner - OWA works&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all!</p>
<p>I'm having this issue when user A tries to schedule a Skype for Business meeting in user B's calendar.</p>
<p>Delegate access has been given from user B's Outlook and user can complete all delegate tasks as expected except for this element.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Details:</p>
<p>Both users on Outlook 2013 with latest updates</p>
<p>Both users on Skype for Business Client</p>
<p>No on-prem, everything is online with 365 (we do not have voice enabled).</p>
<p>We have over 16000 users and at least 1000 of them use this functionality without issue.</p>
<p>User A can login to OWA and successfully schedule a Skype meeting for User B.</p>
<p>User A DOES NOT appear under the Delegates heading in User B's Skype for Business client (this I think is where the issue lies).</p>
<p>MAPI status is OK for both users.</p>
<p>All testing has been completed on users computers and also on clean built Windows 7 Enterprise laptops with the same result.</p>
<p>I made myself a delegate of User B's Calendar and could not schedule a Skype meeting nor did I appear under the Delegates heading in **** client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any clues would be greatly appreciated dear community!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>many thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Rmarney,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the KB <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/2671103" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/2671103</a>, after the delegate is added, the delegator must sign out and then sign back in to the Skype for Business client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, please check the following prerequisites of the “delegate Skype for Business meeting” feature:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. On the owner’s Outlook delegate setting, the delegate (admin assistants) must be listed to have correct delegate permission. To set the permission in the Outlook for Windows (this cannot be set up on the Outlook for Mac client):</p>
<p>a. Configure the owner’s account on the Outlook for Windows client, click File &gt; Account Settings &gt; Delegate Access &gt; Add.</p>
<p>b. Find and add the name of the person who is going to be the delegate.</p>
<p>c. Click the Calendar menu, and select Editor right.</p>
<p>2. On the owner’s machine, Outlook must be running default profile that align with the current sign-in Skype for Business account.</p>
<p>3. Both owner and delegate must be running Skype for Business full client, basic client does not support this feature. A full Skype for Business application can only be downloaded from Office 365 ProPlus, Office 365 Enterprise E3, E4 and E5 subscriptions’
 portal.</p>
<p>4. On the owner’s Skype for Business client, the delegate must be listed, this will happen after ExchangeDelegateSync completed. (This is an automatic sync, performed at backend)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Franky</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hi Franky and thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>All of your steps are confirmed as true; step 4 is the issue - delegates will not appear on the Owners **** client; If anyone knows and understands the process of how that delegate permission is transferred TO **** FROM Outlook that would be great as that
 is where (I believe) the fault lies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much,</p>

            Hi rmarney,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting back.<br />
<br />
Since step 4 could possibly be the root cause, please further check if the <strong>
EnableExchangeDelgateSync</strong> parameter is set to true in the Lync client policy assigned to both the delegator and delegate. If not, you can use
<strong>Set-CsClientPolicy &lt;policy_name&gt; –EnableExchangeDelegateSync $True</strong> to set it and check if there is any improvement.
<br />
Here is a relevant article for your reference:<br />
<a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/rischwen/2014/07/07/lync-2013-delegates-pt-1-non-lync-enterprise-voice-enabled-delegation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/rischwen/2014/07/07/lync-2013-delegates-pt-1-non-lync-enterprise-voice-enabled-delegation/</a><br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> You can use <strong>Get-CsClientPolicy &lt;policy_name&gt; | Select EnableExchangeDelegateSync</strong> to check the parameter. To connect to Skype for Business Online with Office 365 PowerShell, please refer to

            <p>Hi Sam and many thanks for your response.</p>
<p>I made the changes specified in your earlier response and have waited over night to test but unfortunately the same issue remains; Delegate cannot create **** meetings in Delegators Calendar via Outlook but can in OWA; the "delegates" heading and "People
 I manage calls for" have not appeared in both users **** clients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have anything else to try, I would be eternally grateful!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>

            <p>Good Morning Gary!</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your reply.</p>
<p>The changes made were:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EnableExchangeDelgateSync</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;parameter is set to true in the Lync client policy assigned to both the delegator and delegate. If not, you can use&nbsp;</span><strong>Set-CsClientPolicy
 &lt;policy_name&gt; –EnableExchangeDelegateSync $True</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also ran the following and can confirm that they are set to true:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>Get-csclientpolicy  |fl identity, *delegate*</span></em></p>
<p><span><em><span>Get-CsVoicePolicy | fl identity, *delegat*</span></em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>After completing the above, delegates were removed from DELEGATORS Outlook, allowed sync for 6 hours, added delegate back in and waited overnight for sync, unfortunately same result.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I also made User A a delegate of another user in our organization and withing 10 minutes, User A appeared under the "Delegates" heading in **** Client and could schedule **** meetings successfully so I'm sure issue lies
 with this one particular user only (User B)</span></span></p>

            <p>hi again Gary,</p>
<p>Just one more piece of info; in the past, I had made myself a delegate of User B so that I could also test the Skype for Business meeting issue (it fails for me also for this one user).</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Friday, I removed myself from User B's Delegates completely, as of this morning (Monday), I can still create regular meetings in User B's Calendar in my Outlook, which of course I should NOT be able to do as I have been removed from his Delegates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have logged into OWA as myself, opened User B's Calendar and can only view Free/Busy information and cannot create meetings. So it is working as expected in OWA but not in Outlook and here I think is the problem, the changes that we are making are syncing
 up to 365 successfully but not back down to the client (Outlook and Skype for Business).</p>
<p>I think we need to understand this process; how does the change from 365 synchronise to Outlook and Skype for Business Clients as this the area where the process is failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much,</p>
<p>rmarney</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Glad to hear that User A creates the Skype for Business meeting successfully. From the information you provide above, it seems the permission can’t be synced to the user B’s Outlook client or Skype for Business client.
</span></p>
<p><span>I have consulted our related team, except meeting the prerequisites of the “<strong>delegate Skype for Business meeting</strong>” feature, the permissions need more time to be synced from Outlook to Skype for Business. Given the situation,
 we can <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create a new Outlook profile</a> or re-install the Office suites to check if there is any improvement in the sync process.</span></p>

    <title>Update notifications&#47;requests - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Update notifications&#47;requests</h2>
                    <p>When I receive a Skype update message, I want to be able to suppress any repetitions of the message.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance: for the last few days every time I booted up (and Skype starts automatically), I got an instruction to upgrade to a new version of Skype.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>From other <em>public </em>information, I understood that those of us running Skype
<strong>7</strong> under <strong>Windows 7</strong> would not be required to update.&nbsp; I accepted a previous update request a few weeks ago but found it unacceptable - I had to remove it and revert to version 7.41.0.101 ("Classic")</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not want to go through the same procedure again (who knows whether I shall be able to download version 7.41.0.101 again?) and therefore reject the message whenever it appears!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how can I now prevent the message recurring on every boot-up?</p>
