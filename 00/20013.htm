<h2>            How to remove infected files from windows defender</h2>
                    My defender warn me a virus, but defender put thread in quarantined threads, not in current thead. So, defender doesn't aske me an action for this thread. What should I do ?? What will happen if I remove quarantined thread? Does defender remove infected
 file ??

<p>Defender will quarantine threats for 30 – 90 days.<span>&nbsp; </span>When the files are quarantined the files are isolated and harmless. It is not necessary that the files be removed. Defender will eventually remove the files from quarantine.</p>

<p>You can certainly buy each programme separately:-</p>

<h2>            Making O365 Groups work like Site Mailboxes</h2>
                    <p><span>Site Mailboxes are almost a thing of the past. Any suggestions how to use an Office 365 Group in place of a site mailbox? We actually started using
 site mailboxes instead of O365 group, because we have team sites and just needed a group email solution. Because O365 groups have files, people started adding files there when we wanted all files in the document library of the team site.&nbsp;</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>Any suggestions how to use SharePoint team sites with O365 groups while having just one area for documents?</span></p>

<p>I am trying to send emails using my IMAP/ Outlook 2013 address from my PC (MS Office 365), but after I hit the send button the message remains in the Outbox folder without sending to recipient.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have tested the IMAP Account settings in Outlook and this is working fine (stating completed)&nbsp;when running diagnostics.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The Send/ Receive All Folders button also returns&nbsp;a 'completed all tasks status with no errors' message.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please help as soon as possible because this is very important to me.</p>

            <p>Hello Daniel,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Apologies for the delayed response. I tried the method you suggested with no success. However, I used a method I found while doing more research. The scanpst tool did the trick. All the problems I was experiencing were a result of a damaged pst file. I'm
 not exactly sure why it was damaged, since I had just installed office on a new computer. This problem&nbsp;had immediately appeared and not after some time of operation. Further, I had not migrated the pst from my previous computer; it was a fresh pst created
 during the mail set up.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Stephen</p>

<h2>            Outlook sending junk&#47;spam emails </h2>
                    
<p>I have a very large address book (5GB) and all my contacts are receiving an email three times a day&nbsp;from me with a strange link to a nowhere page. I have a sbcglobal.net account but I use Outlook exclusively to send and receive emails. I have run my norton
 anti-virus, increased my windows firewall, adware software, etc to no avail. Each tell me my computer is clean with no problems. The address book that is sending the emails is Outlook. There are no contacts in the sbcglobal.net account. sbcglobal.net uses
 yahoo.com so the problem doesn't seem to be with yahoo. This is a new laptop with windows7. Can someone please tell me how to stop this nighmare? My friends and business associates are screaming with all my junk in their inbox. i have changed the password
 and have a complicated to specification password. I have run out of software to run and places to check for problems. I need help fast! Thanks for your quick response.</p>
<p>11OCT2010_ I received over 200 emails regarding email links. I removed my addressbook from Outlook and any contacts in Yahoo. At 4:00AM this morning the emails went out again. Contacted yahoo they suggested I get some anti-software and use their server.......no
 help....been there, done that, got that t-shirt. Anyone have a suggestion? Thanks.</p>

<p>Hmmm.&nbsp; O.K. try the online scanner.&nbsp; Are you sure that ALL of your contacts are getting these, or is it just some subset of them?&nbsp; Is it possible somebody got your address book somewhere else?&nbsp; The messages could be originating from another machine - spoofing
 your from address.</p>

<p>I think you are correct. I think it must be from another computer. The only place my contacts reside are in Outlook 2007. It is not some subset though. I don't have any groups for distribution list set-up in yahoo or outlook. It appears all the contacts
 are receiving. I have 100's of emails return from A-Z. It is treating each alphabit equally. That is why I don't know where else to look. Scans all show no infections, viruses, ad-ware, mal-ware, etc.</p>
<p>I contacted yahoo and they told me to get anti-virus software and use their server direct. I hate their primitive email software! They gave me no resolution that I haven't tried many times already. Any other suggestions?</p>

<p>If the mails are originating from another computer using Yahoo!'s server wouldn't make any difference.&nbsp; If the contacts are receiving the messages every day then an easy test would be to leave your computer turned off for a day (over the weekend for example).&nbsp;
 If they still get the messages even when your machine is off then clearly they're not coming from your machine.</p>
<p>Is it possible that somebody else got a copy of your e-mail address book?</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 - &#126;Drop Down Addresses Missing</h2>
                    Started our Desktop today, fired up Outlook 2016 and tried to send an email to a number of contacts from My Contacts via the drop down menu. &nbsp;&nbsp; For some reason the drop down menu showing the contact details is empty, but when I type in an the first letter
 of the contact it is shown. &nbsp; Any ideas to resolve this gratefully received.&nbsp; &nbsp;

            Typing first letter method is autocomplete cache. 
<br />What dropdown menu are you using? 
<br />If you click the To button to open the address book, do you see your contacts? 
<br />
<br />What type of email account do you have configured in Outlook?

<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried using To, CC and BCC and no contacts appear.</p>
<p>If I type the 1st letter in any of the To, CC or BCC fields, autocomplete kicks in.</p>
<p>Outlook is configured for POP/STMP email.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I note that in Account Settings&gt;Address Book it is shown as Outlook Address Book, but the Type is MAPI.&nbsp;&nbsp; Should this be POP?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also right-clicked the Contact link (2 people symbol) to check Personla Folder Properties and in the Outlook Addess Book the "Show this folder as an email Address Book" is unchecked and it does not allow me to check it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The name of the address book
 is "Contacts-Personal Folder"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything was working ok on Friday, the last time we used emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the above helps to find a solution.</p>

            The contacts are in the Contacts - Personal folders file, correct?  That is the important part. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; 
<br />However, I note that in Account Settings&gt;Address Book it is shown as Outlook Address Book, but the Type is MAPI.   Should this be POP?
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />No, it is correct as is. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; 
<br />Folder Properties and in the Outlook Addess Book the "Show this folder as an email Address Book" is unchecked and it does not allow me to check it.
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />The inability to check the folder indicates the profile is corrupt. You'll need to make a new profile - it might work to remove all of the accounts from your correct profile and add them back. (don't remove the personal files folder).

            Didn't reply sooner, my apologies, but the drop-down menu suddendly reappeared, so the issue resolved.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, yesterday the same problem occurred.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've changed nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the last reply, it was suggested that we made a new profile and to remove
 all the account from our correct profile and add them back, but don't remove the personal files folder.&nbsp;&nbsp; All well and good, but how does one do that?<br />

</p>
<p>My IE 11 went heywire by somehow and the favourite bar now display link in alphabatic order instead. Which really disorientate me. I check in the dictionary</p>
<p>&nbsp;C:\Users\*******\Favorites\Links </p>
<p>it looks normal there, all links sorted acrroding to how old they are. And I don't want to manually move the old links out and readd then in date order manually/</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been my experience that IE will eventually (perhaps for no visible reason) sort
</p>
<p>Favorites by name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Workaround:</p>
<p>Rename individual Internet Shortcuts so that sort by name works for you. </p>
<p>Example: 1yahoo.com will&nbsp; be listed before bing.com. Or aYahoo.com before bBing.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Preventive measure:</p>
<p>After organizing Favorites in your preferred order, export one or both of these registry keys every day. Double-clicking (merging) either key will
</p>
<p>restore the value (sort order) when the key was exported.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Favorites:</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MenuOrder\Favorites</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Favorites Bar (Links)</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MenuOrder\Favorites\Favorites Bar</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Exporting those registry keys:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;From Start&gt; Run (or Windows logo key + r) type in REGEDIT and hit Enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Export/backup the entire registry (for safety)</strong></p>
<p>In Registry Editor select Computer in the left pane then File&gt; Export. Save that REG file in a convenient location. Double-clicking that REG file will restore the previous registry and undo any changes, if necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Then:</strong></p>
<p>Drill down, by clicking the + to</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Software</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CurrentVersion</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Explorer</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MenuOrder</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Favorites&nbsp;<br />
Select Favorites, right-click&gt; Export.</p>
<p>Repeat for Favorites Bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Exit Registry Editor.</p>

    <title>Onedrive Windows 10 constant crashing. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ihugtrees4jesus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Onedrive Windows 10 constant crashing.</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently got a new pc running windows 10 pro, and have been having constant issues with onedrive crashing since day one. It constantly crashes and refuses to start up again. It will run for some amount of time, before the cloud icon on the taskbar disappears,
 the blue onedrive cloud in file explorer is replaced with a generic file explorer icon, and the onedrive folder in file explorer is completely disconnected from the web. At this point if I try to start the onedrive folder app from the start menu search, the
 message"windows is searching for onedrive.exe, to find it yourself, click browse" appears. The only way i have successfully got it to run again is to remove onedrive from windows 10 through command prompt, and then using the onedrive installer from the web.
 Trying to reinstall it through command prompt does not work. Even, then, after being reinstalled the same cycle continues and it will cease to work after a while. I have even attempted to restore my pc to factory settings, and&nbsp; the same problem still persists.
 Im so done with this, and any help would be much appreciated.</p>

            Employee Attendance tracker seems to be working fine for me on My Excel 2007. I do not see any cells highlighted in Green/Blue.<br />

Mention the exact template that you have downloaded and also provide a screenshot of the same to a website and share the link (preferably Sky Drive).<br />
<br />
Also try with a different Workbook :)<br />

<h2>            reminder impact on time&#47;location change</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've dell venu pro windows mango.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've several reminders so called b'day or others in calendar. Just wondering, is there any impact on these reminder on on time/location change? I've changed timezone&nbsp;as am not in my base country.&nbsp;I suspect many of reminders are gone, can't see them in calendar.
 Will reminder goes off when anybody change time-zone?&nbsp;Is this bug or what?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for clarifying.</p>

            <p>General reminders/appointments are stored in the phone adjusted to a universal time, and displayed based on the time zone you have set, or is set for you. What that winds up doing is changing the time the appointment appears on the calendar. If you place
 an appointment on your calendar at noon (12PM) and travel west two times zones, and the phone picks up that time zone change, the appointment will show up at 10AM. 10AM and 12PM are actually the same time. If one person called the other and asked the time,
 one would say 10AM, the other 12 noon.</p>
<p>You used be able to select your Time Zone and change it when you wanted to on PDAs, but with the advent of cell phone PDAs, the time zone is fairly universally set by the carrier. Great for the clock, the calendar however depends on the individual on whether
 they like this to happen if it is good or not. </p>
<p>All day appointments are a bit trickier. Haven't looked real hard at what happens to them in WP. The hope is that they are designated as a single day event, keyed to a day/date. Some systems have erroneously stored them as a 24hour appointment for midnight
 to midnight. Moving time zones with these can have the affect of the 'day' now spanning two days, from like 10PM one day to 10PM the next. That can erroneously result in the same appointment being shown on adjacent days, because of an all-day tag being assigned
 to the entry on two different days. </p>
<p>Sometimes these things happen not because the system you are using has a bug, but one you sync with has a different interpretation, or methodology, &nbsp;which messes it up and syncs that mistake back.</p>

            <p>yea. Being a developer, I fully understand complexity involved. Most of my remidners were set to 7am when I was in my base country. I've lost reminder those were due after 1-2 month(s). I don't see them. BTW, I didn't pay attension for if still present in
 year&nbsp;2013 or so :-)</p>

            <p>OK, not sure I understand then. You have appointments out for some time ahead, one time or recurring?, and some/all are gone now that you changed time zones? They should have moved but not disappeared. If they are just gone, something else strange has happened.
</p>
<p>Just so I'm clear, you are talking about calendar appointments right?</p>

            <p>yes, I'm talkikng about calendar appointments. All appointments are recurring. If I look in 2013 calendar, I do see those appointments which I don't see in 2012 after time zone change. Weird? Additional question, will I see past appointment again in calendar?</p>
<p>Further, I was getting&nbsp;appointments&nbsp;alerts on my registered email id (guess&nbsp;same day) when was in base country. I'm not getting them now! Any thought?</p>

            <p>Past appointments do stay on the calendar for some time, but not forever. I don't really see anything before Apr 1st on mine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the e-mail alerts, that usually&nbsp;is a function of the e-mail host. You can set up something on the provider site. Don't know why it would stop if you changed Time Zones.</p>

            <p>BTW, I didn't configure anything to get email notification, infact I've no email host configured blah..blah. I was in impression that appointments alters are sent from live id or some kind of stuff. It would short message telling u about reminders. I didn't
 any app which takes of care.</p>
<p>You've brought something new to my attension. Main concern is about getting lost or not triggering. Why am not receiving email alters now?</p>

            <p>If you have no e-mail host configured you won't get e-mail at all. Is your Live ID a Hotmail account? There is an article here about setting up reminder alerts.</p>

<p>No idea why you would start getting them if you didn't opt in, or why they would stop if you didn't turn it off.

            <p>I believe email reminders are a default setting on new Live accounts now. I don't use them, so I had to go in and turn them off on the Live website after creating a new Live account recently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why the behavior changed after switching countries, I don't know.&nbsp; Perhaps different countries have different defaults? (Assuming you changed regions/countries on this account.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Past appointments (usually)&nbsp;roll off Windows Phones in 15 days, (though I've had a few hang around longer for some reason)&nbsp;but recurring appointments are an exception- all occurances stay on the phone as long as some continue into the future.&nbsp; The older
 appointments are still in your Live Calendar, of course, but the phone stops syncing them.</p>

 8.1, I had to fresh install Windows 10.&nbsp; I since reinstalled full Office 2016 which includes OneNote.&nbsp; If from the laptop I view OneNote Online there is only 1 Notebook, the new empty one, so I renamed it to suffix Empty.&nbsp; I tried syncing from phone but it
 still no longer syncs; I was hoping as the online was renamed that the 2 would happily coexist.&nbsp; Furthermore when I launched OneNote 2016, my original fully populated still exists (I have 51 items with lots of data) in my Quick Notes.&nbsp; I have spent much time,
 one page at a time, copied each full page entry into a spreadsheet now that has 51 tabs, took all evening.&nbsp; I then retried the synchronising from all to see the effect but it has not changed anything.&nbsp; The original and the new/empty notebooks are both shown
 in OneNote 2016, the original has a cross and will not synchronise using any option.&nbsp; So I have a copy of the OneNote 51 pages that I want still existing in my Windows Phone Lumia 635 and also in my OneNote 2016.&nbsp; In OneNote Online and in my new Windows Phone
 Lumia 650, I only have the new/empty OneNote Notebook.&nbsp; Kindly help?&nbsp; Thank you, IvanB</div>

            This error code usually indicates a problem with Outlook. Under the Help menu, run Detect and Repair. After the repair is done, connect your device to sync again. Let me know if this helps.

    <title>Onenote 2010 tags integration with Outlook 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryanfrank  say:</h3>
<h2>            Onenote 2010 tags integration with Outlook 2010</h2>
                    Hello, I love OneNote first off, and have recently found the use of the tagging system to help me organize the different aspects of my life.&nbsp; I use the colored boxes - blue for work, green for personal, and yellow for other.&nbsp; I use the #1 box for general
 goals, and the #2 box for action items to reach my goals.&nbsp; I then use the find tags function to view all of my goals and to-do's throughout each of the three categories - I love this function!<br />
<br />
However, the next step that I would like to do is to take this list and drag and drop them in my outlook calender (similar to the task drag and drop integration).&nbsp; As a work-a-round I have setup a tag and a task for each of the to-do items.&nbsp; This is a pain
 because I have to create two tags, and always have to check off two tags - which I forget many times, and then find myself checking things off that I really didn't finish, and not checking off the items that I did finish.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Further, I know that in outlook the tasks can be assigned categories, but these categories do not integrate with onenote, and the onenote tag categories that I created do not integrate with outlook.&nbsp; So I am wondering if there is a way to create categories
 of tags in onenote, and then integrate them directly into the outlook calender?<br />
<br />
I have searched for other note-taking/personal organization software - but none of them measure up to onenote in my opinion; however, I haven't found a way to resolve this issue in Onenote and have searched various forums and work-a-rounds.&nbsp; Any help would
 be appreciated - <br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />
Ryan<br />

            <p>OneNote treats Outlook tasks and other tags differently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So while you can have many different types of tags (different colored check boxes), there's only the one Outlook task (and you're correct that OneNote doesn't know anything about Outlook categories).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback!</p>

</blockquote>
<br />
I do this exactly like you do and have got used to it. Like you I have looked around and found no more elegant solution. I have, however, made my life a little easier by using AutoHotkey to define some shortcut keys: to generate a #1 type of task I can do Ctrl-Alt-Shift-1
 and a #1 tag is generated and a new custom Outlook task inspector window pops up - I then still have to assign an Outlook category by hand, as well as a due date, if any. This makes life a little easier.

    <title>Windows 10 UI Design Submissions &#38; Discussion - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> twyla naythias fox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 UI Design Submissions &#38; Discussion</h2>
                    <p>Among those participating in the Windows 10 Technical preview are a number of designers - some are professionals (such as&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/ae78a5da-1a79-4f1b-9fd9-be908091577d" title="Padwick19's Profile">Padwick19</a>,
 who&nbsp;inspired this discussion) while some are novices (such as myself). &nbsp;Rather than simply complaining about certain UI elements and design choices, those of us with a modicum of design skills should try putting forth our ideas and see if the rest of the community
 thinks they're any good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if they aren't, they should at least help Microsoft get a better feel for what users want from Windows 10 design-wise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Although the design concept presented in this post focuses on the Start Menu/Destop UI, Metro UI submissions are equally welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>Just to get the ball rolling.....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">Desktop UI Concept</p>
<p>The following design is my attempt to 'modernize' the classic look of Windows XP/7 for those who prefer the traditional Start Menu/Desktop paradigm. &nbsp;It utilizes 70% opacity for background fields (Taskbar, Start Menu, Windows, etc) to mimic the look of Windows
 7 Aero, though this can be turned off to resemble the flat colors of Windows 8/8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Start Menu field is entirely modular and tile-based - 4 wide and 6 high by default, though it automatically adjusts to contain the user-configured content. &nbsp;Default content includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional Program Listing - 3 tiles wide; defaults to 6 tiles high, but can be made taller or shorter</li><li>User Profile Picture - single tile; left-click brings up the User Accounts section of the Control Panel</li><li>My Documents, My Pictures, My Music, and My Computer Icons - single tiles; self-explanatory</li><li>Control Cluster - single tile; contains:
<ul>
<li>Help and Support shortcut button</li><li>Control Panel shortcut button</li><li>Power Button w/context option</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>Users can drag Tiles and Icons (program shortcuts) and hover over the Start Button to open the Start Menu and drop them in a manner similar to the current system of pinning shortcuts to the Taskbar. &nbsp;Users can also right-click in any vacant area of the Start
 Menu to bring up a configuration menu. &nbsp;This configuration menu functions similar to the customization menus in Microsoft Office products. &nbsp;Configuration menu would also contain a checkbox to lock Tiles/Icons to the Start Menu to prevent accidental removal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tiles and Icons pinned to the Start Menu feature simple drop shadows though, as with transparency, users are free to turn off this feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong>Default (Desktop View) </strong>w/<strong>Docked Tiles/Shortcuts &nbsp;Search Entry &amp; Results &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tray/Desktops</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a8dab2a8-6c20-4575-bdd3-42edda482d0b" /><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start Button and Taskbar Icons are updated to present a more polished appearance than the flat Windows 8/8.1 style presently in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Search feature has been relocated to the Taskbar. &nbsp;Left-clicking on the Icon brings up the Search Menu, while right-clicking brings up a context menu to select between searching the user's computer, the internet, or everything (default).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Desktop Selector has been relocated to the far right of the Taskbar. &nbsp;Hovering over (or left-clicking on) this Icon brings up all current desktops similar to hovering over an item on the Taskbar. &nbsp;Right-clicking on the Icon brings up the context menu,
 including Show Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a how this UI (with expanded Start Menu) appears on a 1920x1080 monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a7e095cc-6a2d-4115-8c87-300902e065ec" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, props to&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/ae78a5da-1a79-4f1b-9fd9-be908091577d" title="Padwick19's Profile">Padwick19</a>&nbsp;for inspiring this discussion.<br />

            <p>Hi Vixie!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm flattered you feel that I inspired you to create&nbsp;this group for a&nbsp;discussion of the UI specifically.&nbsp; I think most of those that have read my previous posts on the subject know it is a subject that is very important to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never had cause to question the technical aspects of the Windows OS purely the visual. in the current era we now find ourselves I believed it was even more essential that Microsoft dealt with the ad hoc nature and appearance of the Windows GUI.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was under&nbsp;the impression that's what they were talking about when they chose to speak about and embarked on&nbsp;one underlying code&nbsp;but a unified experience across multiple devices and platforms.&nbsp; I've now reluctantly come to the conclusion that even if that
 was their intention the reality is that the different user groups within the ecosystem just won't except this paradigm and want completely different experiences on both desktop and devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a meeting today where the topic of the Windows 10 Technical Preview was discussed in depth.&nbsp; I found myself surprisingly (given my views about the inconsistent look of the entire system) playing devils advocate and&nbsp;defending the preview.&nbsp; The general
 consensus from all groups which included Management, IT, Sales and Marketing&nbsp;was that this didn't demonstrate a unified experience across multiple devices but rather a clear indication that there is to be two distinctly different experiences within Windows
 going forward and that Windows still demonstrated that it has no clearly distinct&nbsp;identity.&nbsp; I found it very hard to argue with the general conclusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was instructed to&nbsp;proceed on with&nbsp;my&nbsp;original brief and to continue research into alternatives and to&nbsp;design and develop solutions that would allow the group to distance itself from the heavy reliance&nbsp;on Microsoft technologies they currently have.&nbsp; I assume
 that these instructions are due to the fact that the group itself see that at some point down the road it may become necessary to consider a future for the group without Windows or an unfortunate&nbsp;necessity.&nbsp; I don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I've said in my profile I'm a designer and the something from nothing department.&nbsp; I don't run the enterprise, I'm not an IT technician, I know nothing about closing a sale.&nbsp; I do know marketing and have a fairly deep insight into much of the afore mentioned
 and their individual requirements out of necessity.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't tell Microsoft how to build an operating system no one can (in that respect they have no equal).&nbsp; What I can tell them is that whatever it may be, it better at the very least have a clearly defined identity and provide a unified visual appearance

</p><p>Sorry Vixie! I've sort of&nbsp;hijacked your discussion in the very second reply.&nbsp; However I thought that it did have relevance as what I've relayed is a real world reaction to the very discussion your started here.&nbsp; Loved your first post and liked the effort
 you clearly put into demonstrating your proposed solution.&nbsp; Would have thumbed it up but it seems you can't, only the replies appear to have a like button?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try to watch this discussion with interest and contribute when I can, but I think its clear from the above that I'm now going to be actively if reluctantly pursuing and implementing the instructions I've received from the group.&nbsp; I say reluctantly as
 it isn't lost on me that what I will essentially be contributing to in a very small way is to undermine a company that I deeply admire and a product that has been an important part of my working life.&nbsp; It doesn't sit well to say the very least.&nbsp;

            <blockquote>
<p>I was under&nbsp;the impression that's what they were talking about when they chose to speak about and embarked on&nbsp;one underlying code&nbsp;but a unified experience across multiple devices and platforms.&nbsp; I've now reluctantly come to the conclusion that even if that
 was their intention the reality is that the different user groups within the ecosystem just won't except this paradigm and want completely different experiences on both desktop and devices.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a meeting today where the topic of the Windows 10 Technical Preview was discussed in depth.&nbsp; I found myself surprisingly (given my views about the inconsistent look of the entire system) playing devils advocate and&nbsp;defending the preview.&nbsp; The general
 consensus from all groups which included Management, IT, Sales and Marketing&nbsp;was that this didn't demonstrate a unified experience across multiple devices but rather a clear indication that there is to be two distinctly different experiences within Windows
 going forward and that Windows still demonstrated that it has no clearly distinct&nbsp;identity.&nbsp; I found it very hard to argue with the general conclusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't mean this to come across wrong, but that conclusion is something of a no-brainer. &nbsp;I'm involved, to a smaller degree, in designing video games (been a 'gamer' for nearly 40 years) and the only constant has been Platform Dichotomy. &nbsp;(Not the best
 term, but it gets the point across.) &nbsp;Even as early as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_(second_generation)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Wikipedia: 2nd-Generation Video Game Consoles">
2nd-Gen Consoles</a>, different consoles naturally appealed to different kinds of gamers and spawned different types of games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the greatest ironies concerning video game consoles is that the dominant platform of each generation has always been the 'weakest' console:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa858ee9-808c-4d97-b0e5-7084477303c8" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>People use smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops for very different functions. &nbsp;There's some overlap between 'neighboring devices', but only rare instances when applications are universal - mostly Skype, email, and social media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Likewise, there's an enormous difference in designing games to be played on mobile devices, games designed for hand-helds, games designed for consoles, and games designed for computers. &nbsp;Things you can take for granted on one platform is restricted on another
 and altogether absent from the rest. &nbsp;Console system specs are standardized, but there's no knowing the specs for other platforms. &nbsp;(Well, apart from touchscreens on mobile devices.)</p>
<div><br />
<p>I'm not entirely sure that all these devices <em><strong>can</strong></em> be brought together under a single unified OS -
<em><strong>should</strong></em> is whole other matter.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>

 very least.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've never been a Microsoft fangirl - for the most part, I don't like Microsoft at all. &nbsp;Internet Explorer has never truly qualified as a browser, and web programmers are sick to death of having to write hacks and workarounds to support it because a lot
 of users don't know any better. &nbsp;Video game consoles were a refuge from Microsoft until they decided to strong-arm their way into that market. &nbsp;Google grew into such a force that it became a verb, so Microsoft decided to force their way into that arena with
 Bing (and force it on people who don't know how to change the defaults). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now they're trying to shoe-horn their way into the mobile OS market with an end-run via their dominance as a computer OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>That being said</em></strong>, the downside of integrity is having to be fair and honest. &nbsp;As much as I despised Windows as a graphical shell, it has grown on me as a true OS. &nbsp;The trope about "upgrading Windows every other version - no exceptions"
 exists for very good reason - Microsoft falls into the "too big to fail" trap, makes some bone-headed blunders on a new OS, then back-tracks to deliver in the next OS what they should have focused on in the one before. &nbsp;95, 98SE, XP, and Windows 7 were all
 awesome - 98, Me, Vista, and Windows 8 were all failures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The jury's still out on 8.1 - hard to say whether it counts as a successor to Windows 8 or just a patch for it.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>I was instructed to&nbsp;proceed on with&nbsp;my&nbsp;original brief and to continue research into alternatives and to&nbsp;design and develop solutions that would allow the group to distance itself from the heavy reliance&nbsp;on Microsoft technologies they currently have.&nbsp; I assume
 that these instructions are due to the fact that the group itself see that at some point down the road it may become necessary to consider a future for the group without Windows or an unfortunate&nbsp;necessity.&nbsp; I don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Start menu should be re-instated in a fashion that it becomes the&nbsp;essential Windows component&nbsp;the users clearly believe it is. &nbsp;It should be extended to the tablet to replace the Charms Bar so users of both desktop and tablet&nbsp;can interchange between
 the two in a familiar fashion&nbsp; confident that they know how to use either medium intuitively and that they're in a&nbsp;clearly defined ecosystem they both understand and can use equally well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's the one major sticking point in this entire situation - innovation for the sake of innovation defeats its own purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By and large, standardization is a good thing. &nbsp;This is where I believe Windows 10 can really shine and usher in a whole new paradigm in computing - assuming, of course, that Microsoft doesn't fumble at the 5-yard-line and let someone else return it for
 a touchdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest point of contention, quite obviously, is going to be what Windows 10
<em><strong>looks</strong></em> like on all these different platforms - hence, the point of this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The more I think on this, the more I begin to wonder if Microsoft should consider going whole-hog and simply open the UI in its entirety. &nbsp;Consider, for a moment,
<em><strong>World of Warcraft</strong></em> - the undisputed King of MMOs. &nbsp;Comes with a default UI so well-designed that most MMOs since have copied it to some degree yet, at the same time, users have complete freedom to alter/redesign it however they like!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some prefer a clean, minimalist UI while others prefer what I refer to as 'screen puke' - the point is that they're completely free to choose whatever UI they happen to prefer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2003e560-a841-436c-8a14-9c465a4ac3c7" />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5ddc81c-95ab-4730-9737-1cdb402d4250" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Most versions of Windows already do this to some degree via Themes - allowing users to completely redesign the UI to their liking seems like a natural extension. &nbsp;Microsoft already has the infrastructure in place to support this. &nbsp;All they really need do
 to capitalize on this is to offer a 'UI Design Kit'.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from this, all that remains is figuring out the most popular UI elements people want on different platforms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Myself, I'm a desktop/laptop user to the core. &nbsp;(Currently have five active desktop systems, three active laptop systems, one older netbook, an ASUS T-100, and a DROiD - only the last two have touchscreens. &nbsp;Also use the occasional Mac at school.) &nbsp;I've
 pretty much restricted my commentary and suggestions to the desktop paradigm because I know them inside and out - I don't use mobile devices enough to rightly comment one way or the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Speaking for the desktop community in general (and I'm on reasonably-close terms with the IT department at college - roughly 10,000 PCs running Windows 7, 3,400 Macs, and no other OSes to be found on campus systems), topping Windows 7 is going to be a pretty
 tall order. &nbsp;Those I've spoken with who have tried the technical preview have dubbed it "8.2" and have no interest in Windows 10 unless and until it at least
<em>resembles</em> Windows 7 (as opposed to Windows 8).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P.S. yes you can all throw missiles if you like, after the day I've had defending TP nothing you could throw would even come close to the insults I've had to endure in defence of said preview.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't throw missiles - I prefer tactical nukes. &nbsp;But knowing the probable backlash concerning the TP, you've earned a bye (at least from me). &nbsp;You've got more than enough on your plate without me going on the offensive.</p>

            <p>Hi Vixie!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I loved your post and yes your bang on with everything point you make.&nbsp; Your idea&nbsp;of opening up the entire UI through a "UI Design kit" under a framework&nbsp;might go a long way to addressing the problems.&nbsp; I doubt whether Microsoft would see this as a practical
 or even desirable solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this would ultimately fix the problem though.&nbsp; The main problem I have (not personally) is that the sales people constantly complain about the freakish nature of the whole Windows tablet interface and&nbsp;experience, in that when you are out
 on the road its slick, functions well and looks impressive.&nbsp; The minute you try to do something it throws you back to what is essentially old school Windows desktop which isn't the easiest of things to either use or control with fingers as we all know.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a jarring experience for the customer and they are left confused as is the sales executive.&nbsp; They understandably come away complaining that if the experience isn't and cannot be made consistent and fluid, then they'd frankly prefer an alternative
 that is (and I think we know to what I elude) fluid, slick and better suits their&nbsp;requirement to foster sales.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other side of the coin is the IT technicians who we are told all demand the&nbsp;return to the Windows 7 Start menu to make them efficient once again.&nbsp; Whilst this may be true in many cases.&nbsp; In my own dealings with the many technicians within the group,
 I hear a somewhat different story.&nbsp; Yes they want the system returned to a point that provides an efficient means of control to them, but they're not opposed to and can see that there could be vast improvements made in the interface that would make them even
 more so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to the nature of the beast, I work from home and we have many of the groups&nbsp;meetings held here.&nbsp; Depending on what is to be discussed, that can involve anything from&nbsp;CEO's, technicians, sales teams&nbsp;right down to general employees and work groups.&nbsp; To
 be fair it gets a bit crowded at times and is a catering nightmare for me, but we manage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When they visit the technicians obviously like to poke around on the computer systems here.&nbsp; Invariably then follows the question&nbsp;from the uninitiated as to whether they are using a Windows system or something entirely different.&nbsp; I have to&nbsp;reassure them&nbsp;it
 is a Windows system, but&nbsp;that&nbsp;the interface has been heavily modified to fit my needs through 3rd party software and my own design skills.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then comes the inevitable question, can this be adapted and rolled out across the group.&nbsp; I have to explain that whilst&nbsp;that may be possible,&nbsp;it might prove&nbsp;an administrative nightmare for them if it were.&nbsp; As it's not an integral part of the OS itself and
 there isn't any way of adapting Windows itself from within the system other than the ability to change the theme in a very limited manner.&nbsp; I wish there were but as it currently stands and is designed - NO!</p>
<p>
</p><p>They tend to leave somewhat deflated as they have clearly seen that much of the information they need in managing the network is sitting there directly in front of them on the desktop being monitored and updated real-time, they can't quite understand why
 they don't already have this&nbsp;option directly within Windows itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yes a "UI Design Kit" under a framework could be the saviour we all need Microsoft included.&nbsp; It could be the greatest thing they have ever done.&nbsp; Will They?&nbsp; I very much doubt it</p>
<p>
</p><p>When people talk about the Start menu somehow making them more efficient, I cringe somewhat.&nbsp; The Start menu as its name implies should be exactly that, not the "Start and End" of what makes people or the system efficient.&nbsp; However I do recognise that for
 the masses it probably does, as they have no real requirement for it to be anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So we are left where we are.&nbsp; Trying to make the best of what's on offer.&nbsp; Will this fix the problem? Not really and definitely not long-term.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Microsoft's attempt at "One ring to rule them all" has to be recognised&nbsp;for what it is, a failure plain and simple.&nbsp; Well intentioned yes, but a failure none the less.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh yes! I don't even mind tactical nukes.&nbsp; As a designer I'm used to having everything I do and say criticised, analysed, denigrated and rejected.&nbsp; It's the nature of the beast, as I'm sure you have already come to appreciate in your own design efforts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers Vixie! </p>

            <p>Hi Vixie!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know you set this discussion up to explore what the interface could look like and I'll try to post some images of what I believe&nbsp;that could be for the purpose of discussion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thinks its important to say that subsequent to the meeting I had in which the Technical Preview was discussed. It's fair to say that people felt as do many here that the experience should be fundamentally different on both tablet and desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'll try to separate them into two distinct individual experiences that rely on the one underlying code base that&nbsp;Microsoft feel must be the case going forward.&nbsp; I'll explore&nbsp;them as a whole, but I'll present them separately as to combine them together
 in one example will only confuse the individual parties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this can contribute to the discussion you have setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>kind regards,</p>

            <p>One other point I meant to make concerning video game consoles...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 7th-Gen more or less divided the console market between Wii and 'everybody else'. &nbsp;The Wii-mote ushered in a new operational paradigm similar to touchscreens for mobile devices. &nbsp;On that same note, Sony and Microsoft have both tried various motion control
 systems for their consoles and they proved to be dismal failures. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the flip-side of that same coin, the Xbox 360 and Sony PS3 controllers are far superior to those of the Wii. &nbsp;(Similar to the keyboard &amp; pointing device paradigm for desktop/laptop systems.) &nbsp;While those controllers have evolved from a single 8-direction
 joystick and button to include 3-4 directional inputs, dual triggers, and nearly a dozen buttons, they remain unshakable as the preferred input device for most software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply put, the Wii can't compete with controller-based games while Sony and Microsoft can't compete with motion-control games. &nbsp;In fact, it's uncommon (if not downright rare) to find many titles that cross the Wii/non-Wii boundary. &nbsp;(Part of this is Nintendo's
 dominance as a first-party developer, but more the difficulty in making non-Wii titles functional on a Wii.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if they all ran the same OS, the demand for video game titles on the Wii would be vastly different from the demands on Xbox and PlayStation.</p>
<p>

 or even desirable solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again coming from a video game development perspective, one of the most powerful tools available to modern developers is metrics - the ability to get a Big Picture™ perspective on how people are using software 24/7. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While a Themes-like repository of UIs would give insight into trends in design and downloads, it can't (in and of itself) reflect what people are actually using. &nbsp;Incorporating a simple UI metric into Windows 10 would keep Microsoft apprised of which UI(s)
 users prefer, what platforms they're used with, and how they've been tweaked. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft would have to restrict such a system to <em><strong>only</strong></em> include the aforementioned metrics, and be meticulous in pointing this out, but it would be the most comprehensive 'feedback program' they could possibly implement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>I think Microsoft's attempt at "One ring to rule them all" has to be recognised&nbsp;for what it is, a failure plain and simple.&nbsp; Well intentioned yes, but a failure none the less.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not a wholly deplorable concept, and I can see where it could prove a major selling point. &nbsp;Someone spends the weekend organizing a few spreadsheets in Excel, being able to pull them up on a tablet as reference during a business meeting would be a huge
 boon. &nbsp;A mechanical engineer bumps into their boss in the hallway and he wants to see how a new design is coming along, being able to whip out their smartphone and at least view a 3D model could prove a sizable boost to productivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not that they'd be trying to actually work with these projects on mobile devices, but just having access to them would be the key point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 'shell' system in Windows 10 is definitely a huge step in the right direction. &nbsp;Make the core 'kernel' as tight and optimized as possible to offer the same base-level APIs across all platforms, then use automatic VM-like shells to offer on-demand compatibility
 with whatever they're trying to do. &nbsp;(Not sure if Microsoft could get away with an 'Android' shell, but that would certainly address the issue of a mobile app library.)</p>

<p>One can only hope. &nbsp;If moddable software (of any ilk) has proven anything, it's that the end users can be far more creative in bugfixes and workarounds than the original developers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A franchise near and dear to my heart is <strong><em>Sim City</em></strong>. &nbsp;The last 'true' title in the franchise was
<em><strong>Sim City 4</strong></em> - released in 2004 - and, to be fair, it was a buggy, convoluted mess even after three patches from the original developers. &nbsp;Meanwhile, fans have streamlined the AI, optimized the game's pathfinding, and generally expanded
 it into such a behemoth that EA/Maxis' attempt at a reboot was a dismal failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few thousand developers working three years couldn't hold a candle to a several million fans worldwide working for a decade. &nbsp;What's more is that the fans took the title in directions the original developers could never have conceived.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We see the same phenomenon over and over - even when end users aren't supposed to. &nbsp;No matter how elaborate the developers of
<strong><em>Grand Theft Auto</em></strong> make the missions, players have far more fun simply running rampant through the streets. &nbsp;<strong><em>Elder Scrolls: Oblivion</em></strong> players were upset about the stupid quest gem they couldn't get rid of because
 they preferred exploring the massive game world to the intended storyline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even with your own mods to Windows. &nbsp;Those who see it want it, but Microsoft doesn't offer any recourse for them to get it unless they go through the same extensive efforts you did. &nbsp;In the business world, making the consumer work for something is bad. &nbsp;(Even
 if it's just trying to figure out how to navigate a non-intuitive UI.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Offering a "UI Design Kit" solves this problem across the board. &nbsp;Millions of people will happily volunteer their own time and effort into developing powerful, appealing, and functional UIs while Microsoft gets to rake in the glory. &nbsp;I honestly can't see
 why they would turn down such a win-win proposition.</p>

            <p>Hi Vixie!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've always considered Windows 8 and 8.1 nothing more than slick yet not altogether convincing mods. I thought it was implied in the "One ring to rule them all" philosophy Microsoft adopted.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Even with your own mods to Windows. &nbsp;Those who see it want it, but Microsoft doesn't offer any recourse for them to get it unless they go through the same extensive efforts you did. &nbsp;In the business world, making the consumer work for something is bad. &nbsp;(Even
 if it's just trying to figure out how to navigate a non-intuitive UI.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Offering a "UI Design Kit" solves this problem across the board. &nbsp;Millions of people will happily volunteer their own time and effort into developing powerful, appealing, and functional UIs while Microsoft gets to rake in the glory. &nbsp;I honestly can't see
 why they would turn down such a win-win proposition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would have thought that&nbsp;at the very least some sort of&nbsp;"UI Design kit" already existed within Microsoft even if&nbsp;it wasn't a fully developed system with a comprehensive framework.&nbsp; It seems to me that it would be the only logically way to even attempt to
 overlay/integrate a mod or skin to the OS itself, but I could be totally wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first set of screenshots are more concerned with the fact that there is demonstrable evidence that your quite correct in that there simple isn't.&nbsp; Which in itself raises questions with regard the "One Ring" philosophy.&nbsp; I've elected the tablet to demonstrate,
 even though I know its not your favourite as I think it clearly highlights the fact in that by (Fig 6) everything falls apart and the illusion is exposed for what it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll have to bear with me and ignore&nbsp;the cheeky re-invented Start menu for now, but I think its fair to say everyone is now pretty much agreed it has to put in an appearance in the desktop experience.&nbsp; So I thought that this might be as equally relevant
 to a Windows user it if also put in an appearance in the Tablet experience, well certainly more so than the Charms Bar anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/23092470-7948-4b4f-9b2d-62abc912649d" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yep! Everything good so far.&nbsp; Got me shining slick interface, slides left and right all fluid and nice and have all the apps there I front of me. Looking good.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0d9b9f90-4120-4d12-b537-73215e6b517f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay so I swipe left and get Padwick19's new Start menu, get that-ish.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f1cdfc19-3dca-4f35-8ed4-8e6d804d4e29" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay so we'll go to "Settings" and it all slides down to reveal the system options. Fine!</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2a395ca7-e41a-42fb-a164-12cd29e15c2d" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Lets got to "Change PC Settings" and change some properties then.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4b0c3f74-8205-4683-b50d-ab22a469904d" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay looks good but I can't see what I want there.&nbsp; Hold on a minute why's the Control Panel down there?&nbsp; May be what I want is in there, we'll go there.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/217784f7-f4ef-4aaf-a694-6f6997cff9f7" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Woo! What happened? where's the slick interface gone.&nbsp; Wait a minute this looks suspiciously familiar,&nbsp; have I been sold a lemon?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this Clearly demonstrates that your contention that a "UI Design Kit" doesn't exist in even the most rudimentary form within Microsoft is correct.&nbsp; It also demonstrates that the whole Modern UI for the tablet ran into an insurmountable hurdle in
 its development.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It became very clear that they were going to have write extensively more mods just to cover the 18-20 subsets contained in the Control Panel alone if they were to maintain the illusion.&nbsp; Or they were going to have to seriously modify the actual Control Panel
 to fit this paradigm and thereby break the core desktop components still further.&nbsp; So in their wisdom they elected to do what they always do and just throw the user back to the desktop and hope no one noticed, which of course they did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst I know the general opinion is that tablets aren't for real work.&nbsp; It rather depends on what you call real work.&nbsp; For me as a designer I find the tablet immensely useful (if not fully developed as of this point).&nbsp; Adobe have been doing extensive work
 with Microsoft over the last two years to bring many of their Creative Cloud tools to the Windows tablet platform (as they&nbsp;have done&nbsp;with Apple).&nbsp; I fully want the desktop fixed and am prepared to contribute to any discussion that explores that.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I think it important to be open and honest about my participation.&nbsp; I want both the desktop and tablet experiences resolved fully, not one without the other.&nbsp; I want to truly be able to move from one to the other fluidly as I truly believe that their
 futures&nbsp;are inexorably linked.&nbsp; I could be wrong!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway that's my first contribution.&nbsp; Let me have your thoughts and comments.&nbsp; Try to keep them clean and polite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck to all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Padwick19 :)</p>

<p>I'm one of those users who never liked the Windows 8 user interface and because of it didn't ever try Windows 8 to any degree. Obviously I'm glad to see the start menu back Windows 10. I've also been placing my taskbar on the right-hand side of the screen
 in order to free up more vertical screen space, the widescreen design of new laptops is very frustrating for those of us who use them as Computers instead of movie screens! Obviously I was able to do this quite easily in the Windows 10 preview. However, when
 I deleted all of the tiles to get back to the type of start menu I prefer the start menu kind of hangs out in space instead of docking against the taskbar on the right-hand side of the screen? It's leaving space for tiles that I'm not using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to move it back to the right so it docs with the taskbar or is this a problem that Microsoft needs to work on before the final release? I'm sure there are many like myself who will remove the tiles and use just the conventional start menu
 and most if not all of them would prefer the start menu to remain docked to the side of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck to all here and to Microsoft on Windows 10,</p>

<p>I don't mean to derail your input, Padwick19. &nbsp;I don't like Metro and I don't use Metro, so I don't feel I'm in a position to critique changes to its operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, I can say the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 ) I wholeheartedly agree with you that being thrown to the desktop while running in Metro mode all-but defeats the purpose of using Metro to begin with. &nbsp;This problem will be further exacerbated by running desktop-based software on mobile devices - as
 Microsoft seems to have made clear as part of their goals for Windows 10. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my mind, it would be far simpler to write new software to work with established file formats. &nbsp;The Catch-22 to that proposal, however, is that it wholly eliminates the necessity of a common OS. &nbsp;I'm sure that tons of Android and iOS apps already exist
 to work with MS Office files (as one example), and I know that numerous non-MS office suites exist for Mac, Windows, and Linux to work with them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 ) Even if everything about Metro was so intuitive as to have no rival... &nbsp;Even if Microsoft somehow manages total Metro integration for preexisting desktop software... &nbsp;Even if Metro (for whatever reason) ends up becoming the
<em>de facto</em> operational standard for nearly every computer and mobile device on the planet...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Metro still <em><strong>LOOKS</strong></em> like 20-year-old web puke!</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/361a1d02-41fb-4884-b8e3-5b39b3e6ac0a" /></p>
<p>(For the record, I had no part in creating this meme - though it's common enough that I had some difficulty deciding which one to use here.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean,&nbsp;<em><strong>SERIOUSLY?!?!?</strong></em>&nbsp; Most of my 'design experience' comes from the realms of video games and web development, but come on!! &nbsp;It's rather nauseating to hear people laud Metro as "sleek and modern" when, in reality, it's a throwback
 to the Dumb Days of web design - back when the internet was so new that we could barely even grasp its potential, let alone think things through design-wise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AOL is the laughing stock of the internet, yet people somehow thought it was a good idea at the time. &nbsp;Metro is barely two years old and it's following the same pattern as AOL. &nbsp;While the mockery it receives is often dismissed as 'schoolyard banter', kids
 in grade school are old enough to distinguish good from bad but not yet old enough to convincingly lie about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let's just be honest, shall we?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the realm of mobile OSes, Microsoft fell asleep at the switch and is desperately trying to play catch-up. &nbsp;Personally, I don't think they can ever overcome this liability but, for the moment, let's assume that they can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So let's look at the evolution of mobile OSes...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the first decade (1996 to 2006) PalmOS (native to the PalmPilot) reigned supreme. &nbsp;Microsoft tried to challenge with Pocket PC in 2000 and Windows Mobile in 2003 to no avail. &nbsp;This scenario is highly reminiscent of the early 'Home Computer Wars' of the
 mid-to-late 1980s - lots of competing standards and OSes were mostly wedded to specific devices. &nbsp;This held true even when iOS (iPhone, 2007) took the world by storm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Android came out back in 2005 and, as recently as 2010, was little more than an 'also ran' in the world of mobile OSes. &nbsp;So how did they manage to become
<strong><em>the</em></strong> dominant mobile OS within 18 months?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We could argue some of the finer details til we're blue in the face, but all those pale to the simple fact that Android was released as open-source. &nbsp;This measure put UI design in the hands of the masses - countless UIs were developed while the core Android
 team incorporated the most popular aspects into the 'standard' UI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bottom line to all this is that Android is the dominant mobile OS (some sources report an 85% market share) because it features the most-widely preferred mobile UI extant. &nbsp;In short, it managed to out-iOS iOS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft wants to gain dominance in the mobile OS market, they have two options:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 ) Try to establish a whole new operational paradigm. &nbsp;This is what they tried - and failed - with Metro. &nbsp;Mobile users don't want it, and computer users sure as hell don't want it! &nbsp;Windows 8 and the various mobile incarnations have proven this in spades.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 ) Try to out-Android Android (which, as an open-source OS vs Microsoft's proprietary OS, I don't believe possible). &nbsp;Microsoft does, however, have three major trump cards - 95, XP, and Windows 7. &nbsp;iOS succeeded by adapting the long-established Mac OS experience
 to mobile devices (desktop &gt; mobile). &nbsp;Android succeeded by adapting the long-established Linux experience to mobile devices (desktop &gt; mobile). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ironic fine print in this equation is that Android/Linux and Mac/iOS both did this by preserving most of the conventions established by Microsoft and their best Windows OSes - 95, XP, and Windows 7. &nbsp;In short, Android and iOS managed to out-Windows Windows!
 &nbsp;In fact, Android is currently making headway in competing against Windows in the computer OS market!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I simply cannot understand why Microsoft is trying to reinvent the wheel when they invented the wheel in the first place! &nbsp;In the chaos of the early days of personal computers, Microsoft emerged as the standard to which the entire world has conformed ever
 since - and they're the only ones refusing to conform. &nbsp;It's like the role the US played in establishing the Metric System as
<em><strong>the</strong></em> international standard system of measure then refusing to abandon the old SAE system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I don't fault Microsoft for trying to become a serious player among mobile OSes. &nbsp;What I do fault is their doing so by apparently abandoning their utter dominance of Windows as a computer OS.</p>

    <title>Is EC500 necessary for Skype&#47;PSTN integration with E4 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tim bxc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is EC500 necessary for Skype&#47;PSTN integration with E4 licenses&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>We'd like to enable PSTN integration with our Skype for Business deployment using E4 licenses. Specifically, we want to integrate with the latest Avaya telephony platform. We're being told by a telephony provider that EC500 is necessary to enable/disable
 the simultaneous ring between our desk phones and our Skype clients (whether desktop or mobile versions). EC500 is an old technology and requires a user to pick up a handset and enter a series of digits to turn on/off the simultaneous ring. This is old school
 and does not provide for a good/seamless user experience. Is there no way to enable/disable the integration using the actual Skype client,&nbsp;or perhaps some O365 administration interface where we can just turn it on for everyone?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>I have done much research and found no&nbsp; article/blog regarding the integration between Skype for Business PSTN and E4 licenses. However,&nbsp; here is an article about the integration between Skype for Business PSTN and Office 365 licenses. Please see<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Dial-in-conferencing-in-Office-365-90d51188-0ba9-4dc4-bd6c-ae11dd1f8551" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 Dial-in conferencing in Office 365</a>.</p>
<p>So, I’d like to confirm whether you have the necessary licenses described in the above article. If yes, you can try changing&nbsp; them to E1, E3 or E5 licenses.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Alan</p>

<p>Thanks. I don't think the article you referenced is what I'm looking for. We are interested in enabling Skype for Business to receive and place calls on top of our Avaya deployment. I'm looking to see if anyone has done this and whether they had to resort
 to using the EC500 method to enable sim ring.</p>

<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>Thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>Based on your description, do you mean to enable PSTN calling between phones and Skype for Business client? If yes, we don’t need to deploy EC500 method first.</p>
<p>To get PSTN calling, we need to first buy the E1, E3 or E5 plan. We don’t have any official information regarding PSTN calling with E4 licenses. For E1 or E3 plans, we need to purchase and assign a Skype for Business Cloud PBX add-on and then assign a PSTN
 voice calling plan to your users.</p>
<p>Here are the articles for your reference:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-is-PSTN-calling-3dc773b9-95e0-4448-b2f1-887c54022429" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
