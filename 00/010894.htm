    <title>HERE Maps crashes upon launch on Lumia 530 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johniel  say:</h3>
<h2>            HERE Maps crashes upon launch on Lumia 530</h2>
                    <p>A few weeks ago, I updated the New Zealand offline map on HERE Maps. I turned off WiFi forgetting that it was downloading in the background. After a day, I went to launch the app and it crashed after it launched. The crashes also spread to HERE Drive+ and
 HERE Transit. I tried deleting the apps and reinstalling them, and it still crashed. I tried deleting the maps from the SD card, but I can't delete it without opening HERE Maps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted the apps again, and waited until today to reinstall them. They still crash. I am planning on connecting my SD card to my computer (Mac) to delete the maps manually, but I'm not sure how to delete the maps while keeping everything intact. Any suggestions
 would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi johniel,</p>
<p>Thank you for your post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand you unintentionally stoped the download of some offline Maps and since that, HERE maps app crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;would advise you to check if some updates are not available for your device:
<strong>settings &gt; phone update &gt; check for updates</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also set date+time manually on your Windows Phone: <strong>settings &gt; date+time &gt; disable the automatic setting</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And finally, soft reset your phone: </p>
<p><span>To do a proper soft reset, press and hold VOLUME DOWN + POWER buttons for 10-15 seconds until the phone vibrates and turns off by itself /!\ Do not Slide down
 to power off /!\ </span></p>
<p><span>After the phone reboots, make sure that your date and time settings are correct. Also, if those settings are in automatic configuration, set them to manual.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>

            First of all, I followed all instructions and all three apps still don't work. Secondly, I don't think you understood the question. There's nothing wrong with system settings as far as I know, I just want to delete all of the offline maps stored on the
 external SD card without tampering with other apps' data.

            <p>I would suggest you to format the SD card once you saved all the content on your pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still have the issue, I would suggest you hard&nbsp;reset the phone:<br />
First&nbsp;of all you need to backup since the hard reset will delete all the content on the phone:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/settings-and-personalization/back-up-my-stuff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/settings-and-personalization/back-up-my-stuff</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you can hard reset:</p>
<p>Settings &gt; About &gt; Reset the phone &gt; Yes &gt; Yes</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you will be able to restore the backup to your phone (pay attention to use the same email address you had before as Microsoft Account in order to restore the backup):</p>

            <p>A hard reset is out of the question, as every time I have attempted a back up since corrupting the offline maps, it comes up with "There was a problem backing up your settings. Try again later."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to reiterate my question, once again:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I just want to delete all of the offline maps stored on the external SD card
<strong>without tampering with other apps' data.</strong></span></em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">With my experience with iOS and Android, I would think that offline maps are not independent from the app that uses it. This is a really frustrating issue that needs to be fixed, maps should be completely
 contained within the respective app, it makes no sense that it requires a separate category on Storage Spaces. Until then, I'm going to have to suffer using the unofficial Google Maps app, thanks Microsoft for continuing to disappoint me.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Giorgia Sa. suggestion is resolution to your issue. If you are not able to backup data over the cloud, you can also backup manually. Just connect your phone to pc via USB cable and transfer data over, contacts should be saved via account;</p>

            I am currently running OS X El Capitan Beta with the Windows Phone app (v 3.1.1). When I plug my phone into the computer, I allow the phone to use the connection, but the app does not recognise the phone, and displays the message "Connect your Windows
 Phone to continue" (ran into this problem earlier with WP7, as per&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/forum/mdlumia-mdupdate/windows-phone-app-on-mac-running-yosemite-does-not/48e57eb5-7c9b-4678-a422-256185dba7c6">Windows Phone App on
 Mac (running Yosemite), does not recognize Windows Phone</a>). There was also a dialog about not being able to find the iPhoto library, it should be just the Photos library the app is looking for. &nbsp;I have successfully backed up my contacts and SMS, but app
 and settings backups are still an issue for me.

            You might want to edit your posting as it is showing your email which scammers like, also the log in to insiders is the one that you used when you first installed the Preview software.

<p>Hi Lonut,<br />
<br />
Firstly, please confirm that the domain name with the mail user has been verified in Office 365.<br />
<br />
Also, you mentioned "a user on prem (mailuser) is synced". Do you mean an on-premises mail user cannot correctly sync the SMTP address to Office 365? If yes, a mail user is a mail-enabled Active Directory user that represents a user outside the Exchange organization.
 Each mail user has an external email address. Generally, the primary email address (SMTP) is the external email address. So could you go to ADSI Edit &gt; the mail user properties &gt; let me know the value of
<em><strong>proxyAddress (SMTP and smtp address)</strong></em> for an successful user and problematic user? Please give me information via private message. If not, please provide more detailed information about it and the value of
<em><strong>proxyAddress</strong></em> as well.<br />
<br />
To access the private message, please click on the following link:<br />

<p>Hi Lonut,</p>
<p>Thanks for the screenshots you provided in PM.</p>
<p>I have checked the value of proxyAddresses for the user. The <i><b>SMT</b><b>P</b></i> address is
<i><b>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</b></i> (in order to protect your privacy, I changed the real domain to domain.fr and the exact user name to Juser). But I cannot find the
<i><b>domain.fr</b></i> is verified in your Office 365 tenant. Just like I mentioned in my last post, please confirm if the domain.fr has been verified in your Office 365. If not, after syncing, the
<b><i>domain.fr</i></b> will be changed to <i><b>domain.onmicrosoft.com</b></i>. To fix it, please verify
<i><b>domain.fr</b></i> in your Office 365 tenant.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Edward<br />

<p>Hi Jen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're unable to access your Microsoft account for more than a year, it's possible that it's already deactivated from Microsoft server. This is one of the possible reasons why you're getting the error message "It looks like there's already an account
 with your email". Another factor could be the email account you're trying to create is already taken by another Microsoft subscriber. It happens when you have a similar email address. We recommend that you create a new Microsoft account different to what you
 created and use it to install Office Home &amp; Business 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, please don't hesitate to let us know.</p>

            Linda, I am not aware that Microsoft Mobile still sells accessories for a Nokia C2-01. Because the phone is more than five years old, you might not even find genuine products anymore. Anyway, remove the battery and have a look at the model type of the
 battery. It should say Nokia&nbsp;BL-5C or something like that. That is the search term to find a replacement battery in the Internet. When it comes to the charger, have a look at yours. If it has a 2mm PIN, you can go for chargers like Nokia AC-8 (fast), Nokia
 AC-15 (compact),&nbsp;Nokia AC-11 (slow, saves battery life).

<h2>            Microsoft Access 2010- I am struggling</h2>
                    <p>Hi my work place would like to move all files from excel to access, but I am having a very difficult time figuring it out. If someone could answer these questions, that would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Can I insert a row in the middle of the data? In Excel, I could just click "insert row"</p>
<p>2. So after trying out how to insert a row (without success), I decided to just copy and paste everything a row down.. but when I tried to paste it back, everything got deleted...</p>
<p>3. Before everything got deleted, I saved the document.. so I figured that I would just exit out of it and reopen it, but no... when I reopened it the document with all the data deleted opened .. why? (also the undo button didn't work so sad.. )</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can clearly see, I am very much struggling... and I even looked through "access 101"and training... I have access 2010 also!</p>
<p>Any pieces of advice/answers would be so helpful! Also, if you guys know any helpful websites/videos, that would be awesome too! Thanks in advance</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>The first thing you need to understand is that Access is NOT a spreadsheet. It is NOT an advanced version of Excel. It is a very different program. Excel is a spreadsheet that excels in doing calculations, what Ifs and data analysis. It has limited database
 functionality. Access is a full fledged relational database that excels in capturing, storing, querying and reporting on data. To approach converting data from Excel to Access, you have to drop the spreadsheet mentality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This mentality is evidenced by your questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Access doesn't not have any sort of concept of "inserting" rows of data. This is because Access doesn't store data in numbered rows. There is no inherent order in an Access table. Records can be entered in Access in any order you want.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if there is a need to sort data in a certain order, then that has to be planned for in the design of the tables. In Access you set a Sort order for the data you are displaying. Therefore you need a field to sort on. And, &nbsp;if there is a possibility of
 needing to insert a record within a sort you need to provide for that. If you explain why you need to "insert" a record between other records, we can advise further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. See the above answer. Again a table in datasheet view, though it may resemble a spreadsheet is not a spreadsheet. So you can't copy and paste to expose a blank row.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Tables in Access are live data. Anything you do in a table is immediately stored. So saving the file doesn't preserve an old set of data unless you save a copy of your accdb file with a different name or in a different folder. Or make a copy of your table
 with a different name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, you still have the original Excel file so you can re import.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One last piece of advice. If you are simply going to import your Excel tables into Access don't bother. To effectively use Access, you are going to have to redesign your Excel data to "normalize" it before you do anything else. A relational database design
 has to follow certain rules called normalization to work properly. So the first thing you need to do is familiarize yourself with this set of rules, then redesign your data tables and re import your data into the new tables.</p>

            <blockquote>Can I insert a row in the middle of the data? In Excel, I could just click "insert row"</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Scott has explained how spreadsheets and databases differ conceptually, and Gina has given you some useful links, but taking the above point as an example, it may help give you an insight into how things are done in a database application if I show you how
 you can achieve what you are aiming at by taking a real example from one of my own databases.&nbsp; This is a database of my own personal financial accounts in fact, and includes a form for entering data into a particular account represented by rows in a Transactions
 table.&nbsp; The form is based on a query which returns the rows from the account, and the query orders the rows by TransactionDate.&nbsp; Let's say I want to insert a new row for a transaction on 12 August 2014, to appear in the form between existing rows for transactions
 on 11 August 2014 and 13 August 2014.<br />
<br />
As Scott has explained the rows in the table are in no order at all.&nbsp; A table is a set, and by definition a set has no intrinsic order.&nbsp; They are shown in date order in the form by virtue of the query on which the form is based.&nbsp; To enter the new row this is
 done in the empty row at the bottom of the form, but then the row magically appears&nbsp; in its correct position between the earlier and later dates.&nbsp; So how does this happen?&nbsp; the answer is that I've programmed it to happen by including some code in the form's
 AfterUpdate event procedure.&nbsp; The code is as below, and I've added rather more detailed comment lines than I would normally to show how it works.<br />
<br />
Private Sub Form_AfterUpdate()<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>' firstly a variable of long integer data type is declared</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim lngID As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>' the value of the new record's primary key TransactionID</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' column is stored in the variable</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lngID = Me.TransactionID<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>' the form is now requeried.&nbsp; This reloads its recordset</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' so the row will now appear in its correct position</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' in the query's sort order.</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Requery<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp; ' however, when a form is requeried the first record in</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' the sort order becomes the current record, whereas we </em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' want to stay on the record we've just entered.</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' To do this we use a clone of the form's recordset</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' which is referenced by the RecordsetClone property</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Me.RecordsetClone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>' using the variable in which we stored the TransactionID</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' value of the new record, we find that record in the clone</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .FindFirst "TransactionID = " &amp; lngID<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>' we firstly check that the record has been found, which is</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' not entirely necessary, but is good programming</em> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not .NoMatch Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>' the form's Bookmark is then set to the same as the </em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' clone's Bookmark.&nbsp; This has the effect of making</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' the form's current record the one we've just found</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' in the clone, i.e. the new record we've just inserted</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>' QED!</strong></em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Bookmark = .Bookmark<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
I'm giving this example not to show you how to undertake this particular task, but to illustrate the fact that a relational database management system like Access is not an out-of-the-box application, but a development environment.&nbsp; There is much you can do
 in Access by using the wizards provided, and there are many templates for common types of databases available on-line, but when you want to customize a database to your own requirements there is no escaping the fact that there is a learning curve to be climbed.&nbsp;
 Don't be discouraged by this, however.&nbsp; If you do the homework and try putting what you learn into effect gaining a good level of proficiency is within the grasp of any reasonably intelligent person.&nbsp; You'll make mistakes, we all do, it's part of the learning
 process.<br />
<br />
The example I've given you above is the use of VBA code to achieve a task, and this is an important part of database development (though in a web databse you can't use VBA, but only macros), but in many ways getting a good understanding of how a relational
 with this, and Scott alluded to the importance of this in his final paragraph.&nbsp; An example of how data from Excel can be imported into Access and
<em>'decomposed'</em> into a set of properly structured and related tables is shown in DecomposerDemo.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
In this little demo, data from a simple Excel worksheet is imported, and by means of a series of
<em>'append'</em> queries is inserted into a set of correctly structured tables in Access.&nbsp; Each query is explained as you step through the demo.&nbsp; I realize the details of this will be difficult to grasp at this early stage in the learning process.&nbsp; Don't let
 this discourage you.&nbsp; I well remember when SQL (the language of queries) was a complete mystery to me.&nbsp; Just try and get a
<em>flavour </em>of what is being done.&nbsp; Learning how to do tasks like this will take some time and effort; there is no escaping that fact.<br />

            <p>It is a very interesting problem. &nbsp;Many small-medium businesses are using EXCEL for complex payroll/stats/job costing/ monitoring etc. where they should be using Access. &nbsp; However, moving to Access is an enormous task and requires some database design knowledge.</p>

    <title>Machine Activation Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> annas11  say:</h3>
<h2>            Machine Activation Error</h2>
                    <p>Hi all. Really hoping for some help. I bought a brand new copy of Office for my equally new MacBook Pro. When I downloaded and installed it, it failed to activate - the error was apparently a "machine activation error". I tried to activate the product over
 the phone: same story, although this time I was told the installation ID wasn't recognized. This happens no matter how many times I download and reinstall Office, and I've worked my way through all the various checks on the Support site. As I bought this product
 from the Apple Store in NYC, it seems unlikely that it's an illegal copy. What's going on here?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried contacting a Microsoft support agent, who looked at my device remotely two weeks ago and told me it was already activated. That was obviously in error, as Word has now stopped allowing me to edit or save documents entirely and is asking me to activate
 once again. I'm not sure what else to do here. Any suggestions at all would be appreciated!</p>

            Thanks for the suggestions, Sukie. I've had some help from another agent who recommended deinstalling, removing the licenses and reinstalling. I've tried that and so far things seem to be working fine. But I used the same approach last time I encountered
 this error with this product, and after 15 days faced activation issues again. So I'm giving it the same period to see what happens. I'll let everyone know if this has worked for me!

            I finally fixed this problem after two weeks. I noticed Outlook wasn't storing password and I couldn't access Managing Credentials from the User Account page in the control panel. After some reading I suspected I had a corrupted Win7 user profile. I created
 a new file and the imap accounts were set up instantly without any flaws. And now my passwords are saved too!

<h3> massifheed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Speech problems - &#34;Can&#39;t access the network at the moment&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lumia 900, and have been getting the following problem. If I use the speech functions in the Messaging Hub or Bing search over a cellular data connection it just sits there saying "Thinking" and evetually returns the error "Can't access the network
 at the moment".</p>
<p>If I try this over a WiFi connection it works fine. I would just put this down to a problem with the carrier (Orange UK), but all other data functions work fine over a cellular connection. Given that, in the UK at least, hardly any of the UK carriers know
 much about WP, it is unlikely that I'll get any support from Orange themselves other than the most basic troubleshooting.</p>
<p>From reading other people's questions it would seem that there are couple of other WP users that have had similar issues, but there doesn't seem to have been a definitive resolution.</p>

            <p>Hello Massifheed,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for contributing to the Microsoft community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the speech function works via WiFi, it seems the issue is rooted in the data connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you provide us with the speed of the data connection (edge, 3G etc.) when you tried to use the speech functions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And can you also please provide us with the following phone information?:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will find the information on your phone, in Settings -&gt; About -&gt; more information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you contacted Orange UK anyway, just to check whether they have any idea why it wouldn't work via their Internet connection?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

            <p>Greetings Massifheed!&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Phone forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest a few quick checks to try-out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I would go to settings &gt; cellular &gt; Data connection and turn-off your Data Connection. Wait a minute or two, then turn the Data Connection back on and try using Speech again.&nbsp; If this fixes it, then your phone's software was simply acting glitchy.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, then I would try turning-off the phone (press and hold the power button until the swipe down message appears, then swipe down to turn off phone), waiting a few minutes then power back up and try using Speech again.&nbsp; If this solves the
 problem, then the phone's firmware/hardware was acting glitchy and simply needed to restart.&nbsp; This could also signal a possible problem with your local cell tower.</p>
<p>Lastly, are you always testing this failure from a single geographic spot?&nbsp;&nbsp; If so, the problem may be the cell tower serving your location.&nbsp; If your local tower is mis-configured, it might make phones operating off of it seem disfunctional like yours.&nbsp;
 Just for grins, I would consider trying to use the Speech function off of a different cell tower.&nbsp; Since most cell towers&nbsp;are spaced about 1-2 miles apart,&nbsp;we can deduce that the typical range is about .5 to 1 mile, so going a few&nbsp;miles away ought to place
 you firmly in the range of a different cell tower.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the problem goes away using this method, it's definitely a cell tower issue (something for Orange UK to fix).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope one of these solutions helps!</p>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestions. Unfortunately they haven't fixed the problem. I'm wondering - seeing as mobile data works fine in general - whether the speech data that gets sent to MS when you do any kind of voice searching or dictation uses some strange ports
 or similar?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It makes no sense to me that email, web browsing, the people hub, and all apps that use data all work fine over a 3G connection, but speech does not. And it's only the the speech data that gets sent to MS. Voice command functions work fine ("Call Mum..."
 etc), it's just the search stuff and speech to text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's what leads me to believe that it must be down to ports or something like that, that are being blocked by Orange. But without knowing for sure if that is the case, it's hard for me to go to them and explain it, or to suggest what it is that may resolve
 it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I am having the same problems with my Nokia 900 over cellular network in Switzerland on Swisscom. It works fine over WiFi as above but on 3g it just thinks and then fails while trying to translate text. Again, mine allows voice functions to work such as
 "text contact name" but doesn't create the text.</p>

<p>I know Swisscom limit the upload speed, is there a minimum upload speed required?</p>

            <p>Hello Michael &amp; Massifheed!<br />
<br />
I'm truly sorry you're having these problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>I am not aware of any minimum upload speed issue Michael.&nbsp; I would recommend that both of you return to your respective stores to see if the floor model of their Lumia 900 experiences the same problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it does, then the issue is most likely something
 to do with the carrier (possible, but not very likely).<br />
<br />
Hopefully their floor model works without issue, after which I would file a claim with them that the device is faulty and needs to be exchanged.&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously you will want to fully synchronize the phone with Zune on your main computer to ensure all of your media
 and music is safely backed-up.&nbsp;&nbsp;Savegame files will be lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretty much everything else is stored in the cloud anyways (your contacts, etc), so you should be safe from that point to return the device(s).&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Lastly, when you get the replacement, before you do anything else, test out the ability of the phones to work in those
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this last suggestion&nbsp;helps.</p>

            Your reply was somewhat helpful - thank you; except my phone does not have the name WAP Gateway and WAP Port fields in the MMS APN setting section. &nbsp;It has Proxy server and Proxy port. &nbsp;Is this the same thing WAP? &nbsp;According to Consumer Cellular, it isn't.

            According the Consumer Cellular, since the Lumia 650 does not have a place to put the WAP settings, I will be unable to send pictures when texting. &nbsp;Consumer Cellular said since they do not support Microsoft phones, they could not help me any further with
 the problem. &nbsp;We were mislead when we called Consumer Cellular to ask if the Microsoft Lumia 650 would work with their system. We were told it would. &nbsp;It works except for sending pictures and being able to download several Apps.

            Hi again Daniel,
<div><br />
<div>I tried making a new file and setting the default tabs at .25". You are quite right about the increase indent following the default tabs and moving at .25" intervals. However, my old files still will not use the interval set by the default tab. They insist
 upon sticking with 1/6" (1pica).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I finally figured out the problem! The style I created for the keys had the hanging indent set at&nbsp;1 pica. That was overriding the increase indent/default tab setting. Once I changed that, Control-shift-M is moving it 1.5 picas/.5 " the way I want.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So everything is working now. Thanks.</div>

<h2>            Is there a way to record from the built in FM radio&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I know the inital answer to the question is NO, but&nbsp;I was wondering if there is any third party application that makes it possible to record from the FM radio. Alternatively to be able to record from another FM radio&nbsp;by a wired connection (not by not by
 placing the phone in front of a radio speaker). Has anyone heard of one?</p>

<p>Many people have tried to record radio, due to restrictions from a diversity of reasons, many handsets makers have closed it as what I am aware of...</p>
<p>Search with <a href="http://www.duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.duckduckgo.com</a> on different keywords.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyhow, if the audio quality doesnÂ´t matter you can try out Loop. Combined with&nbsp;the answer&nbsp;in your other thread&nbsp;answer, perhaps it is well enough for your needs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Search in Ovi store with keywords like Rec, Record, Dicthaphone or whatever you come up with as keyword.</p>

<p>Thanks Ztuka for the suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some backbround on this question. I regularly attend conferences that use an FM transmission of the program so that those who want to record it can do so and those with hearing difficulties can 'tune' in through a radio. If I couild record from the FM tuner
 in the phone and onto the phone itself would be ideal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, I read up about Loop and can't see how it would help unless one of it's recording options is&nbsp;from the inbuilt FM.&nbsp; Anyway I though I would try it as it looks interesting anhyway but I cannot download it. The only option I get is 'Send to Phone' and
 when I do that the link sent by SMS fails to launch the Ovi Store. In fact I am unable to launch it in any way.&nbsp; It says it 'failed to launch automatically - use the Launch button' but it just simply re-displays the same message.&nbsp; I can get to other parts
 of the Ovi site&nbsp;but not the Store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know this is a separate issue but do you have any suggestions?&nbsp;&nbsp;Would it help to reinstall the Ovi store app and, if so, how do I go about it? (The one installed is version 2.12.033).</p>

<h2>            n85 Won&#39;t Turn On&#33; Please help&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just purchased a new n85 about a week ago. All has been good until it ran out of batteries last night. I plugged it into my PC via USB this morning to charge it up, however it won't turn on. All I get is a little battery symbol with a cresent moon up the
 top right hand corner of the screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, after about 10 minutes of charging, it beeps, and the nokia logo comes on, then reverts to the black screen with a little battery in the top right hand corner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried removing the battery and inserting it again and removing the memory card with no luck, this phone just won't turn on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anybody experienced this before? How can I fix this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-RATCOD</p>

<p>Have you tried a wall charger and leaving it to charge for an hour or so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You've already admitted a flat battery, so it might just be a simple case of a flat battery.</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply keat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven't got a wall charger with me at work, however I thought the USB PC charger would effectively do the same thing? (This cable is definitely fine).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone has been plugged in for well over an hour now, but still appears to be in the same state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will leave it charging for another hour or so, then attempt to turn it on again. If that doesn't work, then I will try the wall charger when I get home tonight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi, i have the same "issue" as you when ive totally drained the battery and try to charge it with USB to pc. Try leaving it for a while as the USB often does provide less juice than a normal charger. The phone need some power to boot, and every time you
 try and it shutts off, you start at the beginning of charging again.

<h2>            Office for iPad &#40;iOS 8.3&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an iPad 4 with Retina Display (iOS 8.3), and do NOT own a Mac or PC. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed the 'free' iOS versions of Word, Excel, Powerpoint and Outlook, and have updated them to the latest versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will need to be able to use these for my future online study of a BA in History with the Open University.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have regular or reliable access to a pc or wi-fi, so I would need to be able to use these apps 'offline' for most of the time, but specifically to be able to create, edit and save any documents locally - i.e. on the iPad - or somewhere else that
 is NOT 'in the cloud'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will also need to be able to SEND or UPLOAD .doc or .docx and other format documents digitally to tutors, as per the online study requirements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible WITHOUT an Office 365 subscription?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, will an Office 365 subscription work when I don't have either a mac or pc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tuffty Bob</p>
