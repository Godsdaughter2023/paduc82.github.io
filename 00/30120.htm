            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 comes with DirectX 11. This issue might have caused due to many reasons such as due to any third party program/app or if you have the same version installed on your computer. I would like to know some information about this issue so that we could
 assist you further.</p>
<p>1. Which version of DirectX are you trying to install on your computer?</p>
<p>2. Have you tried any troubleshooting steps to fix this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try the following methods and check if it works for you.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Try the steps in the following Microsoft Help article to diagnose basic problems with DirectX and check if it helps.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/diagnosing-basic-problems-with-directx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/diagnosing-basic-problems-with-directx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Place the computer in Clean Boot state and then try to install latest version of DirectX and check if the issue persists. Clean Boot will help you disable all non-Microsoft Services.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying with the status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are getting this error only with a particular game, then I suggest you to try installing the game in compatibility mode and check if the issue persists. This is to check if the issue is caused due to any compatibility related issues or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the following Microsoft Help article to install the game in compatibility mode.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/make-older-programs-run#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/make-older-programs-run#1TC=windows-7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, then I suggest you to contact the game support for further assistance with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further reference, you may refer to the following Microsoft Help article.</p>

            Hi AB.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> File History, Windows file and Image backup are dysfunctional and may be phased out in a future version.  But they're not the best choices anyway because after ten years in forums I've seen countless times that files are lost trying to restore them, so  feel obligated to recommend choices that work much better and are 100% reliable.  
<br />
<br />For example a simple common mistake during File History file recovery is to turn it on and set it up again which wipes out the files.  See here to avoid this:
<br /><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-correctly-use-file-history-to-transfer-data-files-to-a-new-windows-10-installation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-cor...</a>
<br />
<br />The safest and most reliable backup method is to sort your files into their User Folders (Documents, Desktop, Pictures, Downloads, etc) and periodically drag or copy them to external or another hard drive.  See tips for copying large groups of files here:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />Then have one other Cloud backup so your files are safe from fire and theft and easily accessible via the internet just like email.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag or copy 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  You can also choose to sync the Desktop, Pictures and Documents folders (only) in OneDrive app Settings &gt; Autosave for real time backup.  
<br />
<br />If you install Google Drive, you can use their new Backup to choose ANY  User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud in real time.  You can also drag/copy selected files into Drive folder.
<br />
<br /> Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>.  
<br />
<br />There is an easy way to mount the System Image to extract files if needed.  Some prefer to move their User folders off of C to make the image smaller and so they stay current if you need to re-image C.  Here's how:  <a href="http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-systems/windows-10/how-to-change-the-location-of-user-folders-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-syst...</a>
<br />
<br />This way  if Windows ever becomes irreparable you can restore C in 20 minutes from recovery media, and your files will be current and safe in their own separate partition.  If they are left on C they will be dated from when the image was taken.  
<br />
<br />The best free imaging app for saving the backup image externally is here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi  ABaenziger
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />If you want to backup an external drive to another external drive, you won't find that functionality in Windows Backup. You need to use a third party utility:
<br />
<br />AOMEI Backup would be the best option for that. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.backup-utility.com/articles/backup-external-hard-drive-to-another-external-hard-drive-3889.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.backup-utility.com/articles/backup-...</a>
<br />
<br />You could use Windows Backup and Restore in addition to AOMEI backup to backup the backup.
<br />
<br />You can also maintain multiple backup sets using Macrium Reflect:

            <p>Hello Ryankahlon,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the laptop shutting down or restarting?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is restarting, then this could be an indication that we are getting a bluescreen and the machine is rebooting before you actually see it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is the case, we need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Zip up the contents of the C:\windows\minidumps folder .</span></li><li>Post&nbsp;the zip file in a public folder on <a href="http://skydrive.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://skydrive.live.com</a>.</li><li>Post the link on this thread so that we can look the dumps over.</li></ol>
<p>If the machine is simply shutting down, then this could be a hardware issue.&nbsp; We may also have a scheduled task set to run at every half hour which shuts the machine down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if it is restarting or shutting down and we will move from there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Matthew_Ha</p>

<p>This is really annoying, I just downloaded the L4D 2 demo and even when I select "high" gore there is none!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Why is this? When I kill the zombies, limbs don't come off and the zombies disappear when they are killed. I have checked my settings etc and my console accepts any age rating.</p>

<p>Assuming you're being serious Horrid, someone here could probably speak to this better than I can, but maybe it has something to do with a low violence version?&nbsp; Germans with the game have four or five extra weapons that the rest of us don't have because
 the violence was scaled down in their version.&nbsp; Kind of a, "Sorry you don't see chunks so here are some more weapons to shoot them with," apology.&nbsp; That's why sometimes when I play with someone from Germany, I'll see extra Counter Strike weapons in the game
 that aren't normally there (Combat Knife, MP5, an assualt rifle with a scope and varying rates of fire depending on zoom, and a bolt-action heavy sniper rifle, and one more I think).&nbsp; Some Australians are also stuck with the low violence version.&nbsp; Maybe even
 more countries.&nbsp; Horrid Horrace what country do you live in?<br />
<br />
So upon reading some descriptions of the low violence version, I see many people specify that the bodies disappear.&nbsp; Check out

            Hi Tireman.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Once you get into Windows make sure to check regularly that System Protection is enabled on C with 5-15% disk space configured.  Update can turn it off.  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />For now without it you may need to try other repairs or even Reset to get back into Windows.  Use whichever method works here to get into Repair Mode so you can try Startup Repair or the Reset:   <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary you may need to create bootable media to access the Repair Mode.  
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then Startup Repair, again System Restore.  If that fails go back to Troubleshoot Options to Reset.  
<br />
<br />If all else fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.

<p>I suggest you check the windows update history, as there werent 15 security updates (assuming auto update is turned on and you have received previous updates)</p>
<p>I suspect the windows update settings are set to install 'reccommended updates' which amongst other things would be drivers - a bad move</p>

<h2>            Xbox live gold subscription stopped working&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My son has had a few issues with xbox one live not working the last week. The error code came up and he was advised to reset his account. He has done this but now he has no access to xbox live. We paid for a 12 month subscription back in May this year. The
 billing for this shows up on my account in family. Any ideas how to get his account back to using the Live that we have paid for?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post. It could be that the console just needs to refresh, to do so, try completing a hard reset using the steps below.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Turn off the Xbox One console by pressing the <strong>Xbox</strong> button &nbsp;on the front of the console for about 10 seconds until it shuts down completely.
</li><li>Unplug the console's power cable. Wait 10 seconds.
<p><strong>Important</strong> Be sure to wait 10 seconds. This step resets the power supply.
</p>
</li><li>Plug the console power cable back in. </li><li>Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button &nbsp;on your console to turn on the Xbox One.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how this goes, thanks again!</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you sign in to Skype using the Microsoft email address, that’s what we called Microsoft Skype. It has a “live:” username. This is technically
 a Microsoft account that is being used for Skype. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you created your Skype account with a unique or personalized Skype Name, always sign in to Skype using the Skype Name and not the email address.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Enter your registered
<a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">email address here</span></a> to check the correct Skype Name.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Please do not hesitate to reply to this thread if you need further help.

<h3> devonfair  say:</h3>
<h2>            100&#37; Disk Usage ONLY in Photos and Videos</h2>
                    I recently switched to Windows 10 on my Dell Latitude E4310 from Windows 7, and like most people I've been experiencing the 100% disk usage situation. Most fixes have helped, but there were two particular apps that caused major problems with the HDD: Photos/Video
 Editor and Movies and TV. These have been causing the 100% disk usage problem when I try to work with them or run videos, and sometimes they crash unexpectedly. A few things to point out is that is that I don't have any StorAHCI.sys drivers, Windows Powershell
 cannot support that command "sc config "DiagTrack" start= disabled,"&nbsp; and Superfetch is disabled because it was causing startup problems. So far no fixes have worked that I know of. Any thoughts on what might be causing the problem?

            Hi.
<br />
<br />What I can recommend is that you completely repair the operating system, but first you must backup your files, although with this method the data is not lost but it is a good idea to backup as a security measure, third-party applications if they are uninstalled, check this link.

            <p>Dear Ratandeep,</p>
<p>Thank you for the suggestion. I did se Kevin's reply but not sure if it applies to my case. I do want to keep my existing MSFT account on my other computers but not on this new one! I am afraid if I delete the account, I won't be able to log in to any of
 my other computers. Am I correct?</p>
<p>Creating a new account (new username and password), will mean to transfer all files, apps, docs, from the old account to the new one. Am I correct?</p>
<p>Actually, my only concern is that once they start the window, they will be able to view my "OneDrive" which contains the files and docs that I don't want to share. Is there a way to disable the "OneDrive" app or have it password protected so it can't easily
 be opened by others?</p>
<p>Regards and Happy New Year,</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting Microsoft account from one computer does not delete account from other computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have full backup of all your files and documents, you may not have to create another account. You may simply delete Microsoft account using steps provided in the previous post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still do not want to delete Microsoft account from this computer, you may disable OneDrive file syncing.<br />

<p>Connecting a game console over a TV tuner to PC is not recommended, because most tuners are analog input. If a digital source is connected, it decodes its signal to analog, then the tuner chip encodes the analog signal back to digital to be displayed/heard
 on the PC. Unless your PC has a very fast CPU and the tuner has a fast encoder, that setup is unrecommended, you can get ping issues between what actually happens on the console and what is displayed/heard on the PC. Or use a tuner with a HDMI input to record
 digitally directly, but even in this case a fast PC is required to record HD, and I even doubt that TV tuners with HDMI are exist on the market.</p>

<p>The capture card is not a Tv tuner. It splittes the signal in half, 1 source to a tv with is set to standard deff and 2nd sourse to a usb recording device connected to my laptop. I have been recording gameplay with a simalier method but using a borrowed
 camcorder. There are many HD capture cards on the market but they start at about £50.

<p>The EasyCap is about £10 and I posted to find out if its any good.</p>

<h2>            Problem running Zoo Tycoon 2&#58; Ultimate Collection &#40;Windows 8.1&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I really need your help.</p>
<p>I've installed Zoo Tycoon 2: Ultimate Collection on my laptop with Windows 8.1 and can't get it to run.</p>
<p>Even after clicking "Play" and waiting for a while, it doesn't work.</p>
<p>Of course my laptop meets the minimum system requirements.</p>
<p>I've tried a clean boot and re-installed but neither of them worked.</p>
<p>I can't figure out how to run the game anyway... Please help me!</p>

            <p><span>Hi, <br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>It must be difficult when things do not work as expected. However, let’s analyze and identify the cause of the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
It looks like Microsoft Zoo Tycoon 2: Collection Ultimate is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Microsoft%20Zoo%20Tycoon%202%3A%20Collection%20Ultimate&amp;vendor=Microsoft&amp;Locale=1033%2C2057%2C3081%2C4105%2C16393&amp;ModelOrVersion=1&amp;BreadCrumbPath=Zoo%20tycoon%202%20ultimate%20&amp;LastSearchTerm=Zoo%2Btycoon%2B2%2Bultimate%2B&amp;Type=Software&amp;tempOsid=Windows%208.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
compatible </a>with Windows 8.1. However, some users were able to resolve this issue by running the game in compatibility mode. It could also occur if there is any third party program conflicts, since you have already tried those steps, it is recommended to
 run the program in compatibility mode as suggested here. </span></p>

            <p>Hi, Winston M.</p>
<p>Thank you for helping me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though I tried the way you suggested, it didn't work.<br />
I also tried to install this software on my friend's desktop with Windows 8.1, it didn't work either.</p>
<p>Is it impossible to run it on Windows 8.1 after all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thank you for taking time out to helping me.</p>
I would be happy if you read my reply and gave me some more information.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Delete the contents of the temporary folder in Windows and install the game in clean boot state.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Method 1: Rename the InstallShield folder</strong>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would suggest you to rename the InstallShield folder and then try installing the game. Refer to these steps:</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>a. </span></span></span><span><span><span>In File Explorer, go to the drive where Windows 8 is installed, locate “Program Files\Common Files\”.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>b. </span></span></span><span><span><span>Locate the InstallShield folder, right click and select “Rename”.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>c. </span></span></span><span><span><span>Type “InstallShield1” and press Enter.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>d. </span></span></span><span><span><span>Now, try installing the game.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong>&nbsp;Also delete the contents of the temporary folder in Windows, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div>Press Windows key + R and type <span>%temp%</span>&nbsp;in the Start Search box, and then press Enter.

            <p>I came here with the same problem, on a Windows 8.1 laptop as well. Not sure if you still need help or not but I did everything he said even delete the temp folder and it still didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this is what I did after doing everything Winston M said to do, I went to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 Computer</p>
<p>2 Local Disk</p>
<p>3 Program Files (x86)</p>
<p>4 Down to Microsoft Games then Zoo Tycoon 2</p>
<p>5 in the files there should hopefully be an app that says <strong>zt&nbsp;</strong>click it</p>
<p>6 Afterwards immediately start-up the autorun and hit play</p>
<p>
</p><p>give it a few seconds and voila it should work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possible main menu problems:</p>
<p>So the game should work fine now however the default settings are set to Best Performance under Options meaning. In order to change this you have to go into Windowed mode and edit it however you want. You can then return to Fullscreen afterwards with the
 changes made. You might have to do this if the game crashes while changing settings in Fullscreen. This doesn't always happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Actually, my mother tongue is not English and I'm not good at using a computer either, so it would be a great help if you explained this step in more detail.</p>

            <p>Ok the autorun is the application that is normally used to start Zoo Tycoon 2. It is the menu that pops up that has the Play, Uninstall, Website, and Exit options. To get there you must:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1) Open File Explorer</p>
<p>2) Go to Computer</p>
<p>3) Go to the DVD Drive, it should be the one with the Zoo Tycoon 2 icon, click it</p>
<p>It should open up. Before you do anything remember to follow steps 1 - 5 in order to get to the zt app. double click the
<strong>zt </strong>app then press <strong>Play </strong>afterwards.</p>
<p>Need anything else let me know.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what the autorun app, and where and what the zt app should look like click play after you hit the zt app</p>

<p>Hi Darren,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your interest in windows 10 and also for trying troubleshooting steps to fix issue.&nbsp;I understand the inconvenience you faced. I will certainly help you with this.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This issue could have occurred due to third party software.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to perform Clean Boot and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Clean Boot.</strong><br />
Booting the computer in a clean boot state can reduce software conflicts and help identify the root cause of the issue. You can refer to this article for more information:<br />

&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Disclaimer: </strong><br />
After troubleshooting, reset the computer to start as usual. Refer to the step How to set the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting under more information.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            I did the clean boot shutting down all services but microsoft ones as well as disabling all startup items unrelated to windows. &nbsp;The issue persists no change. &nbsp;I can put it to sleep/hibernate and bring it out no problem but if i walk away and leave it
 in that state at some point later on something is causing the system hang. &nbsp;Event log only shows a coupl errors one of which being driver warning ACPI\PNP0A0A\2&amp;daba3ff&amp;1 with failure name \driver\WUDFRd. &nbsp;The other just being the kernel power issue showing
 that the PC was not shutdown properly. &nbsp;Thoughts?

<h2>            So I cannot download gears of war 2 on the Xbox one</h2>
                    
<p>I preordered a physical copy of gears of war ultimate edition not long before release. I knew that I was meant to receive the 4 original gears games for backwards compatibility. I was able to download all of them except gears of war 2. It is not in my list
 of games available for download like the rest of them were. I was told to come here by Xbox support to get this problem fixed for me. Massively annoying to have them all but not the 2nd gears which is probably the best of the lot!&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Jsacb,
</span></p>
<p><span>Normally this issue occurs if the graphic drivers are not updated on your computer.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, I would suggest you to boot the computer in safe mode with networking and check if you can see the display.
</span><span>To boot to the desktop in safe mode keep tapping F8 key during restart. Once you see the option to boot in safe mode&nbsp;select it and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link to know more about how to boot the computer in safe mode:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>If you are able to boot to the desktop in Safe mode, disable the display adapter in device manager and try to boot to the desktop in
 normal mode. </span></p>
<p><span>To disable display adapter in device manager, follow the steps below.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click on Start.</span>
</li><li><span>In the start search box type devmgmt.msc and press enter.</span>
</li><li><span>In the device manager, expand display adapter, make a note of the adapter installed and right click on the adapter and click on disable.
</span></li><li><span>Restart the computer and check if you can boot to the desktop and see the display.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>If the above steps work, try to download the latest display drivers from the computer manufacturer’s website and install the drivers.
</span></p>
<p><span>Also you may try to update the display drivers on your computer and check if it helps.
</span><span>Access the link below and follow the steps to update drivers.

    <title>The P.C. boots into UEFI mode. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> squarephoenix10  say:</h3>
<h2>            The P.C. boots into UEFI mode.</h2>
                    I had used Rufus tool to create a bootable disk (target system is Legacy mode) and my motherboard setting is set to automatic (which means the boot mode depends on the bootable disk). But every time the system had boot into UEFI mode. I know that there're
 not enough category to select from. So had to choose a random one.

            Hi squarephoenix10, I honestly think using Rufus causes this issue sometimes, this is the method I use and I have never had any trouble installing Windows 10,
<br />
<br />This is a reliable method to create Windows 10 Bootable Media
<br />
<br />Click this link to download the Windows 10 ISO
<br />
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />
<br />Click this link to download a tool from Microsoft which you can use to create the bootable installation media from that ISO - tool works for Windows 7, 8 and 10
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media
<br />

<h3> michelhb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Realtek ac&#39;97 audio driver causes kmode_exception_not_handled in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have been running the technical preview on my older laptop and it was working okay through the 10130 build. &nbsp;When the 10240 build came out, it started crashing during the update with the k_mode_exception_not_handled error. &nbsp;It got so bad I had to roll
 back to 10130. &nbsp;I later installed the release version using the Media creation tool and after one crash, it installed and ran without the audio driver. &nbsp;I tried letting Windows find the driver and as soon as it installed, it crashed with the same error. &nbsp;I
 tried the Win 7/Vista drivers from the Realtek website and the same thing happens. &nbsp;The laptop is an older Emachines M6811 that originally came out with XP and I later upgraded to Windows 8.1. &nbsp;Emachines doesn't have drivers for Windows 10 either. &nbsp;Is there
 a way to make the drivers work or maybe a generic driver to get basic sound to work? &nbsp;Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: I had to disable the driver to get the computer to function albeit without sound. &nbsp;I have not found any solution nor has anyone made any suggestions. &nbsp;It would be nice to know what changed between 10130 and 10240 that caused the drivers to cause
 the system to crash. &nbsp;It worked fine on 10130 and previous builds. &nbsp;It would be nice to get some support from the developers to resolve this issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of three computers I've tried to upgrade, only one went off without any major problems. &nbsp;The one I'm typing this on failed completely and I thought it was a total loss. &nbsp;It failed to finish booting after the upgrade and would just reboot without any
 error message or reason and eventually got to where it wouldn't boot at all. &nbsp;I tried to roll it back and that wasn't working either. &nbsp;I even tried restoring from a recovery image and it wouldn't do that either. &nbsp;I shut it down thinking my hard drive had failed
 and was planning to get a new one and see if I could get it to restore from the image. &nbsp;I couldn't get a hard drive locally so I was going to have to wait until Monday to try to find one. &nbsp;I came home tonight and took a chance at getting it to boot and it
 somehow managed to repair the startup procedure and it got it rolled back to Win 7 without any apparent loss of data. &nbsp;I'm seriously leary of trying again anytime soon. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was an insider testing the preview builds on my two laptops, but not my desktop (which is the one that failed). &nbsp;I will admit that there may be an issue with my hard drive and I plan to look into that before I try to upgrade again. &nbsp;I didn't remove AVG
 antivirus before upgrading either and that may have caused problems so that will also be on my checklist before another attempt to upgrade. &nbsp;I've also seen a lot of people having issues with Nvidia graphics cards so that could also be a problem. &nbsp;I agree with
 many others that drivers should be optional updates. &nbsp;At least video drivers should be because of the problems they can cause. &nbsp;They certainly shouldn't be installed without user confirmation.</p>

            <p>Okay, I found a fix that worked. &nbsp;I searched on Google for a solution and came across this Youtube video that explained how to fix the problem and provided a link to download drivers that work. &nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-Y-oq3DMMA</p>
<p>After following the instructions and installing the provided driver, my sound is now working. &nbsp;This fix is specific to the Realtek ac'97 audio. &nbsp;If you are having problems with the Realtek HD there is a link to the fix for it there as well.</p>

    <title>Signing into Microsoft Account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Signing into Microsoft Account</h2>
                    I have an Xbox One and I was signed out of my Microsoft account. I am trying to sign in on my Xbox, I typed in my password and I can't get it to do anything beyond that. I tried hitting the little three lines button as 'enter' and nothing happens, when
 I hit 'A' it brings me back into the keyboard to type in the password. What should I be hitting to get it to enter my password? I have hit every button and nothing is signing me in.&nbsp;

<p>Hey there Ashley!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue trying to get into your account.
</p>
<p>The best first step in this kinda situation would probably be to power cycle the console as outlined in
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to restart or power cycle your Xbox One console</a>. I'm not sure if you have given that a shot yet, but when you get a chance, please do so and let us know if that changed anything.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p>
