            <p>Hi,</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this happen with all the Wallpaper?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><span><span>The primary reason for this distortion is caused by the difference in size between the image and your systems display ‘resolution’ or screen size, for example, the size of the image that you chose as your wallpaper is 300 x 200 and your screen
 resolution </span></span><span><span>is set at 800 x 600, than Windows is going to ‘blow up’ the image by a factor of 2.67 for the width x 3 for the height.</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>This will cause two changes to the image. First, when you increase the size of an image, it becomes very ‘pixilated’ or blurry because there are not enough ‘dots’ or ‘pixels’ to fill the larger space.</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>The easiest thing to do is to allow the image to be displayed in its original size, which will not allow it to cover the entire background, but the image will be clean.</span></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><span>You may refer these steps:</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>a. Right-click anywhere on the background, then select Properties. This will open a ‘Display Properties’ dialog box with several tabs across the top.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><span>b. Select the ‘Desktop’ tab, then look towards the lower right side of the box for the ‘Position:’ setting.
</span></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><span>c. It should currently say ‘Stretch’ which can be changed to either ‘Center’ or ‘Tile.’</span></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><span>d. ‘Center’ will place the image in the center of the screen at its original size and ‘Tile’ will repeat the image to cover the entire background.</span></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><span>e. If the image appears very small when you select ‘Center,’ then it’s true resolution is very low and may not be a good candidate as a Wallpaper image.</span></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<br />Can you check the following folder?:

<h2>            Corniest game you admit to enjoying.......</h2>
                    
<p>Everyone has their guilty pleasures. Maybe it's peanut butter by the spoonful or deep fried pizza wrapped in bacon.....or Toddlers and Tiaras (I won't judge). How about video games. Which video game do you hate to admit to enjoying and in full public view
 of your real identity, wouldn't normally admit to?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll start: <b>Whiplash</b>. It was a bit sadistic and a PETA members nightmare but man that game was hilarious. The gameplay? Meh. Nothing to write home about. The rabbits' one-liners on the other hand; I don't know but for some reason he cracked me up.
 I realize the game isn't one of those games that everyone talked about so here is a short synopsis. You play the role of a lab weasel(?) and you are chained to a talking rabbit. You have broken free of some animal testing lab and you basically use the rabbit
 as a mace/flail as you beat security guards left and right in search of the boss (who I think turns out to be a monkey). I think you could also use him for zip lining and you could twirl him over fans to elevate. As you beat the guards with the rabbit, he
 spews out crack after crack. I would beat him against random objects just to hear him sometimes. It was the only redeeming part of the game, really. Never finished it but the memories of that rabbit will both haunt and humor me for the rest of my days. The
 game also features an 'announcer-guy' voice over the corporate speakers like a mall announcement giving details of the corporations exploits. Those too, were hilarious.</p>

<p>I'm going to say <em>Trouble Witches Neo! </em>because that's the only thing I can think of and I'm playing it alot.

<p>It's a great schump. But the English-localized voices are horrendous, almost as bad as

    <title>Xbox One Achievement System Detailed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hmbn corp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Achievement System Detailed</h2>
                    
<p>While Microsoft’s achievement system for the Xbox 360 has worked out well for the company these past few years, they’re changing things up for the Xbox One. The new console is getting an all-new achievement system of sorts, and it’ll be broken down into
 two categories, which are regular achievements and then special challenges.</p>
<p>However, Gamerscores will remain intact and will carry over to the Xbox One. According to Microsoft, the Gamerscore “will remain as a critical part of the Xbox gaming experience.” However, the company is adding the ability to unlock various items via achievements,
 such as digital artwork, new maps, unlockable characters, and temporary stat boosts, just to name a few.</p>
<p>Microsoft also says that you can earn achievements through other apps as well, not just games. Microsoft notes that “video and music apps” can now use the achievements system to allow you to earn sneak peek content, early access, or subscription extensions.
 However, the company says that only games will boost your Gamerscore.</p>
<p>The achievement system for the Xbox One will mostly remain the same compared to the Xbox 360, but the addition of challenges will make things a bit interesting. While achievements can be earned anytime, anywhere, challenges only come around every so often,
 and they consist of a goal that you have to reach, with a reward if you reach it. These challenges are also time-based, so you have to complete them in a certain amount of time in order to get the cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Just like with Xbox One apps, challenges don’t affect your Gamerscore — they merely unlock content or reward you with nifty swag that you can used and such. Again, Microsoft is reiterating that games only affect your Gamerscore. However, challenges can be
 met across different games, whereas achievements can only be earned in each game at a time.</p>

<p>I like the concept of the new achievements &amp; challenges particularly how they can be used to gain access to additional content. However, I hate the idea of someone having completed a challenge that I'll never have the opportunity to complete myself because
 the time limit for it has already elapsed.</p>

<p>I wish they would give something for like every 10,000 gs. It would be nice to have something in return for dedication to games and trying to get maximum gamerscore. They could give choices like so much credit towards DLC like Bing rewards.

<p>I know I have a number in my tag but that's different then having random number on the side that means nothing to me. I think achievement are a good idea but just not for me. I would just like the option to opt out of it I don't think it's to much to ask.

<p>Challenges have been around for a while irrespective of achievements. A challenge is usually not an achievement that accrues GP's. When I used to play Halo 4(if it has changed well, I havn't played in a while) there were daily, weekly and monthly challenges
 that netted nothing but exp. It helped to progress your GT for halo. Developers can add challenges or achievements ala DLC, each with a different reward. But, challenges are not usually achievements, ever. I'm fine with it.</p>

<h2>            Xbox party in Xbox app is connecting but the audio won&#39;t work.</h2>
                    I'm able to get into a party with one of my friends, but it says an error occurred and my microphone won't work. I do not have any Xbox, but I have an account as I don't much like Xbox nor want to spend that much money on one as I spent a lot on my gaming
 PC. My NAT type is strict and his is open so it should work, but it doesn't. Is this a Microsoft server thingy? Will it work without an Xbox?

<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Drop shadows for mouse and windows have disappears. I also have aliasing (jagged edges) on mouse pointers that are supposed to be smooth, and are on my windows 7 system. I've updated the graphics drivers, gone into the longer list (can't remember where)
 where is has check boxes for mouse and window shadows, gone back to default theme, everything I could try. Is there anything else?</p>

            <p>What seems to be the problem is using the Intel HD Graphics Control Panel. If I adjust the Display &gt; Color settings and save the settings, then the wonkyness happens a few minutes later. If I go back to default, then it's OK.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may be a conflict with Windows 10 color calibration tool, but I'm not sure about that. I'd have to test it more, but as long as I don't save my color scheme in the Intel program, the settings will still be in place, and everything works for me now.
 So this is kind of solved.</p>

<h3> brandt08  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upload not sharing clips edited in Upload Studio.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone, I am having an issue where any game clip that I have edited with Upload studio cannot be shared. Unedited clips have no problem sharing, but edited ones do. The exact error message that pops up is:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Try again later</p>
<p>Sorry, we can't share this right now. It might be taking longer than usual to upload, or there might be a temporary problem with our service."</p>
<p>Does anyone know a fix for this? I have checked my internet which uploads at 2.8 Mbit/s and my NAT type is open, so I am fairly certain it is not a network issue.</p>
<p>Please help if possible.</p>

    <title>Assigned Access of Powerpoint Presentation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drew patterson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Assigned Access of Powerpoint Presentation</h2>
                    <p>I was hoping that by downloading the PowerPoint Mobile app in windows store, that I would be able to use it to setup assigned access on a Windows 10 computer and display a powerpoint presentation. Our issues is, we need this to be a Kiosk that no-one can
 close out the presentation. Powerpoint allows you to turn most functions off, but you can still access the ease of access toolbar, and can also close the presentation out. When I go to assigned access though, Powerpoint Mobile does not appear in the list of
 Apps. I have downloaded other Supposed PowerPoint Presenters, but none of them show up in the list either.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me how to achieve this! I do not understand how to setup the Power Shell code to set this up, too technical for me. But I really need this as&nbsp; Kiosk computer. Any suggestion?</p>

    <title>How to make a DVD from a completed project in Windows Movie Maker. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to make a DVD from a completed project in Windows Movie Maker.</h2>
                    <p>Using my old computer , operating Windows 7 I was able to successfully&nbsp; and easily use Windows Live Movie Maker to make vacation movies with sound, music transitions etc. and burn the saved project to a DVD for playing on at TV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My old computer crashed and my new computer is operating Windows 8.1.&nbsp; I have downloaded the new version for Movie Maker and mad a movie that I want to save as a DVD as a gift for family to be able to play on their TV.&nbsp; I understand that there is no longer
 an option to do this with the new version Windows Movie Maker.&nbsp;&nbsp; I researched this problem on line, read all the comments, instructions etc. and finally ended up speaking to an Microsoft Support person in January.&nbsp; This person told me I needed to purchase
 the Windows 8.1 ProPack with Media Center to be able to now convert the Movie Maker into a DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did purchase the&nbsp;ProPack and it is now installed on my computer.&nbsp; I still can't figure out how to get from the Windows Movie Maker project to the process of making a DVD.&nbsp; why does this have to be so difficult?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent hours of time on the computer and on the phone with Microsoft trying to figure out how to do something that used to be very simple and fun.&nbsp; I am very frustrated with this change.&nbsp; Not everyone wants their videos on UTube or the Cloud!!&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I'm always surprised by the surface knowledge that Microsoft Support personnel seem to have on their own products while not having a very deep knowledge on them. I'm not part of Microsoft, just a fellow consumer/user of their products who has a lot of familiarity
 with programs like Movie Maker, more so apparently than their own support personnel.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows 8.1 ProPack with Media Center wouldn't be able to help you with being able to create video DVDs. The ProPack adds the ability to&nbsp;<strong><em>play</em></strong> DVDs. It adds the licensed MPEG-2
 codecs that let you decode video on a video DVD. But it does nothing to allow you to&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">burn</span> video DVDs. I'm sorry for the misinformation you were given.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">To give you some history -- in Windows Vista and Windows 7, the ability to play DVDs and to burn DVDs was included. Microsoft licensed the MPEG-2 codecs that allowed both viewing and burning. The viewing
 was done in Windows Media Player. The burning was done in a program called Windows DVD Maker. In Windows 8/8.1 both the codecs and the program are gone.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Movie Maker (both the older and the newer version), if it is running on a system with Windows DVD Maker (Vista or 7) would then offer you the option to burn a DVD. It would pass the project file to the
 program and then let you create a DVD with menus, etc.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Much like Apple dropped support for burning via their iDVD program, Microsoft has stopped providing the Windows DVD Maker program. Furthermore, there is no way to get the program from Windows Vista/7
 onto a Windows 8/8.1 machine. Essentially it is no longer provided/supported/available.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Now, before I go into possible workarounds, can I also ask you why you might need the ability to burn a video DVD? The video DVD standard came from the era of analog TVs and is stuck at a maximum standard
 definition resolution of 480p (NTSC). It's not really a future-proof format any more. Personally, I save all my videos to a computer with copies on a network device. I can stream from either of these to any HDTV in the house via DLNA because they are connected
 to the same network. Furthermore, I make regular backups of videos (and photos) to an external hard drive which is then stored offsite. For me, that gets me the same functionality I might get from an optical DVD disk. If the concern is sharing with family
 and friends, I would stick with online sharing via YouTube, Vimeo, OneDrive, etc. You can also password protect videos to keep things private.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you have someone that needs to be able to view a movie and they are behind technology-wise, some other options are to burn a video file (.mp4 format) to a DVD just as a data file. That can then be
 played in a Blu-ray player and will be in HD format to boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Okay, &nbsp;if none of that is relevant and you still need a shiny disc in the legacy SD video DVD format, the only real options at this point are to look for 3rd party applications that can burn a video DVD.
 A few that I've seen used are Freemake Video Converter, DVD Styler and DVD Flick. Just be careful with installing any free programs like these because they often hide additional programs during the install. Always choose a custom install so that you can uncheck
 anything the program tries to install in addition to the program.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I hope that helps. Let me know if you have any further questions. And again I'm sorry for the incomplete information you received previously.</span></p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How in the world is my tag not aloud</h2>
                    
<p>I dont get why xbox will make u keep your&nbsp;tag, bio, motto, and all that&nbsp;clean but most of the content i can get on the marketplace for my profile and avatar&nbsp;shouldnt be allowed as well...i mean hell they say we cant do this and this but you can buy all this&nbsp;stuff
 but we are not going to let you use....wtf.....why have the player review feature if your not going to use it...if you come accross someone or profile tag whatever and it uppsets you or hurts your little feelings go to submit player review and hit avoid..
 and you will never see it again..</p>
<p>But no people want to go through more trouble and file a complaint like im doing right now cause im pissed....i want to know why with a darn good reason why i cant have my tag...and dont&nbsp;give me the bs crap of oh it sounds offensive... NO this crap has got
 to stop i pay for the service and the service says that u have to be 18 or old to have an account.....bottom line.....u got to be 21 to drink 18 to smoke........but u can be 6 and play gears or war or any other game that is not for kids online&nbsp;and curse and
 say and do all these bad things that are not supposed to happen but they do...and do you ban accounts cause little kids are playing games there not suppposed to....whats the difference between&nbsp;a parent letting there 10 year old take some shots of whiskey,
 or let them play with people online and hear the things they hear and play violent games....the&nbsp;game case says 18+ on games do u ban account when you find underage playing going on....NO u dont cause of your dumb&nbsp;TERMS AND USE...</p>
<p>But just to let you know i have sat here for like 30 mins playing with the tag change since i cant play live until i change it....and i have been able to put in so many other tags that it will let me do that is way worse than I MountAndDew U.....i cant say
 some cause that wouldnt be right...right....but i want to know why i have to change it when all people have to do if they somehow walk through the land of millions of xbox live players and find me 1 little ol me down here in tampa&nbsp;and I hurt there feelings
 or offend them....SUBMIT PLAYER REVIEW AND THEN PUT AVOID PLAYER.....BAM CASE CLOSED YOU NEVER HAVE TO SEE ME AGAIN....but no that would be to easy right...so why is that feature there if all you "xbox team" and all the other player are going to do is make
 people change....sounds like obama to me...ooops there i go again offending people....he changed this country upside down and it looks like he taking us with him..</p>
<p>On an ending note....it says in the terms and use....no drug related, no&nbsp;religous, no&nbsp;racial slurs, or&nbsp;gender&nbsp;offensives.......but yey ive seen it everyday since day 1 of live... why are you going to say that you have to be an adult to get online but u got
 act like we are all in 1st grade again....i mean man come on&nbsp;i stress about whats on tv now a days, &nbsp;the radio, movies hell my kids school....there is far worse stuff out there that influence kids and all that... but seriously everyone is going around being
 crazy....look at it&nbsp;this way <strong>[MOD REMOVED]</strong> all the time and it totaly gets me pissed cause its ok for them to say it but any other race says it then there being raceist..or hate blacks or whatever....but do i go around to city hall or the
 whitehouse and complain that they need to make that word gone...no i deal with it and try to stay away from it...o why cant they all do the same with me....avoid me.......all i ask is that a detailed report on my account of why i cant have my tag...</p>
<p>I had another account that got stolen shortly after you made me change my 1st tag from chief cornholio.. ichanged it to general g score...and 3 weeks later i was playing a game and it said account recovered to another console....you guy went throught your
 little csi...but in the end you told me was " we have no record of Chief Cornholio" now how is that you have no record of an account that i had for almost 6 years....and it took 6 years to be offensive....please thats a joke....ive tried to put it in a min
 agoand it said it was already taken....now how is that when you guys made me change it....but guess what i can get The Great Cornholio avatar or butthead from beavis and butthead.....like i said before we cant have some things but yet it is for sale on the
 marketplace but we can use it.....so i end my baby wa wa wa but if i do have to change it i want Chief Cornholio back if not that than we have a big problem....cause i got that tag from the old moutaindew commercials to where one guy slams the other guy on
 the head with a dew can and says " I mount and dew you" like it was some kind of gravity hammer from halo....so i dont see how this can be offensive....and to all that are offended by shouldnt not even be on live in the first place.....also the zone thing
 on ur profile is a waste of space to....cause that can help big time on keeping the ones that are easily offended by the littliest thing vs the once that dont care about bs like that thy just wanna have fun just like everyone else....so put the coool down
 to earth people with the cool&nbsp;down to earth people and the little babies that cant handle online together....but i know you guys are just doing your job and ur the middle man and all.....but come on something has to be done about this or before u know it everyone
 will have pretty sea horse or carebears, or my little pony as there tags...come on&nbsp;a couple million tags with tags like that...how can you get creative with a tag if u cant use anything cool for ur name....but please rethink this cause this is wack....its
 one thing to change a tag if i was reported like 100 times a day everyday.....but how do you not know that the people reporting me are just a bunch of sore losers that got there butt handed to them on a silver platter in halo...cause thats really all i play
 anymore no a days....but seriously please let me know whats up or what WE can do to fix this.....thanks Adam</p>

<p>Well let's break that down and pick holes in it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
First up your GT 'I MOUNTANDDEW U' even the most sheltered of sheltered people can hazard a decent guess as to what you're referencing here. For anyone else that doesn't get it read this; 'I MOUNT AND DEW U' then say it out loud while reading the part of the
 terms of use that says you're not allowed to have a GT that references sexual acts something you also omitted when referencing the rules regarding what you can and cannot use on XBL. Hence you got caught, deal with it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kids playing certain games like Gears of War when they're under age is a matter for the parents and you are in no position to dictate to them what they allow their kids to see. This also doesn't excuse you from your previous rule breaking as any content
<strong><em>you</em></strong> create on the service must be E for Everyone. Note also that Epic's games are also rated appropriately for their content.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thirdly I also pay my money to play on XBL but I have to follow the rules because I agreed to upon signing up. What makes you so special that you should be allowed to have certain rules not apply to you?<br />
<br />
Lastly The Great Cornholio was the alter ego of Beavis not Butthead.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>I'd say tl;dr, but I did sit and read through... that. You got a FNC cause you broke the rules. Not specifically because someone took offense. A good bit of people
<em>would</em> avoid player and move on. But the Enforcement team would not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its "Keep it 'E' for everyone" because there are kids that wonder around online. Some parents care what their kids do online, some don't. Also, you are incorrect - you don't have to be 18 to use the service. You just have to be 18 to do it without parental
 permission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be careful what you change your name to. After a few forced&nbsp;name changes, if the XBLPET has to ask you again, you get hit with the ban hammer. I've seen this happen with 3-6 forced changes. If you keep pushing the line, they'll just ban you and all the complaining
 won't get your DLC/games/ect back.</p>

<p>yes i do have right to dictate what i think of other parents.....why do you think all the good hard working honest people out there are a dying breed...and being replaced with stupid yahoos that all they care about is facebooking and twitin twitter and look
 at me im so important with my smart phone/android &nbsp;and LAZY....go into any store you pick and I bet you find at least half the people that work there have the look on there face of i dont care im just here to get a check but dont want to work for it....as
 far as the beavis and butthead thing i know who was who....but if you ever remember the old mountaindew commercials where there were 2 or more guys always fighting for the can of dew and on 1 of the commericals 1 guy &nbsp;came busting through the brick wall like
 the beast and smashes the other guy on top of the head like he was holding a gravity hammer from halo and said " I mountain dew you " NOW with that said all super smart guy.... is that 15 characters or more than 15....i think its more...so I had to shortin
 it.....Im am soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo sorry that all of you have your mind in the gutter like some kind of future pervert petifile... you guys prob look at porn all the time dont you..if
 you dedicate yourself to a women you love you willl for get all about your hand and the computer screen..i never ment it to be like that or sounds like or hints like crap....i drink about 2 -12 packs a day of the stuff i dont drink coffee or alcohol...if they
 would of made it to where i could of had a few more letters in my name no one would ever thought that same way all of you are.....period....end of story also smart guy you didnt say anything about the market place content....scroll through there sometime and

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend performing a full reboot of your xbox console, as well as power cycling your modem and router.&nbsp; This should hopefully resolve the issue!</p>

<p>Hey there Texas!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue trying to use your new mods for Skyrim.
</p>
<p>Since mods like the ones usable in Skyrim are in game content, I would suggest trying the steps outlined in our support article entitled "<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/troubleshooting/game-freeze-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">My Xbox
 One game won't start or freezes during gameplay</a>". </p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not work, I'd then try what we call a soft factory reset. <span>
<span>It's a reset of your console back to factory settings but one that does not uninstall any of your games or apps and is a really good troubleshooting step for most issues.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
<span><span>Just
 make sure that before you go ahead with it, that you do know all of the sign-in information for any/all of your accounts</span></span><span><span>(as</span></span><span><span>they
 will be removed) </span></span><span><span>and
 have easy access to your internet network</span></span><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
<span><span>Also
 make sure that you select the option denoted <strong>reset and keep my games and apps.&nbsp;</strong></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">

    <title>ISR unloaded - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peter robertson  say:</h3>
<h2>            ISR unloaded</h2>
                    <p>I am developing a Windows 10 kernel mode driver for some custom hardware.</p>
<p>This usually works, but sometimes after a reboot (power cycle) the first time I do anything that generates an expected interrupt (MSI) it fails with a bugcheck D1.</p>
<p>The dump shows the probable cause (failed instruction address) as the first instruction of the ISR.</p>
<p>The STACK_TEXT shows my driver as 'Unloaded':</p>
<p>
</p><p>... nt!KiPageFault+0x247</p>
<p>...&lt;Unloaded_MyDriver.sys&gt;+0x36d0</p>
<p>... nt!ViCtxIsrMessageBased+0x32</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume this means it's been paged out, but why?</p>
<p>Powering-down and restarting (three or four times!) eventually resolves the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 cannot update anymore - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 cannot update anymore</h2>
                    <p>A few months ago, I decided to join the Windows Insider Program. I had Windows 7 Professional (or something like that), so I was upgraded to Windows 10 Pro build 10074. Everything went smoothly until updating to build 10130. That's when the problems started.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a long time, the following build was unable to be retrieved by my computer and when it finally happened, for some reason, Windows couldn't update because of error 0x80070003. Unable to fix it because there were no answers on the internet and everything
 I tried didn't work, I left it like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days ago, I was alerted that my build would soon expire, so once again I tried updating, but to no avail, then my license got deactivated, leaving me with a computer that now restarts every 2 hours and that will soon not boot anymore. I decided to
 try updating it again, so I went to the Activation tab in Settings and clicked on "Install the latest version of Windows". This opened up Windows Store (Beta), who announced me it would need to update itself before being able to be used. However, the update
 process either resulted in error 0x80004005, either in a screen with "See details" and an arrow (both not clickable) that disappears pretty much immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried fixing this using both the powershell command and wsreset and all that, but again, to no avail. Going back to a previous build is impossible and resetting this one doesn't work either. Making a USB stick and attempting to install the current build
 from it using the Media Creation Tool doesn't work, no matter if I try to install it when clicking on setup.exe while in Windows (it asks for my product key, which expired) or if I try to boot from the stick (it says it's incompatible). Clicking on Update
 now (without creating the USB) inside the Media Creation Tool also prompts me to input the Product key. Basically, I don't know what to do anymore, I simply can't update Windows anymore and it will soon not even boot up anymore.</p>

</p>
<p>The error message 0x80070003 is usually displayed when some files in the update are missing, even though the update is downloaded and extracted successfully.

            I'm sorry I forgot to mention, but I can't even see error 0x80070003 anymore (I've only mentioned it as background to my current problem; the reason that I couldn't update Windows at the time). I've even tried doing what you suggested now and it had no
 effect on anything.

            <p>Update:</p>
<p>I have managed to install today's Windows 10 update using the tool and the USB stick, but the activation problem remains. Windows wants me to fill in an activation key which I don't have anymore (the sticker has worn off) and that I can't obtain from the
 registry either, since Windows 7 doesn't exist on my system at all now. There's no recovery disk either, only the recovery software which has somehow managed to stick around and that came with the laptop, Samsung Recovery Solution 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do? My license has basically been stolen and there's no way for me to get it back now.</p>

<h2>            Purchased 6 used Dell OPtiplex  Win7 Pro Computers with OEM COA on box, fresh installed win10pro will not activate, what is best solution&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Purchased 6 used Dell OptiPlex 380&nbsp;&nbsp;Win7-pro Computers with OEM COA on each box, fresh installed win10-Pro Would&nbsp;not activate over internet, re-installed Win7-pro using COA on box, could not re-activate, I believe due to the fact that I reformatted the small
 Hard drive and removed the Dell recovery partition for more room..</p>
<p>Is there a quick way to activate all 6 computers. My plan was to set up one, then disk copy the other 5 and change the activation&nbsp; code on each to activate. I am a action pack subscriber, but rather not use the licenses since I have 8&nbsp;&nbsp;other computers(6
 desktops and 2 laptops). As they are used on office network, really need Pro version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>Is there a email I could send images of all 6 COA's to get the free upgrade licenses? Or do I have to call on each one as I set it up?</p>

Depending on how large your Windows 10 installation is, it can use a lot of space, so you should invest in an external USB hard disk with a lot of space. In this article, we take a look restoring the system image on a larger hard disk. This makes it quite convenient if you somehow outgrow your current storage allotment."><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">How

</p><p>You can then use the Windows 7 Professional product key on the COA sticker to activate each machine. Because those Windows 7 Professional keys might have previously been in use, I would recommend you use chat support:</p>

<p>Q: If I purchase an Xbox LIVE Arcade game, does it belong to everyone in the family?</p>
<p>A: Purchased content such as games and movies are licensed both to the console it was purchased on, and the individual Gold member that purchased it. So if, for example, your child were to buy an Xbox LIVE Arcade game on your home console, anyone on your
 console can play it. Additionally, if they leave for college, they could recover their account on another Xbox 360 in their dorm room and be able to play the game when logged into their account from that Xbox 360.</p>

            <div>Greetings Niyamath,</div>
<div>To answer your questions:</div>
<div>- IE is now my default browser. The majority of my music now plays, however, there are a few</div>
<div><i>playlists </i>that still won’t play.</div>
<div>- The Media Player issues started when I transferred my music files from my old computer, using Windows 7, to my new computer, using Windows 8. The transfer was done using a fast transfer cable and I followed the instructions for using the factory installed
 software for transferring files.</div>
<div>I would appreciate instructions on how to get these remaining music files to play.
<div>Thanks so much for your assistance.</div>
<div>James Wheeler</div>
        </p>
