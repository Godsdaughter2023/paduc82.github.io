<h2>            Losing all previous contacts</h2>
                    I have recently changed computers and as I downloaded Skype (successfully), I also had to change my password that, of course, after 5 years or so, I had forgotten. Skype works fine but I lost all my previous contacts. Can I recover them and how do I do
 that? Cheers to all generous minds that come to help. Derrick&nbsp;

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e2e322ac-b009-43ab-b5a7-bb31568c3664" title="Derrickde Kerckhove">
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The more common reason as to why your contacts are not showing up after signing into the Skype application is because you are accessing another account. This commonly happens when you have multiple Skype accounts. I strongly suggest you try to sign out of
 the Skype application, and sign back in using your Skype sign-in details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have forgotten the Skype account you are using to access your account previously, please refer to this support page for help:

            Hi Littlewood,<br />
<br />
I totally understand your concern.<br />
<br />
However, I’d like to say each feature should have its own functionality. For “@mentions”, you can refer to
<a href="https://blogs.office.com/2016/07/26/outlook-helps-you-focus-on-what-matters-to-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://blogs.office.com/2016/07/26/outlook-helps-you-focus-on-what-matters-to-you/</a> to know more. (You can filter the key word “mentions” to scan)<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alan

            <p>HI Ciochina,</p>
<p><br />
You have two choices.</p>
<p><br />
We only speak English here and if you want our help you must post in English.&nbsp; To do this, assuming you are using Internet Explorer, get the Bing Translator add-on at:
<a href="http://www.ieaddons.com/en/addons/detail.aspx?id=205" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ieaddons.com/en/addons/detail.aspx?id=205</a> and install it.&nbsp; Then you can use it to type what you want to say in Romanian and translate it to English, copy the English version, and
 post that.&nbsp; You can then use it to translate our replies back into Romanian if necessary.&nbsp; That's how I created this post.</p>
<p><br />
If you prefer or think this is the better option, please go to <a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/Default.aspx?mkt=ro-ro&amp;st=1&amp;wfxredirect=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

I hope this helps.</p>

Good luck!</p>

<h3> dualbenq  say:</h3>
<h2>            I pay for Skype features. Doesn&#39;t that mean something&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Over the past 10 years I have paid for a Skype telephone number.&nbsp; This feature is necessary for people to call me for remote help from their telephones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does Microsoft see fit to upgrade 7.41 to 8.25 on MY Windows 10 Home Operating System?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I pay about $100.00 USD a year to use the best features which also means the most Desktop friendly version.&nbsp; I
<strong>expect</strong> the option to <strong>disable</strong> any updates for years to come.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's mentioned that 8.25 has less security issues. I have no security issues with 7.41 because no one has access inside the office or from the Internet to my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am usually very passive in Microsoft Answers but I want to hear solid policy that "we who pay" for Skype services can keep Skype 7.41 without having to delete the 8.25 version from our Temp folder each time there is a Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To the Team Leader of Skype development.&nbsp; Please realize that millions of us around the world use Skype for Business and need to stick with the familiar Interface and features of 7.41.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are not interested in a "touch screen for mobile" version on work stations.&nbsp; Keyboard and Mouse users do not want, nor need this mobile device version, 8.25. It's simply terrible!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading this and with all due respect.&nbsp; Any moderator reading this needs to forward it to the Skype Team Leader.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep it like this, please!</p>

    <title>Template Numbering turned into black squares - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Template Numbering turned into black squares</h2>
                    <p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having trouble with the template numbering in a Word document on Mac for which I can't seem to find a solution online (I hope I'm not the first one who experiences this).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I received a template in which I'm supposed to write a document, but after drafting 20 or so pages, one of the template numberings - the fifth level/layer, which is supposed to be aa), bb), cc), etc. - just turned into these black squares (image; sorry
 for bad editing)?! I don't really know what to do about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to create a&nbsp;<em>new&nbsp;</em>template with exactly the same format to use instead, the black squares show up even in the template numbering editor. I've restarted both Word and my Macbook. What do I do?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help will be greatly appreciated - I'm pretty desperate so thanks in advance if anyone knows anything!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>
</p><p>Leo</p>

                    Yesterday while using Internet Explorer it was jumping around from IE to desktop.&nbsp; In the process, my internet explorer screen is not concentrated in the middle of the screen in portrait mode and very small.&nbsp; I can't read much of it.&nbsp; I tried changing
 my resolution, but it changes for desktop as well and makes everything too big and unusable.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a landscape screen rather than square and want to be able to read things again.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.

Don't really follow your question yet.&nbsp; Maybe with more descriptive detail (?)..................</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>--Can you explain the "jumping around"&nbsp;part?&nbsp; Were you pushing the Windows key or some other key? Were you dragging with the mouse?&nbsp; What were
<em><strong>you</strong> </em>doing when this started?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>--When you say "<u>not</u> concentrated in the middle, is this the Start screen view or the Desktop view or&nbsp;both?&nbsp; Is there a border on the sides, on the top, etc?&nbsp; What color is the border?&nbsp; Did you pull on the edges of the window to try to resize the screen.&nbsp;
 Did you double-click on the Window's Title Bar?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>--When you say "landscape screen" is this on the Start screen view only?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are talking about the Start screen view, when you right-click a portion of the screen, there will be a black area on the top or bottom.&nbsp; Are you referring to that?</p>

<h2>            Having problem with &#34;search&#34; button after windows 10 mobile update. Lumia 535 DS</h2>
                    <p>Hello! After updating my phone to windows 10 mobile I can't use bing search for searching the web or my phone, like i did when i had the windows 8.1 on my phone. When i press the "search" button it only opens Edge and i couldn't find anything in settings.
 I also can't use voice commands. When i press the "search" button continuously it doesn't do anything. Is there anything i can do to fix this??</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            Pressing search opens edge? Can you post a screenshot of what you are seeing? Also if you don't have cortana enabled, pressing search opens the bing search page which looks a lot like the bing.com on edge.

            <p>This the problem... When I press "search" Edge is opening and the first page is the picture below. I tried to change the first page from Edge's settings and make bing.com the search engine, but it didn't succeed. Also I don't know how exactly I can enable
 Cortana, but with 8.1 I could at least long press "search" and see "Listening..." on my screen. Now when I do this, nothing happens... Any suggestions please?</p>

            This is the weirdest thing I have ever seen! Can you change your search settings by going to edge &gt; settings&gt; advanced settings&gt; search? Change it too Bing.com. Also check whether you have correct date,time and region settings. The keyboard should also
 match your phone language and region. Could you state your region?

            <p>As I said before, I already tried to change the searching machine to Bing.com but with no luck. Google remains the main searching and I still see the picture I uploaded yesterday. When you say "correct" date, time and language, what do you mean? I have set
 these feautures to those matching my country. So I setted my region as Greece. This is where I come from. I know that Greece is not between the countries which support cortana, but at least I would like to have "search" in my phone or the web, and simple voice
 commands, like in w8.1.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Go to settings&gt;time&amp;language and see if every thing is set to Greece defaults. After this try soft resetting(vol. down+power) your phone and see if the problem persists.&nbsp;

            <p>I had set default settings to Greek language and region from the begining. I checked them back now, but nothing has changed and I have the same settings. Yesterday I tried to do something else I read for cortana, and I changed region to US and the default
 language to English, and then cortana was between my apps and search engine changed to Bing.com. I would like to try to change again these settings to Greek ones and see if I 'll have at least "search" button working correctly (because cortana doesn't work
 to Greece), but I don't want cortana to lose the information it gathered these days. Anyway, if anyone has any usefull suggestions I will gladly read them.</p>

            Changing region will give you Cortana, no doubt but it may make some apps not available. Also, after you reverted your settings back to Greece, does search work now? As for Cortana's notebook, i guess she will again be reset once you change your region.

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;How does one integrate a Resource pool project file (mpp) which is stored in Sharepoint to a Project Plan (MSP 2016) file which is also stored in Sharepoint?</p>
<p>Is this even possible?</p>
<p>I opened the Resource pool project file (mpp) and then the Project Plan file (mpp) but the option to use a shared resource pool file is grayed out in the latter (i.e. only 'Use own resources' is available to be selected).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help? Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Saving to OneDrive from Word</h2>
                    <p>I found another article that brought up the adding a service part so that I could get to OneDrive via Sharepoint.</p>
<p>I put in the email address and password. That brings up 2 options:</p>
<p>1. Connect to OneDrive - Business name</p>
<p>2. Connect to Sharepoint - Business name</p>
<p>I click on the Connect button for the OneDrive option.</p>
<p>I type my password (which I use 30 times a week at least) and get told that the username or password for OneDrive - Business isn't correct. It pulled my email address from the first step where it must have been valid to get the 2 options. Then my password...
 which, since I am typing this right now, I am certain of the Caps Lock status.</p>
<p>This is an issue for not just me. My colleague needs it to get their files at home.</p>
<p>I have told them the work around of saving it on hard drive and then uploading via the website interface.... but that is not how it should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking on the Connect for the Sharepoint - Business option brings similar results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is on Windows 7, Office 2013 software with 365 account set up by the corporate office.<br />
They have no problems on their Mac. This only started being a problem in the last few days. Hence I am trying to get mine working to know how to get theirs re-working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

</p><p>Please firstly try the following steps:</p>
<p><strong>Solution 1</strong></p>
<p>1. Open Word&gt;File&gt;Account&gt;sign out the existing account. </p>
<p>2. Quit Word. Open Control Panel&gt;find Credential Manager&gt;remove all Microsoft related credentials in both Windows Credentials and Web Credentials.
</p>
<p>3. Restart your computer&gt; reopen Word and sign into your work/school account. </p>
<p>4. Check if you can save document to OneDrive for Business. </p>
<p><strong>Solution 2</strong></p>
<p>Perform an online repair. As you mentioned, you could save document to local, and then access OneDrive for Business library with browser to upload the local file. It means for OneDrive for Business permission part, you account should be proper. The issue
 might be related to the Office installation when saving document to OneDrive for Business or SharePoint Online</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they don't work, I'd like to confirm some further info:</p>
<p>1. Is this your personal computer at home or domain joined computer at office? It seems you have the related license to install Office 365 ProPlus. Is it possible to install Office 365 ProPlus instead of Office Professional Plus 2013?
</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If it's the computer in your office, you may need to firstly consult your IT for switching the installation.
</p>
<p>2. If this is a computer at office, do you use the same account for log into the computer and Office portal?
</p>
<p>3. Record a video with below steps. You could upload the video to your cloud storage and share a guest link with us in private message.
</p>
<p>a. sign into Office with work/school account. Check if you already can see OneDrive-your company name.</p>
<p>b. If not, click Add service.</p>
<p>c. Select OneDrive-Organization name&gt;enter your work/school account.</p>
<p>d. Get the error message. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tim</p>

            Hi<br />
<br />
It sounds to me like a audio problem. I suggest you take it to your nearest service point eg The place you bought it.<br />
For your nearest service point or if you bought your phone online call 0845 045 055 055 :)

<h2>            Cannot find purchased office to download &#40;Mac&#41; - account login difficulties</h2>
                    <p>I had to create an account to purchase Microsoft Office for Mac (2016) - which I did about a month ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to other updates I had to make to my mac - I didn't install office right away. After making these other updates I came back to install
</p>
<p>office but I was getting an error with my sign in - saying that my email account did not exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted help chat and also submitted a help request - they directed me here....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recreated the account - as directed by Microsoft - but of course that doesn't help with the purchase that I previously made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't access a product that I've paid for - Because any emails confirming were sent to the account that I purchased the software with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I have is the paypal receipt/transaction. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, Doromadry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We're glad to help you! <br />
<br />
I understand that your apps are not working properly. Have you tried to perform a soft reset? If not please do so.
<br />
<br />
You can perform the soft reset by having your phone turned on. Then, press and hold the
<strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><span>and<span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
</span></span><span><strong>Power</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f71780ab3-e8a1-45b0-a0d1-220bfbe6b989%2fhardware-icon-power-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />button until your phone vibrates and restarts.
 Note that you should not touch the device screen during this process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears). After performing soft reset try to check if the issue persists. If soft reset will not fix the issue we suggest you to to perform
 hard reset. You can reset your phone under Settings: <strong>Settings </strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><strong>&nbsp;&gt; about &gt; reset your phone.</strong>
 Make sure to back up all of your files before performing hard reset: <strong>Settings
</strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><strong>&nbsp;&gt; Backup &gt; Apps + settings/More options &gt; Back up now.</strong></p>

    <title>How to make Microsoft abide by their Privacy Statement&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> utkangezer  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to make Microsoft abide by their Privacy Statement&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello dear reader,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have some problems with Microsoft for the past 10 days, and I have been trying to work things out with Microsoft for as long. In the mean time, I have encountered Microsoft's Privacy Statement at
<a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement</a> which grabbed my interest as a possible resolution to my problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under "How to Access &amp; Control Your Personal Data", when you expand it via "Learn More", you can find that Microsoft is committed to provide you the personal data you've provided to them using their services. The statement also says that you may contact
 Microsoft for your personal data, in case you cannot reach to them via the tools Microsoft provides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am unable to access any tools of Microsoft, because my account is "temporarily suspended"</li><li>Microsoft Online Safety Team does not give me any response, and they are pointed as the only ones that can unsuspend my account</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Under these circumstances, it logically follows that I cannot reach my personal data via the tools Microsoft provides, so I should be able to reach to them via contacting Microsoft, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, they do not allow me to do that, either. When I contact to Microsoft Customer Support, they say they are unable to give me my personal data. So, what gives Microsoft? Is this Privacy Statement a lie? What are the legal consequences of making a statement
 that you cannot keep for a big company?</p>
<p>

<p>I never said nor implied that my account's "temporary suspension" is Microsoft's fault. I am not certain on whose fault it is, but that is completely irrelevant to what I'm after here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My account is "temporarily suspended", and I cannot unsuspend it, but I still have to be able to access my personal data, because: Microsoft's Privacy Statement promises their customers that they will give access to and control of the personal data Microsoft
 has obtained. There are no disclaimers, no exceptions in the Privacy Statement. This is a promise that Microsoft has made regardless of whether the account-in-question is in a "temporarily suspended" state or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thank you for your kind concern about my data being possibly obtained by people other than me,
<em>if I was unable to log-in</em>. However, I luckily still can log-in to my account with my credentials.
<a href="http://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.live.com</a> still gives me an error message that my password is wrong, if I type it wrong. It displays the "temporarily suspended" message only if I type in my password correctly. In
 addition to this, I still retain ownership to the security e-mail address and the phone number associated to my account, which can be used to further verify my ownership.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please make sure you read the aforementioned section in the Privacy Statement first, which I have linked in my original post.</p>

<p>I don't even bring up anything about "the reason for me not being able to access my account", you do. I agree, the reason is completely irrelevant, and so you should stop talking about that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have everything to prove my ownership to my account, and (although this doesn't really matter) nobody else has the access to information/power to prove ownership to my account to the degree I can. Even the most core Microsoft employee with the master-key
 doesn't. That is, if we assume that my passwords for the account are being stored behind a cryptographically secure hash. You definitely should base your&nbsp;<em>comment&nbsp;</em>about "you may not access your data, unless you are able to access data", for anybody
 reading these to give any credit to your <em>perpetuated comment</em> any further.</p>

<p>I'm not banging heads here. I'm not even mad as a victim, not since the first couple of days. I am all good without anything that's on that account, and I was like this even on the morning after. I like being detached from stuff I care, which, when you think
 about it, are actually worthless. I like the way universe separates me from them from time to time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am merely assessing the decency of Microsoft here, evaluating how Microsoft handles this situation to see if I or anybody I know should spend any more money on Microsoft's products or not. Here're the evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>It seems Microsoft finds it OK to keep the money as they prematurely terminate their customers' licenses, when the customer violates some Terms. A trade is fair when one keeps the money and the other one keeps the merits. One which keeps them both is just
 a bad person or commonly referred to as a thief.</li><li>Microsoft also finds it OK to not give any specifics of their detected violation, and not provide any means for the customer to explain or justify the situation.</li><li>Finally, Microsoft finds it OK to come up with a decision by themselves alone, evaluating it from a single perspective, which, in my humble opinion, is very prone to mistakes and misunderstandings.</li></ul>
<p>With all this evidence so far, it looks like I won't be spending any more money on Microsoft's products, and will warn everybody I know by telling them about these evidence, whenever I'm asked for my opinion/recommendation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm mad at Microsoft, not as the particular victim of this incident, but merely as a witness of the incident. In other words, I would feel and start to act exactly the same, if this were to happen to a friend of mine and not directly to me. And
 I'm sure the people under my influence will likely feel similar, for that I'm probably the most tech-savvy person they know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Think of me as a journalist, making sure that Microsoft can eliminate all the data of their customer, just because they "think" the customer has violated the Terms in the most self-centered way possible. I truly have forfeited my hopes on Microsoft
 yielding my data back to me, and I'm just double-checking, insisting, so that I will not be objected with "Did you try [this]?" when I tell people my story. Surely no head bangings here.</p>

    <title>Task not showing as complete - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Task not showing as complete</h2>
                    Hi all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a project that contains a list of tasks that are all fixed duration and that have been assigned to resources.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There are resources on the project that span across 2 calendars (Cal A resources work 8hr, Cal B resources work 7.5hr), and the project has its calendar set to Cal A.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The project is now effectively complete and all the tasks (apart from the odd one which I need to chase up with resources) have had their actual work populated by the assigned resource using the Project Server Web App.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For some reason, the majority of tasks are being shown as not complete even though the work and actual work of those tasks are matching. &nbsp;If I add the Work Complete %, it shows the tasks as being 100% complete which they are, however the Complete % is
 not showing as complete.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Project Server is still showing all the tasks as late because of this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I try to update the tasks so that the Complete % is correct and set to 100 %, Project says I can't do that as it is controlled by the project web app from team members entering values, which I guess is correct.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there anyway to get the project to show these tasks as being complete so that the project server shows the project as being complete?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>An example of a task...</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>%Complete is a DURATION measurement (Actual Duration/Duration) and since your tasks are fixed duration (most of the time that is a fiction-why use it?) each time the work is complete sooner than planned Actual Duration is different from (fixed, remember?)
 duration and %complete is not 100%.</p>
<p>Set the task type to fixed units and your problem disappears.</p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your reply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I used the fixed duration task as basically the task is a block booking for a resource on a project for a whole week. &nbsp;That specific project has its tasks and time recorded in an actual agile system. &nbsp;Project is almost only being used as a resource planner,
 not for project tracking.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So is that not really an issue with Project then if fix duration has that effect of task completion? &nbsp;I guess it is an issue with the resource being under one calendar and the project under another that you then get discrepancies with duration?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Switching those tasks to Fixed Units does convert some of the tasks to 100% complete, but other tasks show as only 99% complete. &nbsp;Any ideas?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>
        </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Project isn't used for tracking, why worry about %Complete?</p>
<p>This is not "an issue" but athe application of the basic formula %Complete= 100*Actual Duration/Duration.. It has
<u>no relation whatsoever to calendars</u>. The discrepancy is that as for duration measurements, the task is not complete!</p>
<p>Of course as for work it is complete - show %Work Complete</p>
<p>If you don't like the fixed units setting, I think Big Brother Server will allow you to set remaining duration=0 which will put %Complete to 100%: that is also the way to get rid of the rounding errors that cause the 99%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Microsoft Office Product Activation Failed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joel alerre  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Office Product Activation Failed</h2>
                    A few months ago I received Microsoft Office 2010 Professional Plus from my college because it was required for a course I was taking. I downloaded and it did not ask me for an activation key. It worked fine for awhile. Now, however, when open any of the
 Office applications it says my product activation key has failed and there is a red bar across the top. It still allows me to use it as usual but I was wondering if there is any way to fix this problem.

            I tried doing the methods suggested but they didn't work. I may try to reinstall the software if I can manage to find where I placed the installation disk but for now I can live with it unless you have some other options for solving the problem. Also,
 just to add more information about the problem, the error code is&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">0x8007232b.</span>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have the product key for Office Professional Plus 2010?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so you may remove Office from the computer by going to Control Panel and programs and Features. After which re-download Office Professional Plus 2010 and install it using the product key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may refer to the post of ‘Rohn’ in the following thread for more information on how to download Office Professional Plus 2010 and check.</p>

                    I can't uninstall Skype for business because I am using Office 365, but it infuriatingly starts up every time I login. I unchecked the boxes for automatic startup, but it seems to ignore that. Is there any way of stopping it?&nbsp;

<p>Hi Rick, Vijay and Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've managed to disable 'Skype for Business', so I'm unwilling to start it again to find the version number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that the key problem is that when you exit Skype for Business, the window closes, but SfB continues to run as an unseen process in background. When you restart Windows, Windows restarts anything running at the time it was shutdown - hence re-initiates
 the SfB process and that opens the window again. SO the important thing for all those getting fed up with SFB popping up, is that when you turn off the auto-runs make sure the last initiated SfB background process has been closed down&nbsp;<strong>before&nbsp;</strong>you
 shut down or restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having done all this now it seems my OneDrive is screwed up - any connection between SfB /lync and OneDrive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks everyone for your help.</p>
<p>Ralph</p>
