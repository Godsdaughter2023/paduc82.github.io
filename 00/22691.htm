<h2>            Does Skype sync on multiple devices&#63;</h2>
                    I notice when I chat on Skype, with my iPhone, the conversations aren't appearing on the app on my Surface. Shouldn't it?

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/0ee6082d-98fc-4c77-92be-ec9a12825731" title="HypnoHelperJoe">

</p><p>
</p><p>Yes, the conversations should sync as long as the correct account is signed in on the other device. Skype uses the cloud infrastructure so you can easily access your messages on any supported platform as long as you sign in to the same account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you check if all your conversations are not appearing on your Surface or is it just specific contacts? Let us know so we can check further.</p>

<h3> danielmiller2943  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook is showing that attachments are being blocked</h2>
                    
<p>When sending an attachment sized approx. 9 mg of an MS Access Database to my trial business email account while testing, I am receiving the following message in my email that is received and I am unable to download or receive the attachment.</p>
<p>"Access to this attachment is blocked" - Recipients may not be able to view the attachment either.</p>

<p>Is this a limitation of the trial?&nbsp; The size of the attachment doesn't seem to exceed the maximum attachment size listed in the Exchange Admin Portal.&nbsp; No spam filters or rules have been setup to block any file types or attachment sizes.</p>
<p>Can someone please assist with further insight to why this is happening, and how I can address this issue?</p>

<p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>Please share some details with me:<br />
1. I want to know how and where the email is sent when you mentioned ‚Äúsending an attachment sized approx. 9 mg of an MS Access Database‚Äù. Are you using some kind of application to send message directly from the database?<br />
2. Does the issue happen in Outlook client or Outlook Web App?<br />
3. If you save the file to your hard drive and attach it in email, will the issue occur?<br />
4. And does the issue occur to all emails with attachments?</p>
<p>Regarding the trial plan, it doesn‚Äôt have any additional limitation compare to the paid version.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Henry<br />

<p>I have got a Nokia X2-02. Since past six months I am trying to update the software of my phone using Nokia PC Suite, Nokia Suite and Nokia Software Updater. But its not working. This problem started when I updated my Windows 7 to Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attached is a PDF file with screen shots of the error messages.</p>

<p>You don't mention whether 32 or 64-bit but have no issues with any Nokia Software using Windows 8 Pro on 64-bit machine. Nokia Suite should certainly be compatible as here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nokia.com/ng-en/support/product/x2-02/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.com/ng-en/support/product/x2-02/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once a Nokia software installation goes wrong it can take a lot of sorting out sometimes necessitating removing redundant key entries in registry and may be quicker to try to get access to another PC.</p>

<p>I recently had to reinstall my Office 365 2016 installation.&nbsp; After removing and reinstalling it, there is an issue when I try and open one Excel file.&nbsp; This file causes Excel to crash.&nbsp; I was able to open the file in Excel 2016 before removing and reinstalling
 Office 365 2016.</p>
<p><br />
The issue is that this is my main Excel file that I keep everything in.&nbsp; I sent to Excel file to a coworker who was able to open it fine using Excel 2013 on his sytem.&nbsp; I have also uploaded it to Google docs and was able to open the file and also downloaded
 Open Office and was able to open the file there as well.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on how I can get this file to open in Excel on my machine?</p>
<p>I am running MS 10 with Office 365 2016 as I said earlier.&nbsp; Any help is appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

                    <p>It's the second time after install and Update on Windows 10 Mobile Technical Preview that the battery draining quickly and the phone overheat because the Photo App's search photos proccess don't stop even the App it's closed or the phone are restarted, I

            <p>I was able to fix this issue by going into the System Settings and disabling both options under USB. Ask me before using USB data connection and Notify me when I connect to a slower charger. I disabled both of those options and my phone immediately cooled
 off and the battery life returned to a more normal life expectancy.</p>

<h2>            Access to Skype for Business</h2>
                    I am an outside contractor doing business with a company that uses Skype for Business. I frequently use the conventional Skype but do not have access to Skype for Business. The company invites me to participate in a&nbsp;meeting and I cannot access the meeting.
 Skype tries to get me to download Skype for Business and install Office 365 under subscription. What should I do? My next meeting is Wed April 18, 2018.

<p>Hello Alan,</p>
<p>Thanks for the information.&nbsp; I currently have Skype on my laptop (version 12.1811.248.1000). Two questions: Is "Skype Meetings App" for use on laptops or is it only for smart phones? The work "App" made me ask. Also, can I download "Skype Meetings App" before
 my meeting?</p>

<p><span>Hi Cscarlson,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for getting back to me.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'd like to answer your 2 questions one by one as the followings:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1.&nbsp;</span><span> Is "Skype Meetings App" for use on laptops or is it only for smart phones?</span></p>
<p><span>It is for both laptop and smart phone.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2.&nbsp;</span>can I download "Skype Meetings App" before my meeting?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using the phone to sign into the meeting, then you need to download the app in the phone's store (downloading center) before entering into the meeting; if you are using the laptop, you can refer to the following steps (the first documentation
 of my last reply).</p>

    <title>Outlook 2010&#58; Controlling SPAM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gregory winters  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010&#58; Controlling SPAM</h2>
                    
<p>I've been using the Outlook application since it's '97 version, and with each release, I'm again extremely disappointed that MS doesn't provide nearly the functionality required to control SPAM in email.&nbsp; Anyone who has ever sent or received a single email
 message knows how humans interact with and prioritize browsing their Inboxes, but MS developers seem either oblivious to this information, or they outright disregard it.</p>
<p>When we receive messages, there are basically only two elements of the message we look at - the Sender alias and the Subject line.&nbsp; Between these two, we judge the worthiness of the message to receive our attention.&nbsp; Speaking for the English language only,
 I can say that it's not hard to use the Sender's alias and the Subject line to determine the personal value of messages in nearly every case, but the way that Outlook is designed, one would believe that the nuance of language is the<em>least</em> of the requirements
 in email use.</p>
<p>For a long time, Outlook has provided the ability to create 'rules' which are (allegedly) designed to examine incoming messages based upon certain user-defined criteria, then act according to those criteria.&nbsp; By now (v14), we've certainly been provided with
 a generous list of conditions as well as actions that we can choose to manage email messages.&nbsp; What is glaringly absent from the lists, however, are two crucially important aspects of human decision making:&nbsp; boolean logic and English syntax.&nbsp; Let me cite examples:</p>
<p>Let's say that I wish to have a Rule act upon multiple criteria, but in an 'OR' condition.&nbsp; The only thing a List approach permits a user to perform are 'AND' functions.&nbsp; So...if I wish to eliminate all messages from 'Joe Schmoe' OR 'financial gain can be
 YOURS!', I have to create two rules.&nbsp; The problem with this is that Outlook runs rules in some sort of sequential order, and when messages that meet both criteria are discovered, or if one rule is necessarily run before another, then errors occur.&nbsp; It's far
 too difficult to account for all of the OR conditions in many cases to provide for separate rules in an AND structure.</p>
<p>Another example...I can't for the life of me understand why MS would believe that it's more important to block domains, cryptic header information, etc., than to simply provide us strong tools for dealing with aliases.&nbsp; After all, the only thing the vast
 majority of us ever examine in our email Sender info is the alias, checking to find if it's someone we're familiar with.&nbsp; What on earth is the idea behind blocking domains when, for years, every major domain on the planet has been hijacked by spammers?&nbsp; If
 I'm getting mail I don't want from a hotmail.com domain, for example, why would I want to block that domain thereby excluding all of my legitimate contacts who use that service?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along these same lines, Block Sender is an equally ridiculous exercise, and excruciatingly so because MS believes a 'sender' is a synonym for an email address.&nbsp; I've received thousands of messages from 'John Cummuta' over the past few years, and nearly every
 one of them is associated with a different email address from all over the world.</p>
<p>This brings me to the point of the language itself as displayed in the Sender and Subject lines of an email message.&nbsp; Here is where the battle reaches the level of absurdity.&nbsp; Although Outlook indeed (finally) allows the user to include the text of these
 areas in a Rule (note: the <em>exact</em> text string, letter case and all) dealing with 'specific words', it forces the user to be just as imaginative as the spammer when fighting the incoming messaging.&nbsp; No wild cards are permitted, and no partial text strings
 - two fatal omissions which render the 'specific words' functionality virtually impotent.</p>
<p>At last count, I have nearly <em>seventy</em> different 'specific' rule criteria set up to get rid of SPAM for Viagra - all because I cannot tell Outlook to dump everything *viagra*.</p>
<p>Interestingly, spammers are aware of the disgraceful weaknesses of commercial email clients as it is easy to tell from their sends.&nbsp; They combine words, use mixed case, substitute similar-looking characters for letters, add spaces in unnatural places, and
 employ other easy-to-spot tricks in order to bypass SPAM filters (and Outlook-style client Rules).</p>
<p>Just a few simple improvements to the Rules tool would instantly exterminate the vast majority of this SPAM.&nbsp; How do I know this?&nbsp; All it would take is a basic committment to WYSIWYG - the one thing that spammers must rely upon for us to take their messages
 seriously.&nbsp; Think about it:&nbsp; if Outlook knows enough to <em>display</em> the text in an alias, why cannot it<em>act upon</em> that display?&nbsp; Leave filtering messages based upon IP address and the like to the geeks.&nbsp; I've got no less than<em>four</em> entries
 in my anti-SPAM Rule exactly given as <strong>HomeImprovementLoans</strong>, but Outlook, not using WYSIWYG as its guide, still permits messages with this exact text string passage.</p>
<p>We've all tried to trust our mail servers' spam filters, but I've found that far too many times, these applications are not worthy of this trust.&nbsp; I've been on the phone numerous times with my Exchange Server admins and&nbsp;ISP tech support wanting to know why
 certain messages were flagged, and rarely are they able to tell me what the issue was.&nbsp; I've seen it all:&nbsp; multiple messages from the same Sender (same domain) make it through and one flagged; messages from folks on my Safe Senders list get flagged; messages
 from spammers specifically marked for Junk allowed through (both server and client side).</p>
<p>I can tell that MS is not serious about assisting us with SPAM because of the near-facetious way they<em>do</em> purport to help.&nbsp; What kind of twisted logic allows the user to set up a Rule commanding that a message be permanently deleted if it meets certain
 criteria, only to arbitrarily pair it with a criterion that additional execution of Rules be stopped upon finding a YES condition ("stop processing more rules")?&nbsp; I've heard it said that this applies only to that particular message, but ever since Outlook
 97, what this has actaully meant is that the Rule stops processing<em>altogether</em>.&nbsp; Thus, the very first message that meets the criteria is indeed permanently deleted, but then the Rule ceases to run permitting hundreds of<em>other</em> messages that also
 meet the Delete criteria to enter the folders, either Inbox or Junk.&nbsp; (I know this is happening, because when I run the Rule manually, then it deletes the offending messages.)&nbsp; Besides, shouldn't it be obvious the difference between setting up a Rule for
<em>all</em> messages vs. just one?</p>
<p>C'mon folks...we don't need new ribbon bars, One Note fluff, and the like.&nbsp; Nearly fifteen years ago, Mr. Gates promised that Outlook would replace Windows as the client desktop of choice and his brilliant understanding of the four elements of human interaction
 - calendars, messaging, tasks, and contacts - is still largely wasted in Outlook.&nbsp; Thunderbird and Lotus Notes should have long been retired to the scrap heap, but they continue to flourish as&nbsp;reminders that until MS takes its&nbsp;serious-users community
<em>seriously</em>, and provides us the <em>real</em> capability we need to manage our information exchanges, SPAM will continue to be<em>the</em> debilitating element of our email experience.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>I agree with many of your sentiments, but rather than boolean logic, which Outlook does offer to a degree, I'd really like regular expression rules.&nbsp; Still, though, even that would be nearly powerless to control junk mail because it's such a moving target.&nbsp;
 Better to use a bayesian filter like Outlook already uses, but to make it trainable.</p>
<p>The best approach to SPAM, however, is not to force the recipient to deal with it, but to make it so costly to send that there is no longer an economic gain or to create an electronic infrastructure that contains built-in controls that prevent it in the
 first place.</p>

            I have been searching for a way to get rid of spam/phishing expeditions by targeting the "domain" rather than the "sender"&nbsp; This exposition above was technically way above my head but thought, since it mentioned the "domain", that I might get an answer.&nbsp;
 That's question #1.&nbsp; Question #2 is do you know of a way to sort the "rules" or do you think Microsoft could fashion a way to sort the "rules" so that one could put them in some sort of order without the little up and down arrows? I have nearly 400 "rules"
 and today found at least 4 alike for one sender.&nbsp; So time consuming and these are supposed to make our lives easier!?!&nbsp; Thank you for any response you can give me on either of these 2 questions. Roberta

            <p>Put the domain in the blocked senders list to have all messages from that domain delivered to Junk Email instead of the Inbox. Rules are a particularly bad way of dealing with junk, since the target is so volatile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rules should not be sorted alphabetically. That can affect their behavior. Rules should occur in the order you want them processed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Often you can combine rules. For example, if you want to target messages from @domain1.com, @domain2.com, and @domain3.com, create a rule "with specific words in the sender's address" and include "domain1" or "domain2" or "domain3" as the specific words.</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>I've been using the Outlook application since it's '97 version, and with each release, I'm again extremely disappointed that MS doesn't provide nearly the functionality required to control SPAM in email. &nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Having also been an Outlook user going back to '97 - going to add some comments on how I've finally dealt with when it comes to spam which at the end of the day is not dependent on any "rules", "white/black list filters" or any 3rd party anti-spam addin.
 When it's a case that it's critical that "false positives" not be missed, having to review all that in Outlook takes an inordinate amount of time. Trying to keep pace with how spammers make minor changes to things which can end up bypassing filters - equally
 a complete waste of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW (and acknowledge that this is certainly not for everyone)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step #1 - where possible, deal with things at the email server level (for those that manage their own custom domains and have backend cPanel server access). For example, there was a point where one of my email accounts was getting a never-ending stream of
 stuff from designer domains (i.e. .racing, .faith, .review and some 30+ others). Since I don't know anyone with any one of those designer domains, simply trashed anything incoming before it hits the server &lt;Inbox&gt; and if the day comes that there is someone
 with a legit email address from one of those designer domains, just a matter of "whitelisting" what I want on a case by case basis versus wasting time dealing with "what I don't want" (i.e. certain words found a subject and all kinds of other similar conditions).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step #2 - For three particular accounts, could and cannot afford the risk of anything being flagged as a "false positive" under any circumstances and was not remotely interested in constantly reviewing the "Junk" or "Spam" folder just to look for "false
 positives". Was able to deal with this using a 3rd party program called &lt;<a href="http://www.contactgenie.info/mailwasher-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MailWasher</a>&gt; (now going on almost 10 yrs) allowing the instant (and quick) visual review of
 what's waiting to be downloaded in a list format along with being able to view the message contents while the messages are sitting on the server. Can view all accounts at the same time without needing to download anything in Outlook (or whatever email client
 someone happens to be using). Within a few seconds, can readily check for garbage and delete those items from the inbound queue leaving only the things I "want" showing up the Outlook &lt;Inbox&gt;".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't begin to describe the amount of time &lt;<a href="http://www.contactgenie.info/mailwasher-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MailWasher</a>&gt; has saved me over the years but like everything else, there's no single solution that's going to work for
 everyone - just commenting on my own experiences. Quite frankly, fighting with any anti=spam solution whether Outlook or any other 3rd party anti-spam solution, just became a serious time-consuming PITA. As much as I like
<a href="http://www.contactgenie.info/go/mailwasherpro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a><a href="http://www.contactgenie.info/mailwasher-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MailWasher,</a> don't employ any customized spam options either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step #3 - Once the list of email items has been cleaned to be what I want, then, and only then, do those get downloaded via a manual Send?recieve using Outlook rules to isolate (move) messages (where applicable) to folders based on specific criteria such
 as "deal with immediately" or "read later i.e. newsletters", or whatever criteria is applicable). Just so much easier dealing with only things you want to see versus wasting time trying to deal with things you "don't want".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having also been on the other end of this, there have been a number of times over the years that someone has contacted us to complain that they have never heard back or they didn't get purchase info etc (reason - they didn't check their spam/junk folder).
 It's a waste of our time since a message has to be sent from a secondary email address/domain used strictly for that purpose in hopes of and in order to bypass all the protections the person may have set up to protect themselves from "spam" forgetting to "whitelist"
 the email address they just requested information from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't think there will ever be any kind of automated solution that is going to 100% perfect where someone isn't going to run the risk of either "not-seeing" or "losing messages outright". Where that involves things like sales &amp; support - can become very
 costly. Wasting time trying to circumvent spammers via "rules" who spend their entire day working on ways to circumvent things is an equally time-consuming and costly endeavour IMHO.</p>

            <p>It's interesting that after well over five years, we're still talking about the same problems (and I was bringing us up to date from years prior).&nbsp; Basically everything I wrote in the original email still stands, which lets the user community know just how
 much Microsoft cares about our experiences.&nbsp; Although Mr. Timmermans' response is thoughtful and helpful, in a way, it's what Microsoft seems to depend on in order for users to continue to struggle with their products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mr. Tillman, on the other hand, doesn't seem to ever have investigated the source of a single spam message in his mailbox, else he wouldn't have suggested the useless 'solution' of blocking domains with Rules.&nbsp; Mr. Tillman, just for your information, just
 about every spam message that comes into an Inbox is sent from a <em>unique domain</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, even after all these years, there is still only a few hundred subjects that catch people's attention, and as I suggested in my original post, if Microsoft would understand that users care nothing about domains and everything about Subject Lines
 and Sender aliases, this problem would be almost instantly solved if we could create Rules for these.&nbsp; Why Microsoft has refused to offer this simple spam remedy is beyond me, so instead, we have to rely on inconsistent third-part applications and place our
 faith in server-side spam filters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although we now have different designer colors to display Outlook in, we are still plagued with the same problems that have been part and parcel with Outlook since at least '97:&nbsp; Outlook ignoring selections about blocking from the Junk sub-menu, Outlook
 refusing to connect with Exchange ("Disconnected") even though there is a valid network connection (the Send/Receive button is
<em>still </em>totally useless), not remembering the user's default mail format preferences, etc.&nbsp; And...with the advent of this new hybrid online setup, formerly fairly reliable tools such as spell-checker and AutoCorrect have been trashed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way these issues are ever going to be resolved is if Microsoft relieves those in charge of Outlook of their positions and places people in authority who actually
<em>use </em>email from the 'outside world.'&nbsp; Having Developers! Developers! Developers! in charge or your architecture and interface makes about as much sense as having a mechanic design an automobile or a plumber architect a house.</p>

</p><p>With all due respect, I find it interesting that the people who deem this (or any complex issue for that matter) to be a simple and straight-forward problem to solve are typically arm-chair quarterbacks who don't have the responsibility to fix anything and
 never provide a proven comprehensive and detailed solution for anyone (developers?????)&nbsp; to implement. Any vendor (large or small) that could provide a 100% fool-proof &lt;spam&gt; solution would have revenues beyond anyone's wildest imagination (and then some)
 so to think that no solution is available from anyone because of lack of interest is absolutely and totally ludicrous. Any individual who could actually design such a solution for others (developers?????) to implement would also likely not have to worry about
 his/her financial future unless they decide to give it away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A stark reality is that for every security measure / methodology that is put in place - there are those out there that are going to find a way to get around it - a never-ending cat and mouse game applicable to anything. To believe otherwise is to have the
 most overly simplistic of views of the world we live in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...................</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which vendor that produces an &lt;email client&gt; are you suggesting has a fool-proof solution? Apple? Any 3rd party software vendor? Something available perhaps that runs on Linux? Or are you suggesting that everyone in the industry in general either doesn't
 care or is just incompetent?</p>

            <p>I've been in IT for 34 years...I'm no "arm-chair quarterback"; I know my way around.&nbsp; Since you claim to be similarly experienced, I should be able to speak to you in technical terms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, where do you read in either of my posts that the requirement is a "fool proof" solution?&nbsp; Are you insinuating that because something can't be made to be absolutely free of error then it should remain shoddy and unreliable?&nbsp; Not being able to
 make something 'fool proof' is simply an excuse foisted upon the public to get us to accept poor quality products as evidenced by the massive number of bugs in them ("bugs" is a warm-fuzzy term also jammed down our throats in place of the more truthful term,
<em>malfunction</em>.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, the answer to the issues <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">is </span>
simple:&nbsp; it's called <em>instrumentation</em>.&nbsp; Since you are an IT professional, you should already know what it means to instrument an app.&nbsp; Microsoft refuses to do this with their products, so here we are - on the
<em>sixteenth version </em>of Office - and we're still dealing with 'intelligence' from the applications such as "Excel has stopped working."&nbsp; DUH.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thirdly, applications can be and should be architected to have code routines which are bi-directional with the user interface.&nbsp; The fact that they aren't is sheer laziness on the part of the manufacturer.&nbsp; In Outlook, for example, the application knows where
 to fetch the data used to display subject lines, sender aliases, and even the text that appears in the body of the email.&nbsp; It would be a simple process to permit users to access this data through the Rules engine and instruct Outlook that when it 'sees' the
 mentioned, and created a dictionary of alpha-numeric and special characters used in the messages that if Outlook would permit to apply through the simple process I detailed here, it would cut my spam by a huge margin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Spam is not the same as 'security measures.'&nbsp; This is because unlike the behind-the-scenes maneuvering taking place purely in the world of electronic bits and bytes, spam must eventually translate itself into attention-getting (albeit false) messages in
 the attempt to get the user to open and read the messages, and possibly click on the links or download attachments.&nbsp; Server-side software has already significantly improved over the past few years, but as you mention, spam still gets through.&nbsp; Still, I would
 say that there are only a handful of spam messages that I get each day that would not be caught by a simple set of rules that, if available, would take care of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a difficult choice to decide between nonchalance and incompetence, I must admit, but I would have to believe that the issue is the former and not the latter.&nbsp; If you read through my original post once more, you'll see that the issues (e.g., the definition
 of "Sender," the inability to access the Subject Line, etc.) are so easily understood - even by a lay person - that 'incompetence' really doesn't seem to apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I also did not state that I expect to receive professional-level quality in an application for nothing.&nbsp; Instrument the app and I'll pay an extra $100 for it, at least.&nbsp; It would be well worth it for all the time I spend babysitting it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Will have to leave this as a topic "where we agree to disagree". While you may only have a "few hundred" subject lines that catch your attention etc - my experience is that there is no end to the creativity for spam email not to mention cases that occurred
 within the last 2 weeks where everything appeared normal but in fact was sent from inside a legitmate corporate server using a non-existent user. That's also ignoring those messages that "appear to come" from FaceBook friends etc etc. As for "nonchalance &amp;
 incompetence" and any number of other adjectives I've seen thrown around by different people on different topics - will leave that part to others. Everyone has their own idea about what the ideal solution is but coming from one "user" to another "user" - can
 tell you, what you've described is of absolutely no use to me and doesn't "instantly solve squat" on the volume and types of spam I get on a regular basis but I don't claim to represent the majority. It is ideal for those who desire spending time creating
 what I personally consider to be an unwieldy number of "rules" which in turn also adds overhead to the whole process. Again, let's just leave it as possibly something where "we agree to disagree" &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll have to take myself out of this discussion since I don't rely on rules to "prevent" anything - personally find that to be a complete and total waste of time. I just chimed in to describe what I do given a requirement of ensuring that nothing gets missed
 due to "false positives" </p>

<p>Outlook 2007 on Windows 7.&nbsp; When I open the Outlook, I get the following error message... " cannot open your default email folders the information store could not be opened."<br />

I googled this and found a supposed solution which required me to open regedit and look for an RPC file.&nbsp; There isn't one showing in the location I was told.&nbsp; Microsoft has a FIT IT software which would do the repair for you.&nbsp; I downloaded it and still am getting

<p>Outlook will NOT open.&nbsp; When I click OK after this error message, the program closes.&nbsp; Can you help?</p>

<p>Hi, I'm having the same problem as the above person with my Office Product as well. Mine is Office 2016 Home and&nbsp; Student. Like the above poster, I haven't had this problem until recently, and use Office, especially Word, quite frequently.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening existing files or opening blank ones both trigger the same pop up, and it pops up the same way when opened in safe mode as well. Other than trying safe mode, different files, and blank files, I also tried turning my computer off and on again with
 no luck and hitting the 'repair now' option in the pop up box. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer just updated a few days ago, which also happened to be the last time I used it until today. Could the update have something to do with my Office suddenly not working? Or is something on my computer bugging out? It's got me really worried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any help you're able to provide.</p>

<p>Hello Doug</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for these links. As I noted above, I ended up engaging the online "chat" tech support, which led to a somewhat expensive fix (199 dollars; one year subscription to tech support service) that temporarily fixed the problem, but then it happened again
 last night. I used the tech support, who made some adjustments (something about Safe Mode) which I observed. The technician wrote that this problem is due to a recent Microsoft application.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tonight, I opened a document and the same error message popped up again. This time, I kept reopening and then clicked the "repair now" in the dialogue box and I was able to work on my document.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Here's my question:</strong> I'm worried I wasted money paying for this to be fixed and wondering if you have information on what is causing this problem. Like Chelsea's note (above), this just started recently. As an academic who does a lot of work
 from home, this is getting to be a real problem.&nbsp; Does Microsoft have a "fix" coming for this?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I did uninstall and reinstall office several times before giving up and using the online tech support. Their fixes involved some complicated work that I didn't fully understand.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the long reply. I looked over your links. The first one seems most applicable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steven</p>

<p>Hi Doug,</p>
<p>I did the complete uninstall/reinstall; I've uninstalled, reinstalled, and tried to do the online "repair" several times to no avail. The problem occurred again. I followed the "Safe Mode" start but am wondering "will have to do this every single time I
 open Word?"&nbsp; Shouldn't I be able to simply open Word without pressing Control and responding to a the dialogue box? This seems tedious and I''m wondering why this was never needed before.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried the solutions in the link. Everything is updated. The complex "Registry" fixes should have been performed by the online Tech support that I've paid for. I may try them myself since I've apparently wasted my money on the tech support.

<p>After another session with Tech Support service, in which I showed them your list of fixes, the problem seems to be temporarily fixed; however, the technicians did some other adjustments in Word that were not listed in the fixes you provided and warned me
 not to uninstall reinstall since that evidently exacerbates the problems. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is what caused this issue to suddenly occur? Is Microsoft going to provide a simple update to correct the problem? People who pay good money to buy office should not have all this trouble and, in my case, ending up paying more to solve the issues.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm holding by breath that this issue is finally fixed.&nbsp; Appreciate your help.

Using Excel for Mac, I saved an excel file as a csv file to do a mail merge in Word for Mac. &nbsp;When I complete the mail merge, I get an error that reads "Row 87 doesn't have the same number of fields as the first row. Ensure that all records have the same number

<div>What does this mean? How can I check that row 87 has the same number of fields as the other rows? Visually, all the rows/records have the same number of fields and I can't figure out how to fix the error in the original excel file and/or the cvs.&nbsp;</div>

As Phillip indicated, though, it shouldn't be necessary to create a CSV as the record source - a properly structured Excel file can be accessed directly by Word's Mail Merge feature. What happens if you do it that way?<br />

            Dear July, 
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />You need to use Office Outlook to track emails and request read receipt <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-delivery-receipt-to-track-an-e-mail-message-69cd1b39-2300-482d-96c6-22e2f4a96848" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-de...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use this video for guidance <a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/video-track-email-with-read-receipts-b8606b2c-259e-40c9-8ac5-37cfbed33cd8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/video-...</a>
<br />
<br />In Outlook.com you can only set up how your email account will react to those read receipts

<p>Many thanks for your quick answer. So from home, i will set my computer with those specs as you told me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, do you have an idea when i am for example in an internet caf√©, using outlook.LIVE.com website ? Because, I do not always have my own computer, and i really need to get the confirmation that my emails were received.</p>

<br />I am afraid it is not possible in online version. You need to do it using Office Outlook. 
<br />
<br />If you are unhappy with this lack of functionality, all I can suggest is to submit your feedback to developers here <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.uservoice.com/</a> If there will be enough votes, maybe developers will make changes

    <title>Since upgrade, Outlook 2013 wants to activate - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lisa hall bates  say:</h3>
<h2>            Since upgrade, Outlook 2013 wants to activate</h2>
                    <p>I see I am not the only person this is happening to, but since the Windows 10 upgrade, Outlook, runs through an installation process, asking me if it can make changes, then eventually, finishing so I can use the program. This happens at random, not every
 day. Also, many times, after this long install process completes, it tells me I have to reactivate. It tells me "most of the features of Outlook have been disabled. Choose an option below to reactivate."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then have the option to enter my key or Sign in. I have a subscription to an action pack, and have for many years. I purposefully did not activate the Office 365 subscription, because I did not want to cause problems such as this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I enter my product key. It is accepted, with a green check mark, and I click install. Sometimes this takes, sometimes, like today, I get a red stripe across the top of outlook, which says, "TRIAL PERIOD HAS EXPIRED This trial of Microsoft Office is expired.
 Editing in Outlook has been disabled." with a Buy button in the bar. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This has never been a trial version. I had Office 2010 installed, then upgraded to 2013 when it was released. I have done this several times already today, and it is getting very old. I am not even given the option to do a telephone activation, as others
 in this same boat have had.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually, I will close and reopen Outlook, once or twice and all will be fine. Anyone with any clue as to why this is doing this, or what switch was triggered somewhere in the registry, or any solution will be much appreciated. Thanks</p>

            Well, I ended up just installing the 2016 upgrade. This version works well. I never tried uninstalling 2013 completely then reinstalling, but that would have been my next try. I am just glad that the upgrade was released when it was!

    <title>Why does a rule with a script not work&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bbran  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does a rule with a script not work&#63;</h2>
                    For some reason this occurs anytime this one particular rule is imposed on an e-mail message.&nbsp; The rule appears to work becuase it deletes the message but no forward is ever sent and after the error message, the rule is turned off.&nbsp; The rule includes a
 script to forward the message and then as with all rules I create, it stops processing more rules.&nbsp; How can I get Outlook to use the script and stop turning off the rule?<br />
<br />
I have the rule set up for a specific account with specific words in the senders address, to run the script below and then permanently delete the original message and stop processing more rules.<br />
<br />
I patterned the rule after the following website suggestion: <a href="http://www.slipstick.com/outlook/rules/run-script-rule-change-subject-message/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.slipstick.com/outlook/rules/run-script-rule-change-subject-message/<br />
</a><br />
I of course put in an appropriate e-mail address but everything else is just as you see it below.<br />
<br />
Sub Forward(Item As Outlook.MailItem)<br />
Set myForward = Item.Forward<br />
myForward.Recipients.Add "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***"<br />
myForward.DeleteAfterSubmit = True<br />
myForward.Send<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
I did some more testing and it turns out the message does not get forwarded but it does get permanently deleted, so that tells me the script is not working.&nbsp; However, I can do the same thing w/o the script and it works fine, so it is not the forwarding address.&nbsp;

            <p>The shown script itself looks ok. It would fail of course if you enter an invalid email address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another error that could occur depends on the email account. For instance, my hosted OpenXchange account doesn't allow DeleteAfterSubmit=True (throws an 'operation not supported' or something&nbsp; like that). Instead you'd have to delete the sent email by code.</p>

<p>Hi Jen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in our forum, before the troubleshooting, we would suggest you try the steps below to clear the credential:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open
<p>2. Click "<span style="font-weight: bold">Windows Credentials</span>".</p>
<p><span>3. Under "</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Generic Credentials</span><span>", find the entry that starts with "</span><span style="font-weight: bold">MicrosoftOffice1</span><span style="font-weight: bold">6</span><span style="font-weight: bold">_Data</span><span>".</span></p>
<p>4. Expand that entry and click on "<span style="font-weight: bold">Remove</span>".</p>
<p><span>5. Now open any Office program</span><span> and sign in.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem still persists, we'd like to confirm some information to clarify your situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Are you able to sign in to portal.office.com with the current account?</p>
<p>2. The screenshot of the error message.
</p>
<p>3. Can you sign into other Office applications such as Word or PowerPoint?</p>
<p>3. Please provide the screenshot of the product information, you can check it in
<p>

<p>Hi Tisky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply!&nbsp; Weirdly, I opened up the same excel file this morning and the tan banner prompting me to activate is no longer there.&nbsp; I didn't do anything on my end, so it must've just been a fluke.</p>
<p>
