<p>No, only automatic generated links for you will expire! Those links are created when you have select desired edition and language to download. Then you have 24h time to click download link for 32- or 64-bit iso-image before those links expired,&nbsp;after that
 you can start &nbsp;all over from beginning.</p>

            There are heaps of Builds we receive, they just keep coming over &amp; over.&nbsp; So, instead of having an ISO for
<em>every</em> one, we get then periodically.&nbsp; When they are needed, they become better than not having any and they are not SO old that it isn't much to bring one up to a current Build.<br />

            No, Drew, not "periodically."&nbsp; All builds flighted to Slow Ring have ISOs posted (except for 17074, which had issues found after flighting). &nbsp;

<p>Either I didn't word it well or you misunderstood.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>We are talking about Insider Builds.&nbsp; Not mainstream, bi-annual Major Updates such as, Fall Creators Update.<br />
<br />
Nor about Slow Track.&nbsp; As I said, earlier, I don't &amp; have never done Slow Track.<br />
<br />
Was meant in the sense that if ones Insider Build(s) go awary or for whatever reasons, these ISOs let Insiders get back on track when necessary.&nbsp; OR clean install w/ them (for Insider) reasons.<br />
<br />
If &amp; when it is necessary to rebuild ones Insider&nbsp; Build or Insider Build going again for whatever reason, it becomes damn nice to have these ISOs available to use!&nbsp; Been there, done that.<br />
<br />
These are Insider ISOs for Insiders&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span></strong>, Consumer versions for mainsteam End Users.<br />

<h2>            Office 2019 Pro - splash screen says 365, icons say 2016</h2>
                    <p>I run Windows 10, am an amatuer photgrapher, and am paying an annual subscription to MS so I can have storage for tons of picture files and all my Office documents. This gives me access to Office 365, but I never installed that because my job participates
 in the Microsoft HUP program, allowing me to download Office Pro Plus at a discount.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until today, I was running Office 2016 Pro Plus. This evening I downloaded and installed Office 2019 Pro Plus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing, I ran Windows updates, and even though products should update by that process, I find that if I run updates from within an Office product, more updates are found on occasion, so I ran that, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the rub:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Opening any Office product, I can navigate to File/Account, and see that my activated product is Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2019</li><li>When any Office products are opening, the splash screen says Office 365&nbsp;</li><li>If I hover my mouse over any Office icons, the pop-out says Word/Excel/PowerPoint/etc. 2016</li></ul>

            Hello
<br />
<br />A pleasure to help you.
<br />
<br />My recommendation is to completely uninstall the Office Pro Plus or previous versions that were installed on the computer, for this I recommend doing it manually to clean all types of folders and associated records.
<br />
<br />Manually uninstall Office
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manually-uninstall-office-4e2904ea-25c8-4544-99ee-17696bb3027b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manual...</a>
<br />
<br />Then download Office 2019 following the steps below, which I'm sure you know.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/download-and-install-or-reinstall-office-365-or-office-2019-on-a-pc-or-mac-4414eaaf-0478-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/downlo...</a> 48be-9c42-23adc4716658?

<br />Here's the rub:
<br />* Opening any Office product, I can navigate to File/Account, and see that my activated product is Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2019
<br />* When any Office products are opening, the splash screen says Office 365
<br />* If I hover my mouse over any Office icons, the pop-out says Word/Excel/PowerPoint/etc. 2016
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />It's all Office 2019, no need to uninstall. They all use the same code base (and are all version 16.0.xx) - its just goofiness with the branding.  The Control panel, Mail icon also says 2016 too - that should change soon as should the designation when you hover over the icons. 
<br />
<br />This is the important designation:
<br />&gt;&gt; File/Account, and see that my activated product is Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2019

<br />Why does my new 2019 version of office seem to have three names?
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Likely has a lot to do with the sequence of events of your installs and whether or not you logged into your MS Account for PP'2016 or not. But some observations from various configuration scenarios
<br />
<br />#1 - On a system where only '2016 PP is installed
<br />a) - Splash screen doesn't show either '2016 or 365
<br />b) - Dragging icons to the desktop - does not include '2016 
<br />
<br />#2 - On a system where only '2019 in installed 
<br />a) - splash screen does show '2019
<br />
<br />So I'm guessing that somewhere along the line the '2016 install got switched to 365 to account for the splash screen.
<br />
<br />As for the desktop icons, here I'm guessing that those were manually changed to include '2016 but since '2019 installs into the same folder as 2016 - the desktop icons wouldn't have changed.
<br />
<br />Beyond that - everything that Diane has mentioned applies.

            BTW, do you have a 'show additional licensing information' link above the product activation info?  If you click it, does it list 2016 too?  The only way to get rid of that is by using the Easy Fix tool to wipe **everything** office from your computer - including the outlook profile, all customizations, any custom templates in the default appdata path.

<p>
</p><p>Yes, clicking the "show additional..." as you suggested shows three products:</p>
<ul>
<li>MS Office Pro Plus 2019 (activated)</li><li>MS Office Pro Plus 2016 (activated)</li><li>MS Office 365 (subscription) </li></ul>
<p>The two activations make sense to me, but I don't remember ever subscribing to 365, unless that was included when I subscribed to OneDrive to have more storage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is this "easy fix" tool you mentioned? Where do I get that?</p>
<p>

            Rather than using the easy fix tool, use the activation utility to remove the extra licenses. Go to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/unlicensed-product-and-activation-errors-in-office-0d23d3c0-c19c-4b2f-9845-5344fedc4380#bkmk_fixit_2016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/unlice...</a> - that link should take you to the troubleshoot 2016/2019 activation problems. If not, its about halfway down the page.  This will remove all of the licenses and you'll sign in with the one you want, which would be the EDU license I believe.  
<br />
<br />I decided to finally fix one of my computers that had multiple activations listed after you posted - it took a few minutes to run the license troubleshooter. This computer had a retail license - I needed to reenter the license key to reactivate. 
<br />
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; * MS Office 365 (subscription)  
<br />if you have 1 TB of onedrive, its from this. You don't need to activate office on the computer to use the extra space.

<p>I run Windows 10, am an amatuer photgrapher, and am paying an annual subscription to MS so I can have storage for tons of picture files and all my Office documents. This gives me access to Office 365, but I never installed that because my job participates
 in the Microsoft HUP program, allowing me to download Office Pro Plus at a discount.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until today, I was running Office 2016 Pro Plus. This evening I downloaded and installed Office 2019 Pro Plus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing, I ran Windows updates, and even though products should update by that process, I find that if I run updates from within an Office product, more updates are found on occasion, so I ran that, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the rub:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Opening any Office product, I can navigate to File/Account, and see that my activated product is Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2019</li><li>When any Office products are opening, the splash screen says Office 365&nbsp;</li><li>If I hover my mouse over any Office icons, the pop-out says Word/Excel/PowerPoint/etc. 2016</li></ul>
<p>Why does my new 2019 version of office seem to have three names?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Too late. :-)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already uninstalled all things MS Office related. Totally wiped them all out. Made sure nothing was left in my list of programs. Restarted my computer. Reinstalled Office 2019. The first time I opened each application, the splash screen says Office 2019.
 However, every time since that day, even though 2019 is the only version installed, the splash screen when an Office program starts says Office 365, but the "about" from within the programs all say Office 2019 Pro Plus.

<p>Hello Gumball Adams, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of the computer? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 1903/19H1 is the recent available update for Windows Insiders to enjoy the latest features. However, to resolve the installation issue, you may follow the steps listed below and see it works:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Unplug all the external devices except for keyboard and mouse to keep the PC safe from external virus.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Uninstall Anti-virus software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend you to disable the security software applications that are installed on your machine. Most of the times, security software would be blocking the installation, it’s better to remove it from your device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Windows Defender will take over the control in Windows 10 once the third party anti-virus software is uninstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong>: Clean boot. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean Boot starts your PC with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs, so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your installation. To boot your PC in clean boot</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here’s an article for you to refer: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to perform a clean boot in Windows. <span>&nbsp;</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality while in a clean boot environment, however that functionality will return when you reset the computer to start normally after you have finished your troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once after performing the above troubleshooting steps, you may start the installation again and check if it works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes. We look forward to hearing from you soon. </p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for the replies. I don't have an Anti-Virus which serves Defender as my Anti-Virus. I don't usually have external devices plugged in except my mouse. Also, I tried Clean Boot.<br />
<br />
I was stuck at 23% when performing the Installation Progress (I was already on the Blue Screen).&nbsp;<br />
Something like this, But on 23%<br />

    <title>365 group calendar on iPad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ianrichardson7625  say:</h3>
<h2>            365 group calendar on iPad</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We've just started using Outlook on Office365 at my workplace. I've set up my outlook email account on my iPad at home which has synced my personal calendar with my calendar on Outlook.</p>
<p>However it does not included any of the events that have been posted by other people as general whole staff events. There doesn't seem to be any option to access the staff group on my iPad calendar.</p>
<p>I have also tried to access this via Safari browser. Logging into Office365 website, but it seems to link to a slimmed down version of the site, there I can only access my mail, my 'own' calendar and contacts. I cannot view group messages or group events
 on my calendar. It doesn't even suggest that I am a member of any group not give me the choice of adding one. I've also tried using the OWA app on my iPad but that just does exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anyway to access either the full website when on my ipad, or better yet, to sync the information from my groups to my calendar so that I can see them there.</p>
<p>It works fine from a computer, but obviously it would be much more convenient to be able to check the calendar and add events from my tablet as that's on all the time and easily accessible.</p>

<p>Hi LanRichardson7625,</p>
<p>Based on my research and related test, it’s not feasible to see the group calendar on iPad now. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I understand it will be much more convenient if we can check the group calendar information on iPad directly, so we welcome and encourage you to share your ideas through

<h2>            I don&#39;t understand why Symbian has been killed off by Nokia.</h2>
                    
<p>I recently posted my impressions of the 808&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.guru3d.com/showthread.php?t=374416" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.guru3d.com/showthread.php?t=374416</a>&nbsp;and it has it's problems which means I will not be keeping the phone for very long.
 However if Nokia continued with Symbian which has far more potential than Windows Phone I'd have been happy with it and would have stuck with the phone knowing there will be more updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I've never used Symbian before, unless the 3310 run it, though that was a vastly different experience that you cannot compare. I decided just to give it a chance as the 808 was mega cheap on ebay and I thought what the hell, my upgrade comes in April
 and I can sell it then if I don't like it. I broke my phone so I needed to buy a new one and it's a bit of fun trying something other than Android or IOS for once.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to say now I'm not a fan of Windows Phone and IOS being closed systems, I think you can remain open like Android while offering a great selection of apps on the store. Developers really need to get over piracy, especially platform owners and the makers
 of Operating Systems. I feel like there is this trend to go towards a closed OS as an easy way to combat that, rather than offering a great open experience but having a service worth paying for over piracy. For example Steam has really defeated Piracy on the
 PC, people still do it, they always will and it isn't always a bad thing anyways. A lot of the time people will torrent stuff and then later buy it on Steam when they know it is a product they like. If that person goes on to tell other people about it then
 it creates more sales.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what I've read Symbian has this bad image of piracy but I really think that is due to a lackluster service on Nokia's end more than anything. The store needs a lot of work, while it is functioning, it does need a bit of a UI tweak which obviously wont
 be happening. I also feel like you have to get your apps elsewhere to test them first as there is no protection from Nokia like you get with Android where you can get a refund within a certain time in case the app doesn't work. I've bought a few apps now which
 just plain don't work and it has put me off buying anything else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back to the topic though, I've never used Symbian before or had a Nokia since the 3310 and I'm really surprised at how good it is. I said in that thread it feels like a mix between IOS and Android and it even has good functionality of it's own. Belle FP2
 is either a massive step up far too late or Symbian has gotten a lot of hate for no reason, I don't know as It's the only version I've used. The core functionality is good, it is fast, it doesn't drain much battery and it does everything the other platforms
 do. Yeah it looks a bit drab but it's so easy to just change the theme unlike IOS and while you can do it on Android it isn't anywhere near as easy as Symbian. I really Respect Nokia for a lot of things with Symbian and while I said the store needs work, it
 does function. I feel like it probably lacks a lot of options like more categories due to the lack of apps on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've only really got two problems with Symbian and that is the stock browser is bad, which wouldn't be a problem if Nokia was continuing development of Symbian because they could easily fix it in the future. I have switched to Opera which fixes most of those
 issues, though I do wish Symbian supported Flash 11 because of my next point. The second issue is lack of apps, really this is what has lead me to selling the phone come my upgrade in April. You cannot do much on the phone compared to the others because of
 the lack of apps, if there was Flash 11 it would be less of an issue, however not being able to watch stuff like ITV Player or TVcatchup is a big downer. The lack of games is also another depressing thing and really the lack of development on Symbian is depressing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what I've seen of Belle FP2, Symbian is a great starting point for Nokia's Smart Phone future, sadly it looks like it has come too late and they've always ditched it for Windows Phone, which I think is a shame. The other biggest issue Nokia had is they
 never really made good hardware compared to the rest in the past. They've just started making competitive Smart Phone hardware just as they killed off Symbian. If the Lumia 920 came in 2010 for example I feel like more people would have taken notice of Symbian,
 sadly it came to Windows Phone and not Symbian. Sadly like I said it looks like it took too long for Symbian to get good... though I'm only guessing on that as I've never used it before Belle FP2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do like it though and really wish'd Nokia stuck with it.</p>

<p>I think the biggest commercial issue is that the most money in the phone business is made on
<strong>app sales</strong>, and Symbian lost those once the Iphone came along and developers saw unlimited riches developing apps for IOS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that the vast majority of the apps in the Apple shop are useless trash, and most of the rest are so functionally crippled that one needs to buy several to do a single task, is not the point...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, how were Nokia going to get app sales?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Symbian could easily be tarted up to work just like IOS. But the app sales were lost for ever, as of about 2010 when most Symbian developers dropped it and worked IOS-only. And a lot closed down completely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Android was lost to Nokia due to very limited options for product differentiation. So they had to do something else, and WP was the only option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WP is not a bad option. I have played with WP phones and they work fine. And Micro$oft have the resources to drive it forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Piracy is IMHO barely relevant. It affects mostly games - just like on IOS where the vast majority of jailbreaking is done to run games and other trivia. Piracy became big on Symbian once the developer community dropped it en-masse, and what the hell did
 they expect? Many developers didn't just drop development; they actually took the apps off their websites and out of the Nokia app shop, which is a really stupid business strategy. This stupidity is what has driven piracy. I have had to google for a number
 of .sis files, to get apps that I would have paid for happily.</p>

<p>See I don't think Symbian is the problem, Belle is really nice and what Nokia have done is make it function like IOS and Android. I've used both in the past, I left IOS because I found it too restrictive and used Android ever since. Making the jump to Symbian
 Belle, it's pretty much the same experience but with no apps, though the core Belle experience feels more refined than Android. It probably just came too late for Nokia....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also think Nokia hasn't made a Smart Phone to get excited for until the 920. Everything else they made was sub par, poor specs, poor screen and just very clunky and I'm guessing from reviews, Symbian wasn't good before Belle. Like I said though if they
 released the 920 last year on Symbian Belle instead of Windows Phone 8, I think Symbian could have survived. Really all Belle needed was the hardware and it just never got it, the 808 is great for a camera but the hardware isn't mainstream like the 920 is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just find it weird how Nokia handled&nbsp;the whole situation, it took years for them to get going and once they did they retired Symbian and never released it on a relevant&nbsp;Smart Phone to give it a chance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 808 has opened my eyes to Nokia Hardware though, it is good and well made. I'll wait to see if they release a refreshed 808 with better specs and screen this year before I upgrade as I've just seen rumours about it. I'm just not convinced about Microsoft
 making good on Windows Phone, I don't like the experience it currently offers and Microsoft have never delivered on anything worth while in the past apart from Windows 7. If I look at all their software, I don't remember any of it being good and now with Windows
 Phone being a closed experience, you're stuck with Microsoft's software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just think it is a shame, I really like Belle, it just needs apps and Nokia to revive development for it.&nbsp;</p>

            I too still have a soft spot and did feel great sadness in my heart when it was announced that Nokia was moving to Windows Phone. but that was soon forgotten when I had a chance to play with some Windows Phone devices, and now have a lovely 920 in use
 as my daily driver. I will always have a soft spot for Symbian, but as the news sources and users can attest to, it was too late to recover. It went out on a high with the 808 PureView, and the Belle Refresh update to the N8, and for me, it will live on in
 the sunset :).<br />
<br />
But I know that there is nothing more that can be done, and the focus is on other great platforms now such as the Asha Touch lineup and the Windows Phone lineup of Lumia devices :)

<p>The problem for me with the 920 is that it is HUGE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And phone shops are packed with HUGE phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samsung make about 1000 different HUGE phones. If you want a big phone, with a 4-core processor, ultra thin, whatever, there are loads of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess that, for the current "phone season", Nokia have to sell a HUGE phone like everybody else. They missed out on "Star Trek" flip-top phone business which was all the rage 10 years ago and they don't want to miss another big wave like that.</p>

<p>The problem I have is Windows Phone is a locked OS, you have to wait for Microsoft to do everything for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The potential is gone already, Microsoft does not make good software, it's always just bought out the competition but due to laws these days it's having a hard time staying relevant. The only reason Windows is still so big is down to it being open and all
 the third party stuff is great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Symbian is open and so with developer support it could be great. The core experience is almost there, it's pretty much Android but without all the apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Symbian has far more potential than Windows Phone and tbh we need more Operating systems so there is never a monopoly like there has been with IOS and Android.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry no one has followed up with you. It would seem the file associations have been changed or damaged. Easiest thing would be to right-click on the "*.xlsx" file, select "Open With", select Microsoft Excel and put a checkmark in the box for "make this
 the default". Click on Ok/Open.</p>

                    <p>I cannot install a Microsoft Office 2008 license I had bought on my MacBook Pro (OS: El Capitan OS 10.11.4).</p>
<p>The Genius Bar engineers asked me to contact Microsoft, the Microsoft helpline asked me to start a discussion.</p>
<p>It seems many other users have the same issue - where is the solution, please?</p>

            <p>You won't. The sub-project tasks actually belong to the master file. SO save a baseline in the master file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure your files are:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;All on a disk physically in your building (no remote servers.</li><li>Never over-written with newer versions</li><li>Never moved</li><li>Never renamed</li></ul>
<p>If they are, then file corruption will happen eventually. Investigate master files created weekly with the link option off. Much safer.</p>

</p><p>This is ridiculous that one can log in on multiple devices and can make calls from them to&nbsp;different people. Suppose that you logged in on devices x and y. You can call from y to z1 and from x to z2. Why? It should not be in this way. Or one can call from
 z1 to x and the other guy can call from y to z2. This is funny, isn't it?&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a phenomenon. It should not be like this as the usual call services are provided by any providers such that you can make a single call at a time. My opinion is to fix it. BTW, thank you for the response, I thought my device was hacked when I saw
 that my mom called me when I was talking to her.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Insider 16226 Major problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> julsie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Insider 16226 Major problem</h2>
                    <p>I am on insider builds on my laptop and Desktop.</p>
<p>161215 would not install on my desktop, but installed on my laptop without any problem .</p>
<p>I waited for new build and a few hours ago 16226 installed on both my machines with :apparent: ease.</p>
<p>However, my Desktop lost most of my program&nbsp; licences and codes.</p>
<p>My Keyboard would not work at all and Windows kept running 'We have run into a problem' etc.</p>
<p>I was able to type anywhere!</p>
<p>After a while it was clear to me that&nbsp; windows on my Desktop was a mess.</p>
<p>So, I installed 1619 from a backup, and have now signed up for the slow ring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop was also unusable because I could not get the keyboard to work at all.</p>
<p>After a great deal of trouble , I was able to restore to 16125, and have changed to slow ring here as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been a frustrating journey.</p>
<p>Have any others experienced the same or similar problems</p>
<p>I am looking forward to some responses.</p>
<p>Is it at all possible to install the last update prior to insider builds, or to re install a fresh copy of windows 10.</p>
<p>I am beginning to feel that at 86, this is a little harrowing for me</p>
<p>Thanks for all help received from the community during the past few years.</p>
<p>I apologise for being so long winded, but I needed to explain it all.</p>

 goes to a blank screen. I press CTRL+ALT+DELETE and run task manager. Anyone else see this or similar

<h2>            Unable to save coauthored powerpoint after colleagues save their version</h2>
                    <p>When I'm the only person working on a shared powerpoint, I have no issues saving and seeing my changes sync to the shared onedrive folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I'm coauthoring a powerpoint with a colleague, whenever they save, I am unable to save my own version on top of theirs. I get the error: "upload failed: problems refreshing; your changes were saved but could not be uploaded because this file
 could not be refreshed with updates from server"</p>
<p>

            Hi Josh,<br />
<br />
Are you using the OneDrive sync client to sync your documents to OneDrive?<br />
<br />
If so, you can try unchecking the <strong>Use Office 2016 to sync Office files that I open</strong> option in OneDrive settings. Right click the OneDrive icon in the system tray, and click
<strong>Settings &gt; Office &gt; File collaboration</strong>.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, please make sure your application supports co-authoring. Refer to the <strong>

<p>Hi Jiaxing,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After having unchecking "Use Office 2016 to Sync Office Files that I Open" I am still having issues with collaborating with my coworkers. Even though I am able to save a powerpoint and their versions are updated seemlessly, every time they save their version,
 I am forced to save a copy or discard changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that there might be issues with the firewall at my work, but I have the same issue when I'm working from home through my personal ISP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>JP</p>

<h2>            ACCDE Calculated Queries Fail &#40;With Function Calls&#41; in Access Runtime 2010</h2>
                    
<p>I initially posted this problem in another thread but after doing more troubleshooting and finding out more where the problem originates I thought it would be helpful to start a new thread.</p>
<p>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/addbuz/thread/486dd218-a84c-477c-9cc1-8f7775e5a66b#7f05d2ad-2863-4db1-b1a7-0c2a35484038</p>
<p>I have developed an application in Access 2010 with a good number of ODBC connected tables.&nbsp; I have built Queries with calculated fields that include references to internal Date and string functions.&nbsp; The application uses vb code in almost every form including
 other custom created modules etc.&nbsp; After spending quite a bit of time in the other thread where others were trying to tell me that the problem was related to my code and library references I found that this is not the case and this is what I have come up with.</p>
<p>All my modules include explicitly declared variables.&nbsp; The application compiles fine without any errors and functions exactly the way it was designed in the full version of Access 2010 with ACCDB file.&nbsp; I deploy this application to users who install it and
 run it with Access Runtime 2010.&nbsp; This is where the problem starts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a test machine with stand alone Access Runtime 2010 installed so I can test the app.&nbsp; The problem starts to arise when I save the file to ACCDE.&nbsp; ACCDE and ACCDB versions both work the way they should in the full version of Access 2010.&nbsp; When I move
 the files to the test machine ACCDB file works the way it should but the ACCDE file fails.&nbsp; Specifically the function calls in the calculated queries fail.&nbsp; Everyone that has offered advise seems to think this problem is related to invalid library references
 in the application.&nbsp; How would this be the case when ACCDB works fine in Access Runtime 2010.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is one of the Query statement that includes function calls that fail.</p>
<p>Format() fails</p>
<p>Replace() fails</p>
<p>DateAdd() fails</p>
<p>SELECT tcircuits.*, IIf(Not IsNull([tcircuits].[ID]),[tcircuit_id_header].[Header] &amp; Format([tcircuits].[CktID_Serial],"000000") &amp; IIf([tcircuits].[CktID_SubID]&lt;&gt;"","-" &amp; [tcircuits].[CktID_SubID],""),"") AS Circuit_ID, IIf([tcircuits].[Disconnect_Date]
 Is Not Null,"Disconnected",IIf([tcircuits].[Canceled],"Canceled",IIf([tcircuits].[Complete],"Complete",IIf([tcircuits].[FOC],"FOC",IIf([tcircuits].[ASR_Date] Is Not Null,"ASR","No Status"))))) AS Circuit_Status, IIf(([tcircuits].[Term] Is Not Null) And ([tcircuits].[Disconnect_Date]
 Is Null) And (Val([tcircuits].[Term])&lt;&gt;0),IIf([tcircuits].[Renewal_Date] Is Null,IIf([tcircuits].[Effective_Date] Is Not Null,DateAdd('yyyy',Val([tcircuits].[Term]),[tcircuits].[Effective_Date]),Null),DateAdd('yyyy',Val([tcircuits].[Term]),[tcircuits].[Renewal_Date])),Null)
 AS Term_End_Date, IIf([tcircuits].[A_Customer_Location]&lt;&gt;"",Replace([tcircuits].[A_Customer_Location],"Customer Loc:" &amp; Chr(13) &amp; Chr(10),""),"") AS A_Location, IIf([tcircuits].[Z_Customer_Location]&lt;&gt;"",Replace([tcircuits].[Z_Customer_Location],"Customer Loc:"
 &amp; Chr(13) &amp; Chr(10),""),"") AS Z_Location, tcircuit_id_header.Header</p>
<p>FROM tcircuits INNER JOIN tcircuit_id_header ON tcircuits.CktID_Header = tcircuit_id_header.ID;</p>
<p>One work around that I found was to create a custom public function in a module to handle the function calls.&nbsp; For instance rReplace() would take all the same parameters as the Standard Replace() function and return the same string.&nbsp; Because this is one
 of my public functions it seems to work in Access Runtime 2010 ACCDE.&nbsp; This does not solve the whole problem because other features built into Access such as custom filters in datasheets (Filter options generated at the top of the field in the datasheet) fail
 on date fields not just the calculated date fields.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing I found was if I created a test application and imported the tables, queries, and forms that fail but remove the form vba module and then save it to ACCDE the query works.&nbsp; The minute I add a vba module to the form with only "Option Compare
 Database" and "Option Explicit" at the top with no other code the query fails in Access Runtime 2010.</p>

<p>There has always been a problem with using some &nbsp;VBA functions available in Access VBA (certainly including Replace, and also AFAIK a number of the financial series functions) from "outside" Access, e.g. when you connect to a .mdb via ADO.</p>
<p>/That/ problem, AIUI, has more to do with the fact that there are separate tables of functions in Access/ADO/Jet, and that ADO has never been brought in line with Access. Whether it also affects what happens when you save as an ACCDE, I cannot tell.</p>
<p>You'd hope such things would get fixed over time, but I've seen few signs that that actually happens. I don't think it has anything to do with the references you can set within VBA projects. In the ADO case it's frustrating that the solution might be for
 someone to sit down and add a few entries to a table and rebuild the OLE DB provider, even if there is slightly more to it than that.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Edge won&#39;t reopen after closing</h2>
                    <p>For the last several days, if I close Edge for whatever reason, I can't then reopen it unless/until I reboot.&nbsp; Am running Win 10 Home, version 1511, build 10586.29, Edge version 25.10586.0.0, HTML 13.10586.</p>
<p>
</p><p>to be clear, by close, I mean clicking on the X to close program in usual Windows fashion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will note that Process Explorer shows 6 versions of MicrosoftEdgeCP.exe running under RuntimeBroker.exe, both now (with only one tab open in Edge, which I am using to post this msg) and last time I closed Edge.&nbsp; Don't know if that's normal or what -- can't
 say I've paid attention too much to it in past.&nbsp; The command line and path and package shown in Process Explorer all appear identical.</p>

    <title>Accessing shared calendar that is NOT DEFAULT calendar. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Accessing shared calendar that is NOT DEFAULT calendar.</h2>
                    
<p>We need to set up a calendar to put a subset of group meetings on.&nbsp; We don't want these items to be cluttered within any one group member's other calendar information.</p>
<p>One of us established a new calendar folder and marked it as shared with the other users.&nbsp; (This person is currently running Outlook 2003; I have Outlook 2007 and our whole organization is in the process of migrating to Office 2007).&nbsp; When the other users
 try to view the folder, we cannot see it.</p>
<p><br />
The link below has a section on sharing Custom Calendar Folders.&nbsp; But it has no instructions on how the OTHER USERS then can select the calendar to view.&nbsp; Can anyone explain this to me?&nbsp; Thanks so much!</p>

<p><br />
The instructions are for sharing a SUBFOLDER or any non-default folder. The permissions are set the very same way for default or non-default folders - but the other party needs to open the mailbox in their profile in order to view the folder.</p>
<p>From the "Opening the shared folder" section</p>
<p>The person you shared the folder with needs to add your mailbox to their profile, as a secondary mailbox.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Tools, Account Settings. </li><li>Select your Exchange account and press Change </li><li>Click More Settings </li><li>On the Advanced Tab, click Add </li><li>Type all or part of the name of the mailbox that was shared with you.

    <title>Word 365 Table Displays all muddled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hannesbuhrmann  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 365 Table Displays all muddled</h2>
                    <p>I create word documents with a lot of tables, and I have a persistent problem that really drives me mad - the table formatting gets all muddled up. This normally happens after about 10 minutes or so of editing / modifying tables. Cell alignment goes off,
 cell background fills display in the wrong place, and generally it just present messily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes if I minimize the word window and maximize again, or scroll up and down the problem disappear, although this is more often NOT solving the problem. The only real way to solve the problem is to close the document and open it again - which is incredibly
 frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens on ALL my documents ALL the time - newly created ones, existing ones, ones I receive from other people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running latest version of Windows 10 on a Dell XPS laptop at work, but it also happens on my home PC (again with the latest versin of Window 10). This problem has been bugging me for at least the past year or more</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an example of what happens (look at the green cell fills and the vertical column borders)</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>

<p>And when I close and open the document again, this is what it looks like (which is what it SHOULD look like :</p>

            Since this appears to be a display issue, try disabling hardware graphics acceleration in Word (File | Options | Advanced). A long-term solution may be to update the video driver on your system.

<p>Hi, I've had my NOKIA Lumina phone for 3 months and in the past 5 weeks, everytime I make a phone call the screen goes off and I can not end my call and even it takes time to be able to turn my mobile off as it has been the only solution to end my calls
 so far. This is very frustrating as people can still hear you while you are despeartly trying to end your call. If anyone know what to do, please help me out as I am nearly giving up on this phone. Many thanks.....</p>

<p>Sounds like something is obstructing the proximity sensor on your phone. It is usually at the top of the display next to the ear speaker. You didn't say what you have. Usual suspects are a screen protector or dust.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. The Office version. (Click OneNote&gt;select About OneNote)</p>
<p>2. Check if all students’ sections meet the issue.</p>

                    <font color="#000080"><span>Not only has it taken me ABSOLUTELY AGES to register on this forum because the Nokia Support website is so appalling (the register button hasn’t been working for most of the last hour… a clever move by
 Nokia as it’s the best way to reduce complaints), but my E71 is the worst phone I’ve ever used.</span></font><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000080"><span>I am close to getting a sledge-hammer and really letting the handset know what I think of it.</span></font><font color="#000080"><span>&nbsp;</span></font><font color="#000080"><span>Why
 is my phone SOOOOO SLOW?<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s absolutely appalling.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I was given an E71 for work purposes several months ago and avoided using it until recently as my personal phone (an iPhone) is simply superb.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, I am now doing a lot of foreign travel with work and therefore need to utilise my company’s mobile tariff which means me using the Nokia device.</span></font><font color="#000080"><span>&nbsp;</span></font><font color="#000080"><span>The
 problem is the E71 is UNUSABLE as from time to time (and there’s no telling when it will decide to work like this), it decides to go into go-slow mode when it take between 30 seconds and 5 minutes for the device to respond to a single key press.<span>&nbsp;
</span>What do I do about that?<span>&nbsp; </span>There are so many little graphics on the screen and endless menu options that I have no idea what the problem is and how I adjust the settings to improve its performance.<span>&nbsp;
</span>And as I said, it tends to be a little random as to when it goes slow, although it’s normally 90% of the time I use it.</span></font><font color="#000080"><span>&nbsp;</span></font><font color="#000080"><span>Before
 I have a nervous breakdown please can someone help me figure out how to use it?<span>&nbsp;

<p>I've handled several E71's and they are quite quick in operation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe your handset has too many applications open in the background. Multitasking and background programs can make things slow. You can check by holding down the Symbian/Menu key and call up the task manager, then close&nbsp; the unneeded apps.</p>

<p>I have no problem using my Nokia E71 at all, even when there are so many application running in the background, why don't you try updating your software?</p>

<p>Is your Nokia E71 branded and locked on a certain network or sim free?</p>

<p>well you could disable all memory/battery hogging apps and see how it goes.</p>
<p>for example disable bluetooth, wlan auto search, auto email retriaval, disable apps auto startup and uninstall apps you don't need/use. then wait for a couple of days and see how it works. if the phone doesn't hang then it's one or more of the things you
 disabled. so to find out wich one it is you will have to enable them one at a time. like enable the bluetooth and wait for 2 days and see how it goes. if everything is ok then enable the next thing and so on.</p>
<p>anyways it's better to have less things turned on because it saves battery life.</p>
<p>good luck.</p>

<p>I had the same frustratingly slow performance issues rendering the phone almost un-usable other than voice calls. Every thing that required to go to menu and load something was just **bleep** slow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I however resolved all issues by changing the messaging settings to use memory card for emails instead of phone memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do the following and instantly your phone will come alive again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Menu - Communications - Messaging - Mail for Exchange - Settings - Other - Memory in Use - Memory Card</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do the same for other mail accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Keeping the C memory with as much free space as possible is always a good thing - pitty though, cause it operates fast, but the change of messagememory is good. I would also rearrange apps that are installed on C to E if'its possible (some nokia apps can
 only install on C). You should once in a while also clear priviacy data within the browser, which will gain you some space. - If you have a wallpaper - you should resize it to the same pixlesize as the screen.</p>

<p>I don't know how much difference it will make&nbsp; changing the memorycard to a faster one, but it coul be worth a try if you have one spare ( a better class memory).</p>

            Unfortunately this a huge software BUG of nokia since old times! As soon as one install some apps, menu gets frustraitngly slow! I have experienced same problem with models n97mini, n82, n80, n72, 3230, 6600 ! Of course updating firmware means wipe out
 all history of app installations as well as loosing all installed apps! So come on nokia, it's time to hire more professional programmers!

            I did a hard format *#7370# on my E90 - was hoping to get to the source of my constant auto shutdowns. And, of course, after a while, 28-33MB on the C: drive is a bit low. It's now on 122MB (out of 133MB). Works much better.<br />
When you install apps, always choose the memory card E: - where you have a choice.<br />
Also, install docs, images and music files to the memory card.<br />
On the Ovi Store/(Account) Settings, select Memory Card for installation.<br />
Do the same for contacts and messages.<br />
<br />
I see you where complaining about login in here. I had the same problem, couldn't login yesterday - login no longer valid. It's working now. Keep in mind that if you joined Nokia Discussions - or any other user-based forum just to complain - not attempt to
 find a solution - you have already failed.<br />
<br />
In concluding, I narrowed done the possible causes of my auto shutdowns to my battery, and SIM card. While typing this, my phone went off twice, so I removed the SIM, typed this on a note, offline mode. Also noted that the same subscriber identity module (32k,
 about 6 years old) caused the first shutdown of my N70 that I can remember, this morning.<br />
<br />
So check your SIM. The network is the problem. :)<br />
