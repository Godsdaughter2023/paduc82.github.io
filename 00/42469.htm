            <p>Good morning Mr. RajithR!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying. I really appreciate it..</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. For hardware changes, none. For software changes I believe the user applied Windows updates.</p>
<p>2. No codes were written. The error is showing even if the user is not working on any file or program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will let you know once I am done performing Clean Boot - to determine the cause of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, thank you very much..</p>
<p>

<h2>            Disabling auto login for Windows 7 with only 1 account active.</h2>
                    
<p>I've searched high and low across Google but all I've been able to find are methods to enable auto login.</p>
<p>Is there a way to have Windows 7 load up the accounts selection screen even with only 1 account enabled?</p>
<p>I remember this being a function&nbsp;available&nbsp;in XP.</p>

<p>There are probably simpler methods but this one certainly works: Create a dummy account, then cause it to be hidden from the logon screen. The following batch file will do it for you when executed under elevated administrative privileges. You must, of course,
 disable the usual auto-logon setting via this command:</p>
<p>control userpasswords2</p>
<p>And here is the batch file. Use copy &amp; paste - do not retype it! Note that the line starting with<br />
echo &gt;&gt;%RegFile%" is a very long line that ends with "UserList]". Do not break it up!</p>
<p>@echo off<br />
set RegFile="%temp%\reg.reg"<br />
echo &gt;%RegFile%&nbsp; REGEDIT4<br />
echo &gt;&gt;%RegFile% [HKey_Local_Machine\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccounts\UserList]<br />
echo &gt;&gt;%RegFile% "DummyUser"=dword:00000000<br />

<h2>            Possible Account Hack&#63; HELP PLEASE&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>So on Jan. 5 I redeemed 1600 microsoft points, and today I when to buy Castle Crashers, and It said that my balance was only 110 microsoft points. So I checked my billing options, and It said that 5 things of, "gold Players Premeium", and one thing of, "Premeium
 Gold Pack" and these where purchased on the 11th. I Searched what they were in google, and it said that it was for Fifa, as in the soccer game. Now I don't own any Fifa game, but when I checked my recent games it said that I had played it on the 11th, the
 same day as the purchasing of the weird content. There was know way that someone snuck into my house to do this. But can someone access my account from a different area, besides MY XBox? Please help I'm VERY confused!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have been shut down while they investigate. I have found an unknown hotmail address found in my "alternate email" details( windows live billing options).</p>
<p>I believe it has happened to me because of linking my gamertag to ea.com(battlelog).I have since cancelled my ea.com account( it took 4 hours) and they wanted my gamertag and email to cancel!!</p>
<p>They took 6000ms (premium gold jumbo) i gained 2 fifa chevos.When i went to log in to xbox live it said my hard drive data was different ( my pro evo saves were missing).So i turned it off ,then on again and everything was cool.It was only when i went to
 but the kids joe danger i realised the points were gone.</p>
<p>The billing options state the hack was on the 6th of jan,but the hdd data message was on the 15th?</p>
<p>Now my account is shut down,how much communication can i expect with microsoft?</p>

<p>It'd only be linked to that if you used the same log in details for both your EA account and your XBL account. If so then you've learned a harsh lesson about doing such things, if not then it wasn't that which resulted in your XBL account going walkies.

<p>UPDATE: 1-19-2012</p>
<p>Since I first called MS Support on 1-13-12 about my XBL account being compromised, passwords and secret answers being chaned, as well as points stolen and the card on file used to buy even more points (Wasn't me, BTW), I have my account back, along with
 my daughter's, although hers wasn't hit, because I am the "Primary."</p>
<p>I must say, after viewing TONS of posts on-line about the XBOX accounts being hacked, and people having to wait months for their accounts to be back in their control, and well as waiting for refunds for unauthorized purchases, I'm thrilled to have mine back
 in 6 days...6 days, not a month! :)</p>
<p>If no one yet again breaks into and steals/ changes my Windows Live ID password, which was changed like 5-6 times during this "hack", I'll be as happy as that guy who saw the "Double Rainbow." LOL (If they do, I'll be pretty pi$$ed!!!)</p>
<p>MS sent me a couple e-mails, during the week, with codes for MS Point to cover the ones stolen, a couple extra months of XBOX Live, and well as a refund back to my card for the unauthorized charges.</p>
<p>Now I just need the peace of mind to know it won't be hack into again, so I can redeem those codes...for now, NO WAY!</p>
<p>Also, everyone I spoke with at MS was quite helpful, as long as you are nice to them (It's not the individual's fault XBL accounts are being hacked into.)</p>
<p>A BIG "Thank you" to Jason, Rebecca, and the other girl I spoke with on the 13th.</p>
<p>Time to go get my MW3 frag on! :)</p>

    <title>Skype for Business 2016 Search Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xxddff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype for Business 2016 Search Problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hello</p>

<p>With the new Skype for Business 2016 client we encountered a problem with searching and adding distribution groups to the contact list.</p>
<p>With the previous versions including Skype for Business 2015 the search didn't include the location of the contacts in the search.</p>
<p>So when&nbsp; we searched for "Munich" the name of the distribution group it just returned the group and we were able to add it to the contacts.</p>
<p>With the new version the search now also returns all contacts with the location "Munich" and then stops with too many results before showing the actual&nbsp;distribution group.</p>
<p>Searching for the distribution group by its email address&nbsp;also doesn't work. It&nbsp;finds&nbsp;something what looks like a&nbsp;contact called Munich&nbsp;but it's&nbsp;not&nbsp;the group itself.</p>
<p>How to turn off the search for the location or just search for groups?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Reinhard&nbsp;</p>

<p>hi reinhard,</p>
<p>yeah, i reproduced the scenario on my side. when i search a dg’s name in skype for business 2015 and skype for business 2016. the later version of skype for business will show more results.</p>
<p>while after i input the entire email address of this dg, both of them get a unique result.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b7c04295-1289-4bae-979f-1de7e1894063" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b7c04295-1289-4bae-979f-1de7e1894063" /></a></p>
<p>so to analyze the issue, could you provide the following information?</p>
<p>1.does this group belong to your organization? if yes, i’d like to know if you select “add a contact in my organization” button, then input this dg’s email address, can you get the right one?</p>
<p>in the same way, if the dg is not in your organization, please select the “add a contact not in my organization”</p>
<p>2.for “it finds something what looks like a contact called munich but it's not the group itself.”, could you send us a screenshot, so we can better understand your situation?</p>
<p>3.could you send us the detailed version information such as 16.0.6001.1034?</p>
<p>4. to confirm if the root cause is related to the computer, could you change another machine to check the result?</p>
<p>to upload screenshots, select<strong> use rich formatting</strong>, and then click insert /edit</p>
<p>best regards,</p>
<p>toby</p>

<p>hi toby</p>
<p>thanks for the fast reply</p>
<p>1) yes the distribution group is a global security group defined in our local active directory which is mail enabled.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; same result if i add it with “add a contact in my organization”</p>
<p>2)<br />
&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d96291d0-130d-42b8-be87-21b22dd49132" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d96291d0-130d-42b8-be87-21b22dd49132" /></a></p>
<p>the text behind the name is german for presence unknown.</p>
<p>it looks like an unknown contact</p>
<p>3) 16.0.6001.1034 32-bit updated it to latest version but it was the same behavior with the rtm of office 2016</p>
<p>4) tried it&nbsp;on over 5&nbsp;computers so far and also with different users but always the same problem. if the distribution group was added with the skype for business 2015 client&nbsp;or previous for the user account it still works with skype for business 2016.</p>
<p>best regards,</p>
<p>reinhard</p>

Hi Reinhard,</p>
<p>Since the distribution group is synced from local AD, I'd like to confirm whether the same issue happens when you search other synced distribution group?</p>
<p>To determine whether the issue is caused by the synced distribution group, please try searching the Office 365 Online created distribution groups on your Skype for Business 2016 client.</p>
<p>Then let me know the testing result for further troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Vivian</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I created an distribution group in Office 365 and when I search for it with its name it's shown as distribution group but it can't be expanded I assume this is because the distribution isn't synced back to our AD</p>
<p>When I search for it with the email address it's shown as a contact with an unknown presence (same behavior in Skype for Business 2015) When I just search for the alias it's shown as distribution group, as soon as I type the @ it switches to an unknown contact.</p>
<p>The Lync 2013 server is on-premise together with an hybrid Exchange 2013.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Reinhard</p>

    <title>Windows 10 has been hot garbage. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> boonry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 has been hot garbage.</h2>
                    <p>So where to begin. Ive been a lifelong windows user and avid supporter of microsoft breaking antitrust legislation. Because they had working products. And I saw apple as the brand of those that refuse to open a pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few months ago i bought a new computer that had windows 7 , everything worked fine and all was well as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then came windows 10 update notification. "Wow heres this new OS that for the first time ever, microsoft is giving &nbsp;it away for free." Nope nothing worth having is really free. And i was correct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After disabling all auto updates and notifications for windows 10 ,I enjoyed my windows 7 life for a few more months even though for some reason windows 10 updates somehow just kept ignoring my explicit refusal, and attempts to stop "asking" that I upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Imagine my shock after months of refusal, I take some time away from my PC and go on a trip, when I return behold, my computer somehow has updated otself to windows 10. Amazing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I search forums to ask how to revert to my old OS and afyer following the directions provided by microsoft, to my surprise, no such option was available. Thats funny.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Well here we are" I said, surely windows 10 cant be that bad. I was wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within 3 months the problems began to arise. Slow boot ups, unresponsive settings menu, pictures and videos not loading , random crashes. I could have sworn I downloaded a lot of malware. If only that was the case. Malware can be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it happened. A black screen of pure death.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well maybe if I press f8...oh wait that setting was removed. So my computer has to be working to fix it. Interesting. Ok so I call microsft hotline. After being transfered to some second world country. A friendly indian man informed me there was nothing
 he could do on his end so I was to go to a microsoft store. Fine, thats only 2 hours away. Away I go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After being assured by these very professional and surely conpetant staff that it was a simple corruption with the unwanted update, theyd be able to save my data and simply reinstall windows 10. I remember clearly asking, ARE YOU GOING TO DELETE MY DATA.
 To which they replied of course not we have way to preserve the data for you to transfer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short, he lied. Just like that years of compiled and accumulated from past pc data was gone. I mean my decade old prom photos and the like. Music from local bands that long broke up,work documents , transcripts,programs everything went poof.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly this was framed as my fault for having not backed it up ,due to the unexpected possible occurance of a forced OS upgrade destroying my 700 dollar computer. Boy, way to take accountability there. Maybe I should get that drone strike insurance.
 It must be nice knowing that you can screw customers with no repercussions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well certainly they can at least give me back microsoft office. Haha nope.</p>
<p>
</p><p>fine so i take my now perfectly clean slate of a computer home, and things seem to work far better since the upgrade. Im sure i can move on and rebuild. Then the updates happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>seeing as turning off auto updates was just an illusion of control. Is it any suprise that yet another forced upgrade began the process of degradation anew. Disk rate at 100% , slow boot times, videos and picture not loading, settings unresponsive, then
 the crashing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now here I am with a brick of a computer caught in a start up repair loop. Ive tried every fix I could think of, for a time I thought maybe its just this computer. After all the friendly gentlemen at the microsoft assured me this was just a result of my
 PC just not being quite uo the task of working with such a grand and glorious operating system as windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I read the forums. I would go into detail as to what ive learned about the customer feedback of this flagship product. But lets say "lawsuits" and "backlash" were terms thrown around frequently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a windows customer and systems engineer ive tried every fix listed, and nothing offers a permanent or temporary solution to the many problems caused by windows 10 forcing itself onto my computer. As it seems microsoft adds new problems themselves whenever
 they please. I have no other options but to tell this long winded tale of dissapointment at the customer service of a company I have long supported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            Possible fix for broken File Association for .jar &#39;s&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Recently I've discovered that the file association (double click) for .jar files on my Windows 7 x64&nbsp;has been broken some how.&nbsp;I can still execute the .jar files from the command line, and the problem persists despite several clean installs of the JRE so
 it definitly seems like a problem within Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions on how to resolve this?&nbsp; Thank you in advance for the assistance.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; I've been manually trying to associate the file, using this suggestion;</p>
<p>assoc .jar=JARFile<br />
ftype JARFile="C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin\javaw.exe" -jar "%%1"</p>
<p>but recieve the following error</p>

            <p>It depends on whether there is other sound that you want and if that sound is on the same track or on the added music track.&nbsp;There is sound that is associated with your video and sound that you add (like music).</p>
<p>On the Video Tools | Edit tab (which apepars when you select a clip), you can change the Video Volume.&nbsp;You can use that to reduce the volume of your original clip, all the way down to 0, if you like.&nbsp; This would work well if you wanted to remove all the
 audio from the video clip and only hear the music.</p>
<p>That's how you would do it for a single clip, or several clips.&nbsp; If instead you want to do this for all your clips (only have the added audio), you can use Audio Mix on the Project tab.</p>
<p>These routines work if you want to remove the audio completely.&nbsp; However, if you have audio that has background noise (birds, cars, wind noise, etc.) and foreground noise (someone speaking to the camera, for example) that's not something that Movie Maker
 can separate.&nbsp; All the sound is on one track and Movie Maker can't distinguish background from foreground noise.</p>
<p>For that you'd need specialized software that might be able to adjust volume based on frequency trying to isolate the desired frequencies (say voice) from undesired frequencies (car honking, background hum, etc.)</p>

    <title>Own Minecraft Bedrock Edition on Xbox One, won&#39;t let me - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> katlynkocourek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Own Minecraft Bedrock Edition on Xbox One, won&#39;t let me install&#47;says I haven&#39;t purchased it on PC.</h2>
                    I own Minecraft Windows 10/Bedrock Edition on my Xbox One, and my friends own the same game on their Xbox and it allows them to install it and play it on their PC as well when they link their Xbox account. For some reason, it will not let me install the
 game on my PC. It's not listed in My Games on the app, and on the Microsoft Store, it says that I have to buy it even though I own the game. I've also tried going into the my downloads tab in the Microsoft Store and finding the game there, but when I click
 on it from there, it gives me the option to install the game but only to install it on the Xbox in my house. I'd greatly appreciate some help here because I've tried everything I can to play the title I paid for on my PC. Thanks.&nbsp;

            Hi Katlyn, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />Minecraft Bedrock Edition for Xbox One only gives you the ability to install on the Xbox One, unfortunately.
<br />
<br />The only edition of Minecraft that allows installation on Windows is Minecraft: Java Edition and Minecraft for Windows 10.
<br />
<br />You can see further information here:
<br />

<br />
<br />If your friends are able to install Minecraft on Windows, they must have one of the above mentioned editions.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you have any further questions! Thanks!

<h2>            permanent suspension</h2>
                    <p>ok, I am very frustrated as I just spent over an hour on the phone with Xbox trying to figure out how to contact enforcement about my son"s another account which was permanently suspended. we tried to go on the forums for enforcement with the email of the banned account and it would not even load at all so we could post a thread. I really would like to see the proof of the harassment&nbsp;or claims by whoever reported my son. I think that he was wrongly accused. they seem to have blackballed his account from even posting to a forum to question proof of the claims and reports that caused his account to be banned.</p><p>anyone can make false reports and I have seen it happen many times and even heard people talk about it on Xbox live, laughing how they got someone banned all because they didn't&nbsp;like getting beaten by someone&nbsp;repeatedly.&nbsp;and if it was due to vulgar language&nbsp;a lifetime ban is a little excessive when I repeatedly hear many people and even children as youn

                    <p>I just sent you a "reply" to my answers...but it came back as undeliverable.&nbsp; When I signed into the site...I didn't see my original problem posted.&nbsp; I have tried EVERYTHING to get this printer (or any printer to work.&nbsp; I have tried all of the basics.&nbsp; Uninstall,
 reinstall, delete all printers, install updated windows xp3, received all updated drivers from EPSON.&nbsp; And now tried doing what was suggested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The USB drives were working fine with my Microsoft Mouse, etc....until I uninstalled all 7 of my USB HOST controller drivers.&nbsp; See previous information in my other message.&nbsp; (I apologize....I have never used this sight.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have been working on this problem REALLY for over 40 house....at various times.&nbsp; I even bought a new printer thinking there was a problem with the replacement printer.&nbsp; The printer works fine.&nbsp; There is a WIN XP driver or some other system file that is
 corrupt.&nbsp; I have gone into the registry in the past...but cann't do this without detailed assistance, I know what happens if you screw this up.&nbsp; I can not afford the $150 to take this in to someone I do not trust to fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know there is someone out there that can help!&nbsp; I am familiar with troubleshooting and computers...but I am an old DOS based Gal.....</p>
<p>I appreciate all that anyone can do to help.&nbsp; Following is my response to what I just tried based on advice from this board.</p>

<p>a message regarding this yesterday.&nbsp; I got answers, but couldn't reply.</p>
<p>following is the things that I tryed.&nbsp; I have tried everything else.&nbsp; I am convinced there is a corrupt file, but it is beyond my ability to find and replace it.&nbsp; I really could use help...This printer had been working for over three years.&nbsp; The ports worked
 with other devices until I uninstalled all 7 of my USB HOST controller drivers.&nbsp; Now my logitec mouse (wireless) doesn't work either.</p>

<h2>            How do I scan multi-page documents to .pdf using Microsof Fax and Scan in Windows 7 64-bit</h2>
                    I need to scan multi-page documents to .pdf files in a user preferred directory.&nbsp; I have an HP Color Laserjet 2840 that used HP director under Windows XP to scan documents to .pdf files.&nbsp;I had to move the printer/scanner to a Windows 7 64-bit machine.&nbsp;
 Neither&nbsp;HP director or HP Solution Center&nbsp;is&nbsp;supported for this printer on Windows 7 and HP's website recommends using Windows Fax and Scan.&nbsp; Fax and Scan doesn't seem to support scan to .pdf or multi-page scans to any format except TIFF.&nbsp; It also only allows
 files to be redirected to network folders and doesn't have a browse button to select a location.&nbsp; Short of purchasing Adobe Acrobat and using a 2-step process of scanning to TIFF and then printing the TIFF file to .pdf does anyone have any suggestions?

            I found out through a thread on this question that Windows 7 does not come with the capability of scanning multi-page documents, although prior versions of Windows did.&nbsp; I read that one has to download the Microsoft Office Document Imaging (MODI) program
 from Microsoft in order to scan multi-page documents.&nbsp; What a pain!<br />

            To organize your scanned documents or photos, right-click the Scan folder in the left pane, and then click New Folder. To move a scanned document or photo to a folder, right-click the document, click Move to Folder, and then select the destination and

<p>This is not the first time I connected the phone via usb but this is the first time I tried tethering. Since I'm using this computer after a long time, I recently installed quite a number of updates.</p>
<p>Suggestions provided in the thread recommended couldn't help since I can't find IEEE authentication option anywhere and no wireless networks are listed in Network and sharing center (Neither usb nor bluetooth tethering is working for me).</p>

<h2>            I have been getting windows stop codes for months and I have tried everything. Someone please help.</h2>
                    I get them about twice a day, the most prevalent&nbsp;one is IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL, the other is BAD_POOL_HEADER. I have reinstalled windows 10 just two days ago. I have also gone through all drivers and updated the following drivers: Firmware, Realtek Audio,
 Intel(R) Smart Sound Technology (Intel(R) SST) Audio Controller,&nbsp;Intel(R) Smart Sound Technology (Intel(R) SST) OED, Mobile 6th/7th Generation Intel(R) Processor Family I/O PCI Express Root Port #5 - 9D14, Mobile 6th/7th Generation Intel(R) Processor Family

 - 9D23, Processor Family I/O LPC Controller (U with iHDCP2.2 Premium) - 9D43. I also keep up with all the new Windows 10 updates. I'm just wondering what else I can do at this point it has been going on for over 3 months.

<br />iaStorAVC.sys is Intel RST (Rapid Storage Technology) that software is available on the support page, it is 4th from bottom in the screenshots you provided yesterday, install the version from the Dell website, it may be more compatible with your system . . .

<h2>            CD&#47;DVD Not Ready - cannot read data</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Optiplex GX620 with two CD/DVD Drives. Both stopped working. When I run Windows Diagnostics, I get "Drive Not Ready". Both drives have stopped, but they both have power. When I try to read the media on the disc, I get the message "insert disk",
 even though it has a disc. If one of the drives wasn't working, I would replace the drive, but both stopped working at the same time. The drives are two different manufacturers and have worked fine for the past 3 years.</p>
<p>I also noticed that the "Autorun" setting had been changed to "Do Nothing". I believe I have corrected the setting changes, but I still get the drive "Not Ready"indication when I try to look at the contents through the Command Prompt. I think this is a Windows
 Update problem, but I do not see any recent posts regarding this.</p>
<p>Your responses are appreciated.</p>

            I have tried both of these fixes numerous times and nothing has changed. Microsoft Fixit only confirms that it cannot read the data on the CD. I have tried different cd's with different data and I get the same message. Device Manager shows the drives as
 working (both are doing the same thing). When I try to read the data with the Command prompt it responds "drive not ready".<br />

            <p>Has the PC been opened recently for any reason???&nbsp; If the following is too technical for you, just respond and I will give you far more detail.&nbsp; It is easy to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the case and check the SATA data cables.&nbsp; Remove and re-insert at both ends.&nbsp; Write down which SATA motherboard ports are physically connected to the drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If problem persists,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press F2 on start, check that the SATA ports are enabled, if not enable them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is unusual that they would both stop working at the same time.&nbsp; However, bear in mind that a very high percentage of the time this kind of failure is solved by replacement.&nbsp; $20 and easy to do.</p>

            Hi Patricia,
<br />
<br />My name is Nick and I am an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />Let's try one method.
<br />1. Uninstall the Optimum App for laptop
<br />2. Open Control panel
<br />3. Click on Programs and Features
<br />4. Find Microsoft Silverlight and Uninstall it
<br />5. Download and install the latest version of Microsoft Silverlight
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight/Get-Started/Install/Default" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight/Get-St...</a>
<br />6, Install the Optimum App
<br /><a href="http://preview.optimum.net/laptop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://preview.optimum.net/laptop/</a>
<br />
<br />If the above method doesn’t help, perform the system restore to the point where the app was working fine <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />I don’t recommend you perform the steps apart from Restoring from a system restore point.

<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />•- DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•-  sfc /scannow

<p>Hello Rhonda, <br />
<br />
<br />
We appreciate you being part of the community. To answer your query about Indexing, it helps the system identify the file location based on its details. Therefore, we may think that the file indexing is innocent in the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the files are removed from the system, we are wondering what makes you think that the files are still in the same folder? If the files are deleted, they're normally move to the Recycle bin. If you're using OneDrive and there is where you put the files,
 the system could have synced the files from the online storage. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the best ways to free up storage spaces is to use Disk cleanup:<br />
<br />
</p>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Open Disk Cleanup by clicking the <strong>Start</strong> button . In the search box, type
<strong>Disk Cleanup</strong>, and then, in the list of results, select <strong>Disk Cleanup</strong>.
</span></li><li><span>If prompted, select the drive that you want to clean up, and then select
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the <strong>Disk Cleanup</strong> dialog box in the Description section, select
<strong>Clean up system files</strong>. </span></li><li><span>If prompted, select the drive that you want to clean up, and then select
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the <strong>Disk Cleanup</strong> dialog box, on the <strong>Disk Cleanup</strong> tab, select the check boxes for the file types that you want to delete, and then select
<strong>OK</strong>. To remove data from a previous installation of Windows, select the
<strong>Previous Windows installation(s)</strong> check box. </span></li><li><span>In the message that appears, select <strong>Delete files</strong>. </span>
</li><li><span>Go back to <strong>Computer</strong> in File Explorer, select the drive you cleaned up, and then select
<strong>Refresh</strong>. If you need to free more space (the drive is still marked red), go to the next tip.
</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Feel free to chime back when you need further info. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kind regards. </p>
