<h2>            PC game pass login fail</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pc game pass app downloaded fine and is working, but i cant login. It opens up the login screen and i choose my acct, it says lets continue (as if its fine) but wont login.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>because i can not get past this step, i can also not sign up for game pass.</p>
<p>I have tried reinstalling the app multiple times.</p>
<p>i updated and am on the latest windows version 1903.</p>
<p>i signed up for pc game pass on the website, but that was pointless as i still can not login via the app. MS gave me a refund as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone got any tips for signing in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers, thx<br />

<p>Hi thx for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i just tried this and it hasnt worked for me. There is no option to uninstall Xbox IDP either, to try reinstalling again. i assume its a kind of plugin?</p>
<p>Xbox IDP does not have an individual app, at least none i can find on the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May have to wait for an update to the game pass app or to windows itself.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Later-installed the xbox companion app that logged in automatically. I had an Xbox one in the past that is connected to the acct. Opening the pc game pass beta app and it logged me in automatically. I cant subscribe to game pass again till the month is out,
 given i have already subscribed and got a refund.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>User directory named User after warranty service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> debdrex  say:</h3>
<h2>            User directory named User after warranty service</h2>
                    <p>My computer was malfunctioning so I sent it back to HP where a new motherboard was installed. When the computer was returned Windows 10 had been reset on the computer. Because it had acted badly before the service I didn't want to use my image backup because
 I was afraid some of the files may have been corrupted. So I use the install that the computer came back with and installed all my software and replaced all my files. I noticed when I got it that there was no sign-in, rather the system just started up. I've
 installed all that Microsoft updates and the HP updates. Everything has been working okay since I got it back but I noticed that my user directory bears the name User rather than the abbreviation of my name even though I have set up the computer with my Microsoft
 account. I haven't really found anything to indicate that this is a problem in terms of how the computer works but it does seem like that folder should have my name or be assigned to me. I've seen descriptions on how to change the name of that folder on other
 webpages but would like to know if that's something that I should be doing or should I just leave it alone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help you can give me.</p>

            Hi Deb,what happened is the technician created a new user account called User and then changed the user profile name before returning the system
<br />
<br />Windows 10 is very different from previous versions of Windows . . . 
<br />
<br />While you can change your User Profile name, you cannot change the name on the user folder, there are some hacks that will change the name of that folder, but it results in problems with Windows . . .
<br />
<br />Honestly I would just leave the folder named user, It does not really make any difference to the good running of your system
<br />
<br />Your only way to change the folder name is to create a new user account and delete the old one . . . 
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Go to Accounts - Family and other People 
<br />
<br />Click 'Add someone else to this PC' 
<br />
<br />Follow the prompts to create a new account 
<br />
<br />Close the settings app 
<br />
<br />Log out of that user account 
<br />
<br />Log into your new account 
<br />
<br />Click the Start Button, type netplwiz and hit Enter 
<br />
<br />In the resulting dialog, select the old account and click 'Remove' 
<br />
<br />That's It, your new Admin Account will replace the old account

            Hmmm, 
<br />
<br />So it says Deb there...
<br />
<br />But in C:\Users\(IT SAYS USER HERE?)
<br />
<br />And if you right click on This PC, and choose “manage” - expand Local users and groups, then click on users. Is it Deb there, or User?

            In order for album art to be inserted, the album details for the song should not be blank. Windows Media Player automatically downloads the album art if the details is recognized. In Windows Media Player 12, to make sure it is done automatically, go to

You can also copy art from the internet and paste it in the song. You can learn that from reading the guide.<br />

Your best bet is to download the excellent free app called MP3Tag. &nbsp;(We use it over in the zune forums all the time.) &nbsp;It will embed the album art into the track(s) as part of the metadata. &nbsp;It's primary purpose is to find and/or correct metadata- embedding
 the art is just one part of that. &nbsp;WMP can use that art without trouble. &nbsp;You can also use MP3Tag to extract the art from one song as a jpg which you can use elsewhere if you like.

            Yeah...that helped a whole lotta NOT.&nbsp; There was no hidden image with album art. As a matter of fact there were no hidden files anywhere in my music folders.&nbsp; Thanks for the effort, it was worth a shot.&nbsp; Does anyone else have any solutions?

<p>I was wondering if someone could help me identify the cause of the BSODs I've been experiencing at shutdown recently. The system will display the usual blue "shutting down" screen for some time and then BSOD before rebooting itself. I think the issue may

<strong>1.</strong> Check with Gigabyte support, their on-line documentation, and drivers. Update the<br />
BIOS, chipset drivers, and the other major on-board and separate device drivers (see</p>
<p>driver update methods below). Especially update the Nvidia driver and check with<br />
Nvidia Support and forums.<br />
<br />
BiosVersion = F8<br />
BiosReleaseDate = 10/11/2011<br />
SystemManufacturer = Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd.<br />
SystemProductName = Z68XP-UD3<br />
BaseBoardManufacturer = Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd.<br />
BaseBoardProduct = Z68XP-UD3<br />
<br />
nvlddmkm.sys 5/21/2016 Nvida driver so there may not be a newer driver. If everything<br />
fails you might try an older stable driver.<br />

</span></a><strong>2. </strong>Use ALL the methods in the troubleshooters below.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>If needed run DriverVerifier to see if it can indicate a CAUSE (see DriverVerifier<br />
methods below).<br />
<br />
</p>
=====================================================<br />
<br />
This "could" be a power supply problem though it is not the most common cause.
<p><span>9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs can also cause
<br />
these issues.<br />
<br />
Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows <br />
Updates to see if a driver was updated prior to this occurring. This could also be
<br />
caused by a loose card or cable and even a weak power supply.<br />
<br />
That error means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in <br />
Control Panel - Device Manager to be sure major drivers are not shut off <br />
during sleep - double click Display Adapter - NIC and WIFI - Sound and <br />
others - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow computer to turn off power. <br />
Maybe only one has an issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>(Use RUN&nbsp;instead of Start - Search as used on Vista or Windows 7)<br />
<br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in MSCONFIG.exe<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, <br />
Sound, or.....(and it still could be video interacting with something else). <br />

<br />
<strong>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :</strong><br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<strong>&nbsp; Run DriverView</strong> -<br />
<strong>set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers </strong>- update those without Dump in their
<br />
names.&nbsp;(<strong>also update the BIOS and low level chipset drivers</strong>)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your&nbsp;system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address&nbsp;of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and&nbsp;more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 170, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down<br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click Update Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and <br />
Keyboard if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other <br />
major device drivers you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) <br />
and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get <br />
their latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System <br />
Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT <span>After each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER <br />
– </span><span>Check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

After doing ALL the updates you can, and if the issue continues, then run <br />
DriverVerifier.&nbsp;(Remember to use the Windows 8/8.1 methods posted at the <br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
BTW I am really concerned that <strong>Flxhcih.sys</strong> Fresco Logic xHCI (USB3) Hub Driver<br />
is involved however it is just as likely that something is affecting it as it is that<br />
it is the cause (both scenarios are possible).</p>
<p><br />
That is part of the chipset drivers so be sure to check with Gigabyte.<br />
<br />
For information :<br />

    <title>Setup freezes at agpcpg.sys &#40;I disabled it from booting&#41; and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> soccer4dummys  say:</h3>
<h2>            Setup freezes at agpcpg.sys &#40;I disabled it from booting&#41; and now will freeze at 1394bus.sys</h2>
                    
<p>emachine t6524</p>
<p>Windows Media Center Edition 2006</p>
<p>I just recovered from a nasty virus, which I got rid of with Kaspersky's live recovery CD (so it's clean, now)</p>
<p>Anyway, after the update, I did a reboot and now I'm in a constant reboot. Load XP, fail, reboot. Load XP, fail, reboot. I don't even get to the login screen</p>
<p>I noticed that when loading safemode, it would always freeze at agpcpg.sys. I found an article about something similar that happened with agp440.sys, so I followed the instructions for that just to see if it would work.</p>
<p>They had me boot from my XP CD (had to use the xp home CD because I misplaced my WMC one... ouch) type R for recovery, and type listsvc. See if the sys file is set to boot (which it is). press esc, and type "disable xxxxx.sys". I did that and YES! It got
 past agpcpg.sys!... and is now stuck at amdagp.sys. Lovely. Well, it worked before, so I did it again. I've had to do this with several different files, and kept a record of what I've done:</p>
<p>Disabled:</p>
<ul>
<li>agpcpg.sys </li><li>amdagp.sys </li><li>alim1541.sys </li><li>agp440.sys </li><li>mup.sys </li></ul>
<p>Now the issue: It hangs up at 1394BUS.sys but this one ISN'T included in listsvc. I tried to disable it anyway, but it came up with an error. Anyone have any ideas on how to fix this issue? I'm proud of myself for getting thus far, but I'm clueless on how
 to proceed. I'd really rather not do a system restore.</p>
<p>Let me know if you guys have any questions on info I might have left out. :-)</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Start Menu&#47;Cortana&#47;Settings Fix</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am trying recover my Start menu/Cortana/Settings functionality by using the following command to restore Microsoft default apps from the Command Prompt (Admin):</p>
<p>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</p>
<p>
</p><p>I executed this command close to an hour ago - my system32&gt; prompt has not yet returned, nor have I seen any of the reported red messages reported by other users in the Community. The powershell window message has not changed for at least 30 minutes, probably
 longer. &nbsp;It appears to be stuck on this step:</p>
<p>"Deployment operation progress: C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy\AppXManifest.xml</p>

<p>
</p><p>In Task Manager I see that the Windows PowerShell is running and using 1% CPU consistently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this command hung? Do I need to wait longer? Is there a way to safely interrupt or stop it without hurting my system? I do not know what to do next to proceed with fixing my Windows 10 Start Menu/Cortana/Settings issues. &nbsp;I was trying to follow the procedure

            <p>Hi Laurel, </p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate your concern, are you logged in to your computer as an administrator? If reinstalling
<strong>Windows</strong> apps doesn't work, we suggest that you create a new user account. If you’re currently using a
<strong>Microsoft</strong> account, your settings will also transfer to the new account, once you upgrade it from the default local account. You’ll need to transfer your local files from one account to the other in all cases. Your installed software won’t be
 affected. Here's how:</p>
<p>

<h2>            &#38;quot&#59;That password didn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t work&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>I have been encountering some extremely annoying problems with logging into Xbox live. The first problem that I encountered was that my password was not being recognised, I typed it in and instantly received a "your email address and password weren't recognised"
 error, so naturally I changed my password, logged in again, same error. I cleared my cache a dozen times, restarted my Xbox, and it seemed to finally work so I put in Assassins Creed and updated it, I got onto the main menu and suddenly I'm prompted to log
 in AGAIN and this time my new password didn't work either, I finally decided that it must be a problem with a corrupted profile so I deleted my profile so I could redownload a new copy and lo and behold my password was not recognised. I know my email and password
 are both functional as I can log into my account on the main website, so I'm now stuck with my profile deleted and the inability to redownload it due to the Xbox deciding my password won't work. Care to explain?</p>

<p>Click on Security info, do you have two step verification enabled ? if so you would need to either generate an app password to use in place of your regular password or turn two step off.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You can generate the app password on the same link as above.</p>

<h2>            Runtime Broker build 10586.29 sleep mode</h2>
                    Whenever my pc goes into screen saver or sleep mode it takes 5 minutes for desktop screen to be useable. I also find that in task manager that runtime broker is using about 67% of cpu and that cpu is at 95% usage. Being able to work in desktop requires
 killing runtime broker in task manager.

                    <p>I have a Surface Laptop. After purchasing it I selected the option to switch to the full Windows 10 Pro vs the preinstalled Windows 10 S. I have selected the recovery option "Reset This PC" once or twice before but when I did it today, it failed with the

<p>Hello Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A corrupted <em>Windows Recovery Environment</em> can cause the error message you're getting when resetting your Surface Laptop. That being said, can you tell me where you purchased the device? This type of Surface setup is often offered in universities.
 This information is essential to determine if the activation is managed by IT administrator of the school.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.</p>

<p>Hi Devlin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was purchased at the Microsoft Store in Bellevue. I had to install a new copy of Windows to get the machine working again. Just in case others run into this problem, what is the correct resolution? If the Windows Recovery Environment is corrupt, is there
 a way to recover your Windows license? Or do you have to purchase another copy of Windows?</p>
<p>

<p>I have exactly the same problem as Michael the OP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased a Surface laptop for personal use (not educational nor enterprise) and upgraded to full Windows Pro.&nbsp;My Windows&nbsp; is an authorised copy with a digital licence to my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having some performance issues so decided to Reset this PC last night, having consulted this article: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10/how-to-perform-a-clean-install-using-reset-this-pc/6f6335fc-8d15-4598-af16-033d1d8c16bf
 .</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first stage "Resetting this PC" takes about 2 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second stage "Installing Windows" starts and then fails with the message&nbsp;<span>"Windows could not parse or process the unattend answer file for pass [specialize]. The settings specified in the answer file cannot be applied.
 The error was detected while processing settings for component [Microsoft-Windows-Shell-Setup]."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Pressing OK leads to&nbsp;</span><span>the machine rebooting and after a few more minutes I get a Logon Screen for Other User. Trying to login with my credentials doesn't work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>I
 now cannot access my laptop.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have pressed and held down <strong>shift
</strong>and <strong>restart </strong>and that brought up a screen with a variety of options</span></p>
<p>"Continue - exit and continue to Recovery environment" gives options to use external media, which I don't have or internal storage, which takes me back to the&nbsp;<span>Logon Screen
 for Other User.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"Troubleshoot" takes me back into the Rest mode and some hours later gets me back to the error message and&nbsp;</span><span>Logon Screen for Other User</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"Use a device" offers Internal Storage (see above), USB storage (which I don't have) or PXE Network (which&nbsp;</span><span>gets me back to the error message and&nbsp;</span><span>Logon
 Screen for Other User)</span>"Turn off your PC" - gets me no further towards a functioning PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Use another operating system" gets me 4 options - Windows Recovery environment (which takes me back to the Other user logon screen) and 3 icons each of which says "Windows 10 on volume 3"&nbsp;(which also take me back to the Other user logon screen)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I need to do to get my laptop working again please.</p>

<p>Thank you for the quick response. You can simply reinstall Windows 10 using an installation media created from the
<em>Media Creation Tool</em>. Your product key or digital license is tied to your Surface device. Even if you perform a reset or restore the device to its factory settings, you will still be able to activate it using the same license. For more information about
 activation in Windows 10, you can refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12440/windows-10-activation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Activation in Windows 10">support article</a></strong>.<br />

<p>Unfortunately I didn't create installation media and, as indicated above, my attempt to "reset or restore" failed. When I re-installed Windows, I was prompted for a product key and I entered the one provided with the new copy of Windows. Reading the link
 you provided, it sounds like I should have continued without entering the new product key? Is the digital license that came with my Surface now "lost"?</p>

<p>Yup same problem with me. You would have thought a software company producing its own hardware would have this basic function working. Sad that the Microsoft engineers don't even know how to configure their own unattended files.&nbsp;</p>

<span><span><span>Hi alviriava,</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>What was the exact error message that you received?</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>Does this only happen with<span>&nbsp;
</span>Zune market<span>&nbsp; </span>place or<span>&nbsp; </span>with other websites as well?</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>I would suggest you to perform a Clean Boot to find which non Microsoft program is causing the issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span>Steps to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers
 and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.
</span></li><li>
<span>Click <strong>
Start</strong> <span>Collapse this imageExpand this im</span>, type <strong>
msconfig.exe</strong> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.</span>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Collapse this imageExpand</span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password,
 or click <strong>Continue</strong>. </span></li></ul>
</li><li>
<span>On the <strong>
General</strong> tab, click <strong>Selective Startup</strong>, and then click to clear the
<strong>Load startup items</strong> check box. (The <strong>Use Original Boot.ini</strong> check box is unavailable.)
</span></li><li>
<span>On the <strong>
Services </strong>tab, click to select the <strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong> check box, and then click
<strong>Disable all</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points.
 Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.
</span></li><li>
<span>Click <strong>
OK</strong>, and then click <strong>Restart</strong>.</span> </li></ol>

<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Steps for Normal startup:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Click <strong>
Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Run</strong>. </span></li><li>
<span>Type <strong>
msconfig</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
The <strong>System Configuration Utility</strong> dialog box is displayed. </span>
</li><li>
<span>Click the <strong>
General</strong> tab, click <strong>Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>. </span></li><li>

    <title>Undo effects of Clean command - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rudolfo martinez jr.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Undo effects of Clean command</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without going into motivation (or too painful details!), here's the gist of my problem:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">1.&nbsp; I used the Clean command on an external USB 3.0 Toshiba hard drive connected to my laptop.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">2.&nbsp; This resulted in the drive no longer being listed as one of the drives on my computer in File Explorer.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">3.&nbsp; It is listed in the Disk Management screen as Disk 2, basic, xxx.xx GB, online, and the partition&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "graph" shows xxx.xx GB Unallocated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; Right clicking on disk 2 gives me the choices of New simple,spanned, striped, mirrored, and RAID-5&nbsp; volumes, Properties, and Help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; I'm not given a choice of selecting a drive letter for the disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp; The drive is listed in Device Manager as working properly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; The driver(s) is/are current and correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; There are no yellow triangles with a exclamation point anywhere in the Device
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manager list to indicate any type of problems.</p>
<p>The final result is that I "lost" years of effort and xxx.xx GB of valuable data.&nbsp; I tried using Recuva in an attempt to recover all those lost files to no effect.&nbsp; Recuva does not even acknowledge the disk as being present in the list of drives that it
 detects as existing on my system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there it is!&nbsp; I am open to any help the community may be able to provide me in successfully recovering my lost data/documents.&nbsp; I am reluctant to format the disk in the fear that recovery software might not be able to recover any data.&nbsp; So, do I
 reformat the disk, attempt to establish a partition on it, and whatever else...?&nbsp; What can I do to recover from this disaster?&nbsp; Yes, I know...&nbsp; Backup, backup, backup, and I was going to get a NAS!&nbsp; Murphy's Law strikes when you least expect it, and it always
 does at the worst possible time!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, forgive my long winded rote, but I wanted to you to have a detailed account of my problem so you could better help me!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks in advance to all of you who may be able to exticate my a** from this mess I got myself into!</p>

            Hi Rudolfo, Recuva is OK for recovering a couple of files, but not much more . . .
<br />
<br />You are going to have to use a good 3rd party software to recover the partition and its data on that drive . . .
<br />
<br />EaseUS does a really good job at recovering after using the Clean command in Diskpart . . .
<br />
<br />They do have a free version of their software and that is the only version I am allowed to recommend here, so have a look at that software and see if it can help you recover your data . . .

<h2>            Microsoft Print to PDF in Onedrive</h2>
                    Today I am trying to use Microsoft print to pdf. It has worked in the past, but it doesn't now&nbsp;save the file&nbsp;to the Onedrive. It will save to other locations that are not linked to Onedrive. There seems to be a conflict? CutePDF works.&nbsp;Is there a resolution?

    <title>how to disable OCSP stapling in IIS7.5 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            how to disable OCSP stapling in IIS7.5</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
I'm looking for info on configuring OCSP stapling of revocation info for my SSL enabled site. my web&nbsp;site is hosted in IIS v7.5 in windows server 2008 R2 standard.&nbsp;I found some evidence that implies stapling is on by default in IIS 7.x if the cert contains
 OCSP info, but I can't seem to confirm it anywhere. So I have a couple of questions I'm trying to find answers for:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1) Is OCSP stapling really enabled by default in IIS 7.x for certificates and clients that support it?<br />
2) How can I toggle it to disabled/enabled as needed?</p>

<p>Can you roll back the graphics driver. Another alternative would be to select Update driver and then Browse my computer for drivers then Let me pick from a list of available drivers. See if there are other drivers still on your device and manually try previous
 ones.</p>

            Hi HarisGamer890
<br />
<br />It is possible you may not be able to get a current Windows 10 device driver for that Intel HD Graphics, the Intel website, do not seem to supply thta
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download Intel Driver &amp; Support Assistant (Intel DSA)
<br />
<br />Then run that utility to see if it can find an appropriate graphics driver

            Hi HarisGamer890
<br />
<br />Have you tried loading the Microsoft basic Display Driver, instead of an Intel drive, that should give you the correct resolution
<br />
<br />Right click that device, choose update driver - Browse my Computer for Driver Software - Let me pick from a list of available drivers
<br />
<br />If that driver does not appear there, untick 'Show Compatible Hardware'
<br />
<br />Then on the left, click 'Standard Display Types', that device will be on the right . . .

            Hi HarisGamer890
<br />
<br />If that is the highest resolution form that driver, you will need to go to the support page for your laptop on the manufacturers website and see if they supply a Windows 10 driver, if not, you may have to revert your system to an earlier version of Windows, since as far as i can see there is not current Windows 10 driver .  .

<h2>            Errors 0x8007002 and 0x80246007</h2>
                    <p>Hello. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update is not working - and although I've read various articles online, they are so complex and tech 'savvy' that I can't follow them. If help is available, it will need to be simple to follow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying to correct Windows Update for over two weeks now - including using the virtual agent, to no avail. If I were to reset Windows 10 (i.e., download a 'new' Windows 10), will doing so correct my faulty Windows Update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Larry</p>

            Hi Larry
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed. 
<br />
<br />Try this additional tips to see if they work:

<br />
<br />I would also try upgrading manually to Windows 10 1903:
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Upgrade this PC now if you want to upgrade right away,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don’t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Anniversary Update on a system with limited space:
<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />If you want to perform a new install or just keep your files click Change what to keep. Once you have chosen the desired options, click Install to begin.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />That’s it, the Windows 10 Feature Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />How to prepare your computer before upgrading?
<br />
<br />Although updating to Windows 10 version 1903 is a relatively simple process, similar to a repair upgrade; users should perform some basic pre-requisites before initiating the upgrade.
<br />
<br />If you are finding it difficult to carry out some of the steps described below, please review detailed instructions how to perform them:

    <title>Going back to Windows 7 after Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Going back to Windows 7 after Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Last Resort</p>
<p>I had problems with upgrading to Windows 10 on my Dell Laptop that is about 3 years old.&nbsp; Here are some specifics.</p>
<p>Upgrading from Windows 7.</p>
<p>I was able once to get to the Windows 10 desktop after several efforts.</p>
<p>Once there, based on advice found on the Internet disabled fast startup.&nbsp; I had Avast already and downloaded the latest version.&nbsp; After that downloaded it wanted to do a restart which I allowed.&nbsp; I've never been able to get back to the desktop.</p>
<p>I have tried everything I can find on the Internet to help this to no avail.&nbsp; I usually get the unmountable volume error or partition error.&nbsp; If I use the downloaded 64 bit or 32 bit clean install I created on a USB I can get to the blue page of options
 and the install or repair dark blue page, but nothing there has allowed me to get anywhere.&nbsp; I can get to the command prompt.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I'd be happy to answer any other questions, but after days of not having use of this computer and hours spent trying to 'fix' it, I'm tired.&nbsp; My plan/hope is just to get to a point where I can get back onto Windows 7.&nbsp; Of course I would like to save my files
 and settings, but it is not critical.</p>
<p>Since nothing I've tried has worked, can I just put an old Windows 7 disk in the drive and install over the top of 10?&nbsp; I have my key code that came with the computer, but I don't know if it will allow me to use it again or if this will even work.&nbsp; Or should
 I take my computer in and pay to have an expert work on it, or just shoot the dam thing and learn how to use a new mac?
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            Thank you!&nbsp; Before I do this I have another question.&nbsp; Since I didn't make a backup *waiting for your head to quit shaking* I assume I will lose everything which isn't a huge deal.&nbsp; But will I be able to use my original Windows 7 key code from the bottom
 of my computer for this when I'm asked for it, which I assume I will be?<br />

<p>
</p><p>Yes, you will be able to use the same code found usually at the bottom the computer, to activate Windows, if you choose to do a clean install of Windows 7.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>THIS IS THE ANSWER</p>
<p>Here is what I did that finally got my computer working again.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m no computer expert so it took quite a while and I may have done things I didn’t need to do, but in the end I have Windows 7 back on my Dell Inspirion N5050.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It stated this way.<span>&nbsp; </span>I put in for a free update to Windows 10.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That was a mistake.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dell says my computer will not support Windows 10 even though it is only like 3 years old.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I don’t know if that information would have been available when Windows 10 came out, I didn’t look.<span>&nbsp;
</span>My second mistake was just assuming it would be fine, after all I already “upgraded” to Windows 10 on my Desktop computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a lot of problems getting the download and installing it, but eventually succeeded in getting all the way to the new Win10 desktop.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Once there I thought the first thing I should do is upgrade my free AVAST software.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I did so and at the end of that update it asked to restart the machine and I said yes.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That was the last time I saw the Win10 desktop.<span>&nbsp; </span>After that it was endless loops of attempted repairs and the black screen of death with a cursor.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I would occasionally get to a blue screen of death but wasn’t able to get past it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just kept trying suggestions I found by searching the problems I had. This is basically how it came down:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1- I found a way to get my F8 working again.<span>&nbsp; </span>This allowed me to get into Safe Mode and onto the command prompt which is what I needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2- After trying many cures I found which didn’t work for me, I gave up on saving my files and looked to just get my computer back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3- I found a page that went step by step on Formatting the hard drive, creating a new partition and activating it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4- I then used a Win7 disk I had, but could have also downloaded one and reinstalled the OS.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I was very happy that when I put in my key code it was accepted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5- I went on Dell’s site on my other computer entered my Service tag and was given access to all the necessary drivers, well most of them.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I downloaded all of them except the one for Bios because that one tried to open and run upon download and I was on my other computer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I loaded them on a flash drive which I put in my laptop.<span>&nbsp; </span>I found a place that told me how to upload the drivers and I did.<span>&nbsp;
</span>My computer would not see the Wi-fi I had running off a router so I could use both my machines on the Internet at the same time.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I had to search and find the answer and loaded that driver on in the same way as the others.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Now I was cooking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6- I ran a windows update and got like 206 important and 8 optional.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I broke them into smaller groups so I could keep track of the progress and loaded them.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I didn’t look really at what the updates were I just grabbed them all.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This was another mistake.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was sad, but not overly surprised when my brand new installed OS was suddenly trying to “upgrade” me again to Win10 and the Win10 box of 4 boxes icon was back on my toolbar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7- IMPORTANT – If you get to the point you are updating windows watch out for one that ends with 5583.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It says it is just an update to work out some bugs, but if you research it or click on it to get more info, it’s only purpose is to put you back in the que to get Win10 and it starts loading stuff on your machine again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>AVOID THIS UPDATE.<span>&nbsp; </span>When you see it right click it and ‘hide’ it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Be aware it will still possibly come back as an update again in the future “hide” it again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>And this is a real topper, if you ask Windows update to look at your hidden updates, just looking reactivates it and it will start grabbing Win10 again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>ALSO DON’T BE ONLINE WHEN YOU ARE WORKING WITH THIS AS STUFF WILL BE DOWNLOADING WHILE YOU ARE TRYING TO STOP IT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8-<span>&nbsp; </span>So I found a page on the Web about this and it listed like 8 things you had to do to get rid of this gem.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It included removing items and creating items in the registry just to stop it from working.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Amazing, but I was able to uninstall the update and enter things to stop it from coming back.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you use this page, it kind of looks like all the things listed to do were options or do this and if that doesn’t work then do this.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Not the case.<span>&nbsp; </span>DO THEM ALL one after the other.<span>&nbsp; </span>
There were a couple that lead me to a location in the registry where I should have found items that weren’t there, that is fine it just means something else I did got rid of them.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9- The Microsoft implanted virus is GWX (Get Windows X).<span>&nbsp; </span>I did a search for GWX.exe from the start button and came up with 10 or so of them still on my computer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>None of them would allow me to delete them and none of them showed up as programs that I could uninstall.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I was constantly told I didn’t have permission to delete the files.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I don’t recall how exactly now, but I found a way to look at these and see that “trusted installer” had full authority and I didn’t.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But there was a tab called owner or ownership.<span>&nbsp; </span>I clicked there and was able to claim ownership of it (one by one) as administrator and then close out and go back in and edit it giving the administrator full control and giving “trusted installer”
 no control. <span>&nbsp;</span>Then I was able to go to that particular gwx.exe and delete it. Again, one by one.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But it worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10- then I did just a search for gwx and found a bunch of them as well.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I deleted some of them and left some.<span>&nbsp; </span>I saw gwx in the registry but most were empty folders.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Will not clearing them cause me problems down the road?<span>&nbsp; </span>I don’t think so because of what I put into the registry stopping gwx.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It should be a crime what I had to go through to stop this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11- Now to reload my Windows Office Pro plus 2010.<span>&nbsp; </span>I had the disk and the code key.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I had some glitches loading it and installing it, kind of like I did with the OS, but eventually made it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I entered my key code and was told it was fake.<span>&nbsp; </span>I checked and I had typed it in right.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So I uninstalled the program and reinstalled it and got the same problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>An option is to call in to register.<span>&nbsp; </span>I took this and talked to a machine giving them like 40 numbers from my software for them to give me a key code to install it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Made it all the way to the end and the machine said the software was not legal and hung up on me.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That was bull, I’m looking right at the Microsoft green genuine sticker… anyway.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Fail so back to researching what to do on the Internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12- The only thing I could find was fake keys to try.<span>&nbsp; </span>Tried some, didn’t work.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then I found a page that said to download a tool that would fix the problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>At this stage why not right?<span>&nbsp; </span>I downloaded it and did an AVAST check.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It said it was clean.<span>&nbsp; </span>I tried to open it and couldn’t.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It was an .rar file.<span>&nbsp; </span>So back to the Internet.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I found a free simple .rar opener called 7 something and downloaded it.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I opened it and then was able to open the tool.<span>&nbsp; </span>I clicked on button on the tool and it ran through a bunch of things ending about a minute later with Windows Office is now been ‘fixed’ to show it is genuine and the trial version is now permanent.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Cool<span>&nbsp; </span>I opened up Windows Word and hit file and help and there it was – says genuine and it worked.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I’m sure this could be and is probably used to steal Windows Office, but I don’t care.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I paid for Office and I wouldn’t have had to do this if it weren’t for Microsoft’s BS Win10 problems and wrongly thinking my software wasn’t legit, so I feel no guilt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13- It took me many many many updates and restarts and more updates to get Office 10 up to speed, but I finally was able to click on get updates and got that sweet message that all was up to date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>14- I then downloaded Ccleaner and MalwareBytes.<span>&nbsp; </span>I ran MalwareBytes and it found 14 issues that weren’t actual cases of Malware, just Microsoft spy stuff.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I deleted them.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then I ran Ccleaner and cleaned out a TON of junk.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then I ran the registry check under tools and it found a ton of issues.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I fixed them all (or it did by deleting them) and ran it again.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Seems like I had to run it about 4 times.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then I ran the cleaner again and deleted some more junk.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I ran Malware again and it found nothing and I ran AVAST and it found nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>15-<span>&nbsp; </span>So it seems I got it back and my software just lost my files.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It took hours and hours to do all this and I don’t know how much Whisky!<span>&nbsp;
</span>I wish I could send a bill to Microsoft for my time and expenses.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I have a PC on my desk and this laptop and when they fail, I going MAC.</p>
