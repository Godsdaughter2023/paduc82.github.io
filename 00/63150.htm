                    <p>How can I go back to the old display? The new one is impossible to use - unless I open it up and it fills my screen. It used to be a box on the right of my screen. Now - I can't see the names of my contacts and there is a huge box on the right for the messages
 with over-large blue boxes for the text - just awful!</p>

<h2>            microsoft train simulator from 2001. I have the Ubisoft exclusive CD-ROM.</h2>
                    So I know it is an old game, but my son loves train games and saw one of the train lines on it that he really wants to run. It says it is an incompatible program. Is there ANYTHING I can do to get it to run?

            <p>Hello Therese,</p>
<p>It sounds like there may be a mismatch of OS architecture. Are you running a 32 or 64 Bit version of Windows 7?&nbsp; Hint:&nbsp; go to Control Panel, select System, look at the "System type" line in the first info box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does the CD say what operating system its designed for? Can you access individual files on the CD through Windows Explorer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can answer these questions, I'll try to provide additional assistance to you.</p>

<p><br />
I am using the Windows 7 Home Premium 64 Bit version with service pack 1, 2009, on a Dell Desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CD says that it is compatible with the following OS: 95-98-Me-2000-XP</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The installation came on 2 discs. Disc one does not seem to have a way to open it to access files, but disc 2 does. I chose the 'recommended' install option. I rebooted once done as instructed, but it tells me that I am missing the 'correct CD-ROM. Close
 program, insert disc and reopen.'&nbsp; If I try to re-load the game, it tells me I need to reboot, as all updates have been installed, so I am guessing I need to un-install the game and try again, but maybe with the custom install.&nbsp; I used the Windows 7 compatibility
 troubleshooter without success, and in the final analysis, it said it was not a compatible product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way around this? My son has autism, and is quite upset this won't work. Once loaded properly, he will be able to get the program to do amazing things (how exactly he knows how to run all these train simulators is beyond me) so any help you can
 provide is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope I gave you all the necessary tech information you need and look forward to your reply</p>

            <p>So I uninstalled the program, figuring that would be the next step necessary, but after rebooting the computer, when I try to install the program, it still acts like the program is there, and that I need to reboot the computer. I found another reply on a
 similar question about compatibility mode etc. but can not seem to get past this error message that the files are updated and I need to reboot.&nbsp; I had this same problem with an old Thomas game, and gave up on that as well.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is happening here?&nbsp; Is there a more permanent uninstall step I am missing?&nbsp; The computer seems to know that files were recently present, so it won't let me try again.&nbsp; I am logged in under my son's account, and then give my admin password when asked.
 Should I be logged in under my name to have a more admin presence?&nbsp; Clutching at straws here...</p>

            <p>Hello Therese,</p>
<p>I'm sorry to say that the game will not work on your 64 Bit computer. The game is really a 16 bit application, which can't run on a 64 Bit operating system. As to uninstalling the application, there are probably some registry entries left over. I use and
 recommend IOBit Uninstaller to get rid of applications. Download it from here:&nbsp; <a href="http://download.cnet.com/IObit-Uninstaller/3000-2096_4-75161625.html?tag=mncol;1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.cnet.com/IObit-Uninstaller/3000-2096_4-75161625.html?tag=mncol;1</a>&nbsp; (use Direct Download Link only).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But all is not lost. Here is a freeware train simulator that has gotten top reviews, read more about it and download from here:&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.techsupportalert.com/content/want-drive-train-top-class-sim-free.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.techsupportalert.com/content/want-drive-train-top-class-sim-free.htm</a>&nbsp;. Hopefully your son will find this as amusing as the Microsoft game!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if this helps you out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If the game installed at all it uses a 32bit installer. If it had a 16bit installer it would not even begin<br />
to install. <br />
[ EDIT - Your version of the game is a re-release by Ubisoft form around '05.<br />
This brings us to another issue that comes with games from '04-'05 and 64bit Window - DRM.<br />
The easiest fix for this is usually a noCD patch, unfortunately there seems to only be a patch for<br />
the German version of the game].<br />
<br />
I have read that installing using compatibility mode for XP sp2 will work with 64bit Win7.<br />
- To install in compatibility mode&nbsp; close the install/setup screen after the CD autorun.<br />
Then&nbsp; go to - Start/Computer&nbsp; and R/click on the DVD/CD drive.<br />
Now, click Open - and R/click on the <em>setup.exe&nbsp; </em>(or whatever the installer is called. It will be an .exe ) - then properties ,&nbsp; and set compatibility to&nbsp; XP sp2&nbsp; in this case .
<br />
Tick run... as administrator as well, just for luck.<br />
Now start the install directly from the setup.exe .<br />
<br />
<br />
[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EDIT: Also found this site, which may make my suggestions below redundant -<br />
<a href="http://msts.steam4me.net/tutorials/installing_msts_w7.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msts.steam4me.net/tutorials/installing_msts_w7.html</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; ]<br />
<em><br />
"I am logged in under my son's account"</em><br />
Using the 'run...administrator' option should help with this, but logging in as administrator<br />
is a surer bet. You may also want to disable UAC and your AV temporarily.<br />
- Another option is not installing in the default location - Program Files (x86) as this is a system
<br />
protected folder. If there are no&nbsp; other Partitions or HDD to install to just make a new folder in<br />
C:\ . Name it what you like and install games to their own sub-folders in that.<br />
<br />
<em>"it still acts like the program is there"</em><br />
- Probably because there are still some files. If I/Obit does not help -<br />
Before trying to reinstall the game delete any folders that may have been left after uninstalling.<br />
There may not be any, but if the games install folder is still there delete it and also check in your<br />
User\ My Documents or AppData folder for anything relating to the game. It may be in an Ubisoft folder, an MS folder, or a folder with the games name.<br />
- If you still have issues then it may be due to a registry entry. If you have a system restore point
<br />
to before you uninstalled the game rolling back to that and then uninstalling again from and admin account should delete registry entries.<br />
<br />
- What are the system specifications on your desktop ? Does it use integrated graphics or a dedicated<br />
graphics card ? Games react differently to integrated graphics, some don't recognise them as viable<br />
graphics adapters or have an issue when there is no dedicated VRAM. <br />
Some (as I just found with Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic) will only run in a window if using<br />
integrated graphics (In this case Intel HD4000).</p>
<p>I was also surprised to find that MTS can use up to 1GB system RAM.</p>
<p>[EDIT: 9/14 - Since starting this post I've found that Tony Hawk 2 will run on Intel HD4000 (full screen),
</p>
<p>but not on Nvidia GTX770. I expect the same would apply to some other older games as well. ]</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
<br />
With new Win7 machines it is always a good idea to run the Direct X Web Installer as well -<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=2DA43D38-DB71-4C1B-BC6A-9B6652CD92A3&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download details: DirectX End-User Runtime</a><br />
Check with DELL for updates for your motherboard drivers and too.<br />
Graphics drivers for desktop are generally sourced from the cards mfg web site, but sometimes you<br />
may need to get them from DELL ( more commonly with laptops though).<br />
<br />
Apparently there can also be issues with colour and keyboard assignments, but I don't know if they<br />
are inherent in the game (check for patches too) or something to do with the posters system.<br />
<br />
Further to the above do a good search for forums specific to MTS and you should find a way to<br />
get the game running properly.<br />

<h2>            Webex Remote Access</h2>
                    I have been using Webex Remote Access for a year with no problems (laptop running Vista Ultimate 64 bit).&nbsp;&nbsp; Now after I login to their website and try to remote access a client's quickbooks, I get the message:&nbsp; "Sorry we detected a 64 bit operating system
 which we do not support.&nbsp; Sorry for the inconvenience."<br />
<br />
<br />
Did I change something by accident?&nbsp; Right before this happended, I was dragging some files to a dvd.

<p><span>Hi
<span><span>mstablow</span></span>,</span></p>
<p><span>As I find Webex is not working on any 64 bit computers at present. They are working on it to fix the problem. For the time being,
 you may use any alternative free version of remote access software.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Hope the information helps. Please post back and let us know.</span></p>

<p>Maybe what you can try (before you try&nbsp;points 1..11) only<strong> turn Off your antivirus</strong> and

<strong>turn Off UAC </strong>see <strong>point 5).</strong></p>

<h3> f i x i three  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fifa 11 UT problem</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;So I've just went on to Fifa 11 Ultimate Team to find that everything that was on my trade pile has miraculously disappeared into thin air
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-12.gif" />. The reason I'm angry is that I had approx 150,000 - 200,000 coins worth of stuff for sale! Has anyone else had this problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

            <div>Hi,<br />
<br />
Could well be a hardware problem, probably hard drive, that just happened<br />
to occur during the intense drive use that can happen during an update. So<br />
it probably would have happened next time there was heavy hard drive access<br />
if there were no updates.<br />

<h2>            Problems with Scarlett 2i2 on Skype Room System &#40;v2&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having problems with a Scarlett 2i2 interface connecting two ceilling-mounted microphones to our Logitech SmartDock with Skype Room System v2 running on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing the drivers provided by Focusrite, and plugging the interface directly into the SmartDock (instead of through Logitechs Extender Box), we still don't get any sound in the Skype Room System application.</p>
<p>After some testing we found out that the microphones worked nicely in the normal Skype for Business (2016) application, but would not work in the SRS-app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it be that the app blocks non-certified devices from being used?</p>
<p>If so, does anyone know of a certified interface?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance! :)</p>

            Hi Dentsor,<br />
<br />
As far as I know, Skype Room System belongs to Skype for Business sever criteria. You may refer to
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt790550.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt790550.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</a> to check the whole deployment as your microphones worked fine in Skype for Business (2016).
<br />
<br />
If you have more concern, I suggest you post in <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=sfbfr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype for Business server forum</a> for dedicated help. This forum mainly focuses on Office 365 for Business online services. Thanks for your understanding.
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alan<br />

<br />
Is there at least a way to change those awful colors that look like something my son pieced together in kindergarten?
</blockquote>
There is a Desktop app that allows you to switch back to the Default Look of windows almost identical to Window 7 It looks exactly the same as Windows 7 and provides an escape from the Tiles. You can launch your programs and navigate your files the same way
 you always did with windows 7 but to access other functions such as the Control Panel you will have to make a brief trip back to the Windows 8 Start Menu and type "Control Panel" to access it. Other then that the built in Desktop app would make windows 8 user-friendly
 to you if you are switching over from 7 so you don't have to look at those visually unpleasant Tiles which I personally find repulsive and yes there is a way to change the color schemes on the tiles so you don't have to deal with the Kindergarten colors. But
 I didn't do this because the Desktop app provided a quick and welcome escape from the un-attractive new look.
<div><br />
<div>Short Answer: yes to get rid of the tiles and switch back to the well known windows simply click the desktop app which comes per-installed with all windows 8.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If it wasn't for this feature I wouldn't have upgraded myself. But you will have no problem and feel right as rain after switching over.</div>
<div>Hope this helps and thanks for your time,</div>

<p>Hey there Brett, </p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to get on the Xbox One in Australia, As far as the Power Sources it is possible you might need to search for a different Power Cord that will be compatible with the Outlets.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just go ahead and go through the support article on <a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/microsoft-account/update-microsoft-account-country-region" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to update your Microsoft account if you're moving to a new country or region</a> for more information for the move.

<p>Hello Brett,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is recommended to review this&nbsp; <strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/about-power-supply" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">power supply</a></strong> support article for general information about the device.</p>
<p><span>The console may be used in a different region, but it is recommended to purchase a converter from that region as to not cause harm to the power supply.</span></p>
<p><span>As you mentioned that this is an Xbox One S console, the internal power supply allows you to do exactly this.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We hope this information was helpful and are here for any other inquiries you may have.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Best wishes!</span></p>

            Hey Cake.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Probably detects the mic and speakers separately.  There are a lot of problems with audio in Windows 10 seen daily here in forums where we see the most cases by the thousands.
<br />
<br />I'll give you the fixes working for  bluetooth, microphones and audio to cover all possibilities.  
<br />
<br />Try the Bluetooth troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />Then try pairing again, if necessary run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter again.  
<br />
<br />Please run the Recording Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try this fix next:  <a href="http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working-in-windows-10-1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, open Recording Devices, see if the microphone is listed, set it as Default device.  
<br />
<br />Type Microphone in Start Search, open Set up Microphone, scroll down to Microphone and choose Get started to set it up.
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound controller drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the ones presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br /> Please run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br />
<br />When did this behavior begin?  If you have an idea you might be able to System Restore back to a point before it began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />It's possible this was caused by a Windows Update so if nothing above works, go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, check the Installed Updates list for Updates that might have been just installed, try uninstalling them using the Uninstall button present there.  Then hide the Updates using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by April Version 1803 update can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Issue in Purchasing Xbox 360 Games Using On Xbox Live Store - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nosaj3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue in Purchasing Xbox 360 Games Using On Xbox Live Store</h2>
                    
<p>There have been no issues in regards to downloading Xbox One games but when I try to download the Xbox 360 games from the store I'm getting some confusing behaviour.</p>
<p>When I select the game from the "Gold Members Area" or the store I see that the purchase/download button has been replaced with a "Show Price" button. When I select this button I'm told that the game is compatible with both Xbox One and Xbox 360. When I
 continue from this screen I'm shown the game price and asked to confirm my payment options. When I confirm my payment option I am simply returned back to the game's store page following a loading screen. The game is not added to my queue and I'm given no further
 information.</p>
<p>I do not know if this effects billing as I've only been trying this with games currently free with an Xbox Live Gold Membership. The games I've been getting this issue with are &nbsp;"Super Meat Boy" and "Tekken Tag Tournament 2".</p>

<p>Hey there Nosaj3,</p>
<p>First and foremost. Xbox one still does not have the capability to purchase 360 contents at this time. The only methods to get them is through an xbox 360 console or through the website. Also, another thing to take note. Even if the content is free, you
 still need to proceed with the purchase process for the license to be added to the account which I assume you already know.</p>
<p>So what you actually just need to do is to claim the game online then search again the game through the xbox store on your xbox one and it should then show the option to install. Or you could try to wait a bit for the game to show up under your Ready to
 Install list after claiming it on the web.</p>

<h2>            Command prompt opening up spontaneously</h2>
                    <p>Would be grateful for some advice for the computing illiterate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On 2 recent occasions (in the last 2 weeks), on 2 separate computers running Windows 8.1, what I assume is the command prompt has appeared spontaneously on my screen and then disappeared before I could read it properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the first occasion I think I caught something saying '1 file copied'.&nbsp; This happened twice.&nbsp; I think the HP support assistant was doing something at the time,but cannot be sure.&nbsp; On the second occasion (on a different machine) I could not read it but
 I think it said something different.&nbsp; These are identical HP devices.&nbsp; On both occasions I had recently switched the device on and was using internet explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My McAfee protection software has been running continuously&nbsp;and I have also installed and run malwarebytes with nothing found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, at the time both happened I noticed an unknown device under 'network connections'.&nbsp; On both times this was a nexus device but it had a different name on the first and second occasions.&nbsp; I assumed these were a neighbour's device ( as I sometimes
 do see other devices listed which&nbsp;disappear soon after appearing, and have never seen any listed on my router's&nbsp;dashboard).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I be concerned? Does the command prompt sometimes appear when background windows/update processes are running.&nbsp; I've not seen it before or since and it was the fact that it has occurred on both machines which concerned me.</p>

<p>
</p><p>As you know this might have occurred due to some background process or programs. Let's check if the issue occurs on Safe Mode or not. If the issue do not occur on Safe Mode, I would suggest you to set the computer in a clean boot state and check if it helps.</p>

    <title>after update, cant start and startup option missing from windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            after update, cant start and startup option missing from windows 10 repair disk</h2>
                    <p>One of my win10x64 systems got updated today, 18dec2017, and booted into a white screen that then said there was a problem and it started collecting information.&nbsp; This repeated until I got tired of it and I put in a repair disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This system has been working fine for months running BOINC 24/7&nbsp; &nbsp;I rebooted just a few days ago as I had an Nvidia update driver update and there was no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The repair disk boots up and there are options as follows (note that "Startup Settings" is missing)</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; System Restore - I am told there are no restore points which I know is incorrect.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; System Image Recovery:&nbsp; I have no image recovery.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Startup Repair - tried this several time but end up at that white screen that wants to send my problem off to microsoft.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Command Prompt</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Tried chkdsk /f c: /scan which I had to allow the disk to go off line but it ran OK finding a few lost files.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Tried sfc /scannow which failed as some resource was missing.&nbsp; Maybe this cant be run in repair command prompt???</p>
<p>5 - Go back to the previous build.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are none it seems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to boot into safe mode,&nbsp; I dont see how to do that although I see on the internet that some users have a 6th option to boot into safe mode as part of "Startup Settings".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Need to get to safe mode to save a few things and then fix or reinstall 10.&nbsp; &nbsp;According to my microsoft account this system was running 10 home. I assume I can put in my boot dvd that was created with the media creator, install 10 home w/o a key, use the
 same computer name, and sign into microsoft with my same username and password and activate 10 since this system has a digital key.&nbsp; I would rather not do this.&nbsp; The last thing I want to do is to re-install windows 7 home, put in my 7 license key, then hunt
 around and find that "free" windows 10 upgrade that got me 10 in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely if I can get into that command prompt there must be some way to get to safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This system is headless and runs BOINC 24/7 with no "user" and no need for fall creator or any updates other than antivirus and security updates.&nbsp; I would convert to uBuntu but this system was licensed for Windows 7.&nbsp; &nbsp;Is there a way to prevent fall creator
 or any of its updates?&nbsp; &nbsp;I watched this system rebooting from a remote terminal (Splashtop).&nbsp; I saw the updates being installed as it was shutting down and when it booted up it connected just fine with Splashtop and I watched more updates being installed.&nbsp;
 Maybe 15 minutes of activity, not just a quick security update.&nbsp; When it finally booted into windows it said there were more updates and it shut down again.&nbsp; It did not boot back up into my remote access terminal program so I put a monitor and keyboard on
 it to see what was going on and observed windows boot into that white screen repeatedly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[EDIT]</p>
<p>I put in what I thought was my installation media cd.&nbsp; From that command prompt I navigated to it's SETUP program but after answering a few questions I was told I had to run the program from inside windows.&nbsp; I then booted that DVD directly but got the same
 ending:&nbsp; After selecting "10 Home Single Language" and the "save files" option I am told I must run from inside windows.&nbsp; Where do I find the re-install that puts 10 in but leaves all my files?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can boot into safe mode can I then run the setup.exe from this windows 10 installation disk to do a repair install?&nbsp; Is there such as thing as a repair install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>[EDIT2]</p>
<p>OK, used that bcdedit to get into safe mode.&nbsp; Dont see anything obviously wrong other than it is after midnight here.&nbsp; &nbsp; Hopefully some suggestions will show up here and I will be back later to look at them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for looking!</p>

<p>Hello John.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally solved the problem and yes, there was a recent change - that "Nvidia Update" that I mentioned.&nbsp; That change reminded me that Microsoft's updates, if they include a display update, do NOT include OPENCL.&nbsp; This was the subject of a lot of discussion
 on some of the BOINC project websites where people complained that the nVidia drivers had to be reinstalled after updates, especially that fall creator update, as the OPENCL libraries were removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rolled back the nVidia driver and the system booted back into normal mode.&nbsp; I then reinstalled the 388.59 nVidia driver which brought me up to the latest and greatest from nVidia.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found out why there were no restore points.&nbsp; Back in May I replaced the disk drive with a spare.&nbsp; The spare was actually named "SPARE".&nbsp; Last week when I update the nVidia driver I noticed the name of the C drive was still "SPARE" so I renamed it
 to "System" to match all my other windows C drive default names.&nbsp; It seems the restore points were assigned to the volume name.&nbsp; When I brought up System Protection there were two C drives as shown below.&nbsp; One was "MIssing" and had Protection enabled.&nbsp; The
 other one was labeled "System" but did not have protection enabled (I enabled protection so "off" is not shown anymore).&nbsp; &nbsp;The one I renamed to "System" must have become the "missing" local C drive and a new "local C" was somehow created with no protection
 and was "System".&nbsp; I take it that this is a bug in Windows 10.&nbsp; I have only 1 drive on this system although there is a system partition "E" in addition to the single C partition.&nbsp; I have no idea how to get rid of that "Missing C"</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7aaac364-6e17-4469-9842-c4ac988c71b8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7aaac364-6e17-4469-9842-c4ac988c71b8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing I noticed was the "Protection Settings" tab missing from the control panel dialog box in safe mode.&nbsp; I explicitly ran RSTRUI.EXE and got the exact same dialog box warning that I saw with that repair disk:&nbsp; "there are no restore points".&nbsp; So
 it seem that renaming the volume cause the restore points to be misplaced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft does not seem to be aware of the OPENCL driver problem or even its existence.&nbsp; When running the task managers resource display, it consistently shows my nVidia boards idling.&nbsp; They are actually running at 100% and I use special cooling to keep
 them from overheating.&nbsp; If I select "compute_0" as a GPU option on the graphics display it immediately shows 99-100 percent usage although the overview or summery still shows 1-2 percent utilization.&nbsp; According to BOINC forums, compute_0 is the ID for OPENCL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to mention another problem that might help other users.&nbsp; When adding a 2nd video board, even an exact duplicate such as setting up SLI or CROSSFIRE, problems can be avoided by disconnecting the system from the internet.&nbsp; Windows sees the new board
 and immediately goes to its online update repository and invariably gets an older driver which then causes problems.&nbsp; Older win7 and 8 allow the option of not using the windows online update repository BUT NOT WINDOWS 10.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm glad your problem is resolved for the most part...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wanted to let you know there is a tool called Show\Hide that will allow you to HIDE unwanted Windows Updates... You would need to run this every so often to block the newer "Feature Updates" and anything else you don't want...</p>
<p>
</p><p>OR... you could disable Windows Update in "Services"... It is possible this will cause the machine to become "Not Activated" depending on how it was activated to start with...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender updates with Windows Update disabled btw...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link for the Show\Hide Tool is at the very bottom of this webpage...</p>

            Hello! Sorry you are having this issue. Hopefully we can fix it.
<br />
<br />I suggest you look for what drivers your graphics card uses. You can find this in device manager &gt; display adapters. 
<br />
<br />After you find it, make note. 
<br />
<br />Download ddu and uninstall all drivers and clean them off your PC. Restart your PC and install the drivers again
<br />
<br />DDU: <a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dri...</a>

<p><br />
So your issue is with Windows Live Photo Gallery&nbsp;- or so it seems.</p>
<p>I would suggest some basic cleanup and optimization as well as an uninstall/install clean of Windows Live Photo Gallery (<a href="http://g.live.com/1rewlive3/en/wlsetup-all.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Live Essentials for Windows XP</a>).&nbsp; The basic problem is that we are
 speaking of legacy software all around (albeit Windows XP is in extended support and gets updates through April 2014 - Windows Live Photo Gallery stopped being made for Windows XP some time ago&nbsp;- with the later versions only working on Vista/7.</p>
<p>What's a basic cleanup and optimization?</p>
<p><strong><u>Check for malware:</u></strong></p>
<p>Download, install, run, update and perform full system scans with the following two applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://malwarebytes.org/mbam-download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MalwareBytes (FREE)</a>
</li><li><a href="http://superantispyware.com/downloadfile.html?productid=SUPERANTISPYWAREFREE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SuperAntiSpyware (FREE)</a></li></ul>
<p><br />
Removing everything they find.&nbsp; Rebooting when needed.&nbsp; (You can uninstall one or both when done.)</p>
<p>Then perform an online scan with the <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
eSet Online Scanner</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>The less you have running all the time, the better the things you want to run will perform:</u></strong></p>
<p>Use <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Autoruns</a> to figure out what all is starting up when your computer does/when you log on.&nbsp; Look up anything you do not know about using
<a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Google</a> (and/or ask here.)&nbsp; You can hopefully figure out if there are things starting when you computer does (or you logon) that you do not need and then configure them (via their
 own built-in mechanisms is the preferred method) so they do not start up - using your resources without reason.</p>
<p>You can download and utilize <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Process Explorer</a> to see exactly what is taking up your processor/CPU time and memory.&nbsp; This can help you recognize applications you might want to look into alternatives for and/or get rid of all together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Do some house cleaning and dust off that hard drive:</u></strong></p>
<p>You may wish to free up some disk space (will also aid in getting rid of things you do not utilize) by going through these steps:</p>
<p>Windows XP should take between 4.5 and 9GB *with* an Office suite, Photo Editing software, alternative Internet browser(s), various Internet plugins and a host of other things installed.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable with the stability of your system, you can delete the uninstall files for the patches that Windows XP has installed...<br />

<p>You can turn off hibernation if it is on and you don't use it..</p>
<p>When you hibernate your computer, Windows saves the contents of the system's memory to the hiberfil.sys file. As a result, the size of the hiberfil.sys file will always equal the amount of physical memory in your system. If you don't use the hibernate feature
 and want to recapture the space that Windows uses for the hiberfil.sys file, perform the following steps:</p>
<p>- Start the Control Panel Power Options applet (go to Start, Settings, Control Panel, and click Power Options).<br />
- Select the Hibernate tab, clear the "Enable hibernation" check box, then click OK; although you might think otherwise, selecting Never under the "System hibernates" option on the Power Schemes tab doesn't delete the hiberfil.sys file.<br />
- Windows will remove the "System hibernates" option from the Power Schemes tab and delete the hiberfil.sys file.</p>
<p>You can control how much space your System Restore can use...</p>
<p>1. Click Start, right-click My Computer, and then click Properties.<br />
2. Click the System Restore tab.<br />
3. Highlight one of your drives (or C: if you only have one) and click on the "Settings" button.<br />
4. Change the percentage of disk space you wish to allow.. I suggest moving the slider until you have just about 1GB (1024MB or close to that...)<br />
5. Click OK.. Then Click OK again.</p>
<p>You can control how much space your Temporary Internet Files can utilize...</p>
<p>Empty your Temporary Internet Files and shrink the size it stores to a size between 64MB and 128MB..</p>
<p>- Open ONE copy of Internet Explorer.<br />
- Select TOOLS - Internet Options.<br />
- Under the General tab in the "Temporary Internet Files" section, do the following:<br />
- Click on "Delete Cookies" (click OK)<br />
- Click on "Settings" and change the "Amount of disk space to use:" to something between 64MB and 128MB. (It may be MUCH larger right now.)<br />
- Click OK.<br />
- Click on "Delete Files" and select to "Delete all offline contents" (the checkbox) and click OK. (If you had a LOT, this could take 2-10 minutes or more.)<br />
- Once it is done, click OK, close Internet Explorer, re-open Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>You can use an application that scans your system for log files and temporary files and use that to get rid of those:</p>
<p>Ccleaner (Free!)<br />

<p><strong><u>Cleanup the Update Components on your Windows XP machine</u></strong></p>
<p>While likely not 100% necessary - it is probably a good idea at this time to make sure you continue getting the updates you need.&nbsp; This will help you make sure your update system is ready to do this for you.</p>
<p>Download and run the MSRT manually:<br />

(Skip the details and download the tool, download and save to your desktop, run it.)</p>
<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>Download/Install the latest Windows Installer (for your OS):<br />
( Windows XP 32-bit : <span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloadS/details.aspx?familyid=5A58B56F-60B6-4412-95B9-54D056D6F9F4&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">WindowsXP-KB942288-v3-x86.exe</a></span> )<br />
(Download and save it to your desktop, run it.)</p>
<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>and...</p>
<p>Download the latest version of the Windows Update agent from here (x86):<br />
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=91237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=91237</a><br />
.... and save it to the<strong> root of your C:\ drive</strong>. After saving it to the
<em>root of the C:\ drive</em>, do the following:</p>
<p>Close all Internet Explorer windows and other applications.</p>
<p>Start button --&gt; RUN and type in:<br />
%SystemDrive%\windowsupdateagent30-x86.exe /WUFORCE<br />
--&gt; Click OK.</p>
<p>(If asked, select "Run".) --&gt; Click on NEXT --&gt; Select "I agree" and click on NEXT --&gt; When it finishes installing, click on "Finish"...</p>
<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>Now reset your Windows Update Components with this FixIt (you will <strong><em>*NOT*</em></strong>&nbsp;use the aggressive version):<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I reset Windows Update components?</a></p>
<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that your system is generally free of malware (assuming you have an AntiVirus application), &nbsp;you have cleaned up the 'extra applications' that might be running and taking up your valuable memory and processor, you have cleared out some valuable drive
 space and made sure there are no issues with the drive itself and your Windows Update components are updated and should be working in top shape - there is only one other thing you
<em>may</em> wish to do:</p>
<p>Obtain and install&nbsp;the latest hardware device drivers for your system from the system/hardware manufacturers' support and/or download web site.</p>
<p>If you wish, come back and let us know a little more information about your system - in particular the Make/Model of the system you have - and perhaps someone here can point you to the right place(s) to go to accomplish this.&nbsp; This is not 100% necessary
 - but I would bet that you would gain some performance and features by doing this part.</p>

<h2>            Recover drive locked by bitlocker w&#47;o access to old TPM</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
This is an odd problem. I have a Lenovo T440s that I dual-booted for years using Ubuntu and windows 7. I never encountered any problems, nor did I know that the Windows partition, which was the default OEM install from Lenovo, was captured under bitlocker,
 as I had never activated bitlocker. My intention was to upgrade it to Windows 10 this year.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
About 5 months ago I became unable to boot this machine - the dreaded 4-beeps, which means TPM has died and it is unable to post. Fine, a new motherboard and I am back in business. Except... I'm not. The original drive was indeed set up for bitlocker even though
 I had never activated it from windows. Now the TPM tied to this drive is totally dead. I am unable to boot from the drive or bring up its partitions under ubuntu because it is "protected" by bitlocker, and there is no recovery password because I never set
 one up.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
So.. under normal circumstances, I would say oh well, reformat the drive and go on with my life just a tiny bit wiser. However, this drive has some old but cherished information. I am 90% sure it is resident on this unreachable Windows partition, and nowhere
 else. Normal un-bitlocking tools are useless without a recovery password. I still have the old motherboard but it does not work.
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
I would be grateful for any suggestions.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response, Bill.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These solutions only work if there is a recovery key that can be found. I was not aware that this drive was set up with Bitlocker in the first place, as it never asked for a password or complained during startup. The manufacturer (Lenovo) must have preinstalled
 Bitlocker with a random password that would be reset when the user initiated it. I used this drive for 4 years with no knowledge of Bitlocker's existence and even resized the drive in the meantime with no ill effects.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With no possible access to the original TPM, I evidently have no possible way to unlock this drive, as it was the TPM itself that failed and required a motherboard replacement.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no recovery password - I was never prompted to create or save one. I literally did not know Bitlocker was present on this machine until now. I am more than willing to admit user error when I have caused a problem, but in this case, Bitlocker itself,
 or rather Lenovo's invisible use of it, has caused data loss.<br />
</p>
<p>I will continue to search for this data on older backups, but in the meantime I am very unhappy with the situation.</p>
