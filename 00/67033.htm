<p>Unless they were exact copies of the original items you can not reactivate as a new motherboard is a new computer and need a new license.</p>
<p>The activation of Windows 10 is to the computer not the software. </p>

            AFAIK, MS has change the policy and try to make reactivation process simpler by adding "<strong>I changed hardware on this device recently</strong>". But the reactivation server is not stable "<strong>our servers aren't available right now</strong>" and
 I cannot connect to it.&nbsp; MS's suggestion is "<strong>try adding your Microsoft account again</strong>", what that mean?<br />

            Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />(Not applicable to you) 
<br />What you need to do is to grab the key using any Software like Showkey Plus, uninstall that key from older PC and use it on another computer. 
<br />
<br />Download Showkey Plus: 
<br />www.thewindowsclub.com/showkeyplus-product-key-finder
<br />
<br />Uninstall the key
<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-windows-10-and-change-the-product-key/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-wind...</a> 
<br />
<br />Use the key by Showkey Plus on the newer computer. 
<br />(Not applicable to you ends)
<br />Alternatively, there are two more options available other than this: 
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Contact Microsoft using the phone numbers below:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/405170...</a>
<br />
<br />Use the Activation troubleshooter on the new PC signed in with same MS account. 
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. 
<br />Select I recently changed hardware on this device.

    <title>Can I install Windows 7 pro update on top of itself&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samantha1210  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I install Windows 7 pro update on top of itself&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a PC that was originally Windows Vista, but had a free upgrade to Windows 7. The PC is now totally loaded full of stuff and would do very well with a complete clean install of Windows 7 again. I already own the license for the version of Windows 7
 that I have, so I'm wondering if I can reinstall this over the very same version of Windows 7. I no longer have the key for Vista, so installing that first would be a hassle. I just want to reinstall Windows 7. What is my best option?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clean Install Windows 7 With Upgrade Media and Product Key on Formatted or Empty Blank Hard Drive<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Please read the following:</strong><br />
The upgrade will check that (Windows XP or Vista) is installed. <br />
However the Windows 7 End User License Agreement does specifically state that, therefore as long as you have a valid COA<br />
and product key for the computer you wish to upgrade you can.</p>
<p>So if your computer came with a previous qualifying license (Vista or Windows XP). Note: The Certificate of Authencity (COA) must be attached to the computer and readable, then the COA is reason enough for representing compliance to the software license
 agreement. No actual installation of previous software necessary, which means you can do a clean install with Windows 7 Upgrade disk</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------- License -------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>"15. UPGRADES.</strong> To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade.<br />
Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from.<br />
After you upgrade, you may no longer use the software you upgraded from."</p>
<p>16.PROOF OF LICENSE.<br />
a.Genuine Proof of License. If you acquired the software on a disc or other media, your proof of license is the genuine Microsoft certificate of authenticity label with the accompanying genuine product key, and your proof of purchase. If you purchased and downloaded
 the software online, your proof of license is the genuine Microsoft product key for the software which you received with your purchase, and your proof of purchase from an authorized electronic supplier of genuine Microsoft software. Proof of purchase may be
 subject to verification by your merchant’s records.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I do not have the disk for the Windows 7 upgrade. It is an OEM upgrade from HP. I first contacted Microsoft in regards to this, the agent told me that the recovery drive on the PC should be for Windows 7, not Vista. I felt a little weary about that, as it
 didn't sound like he was very confident in his answer. So I then consulted an IT professional, but got no help. Finally, I called HP and asked if there was anything I could do. He told me that the recovery partition was in fact for Vista, which the sticker
 for has since worn, and I can't get my product key back. He spent the rest of the call&nbsp;trying to sell me a Software Warranty on a PC that's almost 4 years old.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't want to keep anything, I want a clean drive. I've manually removed most of the software, files and folders on the PC, it's running&nbsp; a bit faster than it was. But I'm still looking for an alternative option than buying Windows 8 (which will run poorly)
 or buying Windows 7, which Microsoft no longer sells, so I would be required to buy it from a third party vendor.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really would like a suggestion on how to clean the drive, maybe a place to find the download for the Windows 7 upgrade that I need. (Win7 HmPrm UPG fulfill).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are my options? It seems as though I don't have many. </p>

            <p>The COA I have is for a Windows 7 upgrade. I need the specific upgrade version to install it. I need to find that, as well as I need to know if BECAUSE it is an UPGRADE, will I need to reinstall another OS in order to install it as an upgrade, or can I just
 install it using the currently installed version, (the same one I want to reinstall) as a base OS for Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just want a clean install of my Winodws 7 UPGRADE.</p>

            <p>The key you have will work with the appropriate .ISO download.&nbsp;However since its an "Upgrade" key you do need a prior version of Windows (XP orr Vista) installed and activated.</p>

Yes, you can use the .ISO in the links I provided above:</p>
<p>Download the corresponding edition of Windows 7 you have a license for from the following link. You can identify the edition on COA sticker attached to your machine, with at bottom or battery compartment (laptop) or top/side if its a desktop computer.</p>

<p><br />
Note: Always use the slowest burn speed (4x or 2x) if offered a choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To do a clean install while maintaining compliance, do the following:</strong></p>
<p>Boot from the Windows 7 DVD<br />
Click Install Now<br />
Accept License Agreement<br />
When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>select the disk partition where you would like to install Windows 7 Click Next.</p>
<p>You will receive the following warning:</p>
<p>The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your
 previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>(At all cost, do NOT click anything named Format or Delete or Partition. So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. Click OK</p>
<p>Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.</p>
<p>When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your laptop, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and
 drivers.</p>
<p>You can then recover your personal files from the Windows.old folder and reinstall all your applications and drivers.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 can&#39;t play music and videos after an automatic update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>After automatic update on window 10 last week, my computer can't playback musics and videos. It's stuttering and skipping from song to song. For video, it plays around 4, 5 seconds and stops. I have upgrade the graphic card to the latest version, but it
 doesn't help.</p>
<p>Can anybody give me some hints to fix these problems, please?</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your help</p>

<p>Hi Gil,</p>
<p>I have run sfc and DISM as suggested, but problem still remains even though Windows successfully repaired corrupted files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you give me other ways to fix the problem</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update. Since you have already updated the Display adapters driver, this time, we suggest updating the
<strong>S</strong><strong>ound, video and game controller drivers</strong>, as well as the flash player, such as Adobe, and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, create a new user, and then try to replicate the issue. This is to help us find out if a corruption in the user account is causing videos and sounds to not play. Here is a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support article</a></strong> on how to create a local user or administrator account in Windows
 10 for your reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists on the new user, we suggest performing a <strong>System Restore</strong>, and revert to before the automatic update got installed. In this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support article</a></strong> on recovery options in Windows 10, please refer to

<p>Hi Patricia,</p>
<p>I have tried different ways to fix the problems such as checking the Sound, video and game controller driver update, performing sfc scan, system restore back to 9th of Jan, 2017, the system restore does not work properly. I can't create the restore point
 from the Protection Settings in the System Properties. the computer can only perform the system restore to the time of performance the system restore, this is really annoying! For example, when I run the system restore at 5pm on 02/09/2017. After running for
 a while and restarting, the result indicates that the computer has been restored to 5 pm on 02/09/2017! It's freak! I have also to run the System Restore in the Safe Mode, but nothing has changed. I changed the web browser to Mozilla FireFox to see if it is
 better, but it's worse!</p>
<p>Windows 10 automatic update is horrible! Really annoying!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions!&nbsp;</p>

<h3> squeakyplatypus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Overheating, but only for certain games</h2>
                    
<p>So, I bought the Saints Row Double Pack a couple of days ago. I go to play Saints Row 2, and after only a couple of minutes of being on, I get the two red lights and it shuts down, and the disc itself is also hot. The same thing happens with Saints Row 1.
 But my other games, Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition, Fallout New Vegas and Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion don't do this, and after an hour or two of play, their discs aren't nearly as hot as the Saints Row ones are. My console is out in the open, on top of a
 hard, solid surface with nothing on top of it or on top of the vents, and it is not near any other heat source. The power brick is in the same situation. In late 2006, I was able to play Saints Row 1 without any problems at all for hours on end, so I don't
 know why it's doing this now. I have a 20 gig Pro from 2006, if it matters. Never got RRoD, never had to be sent in for repairs or anything. This is the first time I've ever had actual trouble.</p>

<br />
Have you tried installing the game your having this issue with onto your consoles HDD?, might be worth a crack if it only happens with certain titles.<br />
<br />
If it continues then a repair may be needed OP, unfortunately because the console is over the 3 years extended warranty there would be a charge for a service.<br />

            Hi,
<br />
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />Follow these in order:
<br />1.	Try Wsreset: First see if Windows Store Reset works. This should Reset Windows 10 Store cache and if there is a problem with cache, this would clear it.
<br />           a.	Open Run dialog box(Win+R)
<br />           b.	Type in wsreset and Press Enter
<br />
<br />2.	The next step if Wsreset doesn't help is to Reset the Store app. To do this, follow the steps:
<br />                           a.	Open Run Dialog box( Windows+R key)
<br />                           b.	Type in ms-settings:appsfeatures  and Press Enter(Alternatively, Start&gt;Settings&gt;Apps and features)
<br />                            c.	Locate Microsoft Store
<br />                            d.	Click Advanced Options
<br />                            e.	Locate and click Reset Button
<br />
<br />3.	Reset Windows Update components: Resetting Windows update components might also help. Here is an article on how to do that.
<br />
<br />                    a.	<a href="https://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/reset-windows-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/reset-...</a>
<br />4.	Check for necessary services: Windows Store is dependent on some Services. Please check if the services are running and Automatic as given below.
<br />
<br />                 a.	Right-click Start&gt;Run and Type in Services.msc to open Services.
<br />                 b.	Make sure the status of the following services is Automatic and running
<br />                                        i.	Windows License Manager
<br />                                        ii.	Background Intelligence Transfer service
<br />                                        iii.	Cryptographic Services
<br />                                         iv.	Windows Update
<br />                                          v.	Windows Store
<br />
<br />c.	If something is not as intended, you can try Restoring default services
<br />                     <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vw3g7llzu6niode/Restore%20services.zip?dl=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/vw3g7llzu6niode/Resto...</a>
<br />
<br />5.	Repair install: The last Restort is a reinstallation of Windows. You can do a repair install, which keeps everything including your apps and files.

<p>Otherwise, here is what I answered there:</p>
<p><strong><u>Check for malware:</u></strong></p>
<p>Download, install, run, update and perform full system scans with the following two applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://malwarebytes.org/mbam-download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MalwareBytes (FREE)</a>

<p><br />
Removing everything they find.&nbsp; Rebooting when needed.&nbsp; (You can uninstall one or both when done.)</p>
<p>Then perform an online scan with the <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Free up some hard drive space and get it organized:</u></strong></p>

<li>Click Start, type <b>Compcln.exe</b> and press ENTER </li><li>Click <b>Continue</b> when you see the User Account Control elevation dialog.

            Hi <span>sggpram,</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span>If Windows Resource Protection says that the problems cannot be fixed you may have to try an In-place upgrade of Windows Vista.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span>To do an In-place upgrade of windows Vista follow the steps below:</span></strong><br />
&nbsp;
<p>
<span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Insert the Vista DVD into the DVD drive while your current Vista is running.</span><strong><span>
</span></strong><span>WARNING:</span><span>
<strong>Do not boot</strong> the computer and run the Vista installation DVD from boot. A upgrade install will not work this way.</span></p>
<p>
<span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Click on
<strong>Install Now</strong> to start the upgrade. <em>If <strong>AutoPlay</strong> does not load the Vista setup screen, then open your DVD drive in
<strong>Computer</strong> and click on the <strong>Setup </strong>file.</em></span></p>
<p>
<span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>If you want Vista to check for updates during the installation, then click on that to select it.<em> It will install faster if you select
<strong>Do not get the latest updates for installation</strong>. You can install them later through
<strong>Windows Update</strong>.</em></span></p>
<p>
<span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Do not type in a
<strong>product key</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Leave the
<strong>Automatically activate Windows when I'm online</strong> box unchecked.</span></p>
<p>
<span>6.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Click on
<strong>Next</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>7.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Click on the
<strong>No</strong> button for the “<strong>Do you want to enter your product key now?”</strong> prompt.</span></p>
<p>
<span>8.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Select which edition of Vista you have.</span></p>
<p>
<span>9.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Check the “<strong>I have selected the edition of Windows that I purchased”</strong> box and click on
<strong>Next</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>10.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Click on the<strong> Upgrade</strong> option.</span></p>
<p>
<span>11.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Follow any instructions left until Vista is through installing and has rebooted to the final welcome screen on the Vista desktop.</span></p>
<p>
<span>12.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Remove the Vista installation DVD.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><br />
<span>I hope this information is helpful.</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Please let us know if you require further help.</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />

<h2>            moving files from my old PC XP to New PC 8.1 using easy transfer cable</h2>
                    <p>My old PC is using windows XP, This computer is 9 years old and since XP is no longer being supported, I bought this new PC with windows 8.1. I clicked on start, accessories, system tools then easy transfer.&nbsp; I followed the instruction for transfering files
 to my personal media back up drive.&nbsp; During the back up I get this message that says can't copy &nbsp;file C://document and settings/all users/application data/norton/.&nbsp; I can't skip copying the file. I have to abort, cancel or ingnor. Clicking on ingnor nothing
 happens and it stops the process. After several attemps I gave up and bought a Belkin transfer cable to transfer my XP (32 bit) files settings to my new PC (64 bit) using Window 8.1. &nbsp;I am following the instuctions.&nbsp; Once it says to connect the USB cable&nbsp;to
 both computer it should take a few minuets for the computers to hook up but nothing happens.&nbsp; Here is what the progam asks:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1 prepare your computer (install easy transfer on old computer) Click next</p>
<p>step 2 easy transfer installed, run easy transfer, click launch</p>
<p>step 3 screen provides what information can be transferred, click next</p>
<p>step 4 asks what do you want to use to transfer items to your new computer, click easy transfer cable</p>
<p>step 5 asks which computer are you using now, click this is my old computer I want to transfer files and setting from this computer</p>
<p>step 6 states to open easy transfer on your new PC and provides information on how to do that. step 7 I open windows easy transfer on new computer windows 8.1 and screen say this is what is transfered</p>
<p>step 8&nbsp;screen on olld computer says once easy transfer is running on new computer click next and I click next</p>
<p>step&nbsp;9 say to plug easy transfer cable into both computers.&nbsp; If it takes more than a feww minutes to connect, check the cables connections on both computers.</p>
<p>after this step nothing happens. I move the cable connections to different USB ports and still nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am totaly stumped, no matter what I try to do using external hard drive or transfer cable to move my files and settings from the old computer to the new one works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I need to do to resolve this problem?</p>

            I am having the exact same problem. I have spent hours trying to transfer from my HP with Win&nbsp;XP to my new HP computer with Win 8.1 with no success. I suspect this is just another glitch with Windows operating system - Very frustrating!!!

            <p>Alas, few will probably read my response to your unsolvable problem.&nbsp; After my Apple IIC, I converted to&nbsp;Windows, and have been there ever since - not that I loved it, but my killer program , Quicken, and its investment history only works on Windows - converting
 to MAC loses all investment history - enough of a reason not to change.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Bought my wife a MacBookPro for Christmas because she wanted a second one - was impressed that the MBP transferred ALL of its files (including programs) from her old Apple Mac to her new with just one click - but I was still a PCMan.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After much research, I replaced my WXP version with a new Dell - pretty nice hardware - software stinks.&nbsp; After buying Belkin Easy Transfer Cable, found out MS wrote this out of their plan.&nbsp; Now am faced with a byte-by-byte copy/paste of 8 GB of contact,
 email and doc data - or I can transfer it to SkyCloud, and figure out where each piece need to land from there - just like, "I shot an arrow into the air, it fell to earth I know not where".&nbsp; I don't plan to subject myself to this.&nbsp; I would suggest you other
 wonks waist deep in finding a technical solution think about this also.&nbsp; There are easier ways to live, and I've discovered that MSFT ain't it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>With all due respect, you good folk at MSFT areeither too into the political tea leaves, or else have your heads way up your arses.&nbsp;&nbsp;Need to stoptrying to convince your customers that they are better off when they are miserable. Try spending the next three
 days transferring years of files and tell me how happy you are.Methinks your company has passed over the top, but as happens so many times, few at MSFT yet realize this.</p>

            <p>Hi Terry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the delay in responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Easy Transfer can't transfer files from a 64-bit version of Windows to a 32-bit version of Windows. For example, if you're transferring from a 64-bit version of Windows&nbsp;Vista to a 32-bit version of Windows&nbsp;7, you can move your files manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, you are unable to copy the &nbsp;C://document and settings/all users/application data/Norton folder. This may be due to the permissions set to that folder which does not let you modify the contents of that folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to manually copy the data from you Documents, Pictures, Videos or any other data that you need from those locations to your external hard drive and transfer it to the Windows&nbsp;8 computer.</p>

<p>No not really I called my isp (comcast) and they said they can't do anything about it cuz they changed my ip address 2 times already, &nbsp;and I don't want to be on a vpn cuz the internet will be really slow. And also comcast said it is your servers the hackers
 are tampering with and the xbox is your equipment so they told me to talk to you guys about it. And also you need to take action against these hackers like I already had said.for example: You guys never &nbsp;took care of the ticket number:1232190458.

<p>Actually what Comcast told you was false. They're attacking your internet, not the Xbox servers. Dos attacks actually have nothing to do with Xbox. You can read more about them here -

<p>As far as investigating the other players, you will need to file a complaint on them via the console so the enforcement team can investigate them. No one on the forums has the power to do anything.</p>

<h2>            How do I prevent Windows Media Player from pausing and going to Sync when I insert a USB drive&#63;</h2>
                    Before I start, I want to say this very clearly. So clearly, that I will leave several lines of blank space so you cannot confuse it with anything else.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is NOT an AUTOPLAY issue. AUTOPLAY is already DISABLED.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I am listening to music through WMP12, and insert a usb drive to do whatever I want. Automatically, WMP12 pauses my music, and goes from Now Playing mode to Sync mode.<br />
<br />
After I unpause my music, and remove the USB drive, the music pauses again.<br />
<br />
How can I prevent this from happening.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And I repeat: AUTOPLAY IS ALREADY DISABLED. THIS IS A WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER 12 ISSUE.

<h2>            File associations and file icons in Win 10 for non-MS types</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a problem with file associations in Win 10 for file types of a program (Trados Studio) that is not an MS or common program. Trados itself has a few known glitches that I found out about after the fact:</p>
<p>When deleting old versions of the program, it happens that up to Win 7 the file associations would not be recognized anymore and what could be fixed easily up to Win 7.</p>
<p>In Win 10 the recommended fixes no longer work (letting Trados new 2015 version fix itself or setting the file attributes in Windows as it used to be possible).</p>
<p>So after I deleted obsolete versions of Trados, all kinds of different file type designations (as in the text how Trados calls them) and the icons (various ones for different types, which are important for working with the program) were gone. In my panic
 I set "Trados 2015" as the default app to open the files with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now all of the different Trados types are shown with the application icon and not the specific ones for different types.</p>
<p>I have reinstalled the program a thousand times now and Trados seems to be unable to completely delete itself because my personalized settings and projects reappear in it. I have no way of telling Windows 10 which file needs to be associated with what icon
 (all icons for all Trados files are where they need to be and I can see them here, only not attribute them).</p>
<p>I found a lengthy and complicated recommendation for how to program the associations in the registry but as a mere user I am underqualified to even understand what is meant. Why is there no way to set individual file attributes and associations with file
 type names and file type icons in Windows? Can anyone help?</p>
<p>THANKS!</p>
<p>cg spt</p>
<p>P.S.: Of course I also didn't realize that Windows 10 needs to be told that it makes a restore point or it will not restore to e.g. the previous day, which would of course been my choice to fix the problem and make the obsolete versions reappear. :(</p>

            <p>It is, in fact, quite easy, if tedious, to amend file associations in Windows 10:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to - Start Button (Windows Flag Icon) &gt; "Settings" &gt; "System" &gt; "Default Apps" &gt; "Choose default applications by file type" (in the right-hand pane); and set/amend the Default apps by working through the list of extensions clicking on the app icons to
 get a list of alternatives that can open the files. &nbsp;On completion, the issue you'll be left with is the proprietary file extensions that can only be opened with the 'rogue' application you are trying to remove.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>Actually, everything is and has consistently worked fine - apart from the icons being not displayed and the file types not being shown with the correct file type names.</p>
<p>I was able to install and reinstall Trados Studio 2015 multiple times correctly. The program is running without any problems.</p>
<p>When I recently deleted - and no longer used - old versions of Trados, the error with the icons and type names occurred.</p>
<p>Thereupon I told Windows (when I saw the missing icons and read the message from Windows) to use Trados 2015 for this file.</p>
<p>The problem is though that Trados in itself has different kinds of file types (like project, template, individual file, incoming package, return package....). Each of these types has its own descriptive name and icon. The icons and the names are needed to
 differentiate between e.g. incoming package and return package. The icon of the application itself is only used for the actual program - not the various file types.</p>
<p>The error in Windows does not go away by uninstalling and reinstalling Trados because Windows and/or Trados seems to remember parts of itself and always (I tried so many times) returns with the same error and the same personalized settings in Trados and
 the list of my current projects in Trados.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trados 2015 is perfectly compatible with Windows 10. It has always worked fine until I deleted old versions of Trados (from 2007 to 2014, adding up to multiple GB). I do not understand why neither Windows nor Trados can simply do what they ought to with
 the file associations. It's driving me nuts and I cannot figure out what the problem may be.</p>
<p>The tips and tricks of Trados suggest setting the file attribution in Windows 7 in file manager&nbsp;(there are no further recommendations for Windows 10 and the file manager option is no longer available in Win 10) and/or manually delete personalized settings
 files from Trados and reinstall it (also did not work in Win 10, the recommendation is for Win 7).</p>
<p>THANKS for any input you might have!</p>

            <p>Hi - I tried that as well - no success. </p>
<p>The problem is then that the Trados internal variants of files (each with different icons and descriptions) are not recognized by Windows. Like when I pick the "single translation file type" to attribute it in the way you describe, I am led to the MS App
 Store and there is no option to pick an app from my computer. Besides, the app is set correctly only the app-internal differentiations are gone. :(</p>

            <p>Hello, all who thought about this issue: problem resolved.</p>
<p>It was something that is a historical bug of Trados - which didn't really "occur" this time in the form it is known but in this form of the missing icons upon deletion of old versions:</p>
<p>When making the initial installation of the program it is absolutely necessary to go manually into the download folder and right-click to execute the installation as administrator (I fail to remember this as it makes 0 sense in Windows to do so when all
 user accounts on a PC that is used by 1 person only are set with all rights of god and more) - but you need to do it ONCE for this program. Then upon each upgrade you can simply click from the download bar and have it installed properly.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, when deleting prior versions of this particular program, you need to do the Administrator thing again - albeit in Windows 10 it worked without additionally taking down firewalls and deactivating anti-virus software.</p>
<p>Thus, I got my icons and file designations back and life is starting to be good :) THANKS MS Community for your precisely right pointers that "the program was never installed properly" - exactly the case and that got me thinking.</p>
<p>THANKS!</p>

<p>
</p><p>The cumulative updates of 1803 are listed here: </p>

<p>This is the scenario that we have:<br />
</p>
<p>1. We install WIndows version 1511 (a fresh installation)</p>
<p>2. Change BCDEDIT settings (set&nbsp;<strong>numproc </strong>to non-default number)</p>
<p>3. Reboot Windows -&gt; BCDEDIT changes are applied</p>
<p>4. Go to Check Windows Updates, Windows will install the latest cumulative update (version 1803 is installed)</p>

<p>Neither of those is secret or personal, and we really need to know what they are in order to be able to check your account settings.</p>

<p>This is not an uncommon fault with Yahoo IMAP accounts. I don't think there's any sort of universal cure, but I would suggest that you log in to the same account in webmail (I can't tell you how to do that because I don't know which server you're having
 trouble with ...) and do some housekeeping. Close down Windows Live Mail meanwhile, so it doesn't get confused by all these changes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Empty the folders for spam and deleted items, then move older messages out of the inbox and into user-created folders. Only leave the last week or month's messages in the inbox. When you're finished, launch Windows Live Mail again and tell us what happens.
 There may be some changes you need to make in the account settings.</p>

While eligible purchases you make track towards your year-to-date Star Rank, your MyVIP Star Rank is recalibrated each year based on your previous year's spend.

<ul>
<li>Perform a Factory Restore. Check the manufacturer's home page for instructions.</li><li>Boot the machine with your Windows XP installation CD, then follow the prompts. You will have to find the various drivers to match your hardware, e.g. a driver for the SATA hard disk.<br />

            Hi Gary
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Option 1: 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Select the Processes tab
<br />Scroll down to Windows Explorer then select it
<br />Click Restart
<br />
<br />If that does not work:
<br />
<br />Option 2: 
<br />
<br />uninstall your display driver:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Option 3
<br />
<br />1. Open Notepad.
<br />
<br />2. Copy the following text into Notepad:
<br />
<br />@echo off
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /im explorer.exe
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /im shellexperiencehost.exe
<br />
<br />timeout /t 3 /NOBREAK &gt; nul
<br />
<br />del %localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.ShellExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\TempState\* /q
<br />
<br />timeout /t 2 /NOBREAK &gt; nul
<br />
<br />start explorer
<br />
<br />@echo on
<br />
<br />3. Click File and Save.
<br />
<br />4. Choose a location to save the file.  Enter a File name of ClearTileCache.bat and select Save as type of All files (*.*).  Click Save.
<br />
<br />5. Open File Explorer and navigate to the location that you chose to save the file to.  Double-click ClearTileCache.bat to run the file.
<br />
<br />If none of the above steps works, I recommend you perform a repair upgrade:
<br />
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Upgrade this PC now if you want to upgrade right away,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don’t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Anniversary Update on a system with limited space:
<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />If you want to perform a new install or just keep your files click Change what to keep. Once you have chosen the desired options, click Install to begin.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />That’s it, the Windows 10 Feature Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />How to prepare your computer before upgrading?
<br />
<br />Although updating to Windows 10 version 1903 is a relatively simple process, similar to a repair upgrade; users should perform some basic pre-requisites before initiating the upgrade.
<br />
<br />If you are finding it difficult to carry out some of the steps described below, please review detailed instructions how to perform them:
<br />

            Hi Gary.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What usually works is to re-register the Settings app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />If not go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1903 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Not sending or receiving Contact request</h2>
                    Because there is no more facebook sign in I had to create a Microsoft&nbsp;account. Didn't find any ways to import my old contacts. Now when I'm trying to add a new contact or somebody adds me, then there is no contact request sent. Skype displays that it is
 sent, but neither I or the people I'm contacting receive&nbsp;a contact request.&nbsp;
