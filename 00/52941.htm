            <p>Hi GhettoBoy,</p>
<p><br />
How are you deleting the user accounts? Is it simply from C:\Dosument and settings or from Users and accounts under control panel? If you dont want to keep any data from those account, you can try delete profile from Click Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Control Panel
 -&gt; System -&gt; Advanced -&gt; User profile and select the profile and delete. Also check under "User accounts" in control panel to delete the usernames.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I just had this same problem on my Windows 10 computer and spend several hours researching different issues. I think I found a solution. It seems there is a problem between the d3d9.dll file inside the FSX install, and the actual directx that is installed
 with windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix, I just followed a hunch and renamed the&nbsp;d3d9.dll located in the games install directory. In my case I just appended an underscore to the extension like this: "d3d9.dll_"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your file is located here:&nbsp;<span>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X\d3d9.dll</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try renaming and let me know if it fixes your issue.

<p>This d3d9.dll most often comes up if you have SweetFX or ENBSeries modules installed.&nbsp; Possibly, by following TechGuru's fix by modifying the file extension (which effectively disables the .dll from working), may solve your problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you have the above-mentioned modules installed, the one using that .dll will no longer work.

<p>Chriso,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good point on the fact that renaming the dll file might break some add-on. Whats interesting though, is - I have a clean non-modified install of FSX:SE that i just downloaded off steam. The game would not launch! However, it used to work about 5-6 months
 ago. After renaming the file, it launched like a champ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what changed - but my guess it something to do with Microsoft's updates to Win10.</p>

<p>Hi TechGuru,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could well be that a Windows update made it inoperable;&nbsp; strange things occur with some of these updates.&nbsp; &nbsp;So, have you gone back to the Sim directory to see what the situation is with the d3d9.dll file?&nbsp; Is the old one still there or has a new one mysteriously
 come in?</p>

<p>Hi TechGuru,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's correct:&nbsp; the .dll is now inoperable and another one has not been substituted.&nbsp; &nbsp;You may find that if you install software that needs it, then the new .dll will appear and hopefully you won't get that error.&nbsp; You may have in time past installed software
 that has since been removed, thereby leaving the .dll behind and so causing you problems.</p>

<h2>            Advanced search by file creation date, text in files, etc.&#63;</h2>
                    XP used to provide the option of searching for text within files, or searching by date or folder, and so on. This feature helped me a lot. Does 8.1 have a similar advanced search? The basic search scans only the names of files and not the file's contents.
<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<h2>            Missing Programs and Features after formatting my hard drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi, today I've decided to format my hard drive and do a clean install of my Windows 10. In the past, after formatting my pc and updating windows I always used to have around 10/15 programs installed in the "Programs and Features" tab (Microsoft
 Visual C++, Vulcan Libraries and so on...).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this time around, after formatting my hard drive and updating windows, there are only 2 programs installed by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://imgur.com/a/nRg2J&nbsp; &nbsp;(screenshot)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did something change since the last time I've formattated my hard drive, is this normal now? Or is this some kind of an error and I should reinstall my windows again?</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

            That is normal, your Programs and Features is normally blank after formatting your hard disk. There are some exceptions in Windows 10 regarding the bundled apps though. So, you will see some preinstalled apps in Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features.

<h2>            How to launch tablet Pc touch input from command line</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>From versions&nbsp;of Windows 7 and above it is possible&nbsp;to automatically launch Touchscreen calibration using Tabcal.exe.</p>
<p>I was wondering if there is a similar&nbsp;command to directly launch touch input instead of following inf&nbsp;the steps below:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to Control Panel and search for "Touch".&nbsp;</li><li>Click "Tablet PC Settings"</li><li>Click "Setup..." to the right of "Configure your pen and touch displays"</li><li>Choose "Touch Input..."</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>With best regards,</p>

<p>What do I do? I've been playing Fallout 4 since it's release and about a week ago it began making this terrible angry buzzing sound, freezing and crashing the game. &nbsp;Yes, I have downloaded mods, but I tried uninstalling each of them and restarting. &nbsp;Even
 from an earlier pre-mod save it's still freezing,and crashing. HELP!!</p>

<p>This issue is happening to many people with Fallout 4, a beast of a game yet very buggy . Perform a hard reset, delete your saves locally, unplug for 30 seconds, keep gaming!

<p>The unfortunate consequence of buying a new console at launch. You gotta expect hardware failures with mass produced new tech. Buying a next gen console at launch is like gambling you will either win or lose.</p>

<p>It is an unfortunate expectation with anything that is mass produced. Not so much of how new or how long the tech has been out, it is the quality and build of the item. By the sounds of it quantity beat quality in the manufacturing process with the Xbox
 One. This seems to be a more common thing nowadays with companies cutting costs and using to cheaper materials and labour. So it has to be expected with alot of todays tech now matter how cheap or expensive there is a huge chance of failure.

<p>Wow 2 malfunctioning Xbones. That sucks. I can certainly understand your frustration. However it sounds like MS is doing what they can to make it right. Honestly fixing the issue is really all they HAVE to do. It's like going to a restaurant and your steak
 is not prepared correctly. They don't (and depending on the stink you make) have to comp your meal but bring you a steak prepared the way it was ordered. All I can say is they are in the business of making money. If they gave tons of freebees whenever something
 went wrong their products would cost just that much more. It gets paid for some how. Enjoy your repaired Xbones.</p>

<p>I thought they were giving out a free game or something to people that have faulty disk drives? I could of sworn I read that?</p>
<p>But to stick on the subject. I feel for you, a lot of us had the same problem with the 360 when it 1st came out,alot more then others. All I can tell you is move on you're review is gonna do no good. Microsoft is doing a good job on there own without the
 help of the public....Every game journalist out there is bashing the new Xbox1 cause of the Xbox1 only being able to run 720p while the SP4 can run a amazing 1020p......So everyone on the internet is up in arms over the subject.</p>

<p>Sorry I am living proof of a customer who was greatly disturbed about Xbox One and was greatly disappointed when I had to buy 3 Xbox One consoles in &nbsp;an a year-and-a-half span. on the third attempt my CD drive have gone out just after I had bought the Fallout
 4 game, I was finally fed up with it and called support.com and told them that they needed to replace it or else and I had seen it online on their website where they were willing to freely replace the CD drive if you were part of the batch that was bad. I
 was ready to put the paddle down and walk away from Xbox all together and I have been faithful with their console since day one in fact I loved it so much I removed myself from the PS console all together when the PS2 had first come out. Xbox One support had
 sent me a label to print out and asked if I could send it into them for them to have to take a look and to me and to expect that it might take a month or more to get it back if not guaranteed to be fixed at all. With everything that was going on I was shocked
 to see that in less than two weeks I had gotten my Xbox back one back and that the CD drive was working perfectly again taking my games. Now I don't want to put a Pity trip out there but I am of a man with many health problems and at times I am unable to remove
 myself from my dwelling I use Xbox to interact with my family who lives many miles away. So my Xbox is actually a form of link to the outside world and I would love to put it out there an awesome review that Xbox had come through and replace my CD drive completely
 free and added on a game as well. They have renewed my faith and I stand 100% again behind Microsoft. Thank you guys so much for everything you have done for this humble man. God bless you all.</p>

<p>Start with the lowest common denominator first. &nbsp;I would suggest that you get one console connected and working properly prior to introducing another. &nbsp;Say, start with the xbox one and make sure it is working properly then add the 360. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I did a quick search for your gateway and to be honest it is a very inexpensive device which is normally the case with ISP furnished gateways and you will likely have difficulty connecting multiple gaming consoles to this device and have them perform well.
 &nbsp;The ideal solution is a good cable modem and a good gaming router in two separate devices. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have access to your router configurations? &nbsp;If so please find out if UPnP is enabled. &nbsp;Have you attempted any port forwarding? &nbsp;If not don't do that yet if you have please delete it. &nbsp;Let's make sure that UPnP is enabled and then connect your XBOX
 One and see if it will work. &nbsp;Test it thoroughly and if is working well then proceed with adding the 360. &nbsp;If it is not working then get all the network stats on the One and post back the details so we can take a look and see if we can see anything obvious.
 &nbsp;Good Luck!</p>

<h2>            Unable to install Turbo Tax on Windows 7 Professional</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for all the help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After looking through some other posts, I am not seeing an answer for my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new pc with Windows 7 Professional installed.&nbsp; When I attempt to install Turbo Tax I am unsuccessful.&nbsp; I do not receive any error messages.&nbsp; A TT "window" pops up to show the progress of "preparing to install".&nbsp; It reaches 100%, saying it is ready
 to install.&nbsp; It then sits for a few seconds, then goes away.&nbsp; I tried several years of TT, both Home Corporations.&nbsp; No luck.&nbsp; I tried starting in Selective Start Mode, turning off Firewall and anti-virus...still no luck.&nbsp; I have tried to install from disc
 and download...no luck..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier today I checked MS Updates.&nbsp; It was running very slow but I am currently up to date.&nbsp; I am not sure what other details are needed.&nbsp; Thanks again for any and all help.</p>
<p>

            <p>OK, for any that need it I have found the answer after making a second call to Turbo Tax.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that for whatever reason TT software needs to be put into "Compatibility Mode".&nbsp; Whether the install is from a download or disc, the same issue was present.&nbsp; Below are the resolution(s)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">For Install From a Download:</span></p>
<p>Right-click the downloaded file and select Properties</p>
<p>Select Compatibility tab</p>
<p>Check box for "Run this program in compatibility mode"</p>
<p>Select appropriate OS</p>
<p>Select Apply, then OK</p>
<p>Install software</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">For Install From Disc</span></p>
<p>Right-click drive holding the software to be installed</p>

<h2>            Status code&#58; 807B01F4</h2>
                    
<p>so everytime i try to download anything on the game marketplace on my xbox, i always get this mssg<br />
'Xbox LIVE Marketplace<br />
Can't retrieve information from Xbox LIVE. Please try again later.<br />
Status code: 807B01F4'</p>
<p>ive cleared my cache so that isnt the problem.&nbsp; i tried downloading free stuff just to see if it'd work, thats when i noticed the problem. ive been able to download dlc's from the game on mass effect, directly from the game. theres an option where you can
 click on downloadable content on its main menu, so i did that for its free dlc's &amp; it worked fine, but ive never tried from the game marketplace before. &amp; when i did, well. yea..<br />
<br />
ive read some things saying clear your cache &amp; stuff like that? or create a new account..ummm. no. gonna have microsoft points to spend on my account &amp;&nbsp; achievements. so im not just going to create a new account because thats not the problem. a lot of people
 have had the same issue from searches too but i havent found many answers. my internet kind of sucks for live but i dont think thts the issue. because thru games i can buy dlc's &amp; they download fine as i said before. i can get on xbox live &amp; play games..occasionally,
 when my internet isnt being totally lame..hughsnet LIES. but anyway. i dont have xbox live gold anymore. just basic live. but i want to know if you can go on xbox.com &amp; purchase a game via micropoints, cash, whatever. &amp; if your xbox will download it next time
 you turn it on like it says it will on the marketplace.xbox.com website? or anything like that. because resident evil 4 is coming out for xbox this month &amp; its only available thru the game marketplace..&amp; being a huge RE fan...I NEED IT ON MY XBOX :)) cuz i
 dont like playing it on the wii so much..&amp; i dont even touch my ps2 anymore.either that, or if anyone has found a solution. ive talked to people thru the xpert support thing &amp; two of them have said that it is probly a billing issue? that my account may have
 a hold on it for whatever reason. said i guess xbox does that for no apparent reason from time to time. i dont have any sort of credit card or anything on my billing information. just my address. ive never had microsoft points before. ive only ever downloaded
 free content. but could that really be the issue? </p>
<p>would greatlyyy appreciate a helpful answerr</p>

            I have a PSX To USB adapter I bought at Radio Shack. The last time it worked was on Win98. I've tried it on WinME, XP Vista - It's not responding. To clarify, The light on the adapter is on, and if the analog button on the controller is pressed, it's on
 too. Yet none of the games I have that support controllers will detect it. The Control Panel doesn't see it, and the "Add a Device" option fails to find it as well. And yes, I have tested the controllers (I have a PS2) and they work for the games that support
 them. <br />
Since it's Plug and Play, why isn't it being detected? <br />
<br />
I'm on an HP2000 laptop with Win8 preinstalled. I've had a few updates, but I don't know if 8.1 is worth it.

            Shenan, I see this entry is a couple of years old, but maybe it will reach you!&nbsp; I received a new HP 110 computer from my son for my 89th birthday (3/21) with windows 8.1.&nbsp; He also gave me an external floppy drive so I could cull a bunch of floppies for
 important stuff.&nbsp; But it supposedly only works plug and play through XP.&nbsp; Any ideas as to where I can find W8 software to do the job?&nbsp;&nbsp; Lee Robinson

<h3> peaceenigma  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Pro &#40;32 bit OS&#41; Upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My processor is an Intel Core 2 Quad CPU Q8200 @ 2.33 GHz with 3 GB installed memory (RAM) working on a Windows 8.1 Pro 32 bit Operating system but with x 64 based processor capability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reserved my windows 10 for upgrade as my pc meets the system requirements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my&nbsp; questions are:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- How will I be able to upgrade my current windows 8.1 Pro (32 bit) to Windows 10 (64 bit)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- Does Windows 10 give you the option of selecting 32 bit or 64 bit before automatic upgrading?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3- Do I lose all my files held on my hard disk after the upgrade?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall, what do you recommend I should do because above all, I want a windows 10 but with 64 bit?
</p>
<p>

            <p>Compatibility is a critical consideration if you decide to switch to 64 bit Windows 10, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in Windows 10 64 bit, which means, your applications must
 be 32 bit only, no 16 bit installer or uninstallers. Also, if you decide to move to Windows 10 64 bit in the future, there is no upgrade path from 32 bit Windows, clean install only.</p>
<p><strong>Is my computer 64 bit capable?</strong></p>
<p>Before you can start the process to migrate to 64 bit Windows, you need to find out if your system is 64 bit capable. If you are already running a 32 bit version of Windows 8 or later&nbsp;on your system, you can find out by doing the following:</p>
<p>Press Windows key + X on your keyboard</p>
<p><a href="https://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/image3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2fimage_thumb3.png%3fw%3d396%26amp%3bh%3d383" height="383" width="396" /></a></p>

<p>Look under <em>System</em> &gt; <strong>System type:</strong></p>
<p>There it will list whether the processor is <strong>x64 based processor</strong> or not. In my case I have 64 bit capable processor. Once you have confirmed this, you can move on to the next step.</p>
<p>For Windows 7 and earlier releases:</p>
<p><a href="https://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/image5.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2fimage_thumb5.png%3fw%3d419%26amp%3bh%3d398" height="398" width="419" /></a></p>
<p>You can determine if your processor is 64 bit capable by using a <a href="http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em>Instructions </em>field, look for the instruction set called <strong>AMD64</strong> or
<strong>EM64T</strong>. If you see them, then your processor is 64 bit capable. If you are running a 32 bit version of Windows, whether Windows 8 or Windows 7, you need to consider carefully the steps to migrate from it to 64 bit Windows 8. Regardless of the
 ubiquity of 64 bit computing, key factors such as hardware and application compatibility remain a issue, especially for legacy systems.</p>
<p><strong>Please note, some older 64 bit processors might not be capable of running 64 bit Windows 10.
</strong></p>
<p>To install Windows&nbsp;10 on your PC, the processor (CPU) must support the following features: Physical Address Extension (PAE), NX, and SSE2. Most CPUs have support for these features, so if you receive this error, it is likely because the NX feature is not
 enabled on your system.</p>
<p>To resolve this error, follow manufacturer guidelines to enable NX (“No eXecute bit”), or the equivalent
<span>XD</span> (“eXecute Disabled”), feature within the BIOS settings. This feature is typically found in the Advanced or Security tabs within the BIOS settings, and can be referred to by a variety of
 names, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>No Execute Memory Protect</li><li>Execute Disabled Memory Protection</li><li>EDB (Execute Disabled Bit)</li><li>EVP (Enhanced Virus Protection)</li></ul>
<p>If the BIOS setting for the NX (XD, EDB, or EVP) support option is not available on your system, you may need to contact the manufacturer to update the BIOS. Note that some very old processors may not contain these features and
<strong>will be incompatible </strong>with Windows 10 64 bit. The solution is to use 32 bit Windows 10 even if your computer is currently running a 64 bit version of Windows or stick with that version or purchase a new device with Windows 10 64 bit.</p>
<p>A whitepaper has been published with further details about the PAE/NX/SSE2 requirement for Windows, error cases and scenarios that customers encounter when machines fail to meet the requirement, and what to do to install Windows&nbsp;10 on their PC’s.</p>
<p>You can download the whitepaper at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/hh975398.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>Having just a 64 bit capable processor is not the main go ahead for 64 bit Windows. What about other hardware such as your video card, audio device, printer and any other critical device or application you are using? Also, if you have less than 4 GBs of
 RAM, I strongly suggest you stick with 32 bit Windows&nbsp;10 or consider maxing out the installed RAM before you consider migrating and when I say maxing out, I mean 4 GBs or more.</p>
<p>The first thing to do is to create an inventory of both your hardware and software programs. After doing that, go to the manufacturers website and check if there are any 64 bit drivers available. The manufacturer might not have native 64 bit Windows&nbsp;10 drivers,
 but they just might have 64 bit Windows 7 and Vista drivers which might work. The reason why is Windows 8, Windows 7 and Vista all share the same driver model. Application compatibility remains critical, for instance, if you are running applications designed
 for Windows XP or apps that are not fully 32 bit, you might want to reconsider your decision. Applications that are 32 bit but might contain 16 bit code will not work with 64 bit Windows. So, you need to carefully think this true. If it ain’t broke, don’t
 try fixing it might just apply in this case.</p>
<p><strong>Backup your computer:<br />
</strong>Once you have gathered all the necessary prerequisites such as driver updates and have certified all your applications are compatible, you need to backup your personal data. There is no upgrade path from 32 bit versions of Windows to Windows&nbsp;10 64
 bit. Yes, that means you will have to reinstall all your drivers (64 bit native drivers) and applications. Some additional configuration might be required on your part.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yeah ive already upgraded my windows 8.1 pro to windows 10 pro through the automatic upgrade. So how do i download the windows 10 (64 bits) and do the clean install??? Do i need a product key??? Coz when i did the automatic upgrade it didn't give me any
 key but i suppose that when i'll do the clean install, it will surely ask me for a product key. So could u plz advise what should i do?? Thanks</p>

<p>They are aware of the issue, its not on Microsofts side, 2K made an announcement on their facebook page earlier today and said they are trying to figure out what has happened to the digital version of 2K15.... &nbsp;here is the link to their page and there is
 the last post that 2K made about it, 6 hours ago so lets hope they get this working soon...</p>

<p>Yeah, I almost did that but I stopped. &nbsp;2K is now saying not to do that since its not in the store to download again. &nbsp; Ive been checking on the news, &amp; as of right now there are no new updates from them on twitter or their facebook page. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>I tried to call their customer support only to be told by an automated service that they discontinued their help line last December, so all you can do is file a ticket complaint, which I have done. &nbsp;Like I told them in the ticket I just want some answers
 as to whats going on and what they are doing to fix it since its been over 24 hours with no real notifications from them.</p>

    <title>Windows 8 Boot Up Failure &#124; Startup repair&#47;Restore errors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xdarkomantis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Boot Up Failure &#124; Startup repair&#47;Restore errors &#124; 0 Win Installation identified</h2>
                    <p>I've been trying hard to restore my Dell Inspiron laptop after encountering a frozen screen two days. I had restarted the laptop only to find the Dell logo and a infinite looping circle after several minutes. I ran a diagnostics test on the laptop to find
 out that the Hard Drive encountered an error:<br />
Hard Drive 0<br />
Error code: 2000-0142<br />
<br />
I went to the Microsoft site to get a 8.1 installation image onto my USB. After booting it from the USB, I clicked on repair, did a startup repair to which the repair had failed. I went to do a System restore next and it encountered an error "system restore
 failed to extract the file (c:/windows/bootstrap.dat) from the restore point". I used the command prompt next. Looking at some guides, I came across a command code to scan the disk to which the scan found bad sectors on the HDD. So I tried to see if using
 chkdsk and chkdsk /r would work. I don't know if it worked or not since the startup screen was still in infinite loop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to see if I possibly get the laptop to fix the boot files by following a guide that uses bootrec. I was unsure what I was doing until I stumbled upon this thread: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-windows_install/total-identified-windows-installations-0/52359f87-de4a-41dc-b0c3-cc275e1d9fbf?page=1&amp;tm=1437671784233<br />
<br />
From there, I found that in the prompt, bootrec, it said that I have 0 windows installations identified. I tried seeing if I could do something usin the microsoft thread but I stumbled after hitting step 5 in Vijay B's post. The command:<br />
attrib c:\boot\bcd -h -r -s<br />
<br />
It says "Path not found - C:\boot". Vijay B never offered any help towards posters who replied to him who ran into that problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do? I don't have a Windows 8.1 DVD/CD. But I can access safe mode and recovery mode using the Installation image on my USB. I'm not in a position to simply send my laptop to Dell to replace the HDD since I'm broke right now and my warranty
 ran out(I've had this laptop for 1 year and 2 months). So far all my data on HDD is there in safe mode so I'm guessing that corruption or bad sector is the problem...</p>

            <p>Sure you can update (subject to hardware/software compatibility). But I doubt that your problems are related to Vista (the OS).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How about you tell us...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What browser you are using?</p>
<p>Whether you still have problems if you use an alternate browser?</p>
<p>What the problems are? Specific error messages or description of symptoms.</p>
<p>Specific URLs that are causing you problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe someone will then reply and help get your "Vista" browsing satisfactorily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to research compatibility...</p>

            <p>Hello Sharon B 06,</p>
<p>
</p><p>More information is needed before anyone can begin to help you with your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Tricky has pointed out in his post upgrading to another version of Windows may not solve your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try downloading another web browser - such as Firefox or Google Chrome and see if you still get the same issues. Your ISP may be having routing problems or, for that matter, the relevant web pages that you are visiting may be experiencing problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try to give as much information as you can so that someone can help you.</p>

            <p>Hello Sharon,</p>
<p>if your problem is loading webpages then your issue is likely your internet browser you can download a new browser such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox as the latest version of Internet Explorer Windows Vista supports is 9 and is starting to become obsolete
 if you want a newer version of Internet Explorer you can upgrade to Windows 7 or 8 which are more stable and secure with enhanced features&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To Download the latest version of Google Chrome click on this link and click the Download Chrome button</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/</a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To Download the latest version of Mozilla Firefox click this link and click the Firefox Free Download button</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/</a></p>

            <p>If you haven't already downloaded an alternate browser then by all means do. If you want to take a pragmatic approach, this might well be all you need to do to browse happily again, especially if you don't import any settings from an existing browser.</p>

<h2>            I got a achievement I didn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t earn. Now what&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>A few weeks ago I was playing zombies on Call of Duty: World at War. Once the game started shortly after, I got a achievement saying I unlocked all the death cards. I didn't earn it, I was just playing a game of zombies. I love to collect gamerscore, and
 I have heard of people having their gamerscore reset to 0 for modded achievements. Is the achievement I got modded? Will I be in trouble or have my gamerscore reset? Should I create a new account? Somebody help please.</p>

<p>A friend of mine was playing Skate 3 when it came out, when he got the first achievement he took a look on the achievements page via the centre button and discovered he had all the achievements unlocked. Sometimes its just a glitch. it happens. as long as
 you havent modded anything you should be fine</p>

<p>A few moments after the game started, some crazy cheat menu popped up on my screen in the middle of the game. while I tried to exit out, it gave me the achievement. The whole game of zombies was riddled with modded content.</p>

<p>As the Death Cards must be collected in Campaign (Solo) in order to unlock that achievement and you've unlocked it whilst playing Zombies. The only possibilities are that it glitched and unlocked incorrectly or there was a modder in your lobby.</p>
<p>Considering the history of modders in the CoD games I would expect the latter to be the case. As long as you haven't personally modded/hacked/unlocked anything then no action should be taken &nbsp;against your account.</p>

<p>The game was completely hacked, and even though I left shortly after, achievements are permanent. I love playing xbox, and collecting gamerscore, and I've earned many achievements on my account legit. I never cheat, or do anything I'm not supposed too. I
 even recently put a year membership on my account. I feel as if I don't want to play on my account, because what's the point if I lose all my gamerscore in the future for something I didn't do.</p>

<p>As has already been stated as long as you didn't do the modding yourself there won't be any issues. You can always report any modders you do encounter to Microsoft (all the options are available from the recent players list).</p>
<p>I'm unsure about the specifics for WaW but there may also be a function that will allow you to report users to Treyarch/Activision</p>

<p>Like everyone else has said, it is likely a modder was in the same game as you and therefore unlocked the achievement. I wouldn't worry though because if you've not cheated in anyway, action won't be taken against you, only against the modders/cheaters.
 The Xbox/Microsoft team look into matters and make sure evidence is solid before taking action, so you'll be alright.</p>

    <title>skype.com redirect to skype.gmw.cn - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sakib52  say:</h3>
<h2>            skype.com redirect to skype.gmw.cn</h2>
                    <p>When I try to visit skype, it always redirect to the chinese website. I'm from Bangladesh and I don't see any reason why it would get redirected to the chinese website. This has been happening for over 6 months. The last time I bypassed the issue by downloading
 directly from one of the links provided in another support question to this same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this is getting on my nerve right now. They did not fix this issue for over 6 months. Every other website can detect my location based on my ip perfectly except for skype. For a company as large as skype, I don't understand how this is acceptable. If
 you search on google, you'll find countless other people are facing the exact issue. The solution: download skype from link provided which is unacceptable in my opinion. The skype is going on a downward spiral with every updates it's releasing. The old features
 that are vital are no longer maintained. The interface just sucks and on top of that even their website do not work. What is going on with Skype?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for my rambling, but think about how unprofessional skype has been that such an issue can persist over 6 months.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<p>- skype website goes to chinese version.</p>
<p>- The issue is persisting for over 6 months.</p>
<p>- I thinks Skype is neglecting their user.</p>
