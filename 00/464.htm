<h2>            Why can&#39;t I view full photo albums on Realtor.com, Trulia.com or Homes.com&#63; I can only see the listings 1st picture.</h2>
                    <p>I never had this problem with my old laptop.&nbsp; My FIL just handed down his laptop since our other one was a dinosaur. This Gateway W350A is way different from my Toshiba.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I go to any real estate site i.e. Realtor.com, Trulia.com, Homes.com I can only view the 1st picture of each listing. The listings that say they have more photos available to view don't allow me to click each individual picture to view them at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be sure to reply with a barney style simple to follow instructions since I'm not a computer guru.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've got this same issue occurring on a single machine, but have the service configured without incident on a number of others. &nbsp;Even the drastic step of removing the user profile entirely and adding it back fresh didn't resolve the problem. &nbsp;I've tried
 the various things mentioned above all to no avail. &nbsp;I'm running a fully up to date client 17.3.6390.0509 on Windows 10 Build 14342.rs1 release 160505-1708. &nbsp;I have my primary desktop on that same build and have no issues.</p>

<p>Hi Jay,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further investigate the issue, I'd like to collect some information:</p>
<p>1. Does the issue happen to any Office 365 accounts on this PC?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Is this the first time you run OneDrive for Business client? Or, have you been using OneDrive for Business for some time?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Please provide a related screenshot about the error.</p>
<p>To upload screenshots, you can click <strong>Use rich formatting</strong> in the forum and then click the icon of
<strong>Insert/Edit Media</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Please also send your tenant information via Private Message (PM).</p>
<p>https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>jim,</p>
<p>i've responded to your private message, and will answer the other questions here. &nbsp;this is not the first time i've used the onedrive client and in fact it's the windows 10 native client, and not the onedrive for business client that's part of office 2016.
 &nbsp;this particular install was one that had been working and suddenly stopped. &nbsp;none of my other installs mac or pc showed any issue.</p>
<p>here's what i actually see for the install in question. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=177e0f2b-88e7-4da2-9c84-d520a9043bcb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d177e0f2b-88e7-4da2-9c84-d520a9043bcb" /></a></p>
<p>as the machine in question wasn't a primary machine, i even went as far as to delete the user profile and start fresh all to no avail. then this morning as others have noted with no explanation, the same process of providing my credentials, (adfs and two
 factor) led to the expected completion. &nbsp;i'd prefer to get more answers rather than simply considering this resolved, because i support a number of users, and i need to have an understanding of the underlying issues should it occur elsewhere.</p>
<p>regards,</p>

<p>Hi Jay,</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification and glad to hear the issue has disappeared.</p>
<p>Here are some suggestions for your concerns:<br />
1. You may check if other PCs are not running Windows 10 OneDrive native client.<br />
2. It seems the issue is not likely due to ADFS/MFA because it happen to multiple accounts/tenants.<br />
3. If you encounter the error again, you can uninstall the Windows 10 OneDrive native client:<br />
&nbsp;a. Log in your system as Administrator &gt; open command prompt &gt; run taskkill /f /im OneDrive.exe<br />
&nbsp;b. run %SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall to uninstall OneDrive - For 32-bit Windows, replace syswow64 to system32.</p>
<p>Then install the OneDrive for Business client that's part of Office 2016 to have a try, or download it via the link below:<br />
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=248256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=248256</a></p>
<p>In&nbsp;conclusion, you may check if the issue only happen to the specific client or a specific version.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Jim</p>

<p>Jim, &nbsp;That's really my concern. &nbsp;Your suggestion isn't going to help because my primary desktop is running exactly the same versions of Windows and OneDrive and it didn't happen there, so it would not appear to be version related. &nbsp;Also I will note that
 I'd taken the steps mentioned in step 3. to no avail. &nbsp;Finally, I do not want to run the OneDrive for Business client, as it does not offer the selective sync options and that's a critical must have for my use.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Jay,</p>
<p>Thanks for the updates. Suppose the issue persists, we can escalate it to the related team for further investigation as we have done all basic troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>However, as the issue is now disappeared, we cannot gather the related information to proceed. Given this situation, next time if you got the error, you can&nbsp;contact us to escalate it. Your&nbsp;understanding is&nbsp;much&nbsp;appreciated.</p>

<h3> nyameje  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 Show a second time zone daylight savings&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Outlook 2010 ver. 14.0.4760.1000 (32-bit)<br />
Windows 7 Enterprise x64<br />
Exchange 2007 SP1</p>
<p>When displaying two time zones on Calendar, second time zone is one hour off and newly created appointments are scheduled one hour later in the second time zone.&nbsp;<strong>Windows 7 accurately displays time difference in the 2 time zones, however Outlook does
 not.</strong></p>
<p>In "Show a second time zone" settings are:<br />
Time zone: (UTC+02:00) Helsinki, Kyiv, Riga, Sofia, Tallinn, Vilnius<br />
Second time zone: (UTC-6:00) Central Time (US &amp; Canada)</p>
<p>This smells like a daylight savings update problem, but the system is fully updated, including all DST daylight savings time updates.&nbsp; Also, Outlook 2007 did not exhibit this problem. (Office 2010 RTM recently replaced 2007 on this computer.)&nbsp; Also, for
 what it's worth, I travel globally frequently, have been successfully using Outlook to manage appointment times, etc.&nbsp;for many years.</p>
<p>Steps to reproduce:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set Windows time zone to (UTC+02:00) Helsinki, Kyiv, Riga, Sofia, Tallinn, Vilnius, and check (enable) the option Automatically adjust for daylight savings</li><li>In Outlook (2010) Options, Calendar options, enable Show a second time zone and select (UTC -06:00) Central Time (US &amp; Canada)</li><li>Inspect the vertical time "axis" on left side of Calendar UI.&nbsp; <strong>Note that Central Time is shifted or inaccurate one hour.</strong></li></ol>

<p>I too had the same issue with second timezone which was set to EST. I use Outlook 2010 and it was showing incorrect time for EST.</p>
<p>Then, I found the time zone update tool for outlook. Ran the tool and the time zone issue is fixed.</p>
<p>You can download the tool using the following link.</p>

<p>Hi mmm0808,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you trying to search using any third party toolbar?</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which version of Internet Explorer do you use?</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the exact error message that you receive when you are trying to install Internet Explorer 8?</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you mean by the file that you are referring to: file c:\$secure run chk dsk utility wusa.exe?</p>
<p><br />
I would suggest you to use the built in toolbar of the Internet Explorer and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>Disable the third party toolbar if installed any.</p>

            A processor overclock, that's awesome.<br />
If the arm11 core in all the Symbian phones is the same, in theory it would be possible to overclock older S^3 devices as well.<br />
To Nokia: Would this be possible or is there too much of a difference?

<p>Pay attention to the bold words.That could mean the update is planned also for "other" phones:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It’s arrived on the Nokia 808 PureView, and will also be made available for new production and current users of Nokia 603, 700 and 701 smartphones in coming months. For
<strong>other </strong>latest Symbian devices, we have just made Nokia Belle available, and now already more than 1 million downloads have taken place!</p>
<p>So, if you own<strong> one of the smartphones </strong>in question, <strong>or
</strong>are planning to get either Nokia 603, 700, 701 or the new Nokia 808 PureVision having looked at the delicious images that have already appeared, what are the specifics?</p>
<p>First of all, the entertainment experience is boosted. Dolby ® Headphone and Dolby ® Digital Plus transform the playback of music and movies and games into a personal surround sound experience like no other. With Nokia Belle Feature Pack 1, you can access
 a world of premium entertainment."</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>to clarify the point if the Nokia Belle Featurepack 1 will be made available for N8, C7, E7, X7, E6,&nbsp;C6-01 and Nokia 500, here is the official statement from our Nokia Communications team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>This Nokia Belle Feature Pack has been tailored and will be made available for Nokia 603, Nokia 700, and Nokia 701. Due to hardware requirements and specifications, the Nokia Belle Feature Pack 1 will not be made available to other Symbian devices.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the question if there are future updates to Symbian phones, like N8, C7, E7, E6, X7,&nbsp;C6-01, Nokia 500:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>We regularly deliver software updates to all Nokia phones to give our consumers both performance improvements as well as additional features. We are committed to continue software support for Symbian through 2016.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Will belle feature pack one increase processor speed 1 ghz to 1.3 ghz.</p>
<p>Yesterday in nokia conversation say that only 700 and 701 get increase processor speed 1 ghz to 1.3. finally what about 603, the 603 will increase speed.<i>😃</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(NOKIA CONVERSATION)</p>
<p>Also good news for Nokia 700 and 701, your handset will be faster and more responsive. It’s not so often that software update delivers an increase in processor speed, but with Nokia Belle Feature Pack 1 the processor speed of your handset will go from 1GHz
 to 1.3GHz.</p>

<p>Hi alb3530_</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FP1 is something like a major update for native Belle devices because it includes an overclock and I think what we, Symbian^3 users upgraded to Belle, really need is only to complete our Belle release; this means Nokia gives us the missing widgets, restores
 the missing functionalities and takes care of all the bugs with Belle posted in this forum. It would be nice, though, that Nokia gives us also that HTML5 browser and gives to N8 users that camera software, too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really don't think we need or even can handle an overclock in our Symbian^3 native devices because battery drain and overheating, among other bugs this should cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers!!!</p>

            I am fully disappointed in nokia if the symbian belle FP1 will not be treated in the nokia E6 an new phone. Then nokia are not doing any good in trying 2compet wit other OS like Andriod or iOS. For the make update for all there phones up to standard. Not
 like nokia doing half and leaving the rest behind to surfer. That bad nokia change is all we need in all our phones like the nokia E6.

<h2>            Lumia 950 XL - How do I get a refund from Microsoft&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Good Day,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm from Cape Town, South Africa. When I first laid eyes on the Lumia 950XL I was using a Samsung S4 mini, I was blown away by all the sales talk which made me believe in the Microsoft mobile adventure again so I started to save up for months to be able
 to afford the&nbsp;great and powerful Lumia 950xl flagship phone. It took me 6months and a lot of determination to keep on saving for my share in the mobile Microsoft space. Finally when I had the money I bought a 950XL from the microsoft store. The whole experience
 was amazing, from ordering it and receiving it and setting it up the first time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6months later the phone started giving issues with wireless LAN, it would break the router's connection completely leaving the router without internet and everyone else connected to it also, I worked with many suggested solutions, hard and soft&nbsp;reset the
 phone multiple times. After this I didn't pay much attention to it, I just worked around it as far as I could. Now the phone keeps on rebooting when it's not charging, toggling the bluetooth, location and mobile data&nbsp;makes the phone crash. Phone crashes during
 phone calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>LOL, the last thing I saw&nbsp;on my Lumia was a green overlaid color smudge screen and a very loud drilling sound, like the sound of a over heated fan. The phone is now unable to boot, not even the hard reset combination works. My phone is completely dead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have the money to just buy a new phone, can someone please tell me how do I return my device for a refund.
</p>

            <p>Hi &nbsp;LOLoubser44,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very unfortunate to hear that. I am facing exactly same symptoms on my 15 month old lumia 950 XL.</p>
<p>I came across your post while searching this problem on google.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>By any chance, were you able to resolve the issue and what was the outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw a similar post&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/frequent-rebooting-and-a-green-screen/7c367078-cc29-476e-a22b-dd82849bea1f">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/frequent-rebooting-and-a-green-screen/7c367078-cc29-476e-a22b-dd82849bea1f</a>&nbsp;where
 replacing the battery resolved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything - removing sd card, hard-reset several times, windows recovery tooll, Going to Microsoft store helpdesk. Those guys seem so dumb they didn't even try to troubleshoot and diagnose what's the issue is and told me upfront they can't
 do anything. The only thing they could say is - Do you have extended warranty. Even if I don't have, can't they tell me whats wrong with my phone what part is causing the issue so that it could be repaired/replaced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent 700 USD and I advocated this phone a lot in my friend circle. I won't but windows phone ever ever again. Microsoft doesn't even care. Fanboys like me are fools and Microsoft really doesn't care at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your reply would be useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

            <p>I found a solution!</p>
<p>first of all accept the fact that you have made the wrong move and start saving for another Mobile device. I bought an Iphone 7 now and every single issue just magically disappeared, it exceeds all of my expectations every time I use it, this is true integrity.
 Every time I had to do something on my Lumia I start stressing, I never felt comfortable doing anything on the Lumia, except the camera was great. I know Im not comparing apples with apples here, but why the expensive price tag on the Lumia then?? Its clearly
 not on the same level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I wish you all the best luck with your Lumia and make sure you have that extended warranty, for Microsoft I can only imagine, this a great way to make even more money from a mistake.&nbsp;</p>

            Dear BevFiori,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />Because Outlook.com is a free service, there is an advertisement pane. You will need to upgrade to Office 365 and then it will be removed or if you are using Windows 10 you can actually use free email client and you will not see advertisements.
<br />
<br />If you want to add your account to Windows 10 Mail app you can use tips in this article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up-email-in-the-mail-app-for-windows-10-7ff79e8b-439b-4b47-8ff9-3f9a33166c60" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up...</a> 
<br />
<br />After you will add your account, click on it, in the Manage accounts ( on the left ) select your account, pop up will appear and you will be able to Change mailbox sync settings, In download new content please select "as items arrive", in Download emails from "any time"
<br />
<br />If you are using other OS, you can search for other free email clients.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps.

<br />If you are using other OS, you can look for free email client that will work with your OS.
<br />
<br />If you will decide to move to another account I would advise you to export a mailbox <a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/export-mailbox-and-delete-search-history-in-outlook-com-be5335ea-5f86-41ba-892e-de9e4cb16b87" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/export...</a>, so you will have a copy of your emails.

    <title>Office 2013 Outlook - Duplicate Personal Folder with semi-duplicated - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> moiseve  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2013 Outlook - Duplicate Personal Folder with semi-duplicated data.</h2>
                    <p>A few years ago while still using Office 2007 my computer crashed. I bought a new one and when the Outlook data was loaded into the new computer I ended up with a duplicate file “Personal Folders – Duplicate” that seemed to have more current data than the
 “Personal Folders”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I was very pressed for time, I just went ahead and used “Personal Folder – Duplicate” for all my entries in the Contacts, Inbox, Tasks (plus a half-dozen other email accounts) etc., - all with multiple sub-folders and sub-sub-folders, ect., under those.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently I upgraded to Office 2013 and I still use the “Personal Folders – Duplicate”. But now I have a “Personal Folders” (still with outdated info) and an “Outlook Data File” (with just slightly outdated info). I am not quite sure when the Outlook Data
 File showed up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About 5 years ago we tried to set up a synchronization of Outlook between my tower (primary) and laptop which may have been the caused for some of the duplication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyhow, I would like to know which folder set I should be using: Personal Folders or Outlook Data File?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also what is the best way to move everything from my "Personal Folder – Duplicate" folder to the one I should be using, and not lose any data or end up with duplicates?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, as I have a very elaborate set of sub folders, I very much need to have them (and the files in them) and the column headings moved/copied intact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And how do I delete the unwanted “Personal Folder – Duplicate”, etc., without messing anything up?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the best sequence for deleting and moving/copying?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outlook 2013 seems to be very unstable and I would like to eliminate the duplicate folders/files to see if it stabilizes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate any assistance you can provide. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Not sure where "Outlook 2013 seems to be very unstable" suddenly got added to the mix but that aside, answer to your question depends completely on what you currently have configured along with what you ultimately want to end up with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To start, you need to know what data file is associated with what email account - while the following article has a title related to copying files etc - the description may help in understanding on what you currently have....</p>

<p>
</p><p>Then it's a question of coming to grips with what you actually want to end up at the end of&nbsp;day in terms of your data. What you (can?) get rid of depends on your configuration - what you copy from one folder to another depends on which data set you want
 to keep etc etc. Would be impossible for anyone to provide a definitive answer without knowing all the salient details.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Assuming that this is about a PST file associated with a POP3 account and that the "Personal Folders" data file is not associated with any other email account then without knowing anything else</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - Reality is that Outlook doesn't care what you use - it will utilize the data file that has been associated with the email account</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Outlook wouldn't have created a PST file with the name &lt;Personal Folders – Duplicate&gt; - that's something that would have been done manually</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - If the data file named &lt;Personal Folders&gt; is no longer being used by anything - just delete it from the profile as long as you're sure there is nothing left in there that you want. Even then, deleting the PST file from the profile does not delete the
 file from your system should you ever decide that you need to go back to it for some reason</p>
<p>
</p><p>#4 - Just rename the &lt;Personal Folders - Duplicate&gt; to &lt;Personal Folders&gt; (or any other name - makes no difference)</p>
<p>- right-click on the &lt;root&gt; of the &lt;Personal Folders - Duplicate&gt; folder tree --&gt; Data File properties --&gt; click on Advanced button --&gt; change the value in the &lt;Name&gt; field</p>

<p>
</p><p>Not sure what you mean by "system won't let them deleted" - specifically whether you are referring to folders or the PST file itself. For sake of this response - assuming you are referring to the PST file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not being able to delete it from the profile means that it's set as the default data file for the profile which contains the default contact &amp; calendar folders. If that's the case, then it's simply a matter of setting the default data file to the &lt;Personal
 Folders - Duplicate&gt; PST file. If the Contact/Calendar folders are &lt;empty&gt; in the PST file designated as the default for the profile, that also means that you have always explicitly selected the contact/calendar folder (where those items exist) before creating
 any of those items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an aside - if you're referring to deleting a PST file that has been removed from the Outlook, then the likely issue is that you haven't closed Outlook to release the file lock.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Not sure what you mean by "put everything back to normal" - already addressed how to delete the empty PST Personal folders if it's designated as the default file for the profile</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;"If that's the case, then it's simply a matter of setting the default data file to the &lt;Personal Folders - Duplicate&gt; PST file.&gt;"</p>
<p>
</p><p>and see item #4 of a previous post on how to rename the PST file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can certainly start over again by creating a new profile AND ensuring that you use your existing data for the POP account(s) now contained in the &lt;Personal Folders - Duplicate&gt; but personally, from everything you've described so far, probably a needless
 waste of time. Your current Outlook profile didn't get into its current state without some manual actions on your part.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, if you do decide to start with a new profile - you may find the following info of some interest in terms of what gets created when based on the sequence of the addition of your email accounts. If you don't use PST file currently named &lt;Personal
 Folders - Duplicate&gt; - you'll have the added exercise of moving all the data from it to the appropriate folders - so technically, just starting over&nbsp;wouldn't result in everything being put "back to normal" without the additional step(s).</p>

<p>
</p><p>Like I've said previously, not clear on what steps you followed to get to your current configuration which additionally included the comment "Outlook 2013 seems to be very unstable" - either I'm missing something in your description or there is info that
 hasn't been included but based purely on what has been mentioned vis-a-vis the two PST files (&lt;Personal Folders&gt; &amp; &lt;Personal Folders - Duplicate&gt;) That in and of itself wouldn't warrant "starting over" but may mean making some simple changes to ensure that
 your POP accounts point to the data file you want to use. </p>

            A .jad file is really a simple text file (Java Application Description). Find the .jar file which containst the actual application (or fix the pointer or web server where the .jar files is and where the .jad file points to).<br />
<br />
Did you try, as you have an N90, to get and install the keyboard driver for S60 2nd Edition. An S60 3rd Edition version does not work.

<h2>            Setting Up GoDaddy email account on Microsoft Outlook 2013 on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I just signed up with GoDaddy on a web hosting plan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set up an email account on GoDaddy in the C-Panel. The email works since I am able to send and receive emails from Webmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to set up the account in Outlook 2013 running on Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go through the process outlined by GoDaddy here&nbsp;http://www.emailwizard.co/outlook-2013-cpanel.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook is able to log in to the mail server but when it tries to send a test mail, it times out. So I cannot setup my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted GoDaddy support and they said I am doing everything right and it might be an Outlook issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have other email accounts with another service provider on Outlook and it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what is going on here with GoDaddy and Outlook. Can anyone help?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to follow Steve's&nbsp;recommendation re seeking assistance from MSE Support.&nbsp; You also&nbsp;should be concerned how you picked up the infection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I saw this exploit listed in Task Manager two days ago after I received a popup wanting to scan my computer because "Windows Security has seen a problem"&nbsp;(a la fake antivirus program) after I "clicked" on a Google link.&nbsp; I shut down the window in Task Manager
 without clicking the popup and followed Steve's suggestions (as listed below) and that may have saved me from being infected.&nbsp; Subsequent scans with MSE and MBytes were negative so I dodged whatever it was selling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Here's a comprehensive list of suggestions on handling such "attacks" by Stephen Boots, one of the forum moderators:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>"Unfortunately, these type of malware attacks are difficult to keep up with because they trick you into letting them install. They usually come
 from an infected web site, and usually through an advertisement. You get a pop-up from the infection and you click&nbsp;it to close the pop-up - which allows the infection to install.&nbsp; They can also be delivered in a "drive-by" fashion with no action needed by
 the user due to the system being unpatched, no matter what security software is running.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you encounter one of these fake virus pop-ups while browsing, immediately do the following:<br />
<br />
-Do not touch any browser window to close it or browse further.<br />
-Immediately press Ctrl-Alt-Del (Ctrl-Shift-Esc in Vista or Win 7) and bring up Task Manager and forcibly end all instances of iexplore.exe, if using Internet Explorer, or the executable for&nbsp;the browser you are using.<br />
--or--<br />
-Go to Start/Shut Down and restart the PC without touching any browser windows.<br />
-If you used task manager to close browser instances, reboot the machine.<br />
-Then go to Control Panel/Internet Options and delete all temporary Internet Files and cookies. If you are using an alternate web browser, open the browser settings to do the same - delete the local cached files and cookies.<br />
-Perform a full scan with MSE.<br />
<br />
The above steps should prevent the infection from taking hold.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Besides MSE, the following recommendations will assist in protecting the PC from infection:
</span></p>
<p><span>-Make sure that the Windows Firewall is enabled.
</span></p>
<p><span>-Make sure that all important/critical updates, including service packs for the operating system and programs are installed from Microsoft Update
 (Windows Update). </span></p>
<p><span>-Make sure Internet Explorer is at version 8 and updated with all patches.
</span></p>
<p><span>-In Internet Explorer 8, use the SmartScreen Filter.
</span></p>
<p><span>-Make sure that IE Internet Security settings are at least set to medium-high (default).
</span></p>
<p><span>-Enable the pop-up blocker in IE.
</span></p>
<p><span>-On Vista and Windows 7 make sure thatUser Account Control (UAC) ON&nbsp; and not running with elevated privileges.
</span></p>
<p><span>-Make sure that Windows Automatic Updates are set to at least notify, but the preferred setting is to download and install automatically. If you
 update manually, be sure to update as soon as possible after being notified of available updates.
</span></p>
<p><span>-<u>Make sure that installed applications, especially Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Flash, and Java are at their latest versions. Many vendors are regularly
 updating and patching for security holes.</u> </span></p>
<p><span>-Never click through links from unknown sources and use caution even if they are from a "trusted" source.
</span></p>
<p><span>-Never open unsolicited email attachments.
</span></p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>Thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>It is not feasible to add an Office 365 Home subscription to an Office 365 for Business subscription.</p>
<p>If you want the user to have Exchange services and have access to the shared documents, you should take the following steps:</p>

<h2>            Regarding Windows 10 Insider Build 17133 and AMD Ryzen Master Program latest version</h2>
                    Hello to all, I have noticed recently that Whenever I attempt to run AMD Ryzen Master Program latest version it GSODs me with a System Service Exception due to&nbsp;AMDRyzenMasterDriver.sys..&nbsp; I have recently tried the uninstall and reinstall and that did no
 good but would still install anyways as well but still won't load the program without a GSOD..&nbsp; Also I have tried sfc /scannow and DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth and that did not find any corruption at all..&nbsp; I have tried a chkdsk and no errors
 on the hard drive exist either....&nbsp; About the only other thing that I have thought of and did not do yet is a Clean Reinstall of this insider preview build..&nbsp; So, Any suggestions besides that I would most appreciate,&nbsp; Thanks for listening and have a great
 day ahead as well.

<p>Thanks for quick reply and all, Just to let you know what I am considering doing as of now, I think a clean reinstall might solve the problem so I will let you all know of my results afterwards..&nbsp; Anyways, Thanks again for the suggestion but I did try hardware
 and devices troubleshooter and I basically did not find anything wrong and also I did look this morning on amd's website for a chipset driver update and there was none as of this date as I already have installed 18.10b chipset driver version. So, Have a great
 day ahead and like I said I will definitely let you know of my results as soon as possible..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello to all, An update on the situation at hand here,&nbsp; I just test the core isolation option and that seems to be the cause for the gsod system service exception due to amdryzenmasterdriver.sys on load of the AMD Ryzen Master Program..&nbsp; Interesting isn't
 it?&nbsp; Well Anyways, Thanks for listening and your attempt at helping me as I appreciate it very much..</p>

    <title>Font duplication in Office 2016 for MAC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrew pickering brook  say:</h3>
<h2>            Font duplication in Office 2016 for MAC</h2>
                    <p>I have just found that Microsoft in its wisdom has decided not to use the standard fonts localities for Mac OS but has decided to store the fonts for Office elsewhere, but even better, has decided to duplicate the fonts for each Office application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each 2016 Office for Mac application stores its fonts in the application package, i.e. Microsoft Excel.app sores its fonts in Contents &gt; Resources &gt; Fonts, as do all of the Office applications with each application having its own copy of the fonts it needs.
 Therefore, Word has 485.7 MB, Excel 483.7 MB, OneNote 289.1 MB, OutLook 256.8 MB and PowerPoint 483.7 MB - Totalling a huge 1,999 MB of disk space. If Office shared the fonts between the Office applications this would be reduced to ~25% of the size (basically
 Word has a copy of all of the fonts used by all other Office applications). On my system, the HD &gt; Library &gt; Fonts also contains some duplication of the fonts in Word. If the fonts for Office were stored in the standard Font location for MAC OS the total font
 size, outside of the system fonts, would be further reduced in duplicated font space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does Microsoft do this? Even if there is some copyright or proprietary ownership issue with the fonts, at least share the fonts for the whole Office suite instead of this inefficient duplication and waste of disk space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is poor programming and software design. Or am I missing something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, disk space has become cheeper and cheeper and disk sizes have become huge, but we appear to need them when MS Office 2016 for MAC appears to waste at least 1.5 GB of it in duplicated fonts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A disgruntled user.</p>

            Jim, if this is the case why do other applications like Open Office, LibreOffice, Pages etc not require font duplication?

<p>They may not be in compliance with Apple's sandboxing rules. In order to be able to be delivered via the Apple App store, an app must be compliant with sandboxing rules. Pages is an Apple app, so Apple automatically trusts it.
</p>
<p>

<p>There must be a way for all of the Office apps to share the same set of fonts instead of duplicating for each application. Was that not the reason for the application support folder in the libraries folder? Can't all of the Office applications be placed
 in a single Office container?</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this stage, as far as I can see, MS is not distributing Office through the App Store and for a company the size of MS I don't see the advantage to them. Many software developers appear to be giving up on the app store and offering their software directly
 from their website and offering more in their software than the version being offered on the AS. At the moment the only MS products I can see on the AS are OneNote, Remote Desktop, Band Sync and OneDrive.</p>

<p>Microsoft tries to follow Apple's rules. I think Microsoft had a hope of distributing Office for Mac in the App store. OneNote seems to be the trial balloon, as the same app is available as a stand-alone from the Mac App store and with Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apple's sandboxing scheme has been a disaster for add-ins and extensibility in Microsoft Office. If Apple wanted to wreck Microsoft Office (and other apps),&nbsp; I think Sandboxing was an excellent way to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I worked at Microsoft and saw how much sandboxing cost Microsoft, office developers and customers, I would have simply said, "Sorry, no." To me, the benefit is infinitesimal and the cost is outrageous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many factors that influence whether or not Microsoft will eventually use the Mac App store. Payments to Apple is certainly a major factor, but there are technical issues, too. There's also this "make everything work like a phone or mobile app"
 disease that's infested Apple, Microsoft and Google for more than a decade pushing toward using the App store. Anyway - so much for my soapbox.</p>

            Thanks Jim. Hope MS see sense and stay away from the App Store, it has worked fine in the past and works fine for other software producers and there appears to be some indication of some producers leaving or at least not supporting the AS to the same extent.
 The only advantage of the AS for small software manufacturers is the ease of software updates, not really a problem for the Microsofts and Adobes of this world. Any way, I hopefully look forward to MS deciding to be more memory efficient in the future (probably
 distant future) and deciding to share fonts and other resources.

<p>Hi Jim: <br />
</p>
<p>I downloaded my Office apps directly from the Microsoft site. Still it has the same crazy configuration: one font folder per app. Maybe they should offer a sandbox free version when downloaded from their own site, as Adobe does with the CC suite.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> If I want to use a font in Office, let's say Montserrat, do I have to manually copy the Montserrat files inside each and every font folder of the Office apps? Is there a way to work with Office apps and Fontbook? Or any simpler
 way to use my huge set of fonts with Office?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Un abrazo,&nbsp;<br />
Robby!&nbsp;

<p>Hi Robby,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The MS Office applications appear to be able to see any fonts in the Mac OS Font area. For example I have a font "Academy Engraved LET" that is in Font Book (<span>/Library/Fonts/Academy
 Engraved LET Fonts</span>) but not in the MS Word font folder in the Word application and Word can see and use this font. However, if you wish to use a font in another application (i.e. Pages etc) &nbsp;that is in the MS Word application only and not in the Mac
 OS font area you will have to copy the Font from the MS application into the Mac OS font area.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andrew</p>

<h2>            Office Preview and Protected View</h2>
                    <p>I have a surface pro 4 running office 2016. All of a sudden outlook will not preview word, excel, powerpoint files. Also files will not open in associated program as protected views, error message saying file corrupted. I can copy the files to desktop and
 open normally. The problem might have started after a software update, not sure. I have used the fix facility in office 365, no change. I can open the files by switching off protected view, but that defeats the reason for having it!</p>
<p>The preview pane in file explorer is also not working I've just noticed.</p>

<p><span>Thanks for the question! This issue may occur if the security software is causing an issue. We can help you with this
 issue, but I’m going to need a little more information first. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the security software installed on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Method 1:</span></p>
<p>There might be any antivirus plugin installed in Word hence let is open Word in safe mode and check the result:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Hold
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Windows key</span><span> +
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">R</span><span>.</span>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Copy and paste, or type the following command in the

</li></ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">WinWord /safe</span></p>
<p>Note: There is space between WinWord and /.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Method 2:</span></p>
<p>If the above step fails, open Word in clean boot and check if the issue occurs.</p>
<p>Refer the link to know how to start the computer in clean boot:</p>

<p>Note: Ensure to restart the computer in normal mode once troubleshooting is completed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean boot is performed to disable all startup programs and 3rd party services on the machine and check if they are conflicting with the Office program.</p>
<p>If so, you may disable the unwanted software those conflict with the suite or get them updated</p>

            <p>Thanks Deepa.</p>
<p>Tried method 1 to no avail. </p>
<p>Concerned in method 2 that if, as you advise,&nbsp;I take out conflicting security (do I understand you properly?), I shall leave my computer&nbsp;partially exposed.
</p>
<p>Further: will such action invalidate my contract with McAfee security?</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The security software would be disabled in the clean boot mode and as far as I know this would not invalidate your contract with McAfee security.</p>
<p>This step is performed to disable all startup programs and 3rd party services on the machine and check if they are conflicting with the Office program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the troubleshooting is completed you may restart the computer to normal mode again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
        </p>
