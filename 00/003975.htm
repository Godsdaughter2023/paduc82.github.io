    <title>OneNote 2013 AutoCorrect - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            OneNote 2013 AutoCorrect</h2>
                    I frequently use symbols in my OneNote Notetaking. &nbsp;Many of them appear in the Math AutoCorrect list, but I like to use them when I am typing text, without the extra keystrokes to indicate this is a "formula." &nbsp;In both Word and other versions of OneNote,
 I've been able to add my favorite shortcuts into the AutoCorrect list, which takes care of the problem. &nbsp;In 2013 OneNote, I can't get my symbols to paste into that list. &nbsp;What am I missing?

            <p>I have a similar problem.</p>
<p>I like to autocorrect ti to appear as a tick using wingdings in </p>
<p>The symbol is a tick. I used to ask autocorrect to replace ti with a tick.</p>
<p>Now what happens is that it does not autocorrect the font, so it appears in arial as a Ã¼ (a u with two dots above) not in wingdings.</p>

            <p>Have you switched from a PC Version to Mac?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, it's possible that this feature has never been a Mac Version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Microsoft looks upon all things Mac l</span>ike a Millionaire Family:

<li>The millionaire family has two children The Dad &nbsp;takes a shine to one Child nothing that child can do is wrong in his eyes. So he lavishes all the attention gives all the Perks to that Child. In this case The is the PC version of any software&nbsp;<span>Microsoft

<p>This despite every one of the Core Products (Excel, PowerPoint, Word) got their start first on Mac. Because Mac Users were more willing to experiment than PC Users, and didn't mind Reporting Bug. After all the kinks were worked out then. They were introduced
 to PC Users and the Mac users got the short end of the stick.</p>

            Hi Julie,<br />
<br />
<em>Should I set up ONE class notebook for each course (8th grade Language Arts) or should I set up ONE class notebook per course section (8th Grade Language Arts Period 1; LA Period 3, etc.)?</em><br />
I would suggest you set up one class notebook and add one section for each course.<br />
<br />
<em>Can I add content to more than one notebook at a time (e.g., a document to the content library of all 5 sections)?</em><br />
If you mean distribute pages and sections to all students in the Class Notebook at a time, you can follow the steps here:<br />

<p>hi bryanba,</p>
<p>firstly, may i know if you didnât use shared mailbox before and after creating shared mailbox, you want to set the created shared mailbox display in owa(<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook web app</a>)? if so, please check if you have the full
 access permission of the shared mailbox as the following steps at first:</p>
<p>a. go to shared mailboxes.<br />
b. select the shared mailbox you want to edit, double click it.<br />
c. select <strong>mailbox delegation</strong>, check if you have the full access permission of the shared mailbox. if no, add your account in the
<strong>full access</strong> list.</p>
<p>if you have the full access permission of the shared mailbox, generally, we have two ways to open a shared mailbox using outlook web app. you may want to try both methods and see which works best for you.</p>
<p>1. add the shared mailbox so it displays under your primary mailbox in outlook web app.</p>
<p>this method is recommended if you want to monitor the email from your primary mailbox and the shared mailbox at the same time. in addition, after you complete this task, the shared mailbox and its folders are displayed in the left navigation pane each time
 you open outlook web app.</p>
<p>a. sign in to your account in <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook web app</a>.<br />
b. right-click your primary mailbox in the left navigation pane, and then choose <strong>
add shared folder</strong>.<br />
c. in the <strong>add shared folder</strong> dialog box, type the name or email address of the shared mailbox, and then click
<strong>add</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5f3949bc-64d4-4bbe-adb2-99a801339ea6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5f3949bc-64d4-4bbe-adb2-99a801339ea6" /></a></p>
<p>the shared mailbox displays in your folder list in outlook web app. you can expand or collapse the shared mailbox folders as you can with your primary mailbox. you also can remove the shared mailbox from your folder list. to remove it, right-click the shared
 mailbox, and then click <strong>delete</strong>.</p>
<p>2. open the shared mailbox in a separate browser window.</p>
<p>we recommend that you use this method if you want to view and manage the email for the shared mailbox in its own browser window.</p>
<p>a. sign in to your account in <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook web app</a>.<br />
b. on the outlook web app nav bar, click on your name. a list appears.<br />
c. click <strong>open another mailbox</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/657bd496-6227-4ad1-b3f7-9fe0fcbff2e6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/657bd496-6227-4ad1-b3f7-9fe0fcbff2e6" /></a></p>
<p><br />
d. type the email address of the other mailbox that you want to open. another outlook web app session opens in a separate window, allowing access to the other mailbox.</p>
<p>note: if you mistype the email address of the mailbox, a second window opens alerting you that the webpage canât be found. try retyping the email address.</p>
<p>for your reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-and-use-a-shared-mailbox-in-outlook-web-app-bc127866-42be-4de7-92ae-1ef2f787fd5c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
open and use a shared mailbox in outlook web app</a>.</p>
<p>if you cannot open shared mailboxes in owa with the information above, we need to collect the following information for further assistance:</p>
<p>1. if you encounter any error messages when performing the steps above, please capture corresponding screenshots and share with us for analysis. to upload the screenshots, you can click
<strong>use rich formatting</strong> when replying and then click the <strong>insert image button</strong>.</p>
<p><br />
2. please provide the detailed steps of how you created the shared mailbox.</p>
<p>best regards,<br />

                    Hotmail asks me to &nbsp;start with a new account but if I put in the same account name and press join it tells me this account exists and to sign in. When I do it tells me this account does not exist. The disability line can not help me nor can anyone from
 Microsoft. As this is a backup emergency alternative communication line for me it is very urgent that I recover the use of this account . Can anyone please help me or show me how I can escalate this problem to someone in Microsoft who cares?

<h2>            950 battery issue&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My Lumia 950 works fine when plugged in and for a while after it's been fully charged, but as soon as it goes below a certain point (somewhere below 75% or so, I think) it starts shutting down frequently as I open apps and so on. A little longer and it struggles
 to even get going.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking it's the battery, but I've learned that it's not always the most obvious issue when it comes to gadgets... so, what do you think?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's start working on this by checking if there's a pending phone software update. To check it, just go to
<strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Update and security</strong>&gt; <strong>Phone update</strong>&gt;
<strong>Check for updates</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After updating the phone software, we suggest that you perform a soft reset. To soft reset the phone, just press and hold the power and volume down buttons at the same time until the phone restarts.
<br />
<br />
Let us know the results.</p>

            No pending updates (I'm on the general release builds on this device). Also did a full reset and continued from device backup soon after the issues started.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you use the Windows Device Recovery Tool. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To recover your phone using the Windows Device Recovery Tool, complete the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">WDRT tool</a><span>&nbsp;</span>to your PC.<br />
</li></ul>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5c97924-5cae-42a0-8fd2-2a280b2c35cf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5c97924-5cae-42a0-8fd2-2a280b2c35cf" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that your device has a full charge if possible.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>A minimum of 50% charge is required.</li><li>Open the WDRT software on your PC<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/78426511-a53d-40f0-858b-d6abd929d89a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/78426511-a53d-40f0-858b-d6abd929d89a" /></a><br />
</li><li>Connect the affected device to your PC via an appropriate USB cable:</li></ul>
<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span>If your device is detected appropriately, click the phone option as displayed.</p>
<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span>If your device is not detected, choose âMy device was not detectedâ and follow the appropriate on-screen prompts.</p>
<p><span><span>Â§<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span>If using this option and the WDRT tool seems to âhangâ, disconnect the phone from the USB cable, wait ~10 seconds, and reconnect.</p>
<p><span><span>Â§<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span>If disconnecting the device does not work, you may need to reboot your PC to re-enumerate the connected peripherals.</p>
<ul>
<li>The WDRT will check your device for available Firmware version and OS version:</li><li>The tool may say âYou have the latest available software versionâ.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>This is referencing the firmware on the device.<span>&nbsp;</span>This is expected.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>You
 can view the Operating system version and see the version that is available on the WDRT server (highlighted in red below).</li><li>Click Reinstall software.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>The WDRT will download the appropriate software package and then begin the recovery process.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>Ensure
 the device remains connected via USB during this entire process.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>Removal of the device during the flashing process may render it permanently inoperable.</li><li>Once the recovery image has flashed to the device, it will reboot and prompt you to complete setup.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>The device is now fully recovered.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            Yes, the Zune HD will support audiobooks.&nbsp; The only catch is that you cannot sync them to the device through the Zune software.&nbsp; You have to use either Audible or Overdrive audiobooks software to get them on the device.&nbsp; I personally am not very familiar
 with Audible, but with Overdirve I know there is a feature to rip any audiobooks you have on CD to the software to sync them to the device.&nbsp; Overdrive is also used by a lot of libraries so you can "check out" an audiobook and use the Overdrive software to
 put those books on your device as well.&nbsp; I hope this helps you.

            <p>Hi <font color="#0072c6">Cbartoldson</font>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching out to Microsoft Community. Let me assist you with your concern regarding sharing your Outlook.com Calendars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For us to better understand this issue, can you give us a detailed description on your "sub (secondary) calendar"? Is it a calendar that you added or imported? or is it subscribed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, you may refer to the article below&nbsp;for more information on sharing calendars in Outlook.com:</p>

<p>We're looking forward for your response.</p>

            Using outlook.com I set up my main calendar. I then used the add calendar feature and added a separate birthday calendar. When I share my calendar with others it only shares the first one I set up. The directions say to click share and select the calendar
 you want to share. It only shows my first calendar and not my second calendars I set up for birthdays.&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
We understand that you want to share the calendars you've set-up. However when you you tried sharing them , it only shows the first calendar. Am I correct? We would like to know how you've set-up the calendars. So please provide us the exact steps in adding
 the calendar as this will help us find out what might have been causing the problem.<br />
<br />
Should you have further questions, don't hesitate to post back.<br />
<br />
Thanks!

            <p>Hi CraigBartoldson,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you're unable to share your other calendars. I also understand that this must be inconvenient on your end. Don't worry, let us help you with this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the screenshots you have provided. Please verify if these calendars you would like to share are also shared to you. Because if these calendars are only shared to you, you would not be able to share them to other users as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have additional questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

 calendar you want to share but it never offers up the other calendars to be shared.

    <title>PowerPoint 2016 - Import outline - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bryon rykard  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint 2016 - Import outline</h2>
                    <p>Cannot&nbsp;import an outline from a Word 2016 document (.docx) into PowerPoint 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dialog box does not show .docx files.</p>
<p>The dialog box DOES show .doc files, but when you select them for import you receive the following message:<br />
"PowerPoint cannot open this type of file ([file location: file name])"</p>
<p>If you select the "all files" option you can see the file.&nbsp; If you then&nbsp;select it, it says "PowerPoint can't open this file because its file extension has changed.&nbsp; Make sure the format of the file matches the extension"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a fix for this coming out soon?&nbsp; A current work around?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I teach a class at my local college and this is an exercise in the book and we are unable to complete this in the current version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me elaborate on this...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would think if you make an outline in Word 2016 you should be able to import it into PowerPoint 2016 without converting it.&nbsp; The exercise in the instruction book has them create the outline, save it, close Word 2016 and then open PowerPoint 2016.&nbsp; Click
 the New Slide menu button, choose Slides From Outline, navigate to the flash drive where the file is stored, and import the outline into the PowerPoint 2016 presentation.&nbsp; We used the PowerPoint 2010 book and it had the same operation and it worked.&nbsp; Now we
 have "upgraded" to Office 2016 and are using the 2016 books.&nbsp; It has the same exercise as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot believe that I am the first person to have found this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to open the .doc word file it said I needed to download a converter.&nbsp; I did and now it says that it says the file type has changed.</p>

            <p>PowerPoint 2016 should be designed to use a Word 2016 outline as input to create slides/content.&nbsp; NO conversion is necessary.&nbsp; The 2010 products worked just fine.&nbsp; The 2016 products do not.&nbsp; I would like to see the 2016 products fixed to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to answer your question, No.&nbsp; If I was to convert the file, to what would I convert it?&nbsp; It is already a Word 2016 file and that is what PowerPoint should be expecting as input.</p>

            What were the 2007 fixes? In theory, they probably should work in 2003 with minor adjustments.<br />
<br />
I don't have a specific fix, but here are some generic trouble shooting procedures you can try:<br />
<b>Trouble Shoot Word problems that occur when you start or use Word 2010, 2007, 2003, or 2002
</b>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/921541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/921541</span></a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span><span><span>2003-2010<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=820919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=820919</a><span><span> -2002-2003
<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><b>NOTE:<span>&nbsp;
</span></b>part of this procedure is disabling addins. If you want to take a shortcut, check to see if you have a BlueTooth device driver or addin, ie âsend to Bluetoothâ, installed. Disabling BlueTooth is rapidly moving to the top of my Office trouble shooting
 process. Blue Tooth drivers have been identified as the cause of problems with many different ârandomâ symptoms. If you have BlueTooth, disable it in control panel, device manager and possibly as an addin in Office apps.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Itâs not that I think there is anything inherently bad with Blue Tooth. The problem is with the people writing the drivers.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<b>Donât Assume ANYTHING!</b>
<p>Donât assume some part of the trouble shooting processes listed below doesnât apply to you. Often there are things going on in the background that you just arenât aware of. For example, when installing software it is all too easy to have
 an unwanted app installed if you donât carefully read every screen. </p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<b>Uninstall Recent Software</b>
<p>At this point, you have also think about any software or plugins that you may have installed on your computer. Annoyingly, this problem with Word can be caused by a program that is completely unrelated to Word!</p>
<p>Did you recently install some new hardware? A printer, scanner, label machine, web cam, tablet, etc? Have you installed any software? If so, uninstall it and see if the problem goes away.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The following Skype links are an example of this issue</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

</span></p>
<p>Starting in March 2012, "Skype click to Call" has been causing problems File Open problems, and Copy/Paste problems in Office Apps.
</p>
<p>The quick test for this problem is to close all open browsers. If the problem goes away it is probably Skype.</p>
<p>March 30 â MS has released an update to Skype that fixes the problem. Go to the Skype site, download and install the newest version ofc the program.</p>

<p>For anyone reading this, I figured out the problem after surfing the web for the past 3-4 weeks. Painful process. I have a paid version of Advanced SystemCare Pro, v5.2.0. 3-4 weeks ago, while scanning through it's vast offerings, I came
 across a feature I could activate called "Smart RAM". I turned it on and checked the 5 boxes it offers in the settings. The last of those 5 is "Clean Clipboard". I unchecked this box a few minutes ago and it fixed my issues. I now have no problems with copy/paste.
 Info only, it case it helps anyone.</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;<span>&nbsp; </span>Hi, I recently came across this problem in MS Word 2007 where after I type or hit any key on my keyboard while in the Word window, I can no longer highlight text with my mouse (by clicking once at the beginning
 of the text and dragging the mouse to the end of the text portion that I want to highlight). I have found that if I click out of the Word window and press any key on the keyboard, this seems to resolve the problem and I can finally highlight with my mouse.
 However, as soon as I type anything in the Word window again, highlighting with the mouse no longer works. Clicking on any key again within the Word window does not resolve the issue- I have to push a key outside the Word window in order to resolve the problem.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; Hi, I just figured out the problem. I had installed the Synergy program 1.5 weeks ago and by uninstalling it the problem appears to be resolved. Thank you both for your time and help. &nbsp;&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; I had the same problem, i ran windword in safe mode successfully and disabled ABBYY FineReader 9.0 and the problem was solved as well, all is fine now and office is awesome!!&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; <span>I ran my old Word 2010 and removed the ABBYY add-in. I didn't have to disable the whole program. I also did the "Quick Repair" and the "Online Repair" of Office 2013 Preview, but I'm pretty sure it was the add-in
 removal that made the difference. </span>&lt;/snip</p>

</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>Alright, well, I found the answer to this final issue: I only needed to disable the Bluetooth add-in on Options. I have no idea why that would have been the problem, but I found it as a suggested fix

<p>Thanks for all your help everyone.</p>
<p>As a recap:</p>
<p><span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>My Office 2010 was a Click-to-Run version</p>
<p><span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Word suddenly giving me messages about "Downloading the Required Feature," freezing up, slowing down...</p>
<p><span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Ultimately had to uninstall Office</p>
<p><span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Reinstalled it from the Microsoft website with my product key, choosing the 64-bit version instead of the Click-to-Run version</p>
<p><span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Installed all new updates from Windows Updates</p>
<p><span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Restarted computer</p>
<p><span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Word working quickly with no messages, but became unresponsive when trying to open old files</p>
<p><span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Went to File-&gt;Options-&gt;Add-Ins-&gt;Go-&gt; and unchecked Bluetooth.</p>
<p><span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Everything seems to be back to normal, if not better than before.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<div>
<p>
My problem is if I copy text from a web site or from Excel, Access etc into Word all I get is a black spot.</p>
<p>
I have tried a repair install and checking all the settings against my laptop - where this function works properly.
</p>
<p>The problem is caused by a defective Bluetooth add-in for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, turn off the Com Addin.</p>
<p><b><span>Additional Notes:</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>The defective Bluetooth add-in is usually installed by a Bluetooth driver. (In my case - Intel Centrino Wireless Bluetooth 3.0 + High Speed Adaptor (v1.1))</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Updating your Bluetooth driver (or reverting to an older version) may also resolve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Unfortunately simply disabling the add-in through the Word options may result in a 3 second freeze when loading Word 2007. (If this is a problem, changing to a different bluetooth driver version may be the better option)</span></p>
<p><b><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>Oddly enough, this ended up being the cause of my problem. I had an older print driver installed on my Win7 machine and once I removed that driver, Word started working without any problems!</p>
<p>You can delete individual printer drivers by going into the registry. Note that simply going to Printers and Faxes and deleting a printer there does not delete the printer driver.</p>
<p>Follow <strong><span>Step 3</span></strong> in my previous post about a printer error to remove the printer drivers:</p>

<p>
<span>Here is a truely Off-the-wall solution that is in the same class as bad RAM and bad Video Cards</span></p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; My problem turned out to be related to the WYSE thin clients we were using to connect to the Win 2008 R2 Terminal servers.&nbsp; The software that allows/enhances use of dual screens called WYSE TXC Multi-Display v1.2.1.7 was causing
 the applications to crash (including IE 9 32bit).&nbsp; Once this software was disabled - The errors stopped.</p>
<p>I have a feeling this software doesn't like Windows Server 2008 R2.&nbsp; It was being used successfully on Server 2003.&nbsp; I have seen a&nbsp; few other posts on Google for people searching for an updated version without success. &lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<b>Starting point when Word does something unexpected</b>
<p>As a general rule, when something seems to be going wrong, or at least not the way you want it to go, in Word, any version, go to Tools and then Options and study all the settings on all the tabs. You may even find some settings that
 you want to try that have nothing to do with the current problem.</p>
<p>When I was teaching Word and other Microsoft Office programs at a private business college, I had three rules:</p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Always check Tools Options</p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>When in doubt, right-click on something</p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If you're wondering how to set up a special kind of material in a document, consider whether Word tables are suitable. The placement officer of the school came to me several times and asked how I thought she should set something up. Each time
 the answer was, "I'd use a Word table." By the fifth time she had stopped asking--she got the point.</p>

            <p>Hi LenDanos,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not feasible to meet all the following requirements at the same time.</p>
<p>we suggest you post your <span>feedback in our <a href="https://excel.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Excel UserVoice</a>. Many new features came directly from customer's feedback.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>If you want to meet the following requirements individually, you can refer the following steps.
</p>
<p>Regarding<span>â</span> There is a picture attached on the file that shouldn't be copied/resize/move<span>â</span>.</p>
<p>I suggest you try protecting Sheet. (Open the Sheet&gt;Click Review&gt;Select Protect Sheet&gt;Set a password&gt;Check Select locked cells and Select unlocked cells)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About<span>â</span> The margins should not be resized also<span>â</span>.</p>
<p>It is not feasible to forbid to resize margins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the requirement<span>â</span> There is a certain portion in a row where the user can only put/delete text<span>â</span>, I suggest you try the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Select the cells which you want to type or delete text.</p>
<p>2. Click Home&gt;Select Format under Cells&gt;Click Format Cells&gt;Select Protection&gt;Uncheck Locked and Hidden&gt;Click OK.</p>
<p>3. Click Review&gt;Select Protect Sheet&gt;Set a password&gt;Check Select unlocked cells.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding<span>â</span> No password should be required upon opening that excel document<span>â</span> and
<span>â</span>I inserted also a check box and it shouldn't be affected by restriction<span>â</span>.</p>
<p>I would like to explain that if you have done no settings, the requirements are default.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding,</p>
<p>Qing </p>

<h2>            Switching to Notebook View accidentally completely destroyed formatting</h2>
                    Hi
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a large file I was creating in print layout, the notebook layout was accidentally pressed and when I immediately switched back to print layout it kep all the terrible formatting from notebook layout - there are no more bullets, the font has changed
 and it is generally unreadable.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How do I recover my previous layout?? I can't believe that it is so difficult to switch back. Completely useless.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

            If you have not saved the file since converting you <i>may</i> be able to recover it by closing the document without saving. Once you confirm Convert in the conversion notice &amp; save the document I don't know of any way to restore lost formatting other
 than reverting to a recent backup copy... Perhaps you're using Time Machine or some other means of backing up?<br />

    <title>Chart Templates &#47; Default Excel Chart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> montana_x  say:</h3>
<h2>            Chart Templates &#47; Default Excel Chart</h2>
                    <p>Can 'Chart Template' formatting be updated when working between&nbsp;multiplesThemes?&nbsp; Meaning, I saved a chart template and would like to use it&nbsp;in a new file that has a different&nbsp;Theme applied.&nbsp;When the chart is inserted, it does not pick up on the new theme
 colors, the font colors (relative to a darker background), etc.&nbsp; If I select: Reset to Match Style, the chart picks up the correct column colors but also changes the font size and axis colors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible change&nbsp;the&nbsp;Excel default Chart Style (Match Style) to retain my chart template formatting --- and use these Chart Templates across Themes with varied background and color schemes?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, when I insert a new chart, it comes in with formatting that I would like to cusomize, i.e., no gridlines, different axis color etc. Where are the settings for this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you, Montana</p>

            It depends upon which font you chose when you created the chart. But even better, try and do it this way:
<div>
<ol>
<li>Make note of which Theme your PowerPoint file uses.</li><li>Insert a chart in your PowerPoint file -- this will launch Excel.</li><li>Change the Theme in Excel to match the PowerPoint Theme. Look at this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.indezine.com/products/powerpoint/learn/themes/03-applying-themes-2010.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Applying Themes in PowerPoint, Word, and Excel 2010</a> tutorial to learn how to apply
 a Theme in Excel.</li><li>Exit Excel.</li><li>Make changes in PowerPoint to the chart. For any font changes, stay with the top two fonts in the Fonts gallery (this says Theme Fonts and the words "Headings" and "Body" will be suffixed to the fonts).</li><li>Similarly use only Theme colors and Theme effects for all chart elements.</li><li>Save as a chart template in PowerPoint -- look at this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.indezine.com/products/powerpoint/learn/chartsdiagrams/saving-chart-templates-ppt2010.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Saving Chart Templates</a> tutorial.</li></ol>

            Are you using ODBC Connections to link the tables? If so, have you tested the ODBC link? Have you updated the ODBC driver? If you are using DSNless connections, also check that you are using the most current SQL Server driver.

<p><span><span>You likely should not have to do much of anything.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>However, what I would do is try re-linking the tables.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>So launch the linked table manager. Do a select all, and then hit ok.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This should re-fresh the links.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If this refresh does not work, then re-launch the linked table manager. Select all, but ALSO click on the âAlways prompt for new locationâ.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This will force/allow you to re-create the DSN. You can selecting your existing one, or simply create a brand new one.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Keep in mind I âstrongâ suggest when doing the above you choose a âfileâ DSN.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The reason for this is Access automatic converts all file dsnâs to DSN-less.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>So this is a great default by Access, since if your tables link correctly, then you can deploy the application to any workstation on the network, and not have to setup or bother with creating a DSN on those other stations.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This also means you donât have to use code or anything to re-link the tables, and you donât have to do anything and the result is a DSN-less connection.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>So the âdefaultâ for Access is what we call a DSN-less connection. No VBA code or anything is required for this preferred DSN-less connection. This also means that Access will ignore the DSN you have, and you could even delete it - Access will
 not care (Access only uses this during a re-link and only if you check the prompt for new location box).
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>And more important, if you modify the DSN - access will NOT see this change nor care. (so 2nd suggest is required here if you change the dsn). So if you modify the DSN, Access will not see or know about this change.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>So first try the re-fresh. If that donât work, then re-launch linked table manager again, and ensure you tick the âalways prompt for a new location" â that will allow you to re-build the connection.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>I suspect when you upgraded the server, perhaps the name or instance or sever name changed. Thus the 2nd
</span><span>&nbsp;suggest above (prompt for new location) should fix this issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>edit: I also don't think this is related to TLS 1.1 - as far as I know that is only related to https (web server), not your general network tc/ip that you using to connect to sql server.

    <title>Nokia N93 Focus and Focus button - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smiler34uk2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia N93 Focus and Focus button</h2>
                    Has anyone else got problems with there Nokia focus button and zoom in and out swivel thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
I bought the phone 11/10/06 three days later took it to Nokia shop to have it upgraded with the new firmware as it was crashing and taking jerky video.<br />
<br />
All ok, All taking video ok, then things started to go wrong, the unit restarts on its own, I can not use the swivel zoom in and out button its too hard to move, I take the pictures at night and well u might as well not use the flash for all the good it does.
 The focus button I depress on photo mode will flash green for ages and will not focus at all. The video looks like it is stuck on high zoom and will not do anything.<br />
<br />
Â£499 I paid for this phone and for a phone thats a lot of cash to pay for just that A PHONE!!!<br />
<br />
Im not saying that it should be the bees n eee of phones, but why for a new phone is it failing and even let out on the market with faults??<br />
<br />
The place where I got it from is not even answering the phone or emails I am sending to get it sorted, even the Nokia Shop where I took it to get it f/w uploaded told me to send it back to where I got it from in the 1st place next time.<br />
<br />
So Nokia, if your listening, help me out here?<br />
<br />
So far since I got this phone.<br />
<br />
Bad software version so new phone could not use as it suggested.<br />
Bad after sales service from your Nokia center.<br />
And now a camera phone which has turned into a hmmm Phone...<br />
<br />
Happy? not...<br />
<br />
All I can say is I hope your N95 is better and tested before you send it out to the public.

            i just can say that i am totaly in agree with you, this phone seems to be done in a rush kind of to put it on the shops as fast as they can and now this is it, a phone that cost as mutch as a camera and is a complete disaster i found it a waste of money,
 but as many of you guys can e canÂ´t afford myself to buy a N95 right away.. nokia should listen to this cause this is really bad for a brand like nokia is, os used to be..<br />

            Well here we are, I took my phone to the shop, they told me after a week it went to germany for the phone to be diceted(spelt right? hmm) anyway, I went on holiday to aus for three weeks without a phone, thanks nokia!! came back, and just my phone was
 ready, I got a friend to pick it up as while I was away my dad died. Family could not reach me as no telephone. I check it out and use it, v 10.0.025 12-07-06 RM-55 N93 (52.01) Bluetooth can not turn up the volume while in a call. Pics grainy Batt power will
 not even last a night, I got to sleep with a fully charged phone and wake and its dead. Strange how the nokia shop said nokia have sent me a new phone. Choices choices, Local paper will def hear abotu hwo **bleep** your company is with support and pushing
 out faulty phones and def will be talking to consumerwatch, you will be hearing from me later, just **bleep**. And yes im angry. Not happy at all with the responces, example, please accept out appoligies, and can you take it to your nerest nokia shop for an
 upgrade or repair. Jeesh, I have had this phone since october and I have only had it with me for three weeks out of that lot, you nokia have had it, shall I just give you Â£500 and not have a phone as thats what it feels like. Its supposed to work, I dont buy
 a car without wheels do I? I buy a phone which should work. All other readers dont waste your time with this phone or nokia as the support if poor and well the phone is not worth it.. Oh also for your updater software, if ver 11 or ver 20 odd is out, why does
 the software say there is no new software for my phone? Another waste of harddisk space on my computer.<br />

Form your latest post i guess you have got a replacement and your have no problems with pciture taking. If the problem persists its due to zoom getting stuck. Get it replaced. If your firmware is 10.0.028 then get it upgarded to 11.0.034. Do not upgrade to
 20.0.058 as its software is unstable and firmware is having problems.<br />
<br />
We should understand with a phone of high quality bugs are bound to creep in; hardware &amp; software. Nokia testing bench resources are limited. They try to test to the best possible extent. Competitors pressure thwarts them to do a very thorough testing and Nokia
 launches half baked phones. Quality of Nokia service is discussed extensively in this forum.<br />
<br />
I have suggestion. Nokia phones should log errors in its system<br />
so that service department is able to quickly identify<br />
errors and find a solution<br />
<br />
However I agree that Nokia should address customer needs quickly. Customer service department of Nokia needs thorough overhaul.

            I took my phone to a Nokia Service Point in Peterborough, UK hoping to get software version 20.XX. I had already in the past had to send it away to get an upgrade from 10.XX to 11.XX. This was a story in itself as UPS stole my phone on its return leg and
 CRC/Nokia kept me waiting for several weeks to get a suitable replacement.<br />
<br />
Peterborough Nokia Service Point have gone and installed version 10.XX so I'm back to square one. They tell me it's an automated process so this must have been the latest version. This just isn't true.<br />
<br />
Why has this happened?<br />
<br />
I'm so fed up with Nokia I regret buying this nasty handset and I'm not going to ever buy a Nokia handset again. I will actively encourage all those I know to avoid Nokia too. They don't properly test their handsets before launch, their customer service is
 the worst I have encountered anyway...BY A VERY LONG WAY.<br />
<br />
I think Nokia deserve to go out of business. One day, ordinary consumers and suppliers will wake up to the digusting conduct of this miserable company and turn their backs.

<p>The problem of OneNote data corruption in my phone is with the account that was used to set up the phone.&nbsp; You are suggesting that I delete and then add this account in the phone.&nbsp; But this will not work for me -- because deleting this account will delete
 ALL my phone settings, apps&nbsp;and data!&nbsp; Please suggest another solution.&nbsp; </p>

<p>This method will not remove any files, settings or apps on your phone, but it will just unlink your account to the Microsoft apps on your phone including OneNote, OneDrive, Word and others. You can still restore the files by adding the account again to your

<p>In the past, when I unregistered on one phone and then registered on another phone (both Nokia Lumia Icons), several apps became unavailable on the newly registered phone (because their developers stopped supporting them and they were removed from Microsoft
 Store). I worry that the same thing could happen again if I follow your unregister/reregister suggestion. Could you suggest another solution? For example, is it possible (and if so, would it work?) to make a copy of my online notebook and then start using
 the copy on my phone?</p>
<p>

<p>I've had the same issue recently. OneNote started crashing at startup (the data existed on OneDrive intact and could be viewed and edited on my notebook). OneNote on phone has a "reset" option that claims to reset whatever pointers/indexes are corrupted,
 but that option did not fix the problem. Normally you would reinstall the OneNote app, but guess what...can't be deleted so it can't be reinstalled. Only solution...reinstall ENTIRE phone. A brilliant bit of programming. I'll add that my other WP simultaneously
 had the same issue with the same dataset, proving it was a botched "mandatory" OneNote upgrade at fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why individual apps like OneNote or Edge can't be deleted is obvious--keeps you a prisoner.</p>

            In Mac Word 2011, there are 2 ways you can go: Link to Previous or Different First Page. Both are located on the Header &amp; Footer contextual tab which appears only when active in a Header or Footer. See Word 2011 Help on Headers&nbsp; [and Footers] for more

<h2>            Creating and Organizational Chart with 4 Tiers</h2>
                    I am trying to do an organizational chart in Word and It will only allow three levels and I need four levels reporting to the Owner.<br />
<br />
I currently have block one as the owner , the next blocks are upper management (2 entries) reporting to the owner, the next set of block are for Office staff (4 entries) reporting to the owner and the fourth level is our labourers whom are also reporting directly
 to the owner.&nbsp; I have tried to do the add using the Smart Art Edit and I can't get it to do what I want.

            I'm afraid I just can't conceptualize the structure based on your description... It refers to 4 Levels but stipulates that everyone other than the owner reports directly to the owner. That sounds to me like there are only 2 Levels -- One being the owner,
 the other being everyone else.<br />
<br />
Can you provide a more explicit definition of what you're trying to create?<br />

            First, right-click the border of the organization chart. From the pop-up (contextual) menu choose Wrap Text and then choose an option
<b>other than</b> in line with text.
<div><br />
<div>Now you will be able to drag the border of the chart down by dragging on the lower-right corner of the organization chart frame.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Once you've made some room, the secret to making more levels is pressing the TAB key and SHIFT-TAB key. Select the bottommost entry and press TAB to make a new level. If you want to move a box up a level use SHIFT-TAB. Make your edits in the smaller dark
 Text Pane window.</div>
