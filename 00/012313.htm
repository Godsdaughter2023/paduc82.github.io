<h2>            Microsoft HUP activation</h2>
                    <p>I bought a Microsoft HUP License via my company but somehow I cannot activate it anymore.</p>
<p>I've already called Microsoft twice and asked my company 3 times.</p>
<p>Both are pointing at eachother to fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't get it. Do I pay for something and then get no help?</p>
<p>Why is this so difficult to fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just activate my license.</p>
<p>I have a product code a program code and&nbsp;a valid account, what else do you people want from me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I know this is a community question, but there is no contact emailaddress and I am tired of calling Microsoft and being told my company has to fix it and then have my company tell me Microsoft should fix it...</p>

            <p>Hi Ram,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply!</p>
<p>I've bought a HUP license and it works on my personal computer.</p>
<p>However it should be possible to install it on a other computer at home as well.</p>
<p>When I try this I get an activation message upon starting word/exell.</p>
<p>When I log in with my Microsoft account I get a message that activation is not possible because the license is not active. When I try to activate with the product key I get the same result.</p>
<p>I've contatced the Microsoft HUP helpdesk and they told me my company must re-activate my license with a programcode.</p>
<p>My company replied that they have given me this programcode to use for initial registration/activation and that they cannot help me any further.</p>
<p>So I called Microsft again but I got the same answer.</p>
<p>Then I've contacted my companies helpdesk again and got the same answer from them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems I am being bounced between Microsoft and my company without getting the problem fixed...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really hope you can figure out what is going on!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards, Michel Oranje</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, installing on more than one computer was allowed for previous versions of Office, but no longer in 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I strongly believe you are mistaken in your assumption that you may install Office 2013 Pro Plus on more than one computer.&nbsp; Every other Office 2013 license has been "improved" &lt;heavy sarcasm!&gt; to allow only install on one computer at a time. I have a Pro
 Plus License (but not HUP) and could not find anything in it that allows you to run it on more than one computer at a time (only in Japan).&nbsp; Is there something in writing, specific to the HUP agreement, that allows you to install on a second machine?</p>

            <p>OK, that&nbsp; is a clear statement.&nbsp; It is an exception to the general rule for Office 2013 licenses. But it is good for you.&nbsp; Personally, I suspect if you push subject MS will go back and "correct" the website ...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are having problems activating the license on a second machine, then the only thing you can do is contact the MS Phone Activation support number (pick the "Phone Activation" rather than "Internet Activation" option).&nbsp; The Activation center is the
 only support that can help with activation problems. When you phone in, don't bother replying to the initial prompts. Wait, a long time, until you are offered the option of talking to a live "service" rep.&nbsp; Explain the problem to them, give them the link to
 the HUP page. In theory, they should be able to help you. </p>

<p>NOTE: you can find links to the specific activation instruction for Office or Windows in hyperlinks at the bottom of the article</p>
<p>If the activation process fails, you can change the activation process to telephone and call the number it provides you. Do not enter anything until the phone system offers you the option to talk to a live service rep. Explain the problem to them.
 You are transferring the installation from a “dead” computer, or you are getting an invalid product key and would like to know the exact reason</p>

                    I feel like i have tried everything. &nbsp;I uninstalled McAfee which was preinstalled on my computer when i bought it (which was today). &nbsp;I even downloaded the McAfee removal tool and ran as administrator. &nbsp;I have tried running WIndows Defender from the Action

    <title>SQL Direct Query asking to Select Data Source DSN file - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            SQL Direct Query asking to Select Data Source DSN file</h2>
                    Greetings,<br />
<br />
I have an Access 2010 32 bits version on a Windows 7 64bits. <br />
<br />
My problem is I cannot create SQL Direct query without Access asking me "Select Data Source".<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I created very basic query like "SELECT * FROM tblLabSamples;" and it always ask me "Select Data Source".<br />
<br />
I even created a DSN file using Microsoft Access Driver(*.mdb, *.accdb) pointing on my only Access database. It says "Y<i>ou cannot use ODBC to import from, export to, or link an External Microsoft Jet or ISAM database table to your database</i>". I don't understand
 why it keep asking me to select a data source to query itself!?<br />
<br />
Going crazy,<br />
<br />
Thanks for help<br />

<h3> whathaveyoudonetomycomputer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender update&#47;backup deleted system files and drivers and now my computer has severe issues - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p><span>I have had my Dell Inspiron 15, 7000 Series - 7537 laptop for probably ~2 years and have never touched the Dell backup and recovery tool. I have my own personal backup and never needed it. Recently (as in 2 days ago on 3/13/17) I ran Windows Defender.
 When I did, a new option came up that did an offline and more in depth security scan, as well as a backup and restoration thing. Now, I realize this may be a Dell issue, but the reason I post on here is because the security scan was what I assume initiated
 the Dell Backup and Recovery application.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The whole process took only about 30 minutes, so I was pleased at first. However, upon logging into my computer, I realized that it was running slower than normal which I figured was just the system double checking things or whatever (rookie mistake).
 I also realized that the audio on my computer wasn't functioning. When I say it wasn't functioning, I mean that neither the laptop speakers nor any other connected device (Bluetooth headphones/speaker and wired headphones through the audio jack) would produce
 any sound. Before someone says anything, no, the computer isn't muted, I've checked the device drivers and connections, and have done multiple hard/soft reboots in an attempt to possibly kick start it or re-download drivers, etc.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since this was odd to me, I began looking on the internet to find possible solutions. However, when I tried accessing some of the system files/task manager/admin stuff in general I would often receive error messages such as (most are changed slightly,
 but look almost exactly like these):</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Ex. 1</span></p>
<p><span>"C:Users\*omitted my name*\AppData\Local\Microscoft\Windows\WinX\Group2\5 - Task Manager.lnk</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action. Please install a program or, if one is already installed, create and associating in the Default Programs control panel."<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>(When trying to access system programs such as Task Manager, Computer Management, Disk Management, etc.)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Ex. 2</span></p>
<p><span>"::{26EE0668-A00A-44D7-9371-BEB064C9868...:{74246BFC-4C96-11D0-ABEF-0020AF6B0...</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows cannot find</span></p>
<p><span>::{26EE0668-A00A-44D7-9371-BEB064C9868...:{74246BFC-4C96-11D0-ABEF-0020AF6B0B7A}'.</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again."<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>(When trying to access another program which I can’t remember at the moment.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since discovering this, it seems that these files may have been flagged and subsequently deleted from my computer as a virus during the offline scan process. The issue with this is that I can barely access anything. Almost anything relating to the
 system or admin that will possibly help fix this has been deleted/can’t be found. In addition to this, it takes anywhere from 3-10 minutes after clicking an action before the error message (or very rarely, an actual program) appears on the screen.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please note that not all programs are affected in this way. Programs such as Chrome and Microsoft Office start as normal. Honestly, I have spent almost 3 days searching for any type of assistance with this and have yet to find anything else that fits
 this description. I would prefer not to reformat my computer or anything else similarly drastic until any and all other options have been exhausted. I have not yet run the computer in safe mode to possibly identify/fix issues because I have yet to find a method
 to get there that actually works with what is now a very broken computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Nothing I have tried has worked at all and I cannot find any suggestions to fix it or similar instances online. While most of these issues are fairly minor since the programs typically don't get much use, in this instance I need access to all of them
 to fix my computer and have next to none. Please help me with this. Any suggestions or help of any kind would be incredibly appreciated.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>All that being said</span></p>
<p><span>Is this something that has happened to other people or is it just me?<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Is there any way to fix this and what would that be?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Why exactly did this happen and how can I make sure it never does again?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>*It’s important to note that while the backup and recovery program supposedly did backup the system, the program itself has apparently been corrupted or simply won’t open and gives an error similar to the first example.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>**Another side note is that in the Windows Defender "History" tab, I am unable to "view details" as it gives another error message saying the system cannot find the specified file.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>***The last note is that the computer still says everything is fine up until I select a program. Drivers are supposedly installed (in the case of the audio) and Windows Defender says there is no threat at all (which it claimed before the offline scan,
 after conducting both a “Quick Scan” and later, a “Full Scan” )</span></p>

            <p>Please tell me that isnt a serious "answer"... That link (the two points that were even slightly related to this issue) was useless if you've read my post. For example:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">It’s important to note that while the backup and recovery program supposedly did backup the system, the program itself has apparently been corrupted or simply won’t open and gives an error similar to
 the first example.</span><span>"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Meaning, I cant do #1 on your unhelpful list. And while number two on your list is *possible*, im pretty sure the next thing closest to factory resetting your computer is to *almost* factory rest your computer, which is exactly what I said i didnt want to
 do. Again though, that information is obviously useless to you unless you've read the post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I appreciate your keen ability to point out that I have multiple issues, you notice if the post had been read (im seeing a trend...) that they are all related, started at the *exact* same time, and did so immediately after running your program. &nbsp;The
 list you have provided via that link was completely useless and id appreciate at least an inkling of effort to help maybe diagnose where your program went wrong, and possibly some actual assistance fixing it. Again, WITHOUT resetting my computer back to factory
 settings or other similarly drastic measures until other options have been exhausted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be 100% honest, after i read your response and looked at your link, I immediately looked for the "Mark Unhelpful" button because i could tell exactly how little you put into that response. Surprisingly there wasnt one...</p>

            The thing is, Windows Defender never once detected a virus, or at least not that it told me of. And normally windows defender checks before it deletes things to make sure it isnt something you have put there. In my experience, it usually asks something
 along the lines of This program was being naughty, is it yours? otherwise we'll discard of the body for you. In this case, it shut down my computer for a task that it was created for and then deleted system files. I get that sometimes the only option is to
 start over, but not when LITERALLY NOTHING ELSE has been suggested yet. Really, all im asking for is someone who will actually read the problem and then at least offer to fix it. That like saying you bought a pair of shoes, I tell you im gonna "back up" the
 laces, then proceed to burn them and tell you to buy a new pair of shoes. How bout lets try some new shoe strings first?&nbsp;

            <p>Seriously, unless you're going to read my posts, please stop saying the same thing over and over.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, I have not yet run a system restore because, once again as it said in my post, I have yet to find a way that my computer will boot into safe/advanced mode becuase the system files have been severly messed with. Finding a route should be possible, but
 its kinda difficult when a lot(but not all) of the devices key systems to do that are missing chunks of data. If you have suggestions for this, those are welcome too.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look, I'm not trying to come across as rude or cause issues or anything like that, but i wrote an *incredibly* detailed post for the exact reason that I wouldnt have someone try and tell me to just Start over. Im looking for assistance in fixing it, through
 advice, suggestions, or anything else you guys may be able to offer instead of a preset, generic (right up there with "turn it off an back on again") list of solutions you tell everyone because its easier to reply that way. If it comes to it, I am willing
 to rest everything, but only as a last resort because thats incredibly frustrating setting up a computer again.

            <p>I apologize for making you feel as if I'm attacking you or the help you've given me. I most certainly am not, however I am upset at the situation and thats possibly spilling over resulting in me being more passionate about this issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I've said multiple times, I understand and am willing to take your advice. However, i know there is often a way to at least troubleshoot before going to drastic measures such as factory resetting my computer. One suggestion ive been given is to do a system
 restore, but when I asked questions about how to go about that, thy were dissmissed because I didnt take the very first advice given. For example, what methods would be suggested for trying to get into safe mode since im having difficulty. I have yet to insult
 you and there is no outright dismissal. again, I've actually said more than once that I am willing to reset, but Id like to try other options if there are any. Ive asked for advice multiple times but the default answer is to do a system restore and then a
 factory reset with little to nothing other than that. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I feel you guys have not read my problem is beacause of the very general blanket response I was given even when I asked specific questions about specific issues. While I understand there are mmore than one issue, they are all connect and therefore
 figured would be easier to cover in a single go instead of having 3 different questions for the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, thank you for being a volunteer. I do appreciate that. But i have had at least one question if not more that should not require the drastic steps you suggested. For example, when i asked how you either of you would suggest getting to safe mode which
 i know does not require a factory reset. I understand that I may be being slightly short or flabbergasted, but thats because im being dismissed just as much as you feel im rejecting your ideas. If I ask a question on a dedicated forum made for a specific system
 such as microsoft, i personally feel maybe slightly more than "reset your computer" would be warranted. Especially since this is a machine that ive spent a fair deal of money on to have the software destroy itself without explanation.</p>

            <p>We appreciate the screenshots you've provided. Based on the error messages you're getting, we can resolve your concern either by performing a system restore, or a repair installation. System restore will put your PC back to its original state, before you
 run the Windows Defender scan. You have the option to select a date. If you decided to do a repair install/ upgrade, it will repair your PC without losing your files. You may refer to this

<p>I am unable to edit my contact information, especially the phone numbers. The new format in Outlook gives the message that "You can't change Messenger contact info, but you can add details that will appear on this contact's card."&nbsp; This doesn't make sense.
 How can the update be restricted if the information has changed. Extremely bad design and not user friendly at all.<br />

The design should be changed and fixed to allow updating All information in contacts/ people.<br />

<div>RE: Your post above.</div>
<div>I've looked at your post, followed all the steps, and all to no avail.</div>
<div>You say if the contact was originally added on my microsoft account it would be editable. Am I to assume then that Messenger wasn't a microsoft account? The contacts I added to my messenger ARE NOT editable. So.....is there even a way to delete a contact
 and add it with the new email?&nbsp;</div>
<div>This is what happens when a company runs roughshod over peoples' choices, I'm sure I am not alone in wondering why there was any need to force a change onto people who had a messenger account for years.</div>

            <p>Hello JimG666,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing your concern to our attention. Sorry for the confusion about contacts within Messenger client and editing contacts through People page. When you added a contact using Messenger client, the contact cannot be edited through People page.
 You need to re-add the contact&nbsp;to Outlook.com for you to be able to edit the contact.</p>

            I went through the steps. There are some problems though the way it is programmed.<br />
<br />
1. First it does not allow to edit the contacts that have phone number information. When you click edit it does not even display the fields with phone number so you cannot change that information.<br />
2. On clicking edit when you get the message "You can't change Messenger contact info, but you can add details that will appear on this contact's card."&nbsp; and you click
<b>Add</b>. You add/edit the information (phone fields not showing though). Next time when you edit the same contact you don't get the error message this time but all the fields with information in the contact (phone) still are not displayed.<br />
<br />
My contacts are not from messenger or some third party. Even if someone adds the contacts from messenger or another source, why is a user not allowed to edit any information in their contacts. The user should be able to make ANY updates in their account. This
 makes the new Hotmail very user un-friendly.<br />
<br />
The People page has some serious issues that Microsoft needs to fix.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

Welcome to Microsoft Community Answers forum. I understand that you're receiving message when editing your contacts's information. Let's see what we can do to resolve this issue.&nbsp;<strong>t-4-2</strong>'s post is correct.
 that was originally added on your Microsoft account, you will able to edit this by referring to the steps below:</span></p>

I followed the steps you outlined:<br />
1. I clicked on the link and was automatically logged in.<br />
2. I found the contact I needed to edit on the left pane.<br />
3. I clicked the Edit option.<br />
4. I did all of that about 3 minutes ago and it still says loading....<br />
....for how long will it load?<br />
<br />
What I don't understand is why we cannot edit contacts that were created with a Microsoft service that is no longer being supported and in fact no longer exists.<br />
<br />
<br />
A. User says:<br />
[[It does not make a whole lot of sense, but that is the way I understand.
<p>So, you will have to go to Messenger/Skype and do the editing there.]]</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So then I went to Skype and tried to make the change there and I just flat out couldn't find the option to edit in Skype.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Why is this so hard to do?</p>
<p>We're not asking Microsoft to give Peace to the Middle East, we just want to be able to edit our contacts in Outlook.<br />

            Hi Oscar,<br />
<br />
We're sorry for the inconvenience that you're experiencing despite following those steps. Let me see what I can do top help you. You said that when you tried to edit the contacts, the page just keeps loading. I suggest that you try to access your account using
 a different browser to see if the same thing happens when editing contacts through other browsers. Please be guided that this is to isolate the possibility of a browser problem. Let us know the result.<br />
<br />
With regard to&nbsp;A. User's post, you can refer to&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/7f471324-832f-479b-a17b-ae580e36f908">Ken_Rey_C.</a>'s response which clearly states that if a contact comes from third party services which
 is linked to your account, you won't be able to edit it. You can add information though.
<br />
<br />
This means that when you have a contact (i.e. Facebook contact) and you linked your the Facebook account to your Outlook.com account, the Facebook contact details will show on your Outlook.com's account's contact list, however you cannot edit it's existing
 information. But changes on contact information in the Facebook interface, reflects in his contact information in Outlook.com's contact list.<br />
<br />
If the contact is originally added in your Outlook.com account, you would able to edit the information<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
<br />

            <p>I am having the same problem. I think you are failing to understant the OP's comment. I had contacts entered either vaia hotmail.com or Microsoft Messenger. Skype then replaced Microsoft Messenger. Skype does not give any option for editing the phone numbers
 in a Messenger Contact. In Outlook.com I can see my Messenger contacts, but if you try to edit them - you get the message about not being able to change contact information on a Messgenger contact, but you can add to it. If you add to it, save, and then edit
 again you no longer get the error message, but still cannot edit the phone numbers for the contact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is Microsoft considering Microsoft Messgener contacts to be 3rd party? Since Skype took over Messenger and it can't edit them, and Hotmail/Outlook.com cannot edit them - then what are we to do - delete all of our Messenger contacts and then re-key&nbsp;them as
 a native Hotmail/Outlook.com contact? What's the deal?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

That is if you type <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.microsoft.com</a>, you can not remove the link.
<br />
Are you able to right click on the link and edit it?<br />

            This works, at least on the Mac. I right-clicked on the link and selected Edit Link and removed the http:// from the top line (which also removed it from the bottom line). Clicked OK. When I right-clicked again on the link Remove Link was available. It
 was still OK after quitting OneNote and going back in.

                    I have created several dynamic search ads campaigns. Buy after 3 days, no impression shows. Is there any possible problems which blocked the dsa show?

            <p>Hello Anna You,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be a few things causing the delay, it would be best to contact customer support to go over all possible reasons. From just the quick description, as long everything has been setup to allow for your website to be tracked and if there are no editorial
 or draft issues on the ads themselves, the ads would be eligible to serve in the current open markets for Dynamic Search Ads. Dynamic Search Ads are still in pilot&nbsp;and are not yet available in all markets. It is also possible that the targeting is not yet
 rolled out. During the rollout period on pilots it is recommended that customers have both dynamic and standard search ads available so as not to miss out on potential customers. These are all best guesses based on limited information.&nbsp;For the best answer
 please contact your account manager or customer support to look specifically into your account.
</p>

 to have skype on my mobile, now nothing happens. Just stuck on the Date of Birth page.

            It sounds like you may have mis-typed your gmail email address when purchasing. You should try to contact customer service of the vendor and explain what happened so they can correct your email address and send you your product key.

<h2>            I am trying to get a Brother QL500 add in to show in the menu items so that I can use the Brother QL500 to print labels from WORD. In a prior version&#40;WORD&#41; I would highlight the address, hit the icon and then print the related label. </h2>
                    
<p>When I view the add ins available on WORD 2010 I cannot see the QL500 (Ptouch) Icon.</p>
<p>I can print to the QL500 if I select it as a printer but it does not print the proper info in the correct format.</p>

<br />
Most likely, you need an updated version of the add-in for Word 2010. Such a version&nbsp;may not yet have been released.

                    <p>Just today, if I try to open Internet Explorer from the Tiles/Metro/Modern/whatever-it's-called interface, it opens in desktop mode only. &nbsp;In Internet Options Programs Tab, under "Choose how you open links", it is stuck on "Always in Internet Explorer on

            Hey Cadill,<br />
<br />
Thanks for using My Phone Service.<br />
<br />
Could you check the amount of data that you have on the portal that you might be trying to sync to the phone?<br />
Also is the 85MB of memory including&nbsp;any storage card?<br />
<br />
Inorder to check with the issue, instead of deleting contents, you could archive few items on the portal (probably the ones that you might not need on the phone)so that they retain on the portal and will not be synced to the phone.&nbsp;And try syncing again.<br />
Please note that when you archive items which are already synced to the phone and sync, they will be deleted on the phone but are still stored intact on the portal. If you want them back on the phone later, you can restore the contents and sync.<br />
Let us know if it can sync this time.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile please feel free to share your comments and suggestions.<br />
<br />

<h2>            How to delete messages in MS Outlook 2011 for MAC</h2>
                    Hello!<br />
I'm newbie in MAC OS that why sorry for simple question. <br />
So using MS Office 2011 for MAC with all actual updates installed on MAC OS 10.8 Snow Leopard. When I trying to delete message from any folder I:<br />
- select this mail<br />
- press &lt;Delete&gt; button from menu or &lt;Backspace&gt; from keyboard<br />
and nothing happens.<br />
<br />
Mail is not deleted and cursor that selects mail moves down to the next mail. Sometimes if I press &lt;Delete&gt; or &lt;Backspace&gt; two or three times I can delete message but it doesn't happen all time.<br />
Also I trued to reinstall Office and use it without any patches and updates, but it don't helps me.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advanced.<br />
<br />
Yury.<br />

<h2>            Getting indicator that my incoming call&#40;s&#41; are being missed but there is no ring when the call comes thru...</h2>
                    My skype app worked fine originally, but for some reason when I am receiving an incoming call (phone to phone), I am only now getting an indicator that the call has been missed.&nbsp; Mine is a Samsung Galaxy &amp; the other is an LG6. Both are having the same
 problem. We both get our own video feed but the calls for some reason are not working now. They both do not indicate an incoming call. They did when I had set up the account but I can't figure out why this is happening now.

            Hi, I recommend you to follow mobile connectivity issues.  You can try to reinstall the app, and try to disable your wifi. To log in, skype only require user and password, not mayor configuration.

            Indeed, you can delete the backup identities. They were created when rebuilding your identity in the past.
<div><br />
<div>If you’ve found you’re not missing any mail or information from before those rebuilds then you’re probably not going to miss them if you delete them. Since they’re at least two years old the likelihood you’ll ever need to return to them is extremely low.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps!</div>

            While you can delete the old backups gaining 50 GB is most likely not going to solve your problems with not having enough free space to rebuild. More info:
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://www.officeformachelp.com/2007/09/rebuilding_a_damaged_database_that_exceeded_size_limit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.officeformachelp.com/2007/09/rebuilding_a_damaged_database_that_exceeded_size_limit/</a><br />
<div><br />
<div>Buy a large external drive and clone your drive. Boot from the external drive to do the rebuild. You can partition for other options after the rebuild. With all the sales now you can probably find a great price. Someone said they found the 3T Seagate for
 $99 recently.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>I like the Seagate USB 3.0 Backup plus drives. Works on USB 2.0 ports. I don't recommend Western Digital because of the boot problem with some of their drives. You will need to boot from the drive. They come formatted for PC but easy to format in Disk
 Utility.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Buying a second or third TB cost very little extra and gives you a lot of additional choices down the line.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For example:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB USB 3.0 $88.48</div>
<div><br />
<div>Seagate Backup Plus 2 TB USB 3.0 $92.68</div>
<div><br />
<div>Seagate Backup Plus 3 TB USB 3.0 $117.00</div>

<h2>            Remove message from thread</h2>
                    <p>I often send the same email to a number of people and it is important to be able to keep all the responses together - something I love about the group by conversation option.&nbsp; But:</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I remove a message which has been sent under the wrong subject?&nbsp; I often have this problem - people just seem to click on the last message from me, no matter what the subject, to talk about something completely different.&nbsp; This message then gets added
 to the conversation given in the Subject line, and I'm left with a thread from one contact on two different subjects, all under the one Subject.&nbsp; How can I split off one message to add it to the correct conversation, whilst keeping the other where it belongs?&nbsp;
 I'd rather not have make a second copy in order to file them into their individual categories, particularly when sensitive information is involved.</p>

            You can't split it from the thread using a native outlook feature. 
<br />
<br />You can use a macro to split (or join) threads. I have one at <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/developer/code-samples/merge-split-conversations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/developer/code-sample...</a>
