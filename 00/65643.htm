<p><span>Hi Rolly1932,</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes third party software may interfere with the installation of the Microsoft’s Lifecam software. Place the computer in a clean boot state
 and then install the Lifecam software on the computer. You can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Before you start the Lifecam software installation again,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">uninstall
 the existing software from programs and features</a></strong> completely.</span></p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 TypeCover issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris_5556  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 TypeCover issues</h2>
                    I just purchased the Surface pro 3 about 3 days ago, I have installed all the updates that msft has provided, but I am having issues with the typecover pro that I bought with the pro 3. My pro 3 is saying the typecover is not connected even though I am
 currently typing on it as im writing this, the trackpad scrolling does not work, the computer says there are no drivers for the typecover and will not apply the fix when I try to update the driver, and about half the time the typecover will not connect to
 my pro 3 even though it is physically connected to the computer. I am having connectivity issues and one second the typecover will work, then it will not work a second later and then I have to disconnect and reconnect the typecover. Any help to fix this connectivity
 and driver issues? Otherwise everything works great on my pro 3 just the typecover is having issues.

<br />
<br />So it jumped to 99%, and did it finish? Where does the PC stand right now? 
<br />
<br />If you have concerns, we could entertain a fresh install of windows. If you have a free USB drive, we can get this done. 
<br />
<br />let me know!

<p>Yeah it finished and i am writing to you from the same laptop now.</p>
<p>Windows installed normally after that 99% but my concern is about that jump from 40% to 99% while resetting the pc.</p>
<p>(To make sure we are on the same page) I am talking about the part before the installation of windows 10 where it just says "resetting this PC" with a black screen. The windows 10 installation part comes after that and this part went successfully.</p>
<p>So do you think this means that resetting my pc was incomplete/unsuccessful ? Does it mean it is not exactly the way it was when it came out of the factory ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks !</p>

            Thank you so much for the detailed info. Honestly you should be fine. I’ve seen this time and time before, where even though the number of % isn’t progressing, the process is still moving forward, and makes one big jump (like it did to you)<br /><br />I’d reboot a couple of times, log in, and if everything looks and feels good, you’re in good shape!<br /><br />Hope this helps!<br />- C

<h2>            Nvidia GTX 970 Display Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Nvidia GTX 970 and I recently restarted my PC. I do not know if any updates were installed during this time. But I know that when I turned my computer back on the next morning it wouldn't boot correctly</p>
<p>
</p><p>The BIOS would start, but the text were extremely enlarged, after that windows would load but once it go to the log in screen everything went black and my monitor said it had no video and I had no mouse cursor obviously.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all the tricks I found online and they only thing that has allowed me to login was disabling my Nvida card and deleting the driver. The weird part also is that when I removed the card and went to my on board card I couldn't get a display at all,
 even during the BIOS launch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any help in solving this would be greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<h2>            Trouble with One Drive &#91;onedrive.live.com&#93;</h2>
                    <p>How do I delete files on One-Drive? There seems to be no option to do that.</p>
<p>I am talking live with a Microsoft&nbsp;rep named Marvin, who seems to be just a young kid who can't understand what I'm asking him.</p>
<p>This new Windows 10 setup seems to be pushing this One Drive account, so I logged in to the account website, and I see it has some of my personal and secret files, and some in a folder named "shared". &nbsp;I do not use this often, and I don't have much use for
 this, but I do not want the whole world having access to these files. &nbsp;I do store them on my hard drive, and back them up on USB thumb drives. &nbsp;I have no need to do more backups, since I need to update or re-create files after a few years anyway.</p>
<p>So, the problem is, basically why is onedrive a part of Windows 10 automatically, why was it set up? &nbsp;It is possible with all my multi-tasking, that just a mouse click did this? &nbsp;Fine, but the problem really now is that there is no way to delete or remove
 the files, especially the ones in the folder marked "shared".</p>

    <title>Why Windows XP is better and Windows 8 sucks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ntekniklaus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why Windows XP is better and Windows 8 sucks</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was DUMB of you to no longer support XP, but that's just me. Now you're just telling people to upgrade to Windows 8.1, and people DON'T WANT TO UPGRADE TO 8.1. Windows XP was easy to use. This can be explained because the start menu had all
 the accessories, and games, etc. Not only that, it had one of the best games you put in Windows: 3D PINBALL. Now Windows 8.1 RUINED THIS. There is NO accessories or games folders in the start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Windows XP was great for business. I saw computers running XP everywhere, and it made me happy. And they still run XP. It's clear that they need good security, SO WHY DID YOU NO LONGER SUPPORT SECURITY ESSENTIALS FOR XP? OH, I KNOW! YOU WANT THEM TO EITHER

            <p>If XP was out when you were 1 years old, then you're likely no older than 13 or 14 (and certainly type like it), and have no concept of computer security, or why XP was an exception in the world of software. Enjoy your viruses as time goes on.</p>

            I Agree with you. For home users windows XP is the best operating system ever created by microsoft. It is the most user friendly and least complicated to use OS. For security, there are many well known security packs available as freeware and for low costs.
 So XP should not be considered unsafe if you have a security suit (I prefer AVG). As far as speed is concerned, Xp takes a little more time in some tasks than 8. But when 8 hangs it takes a lot more time than xp to get back to normal. I would say microsoft
 has created the versions of windows after Xp in a rush to compete with other OSs in the market and did not really care much about making it easier to use.

            <p>XP was a security risk. No third party program fixes the issues that are found in the core OS going forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I like how your post contradicts itself that it's the best OS for home, yet it takes longer to do tasks.</p>

<p>first of all. go to the store and grab the legacy pinball. second of all MSSE anti virus is the lowest grade anti viral **** anyone has to offer. even microsoft techs will tell you that. a plastic bubblewrapped computer could catch a flu with that installed,
 so yea i agree but avg made in the former czechslovakian republic? i think not. try avira free, made in germany. kicks the llama's a** but xp was nothing but vulnerability laden and laced and 7(with or without sp1) was supposed to cover that but again another
 nightmare. 8? all i can say is hahahaha, without the point 1 it was nothing short of vista's sister, lol. now 8.1 with the update is flawless. all programs work whether you use compatibility mode or not. now lets look at 10. an operating system that will work
 seamlessly alongside any other OS and an up &amp; coming success story. so far so good with even some of the most stubborn programs outperforms xp, vista, 7 &amp; 8. not too sure yet whether to bone it up to 8.1 though. if you're going to cry about it, please dont.
 no one wants to hear it. if you are please go back to xp. you wont like what's become of it.

<h2>            How to turn off family features</h2>
                    <p>Good(whatever time of day it is when this is read),</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same Microsoft account for a couple of years now and I never had any problems with something like this before, I recently played with my brother on his Xbox One and since I never played on it before (because of pcmasterrace and all) we had to
 add an account. We thought nothing of it and I logged in with my Microsoft account, which went fine but something strange happened after that. My account turned into a child account(I'm over 18) and I was placed in a family with my brother. After a while my
 account got recognized as an adult again and I left the family. But still when I try using chrome or firefox the - Microsoft family features - won't let me and now I'm bound to use this hellish edgy browser.. Does someone know what is going on and how I can
 fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance</p>
<p>
</p><p>(also google turned to ''safesearch'' for some reason and I can't figure out how to change this either)</p>

            <p>Hi KristinaIsak, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What exactly are you referring when you say 'my start windows doesn't work'? Are you unable to work with Start Screen?
</p>

<p>
</p><p>They say in the chat they have reported it. When something is reported it needs to be investigated to see what is going on. some investigations can take a while. We understand your frustration, Just give it a bit to see what happens.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes to the computer before this happened?</span></p>
<p><span>Csrss.exe is a vital component of the Microsoft windows operating system. It stands for Microsoft Client/Server Runtime Server Subsystem. This process is responsible for dealing with the majority of the interface of windows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the steps provided below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span>T<span>ry to set your computer in
</span>Clean Boot state and check if the same issue occurs.</span></p>
<p><span>By setting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:</span></strong><span><br />
</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After clean boot troubleshooting step, follow <b>
Step 7</b> in the provided link to return your computer to <span>Normal startup mode</span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span><br />
The issue may be caused also by your security program such&nbsp;as anti-virus or a Windows Firewall /Defender which might have conflicting settings as to not to perform certain tasks. I suggest that you temporary disable the anti-virus and firewall and check the
 result again. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Disable antivirus software: </span></strong><span><br />

<p><span><br />
<strong><span>Important Note:</span></strong><b> </b>Make sure to enable the security software and firewalls on the computer after checking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></span></p>

<h2>            When I try to play Fallout 3, my Xbox 360 freezes to a grey screen and is unresponsive...</h2>
                    
<p>Okay, so long story short, I was offline for a long time.&nbsp; While I was,&nbsp;I bought and played Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition.&nbsp; Now I am back online and when I try to play Fallout 3 after about 4 mins the disc drive suddenly stops spinning and my 360 freezes
 to a grey-white screen... anyone encountered this or know what to do?&nbsp; This may or may not be related but I have also noticed that my Fallout 3 Achievements are always shown next to my Avatar. even if it isn't my most recent game played...</p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Ok so as asked what I did is to delete my Fallout 3 saved games and uninstall the DLC (this is the GOTY edition). &nbsp;The problem hasn't happened since then, but obviously I want to install the DLC again soon. &nbsp;The disc is not very scratched, I know how to
 take care of my game discs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can Fallout 3 be safely installed? &nbsp;I can't remember exactly when the install feature became available, but I remember Halo 3 was not supposed to be installed and maybe other games are like that?? &nbsp;This particular issue (with the disc drive noticeably and
 rapidly powering down and then the grey-white screen) has only happened with Fallout 3. &nbsp;I have had other minor freezes with other games, of course, but this one seems worse and specific to Fallout 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As stated in my original post, my Fallout 3 Achievements are always shown next to my avatar even if I play other games, which is weird, right? &nbsp;Could that be related?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks so far guys,</p>

<p>Thanks for answering, Rose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I am getting no error messages</p>
<p>2) maybe the last two to three weeks</p>
<p>3) i have not installed anything big recently except Flash updates, latest Java version, and the Microsoft updates. After the most recent large Microsoft update I tried out Microsoft Edge - I have only been using Chrome (most) and Internet Explorer (very
 little) - and after first use of Edge it seemed to make the problem very noticeably worse. I wondered about the interaction between the two, maybe a conflict, but I couldn't really repeat anything consistently. After the last update I also seemed to experience
 more trouble with downloads from DropBox (online) which also seemed to aggravate the problem, but again, I couldn't confirm a link.</p>
<p>4) I've installed and run Malwarebytes - no problems. I've uninstalled Dropbox and reinstalled - all seemed fine. I uninstalled Dragon Naturally Speaking - most recent change and have not reinstalled - maybe this has worked but haven't had enough time to
 really confirm this. I've run SFC - no errors or problems; I've run various diagnostics from Settings (file explorer, internet, search) - reported no problems; I did a search index rebuild - it did not make any difference since problem remained while it rebuilt;
 i ran the&nbsp;Powershell DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth - no problems reported; I tried to identify which process was using the CPU (cannot remember which one it was) - I stopped it and problem reduced for a while but returned. That's what I can remember.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>I've got more information on the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Started up computer without anything else this morning. (There was a message from OneDrive to do something, which I selected.) Then, just looking at Task Manager processes, doing nothing else. At first Microsoft Search Protocol Host and Microsoft Search
 Filter Host are hovering around 15% each of CPU. Then MS Protocol Host drops off and MS Search filter Host hovers around 20-35% CPU. Then, for no apparent reason, MS Search Filter Host starts chewing up more CPU, 40%, 50%, and then System kicks in with 30%
 up to 45%. Then after many minutes both drop away.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>An update on my problem:</p>
<p>I have not been able to find out what the problem is or whether there is a specific solution.
</p>
<p>However, the occurrences of these events of high CPU usage is now <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
a lot less</span>, perhaps once or twice a day, still showing exactly the same symptoms I described. It is not clear at all to me what helped or what did not help.</p>
<p>Some Windows updates have been applied in the mean time, and I have had updates to DropBox and Flash as well.</p>
<p>It is now very difficult to anticipate the event, so it is not worth investing further energy into it.</p>

<h3> wendy jm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Logitech M275 wireless mouse and K345 wireless keyboard no longer working - receiver has no driver</h2>
                    <p>I've been using combined mouse and keyboard (MK345) for about a year with no issues. Following some recent Windows 10 updates they no longer work. I can see on this forum and others that this seems to be a common issue.<br />
<br />
I've tried multiple fixes found on this forum and others but cannot get them to work. Troubleshoot through Windows says no drivers for the USB receiver but can't find any drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device Manager shows the USB receiver but that it has no drivers. Update drivers results in message that none can be found.<br />
<br />
Downloading software - Setpoint and Options - doesn't work as they need to read the receiver and with no drivers, it can't be read. I also tried Unifying software but it also won't recognise that the USB receiver is plugged in, so won't work.<br />
<br />
I have tried the USB receiver in multiple ports but it doesn't work in any. Also tried two other Logitech mice and one Microsoft mouse and none of them work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of them work in another laptop that is running Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ports all work for other devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help please!</p>

</p><p>I kept trying to find a solution, and when working through the Windows updates log, I could see that the update mentioned by Andre had been applied but by clicking on it, I accessed its details, which included notification that the update was causing issues
 with some USB devices. It provided a fix, at the link below. After following the fix, my keyboard and mouse are now working.</p>

            Have you considered... Linux? Linux is customizable to a much greater degree than Windows, and is much easier to deal with. You can choose what desktop environment you want, what distribution you want, and basically everything else within your distro and
 DE. If you want to give it a shot, I recommend Ubuntu for a first-time Linux user; check out

<h2>            Xbox One Fortnite Bundle - Missing Eon Cosmetic Set &#38; VBucks</h2>
                    <p>I purchased the Xbox One Fortnite bundle and have used the DLC code to install the game, this has worked fine. However, the Eon Cosmetic Set and VBucks have not appeared against my profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone through every support instruction available on Microsoft.com/support but have not been able to resolve this issue. Trying the code again simply results in the 'This code has already been used' message which is really infuriating because I know
 this and is in fact, the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can someone advise me how I can contact someone at Microsoft (I've already gone to Epic, they say it's a Microsoft thing) without using the useless 'chat to a gamer' facility please?</p>
