    <title>Mail Merge losing superscript formatting - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mail Merge losing superscript formatting</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I am trying to use mail merge to transfer numbers with superscript following them (i.e. 1st, where 'st' is in superscript). I am transferring the text from an Excel file to a Word document using Mail Merge, but I haven't had any luck retaining the formatting.
</p>
<p>I also tried to figure out a way to make Word change the text to superscript automatically after the merge is complete, but I'm not sure how to do this either.
</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated!</p>
                </div>

            I think that the only way you will be able to achieve that is to split the field in Excel into 2 or 3 parts so that the characters that are required to be in superscript are in a cell by themselves and then for the merge field that contains those characters,
 replace the \* MERGEFORMAT (if there is one) in the field code that is displayed in Word when you use Alt+F9 to toggle on the display of the field codes with \* CHARFORMAT, or add that inside the closing field delimiter } and then apply superscript formatting
 to the M of MERGEFIELD.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Assuming the ordinal number is the only thing in the column, you could use a field in Word coded as:</p>
<p>{QUOTE{Set Val {MERGEFIELD&nbsp;MyField \#0}}"{=Val \#0}{IF{=(MOD({={=Val}+89},100)&gt;2)*(MOD({={=Val}+9},10)&lt;3)}= 1 {=MOD({=Val},10)-2 \#
<span><sup>rd;st;nd</sup></span>} <span><sup>th</sup></span>}"}</p>
<p>where 'MyField' is your field name and the 'rd;st;nd' and'th' strings in the field code are all superscripted. With this approach, it doesn't even matter whether the Excel data are in an ordinal format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if the mergefield&nbsp;returns a date, it's possible to use field coding to apply superscript numbering (e.g. 29<span><sup>th</sup></span> October 2014). For the basic field coding to do that, see 'Insert A Date with Ordinal Numbering' (from which the above
 example is derived) in my Microsoft Word Date Calculation Tutorial, which you can download from:<br />

Do read the document's introductory material.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The field brace pairs (i.e. '{ }') for the above example are created in the document itself, via Ctrl-F9 (Cmd-F9 on a Mac); you can't simply type them or copy &amp; paste them from this message. Nor is it practicable to add them via any
 of the standard Word dialogues.&nbsp;The spaces represented in the field construction are all required.</p>

            <p>1. The following field coding (with or without an enclosing QUOTE field) may be a little more obvious for many, at least assuming that they understand what "mod" does.<br />
<br />
<span>{ SET v { MERGEFIELD MyField \#0 } }{ v }{ IF { v \*Ordinal } = *h <sup>th</sup> { =mod(v,10)-2 \#<sup>rd;st;nd</sup> } }<br />
<br />
(You can lose a few more spaces in there if you prefer, but the same notes apply as inPaul's message, i.e. primarily that all the { &nbsp;} have to be the special field code braces that you can insert using ctrl-F9 on Windows Word). In this case, you also have to
 ensure that the { v \*Ordinal } field is formatted as English language.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
2. If your Excel sheet happens to contain the ordinals in a format where there is some kind of space between the number and the "Ordinal indicator" st, nd etc., and every single value in the column is in that format (no empty cells etc.) then you could in theory
 achieve this using the \*MERGEFORMAT switch. You use<br />
<br />
{ MERGEFIELD MyField \*Mergeformat }<br />
<br />
Then you show the <em>result</em> of one of the values, and format the result so that</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;a. the ordinal indicator (st, rd etc.) is superscripted<br />
&nbsp;b. the spacing character is either hidden or made much smaller (e.g. using a small font size.<br />
<br />
That's really what \*Mergeformat was originally intended to achieve, but it is so dependent on the consistency of the data that I doubt if many people rely on it.<br />
<br />
3. Again, in theory, if you are merging to a single output file, e.g. via a Directory merge (Catalog merge on Mac), you could postprocess the file using autoformat. You would need to go and find the Option in Word-&gt;Options and put it in your QAT. Then, when
 you open the dialog box, you'll need to go into the Options... and uncheck everything except the "Oridinals (1st) with Superscript" option. (It may be different on Word 2013). But I wouldn't entirely trust that not to change other things unexpectedly.</span></p>

<p>Purchased XBox PC version of Angry Birds Star Wars.</p>
<p>Appears to install, but when you click on the "open" button, a quick Angry Birds screen reverts back to Windows Store with the reinstall button displayed, and the message that there was a problem and that you should reinstall. BUT, when you Do reinstall,
 the same process just repeats. Uninstalls do not fix the problem either</p>
<p>Details show an error code of 0x80070020.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The initial issue took several days, but I think also posting the issue in the Windows 10 Feedback forum may have helped folks troubleshoot.
</p>
<p>Since there is now a "Reproduce" button one can use, all you have to do is click on that and Microsoft collects the data while you repeat the steps that are resulting in problems/issues.</p>

<p>
</p><p>By leaving your current DNS records as is, Intermedia will continue to be responsible for handling your emails. By adding&nbsp;your domain as a non-authoritative domain in Office 365 Exchange Online, any internal emails&nbsp;for that domain will be delivered directly
 to any mailbox that has been migrated to Office 365 already but any emails with an address of that domain that can't be resolved internally will be delivered to Intermedia via your current MX records.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make sure external email for people that have already been migrated to Office 365 are still being received, the address still needs to exist on the Intermedia server (the authoritative server for your domain) as well and must be forwarded to Office 365.
 This can be done by using the obligatory @yourtenantname.onmicrosoft.com addresses of the users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once every email address has been migrated, you can switch the MX records and make the Exchange Online service authoritative for your domain.</p>

<h2>            Office Home and Student 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased a new Laptop and at the same time i Purchased a copy of Office Home and Student 2016. I activated MS Office with no problems at all. However the laptop in question had a lot of faults and was returned to the shop for a full refund including
 the Office Home and Student Licence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few weeks later i found a different laptop and purchased this, again along with a second Home and Student 2016 Licence key as the first one was refunded in full by the shop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have logged onto myoffice on line account and entered in the new licence key and this was accepted without any issues what so ever, i can still see the old one on there as well.
</p>
<p>I click the "Install" button on the web page making sure that I am definitely selecting the correct Licence key i.e. the one added this week. However MS office will not activate once installed. I just get the "This product has been activated by another PC"
 message but this is not the case at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas as uninstalling and reinstalling office makes no odds. i have done it a couple of times now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is gratefully received as i have spent £100 on a life time subscription and it feels like i have been banging my head against a wall for a life time trying to get it to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

            <p>It would be unusual for a seller to have refunded your Office purchase, usually they refund the defective PC, and you can reinstall your purchased 2016 on the new PC, having first de-activated the first install</p>
<p>In your MS Account page deactivate the old install before installing your version<br />

            <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>many thanks for your reply,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not see how to deactivate the old licence. I have removed all devices from my account and uninstalled Office again and reinstalled from the Install link in my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>when office first loads up after a fresh install i get a pop up that comes up and asks me select which product i want to use as two have been detected to my account. i have tried both and i still get the same issue that the product can not be activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is getting so frustrating now, having spent £100 on MS office i did not expect it to be this hard. All i want is for my MS Office products to be activated and licenced so that i can use the laptop for the reason i purchased it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            since upgrading from 8.1 and then performing a reset really bumped up the glance feature

&nbsp;a full wipe/flash would be perfect (just to be sure nothing is interfering with anything). well that requires that all relevant apps/features are already present in the image.

<p>That is a favorite request, even I look for this. Especially because the procedure via the Upgrade Advisor took more than three hours and in case of some phone models kills the app in Settings » Extras, as you mentioned. Until then, p<span>lease,

<h2>            Extremely annoying account problems</h2>
                    The other day, I created an account to try the new xbox one streaming feature to windows 10. But I was unable to sign into my account and it would automatically go to "signing out" as soon as I put in the password. I deleted the account, but whenever I
 go to make it again, it says "An account using this microsoft account already exists on this PC." It doesn't show up when I view the accounts in command prompt or under "Other Accounts" in PC Settings, is there any way to completely delete it in file browser,
 or is there another way?&nbsp;

            1. I am able to sign into xbox on my main account, turns out it wasn't connected to an xbox account but is now.<br />
2. The only account I can sign into is the account I had when I set up my PC for windows 8. It is a microsoft account.<br />
3. I do have access to my account.<br />
4. No, the issue is on the windows accounts. I am unable to create and delete accounts, as they don't show up.<br />

    <title>Outlook app on Windows phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spud451  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook app on Windows phone</h2>
                    <p>Hiya</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my phone installed the "outlook mail and outlook calendar" version 17.8241.41276.0 several days ago I can no longer receive email on my phone. I can send email I just can't receive it, even email sent to myself. When I select to synchronise manually
 it appears to run, I'm not getting a visible error of any sort, its just not working and I can still see email in my inbox which I have deleted or moved to a folder on my laptop connecting to the same account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this problem, if so do you know how to fix it?<br />
</p>
<p>It's the account associated with my Microsoft account so I don't seem to be able to drop and recreate it without doing something drastic and other than this the phone is working well. I've already tried looking for any additional updates, there were none,
 and shutting down the phone and restarting it as was suggested on older posts relating to similar issues but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the information you have provided, we suggest that you perform a hard reset on your phone. This process will bring your phone back to factory settings, the same state as when the device was first turned on. All apps, messages, media, personal settings,
 etc&nbsp;will be removed from the phone. Please create a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17232/windows-10-mobile-back-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">backup
</a></strong>to avoid data loss. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Last night, my Windows 10 mobile received build&nbsp;10.0.15063.483 and the issue went away.</p>
<p>Now, even my live tiles for the Outlook app work again, which were also broken in&nbsp;10.0.15063.297.</p>

            I eventually found that owa has an option to review and delete the mobile devices sync'ed with the account (options&gt;general&gt;mobile devices) from there I could see a load of connections, far more than I have devices (although none of them showed a phone
 number in the details) so I deleted all of them and resynced the phone and now all seems well. At least I know what to do it it happens again!

            Hi cytoman, that is yet another feature that is sadly missing from the new Skype app . ..

<br />If you are unhappy with the new Skype app, Microsoft have decided to extend the period for which Skype Classic (version 7) will be available, the September deadline, no longer exists
<br />

            1. This is an issue with latest Skype which is v8. You can't change it.
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you should send this feedback to Skype engineers - Open v8 skype &gt; Click 3 dots on top &gt; Help &amp; feedback &gt; Give feedback 
<br />
<br />Feedback can also be given through Uservoice where you can find the feedback of others and status would be visible to you - <a href="https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-skype-ideas/filters/my_feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-skype...</a>
<br />
<br />2. As a work-around, You can download Classic Skype and use that. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a> 
<br />
<br />Good news is that Classic Skype is not going to be retired. Its last date in service was 1-Sep-18 and it has been decided not stop the services to Classic Skype for some more time. It would nag you for updating to latest version which is v8 which you will have to ignore and tolerate.

<h3> stanfelderman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 Send&#47;Receive Hangs</h2>
                    <p>I have recently installed Outlook 2010 on two computer running windows 7 professional.&nbsp; The system hangs when doing a send receive.&nbsp; I do not have any virus protection installed as that was one thing it suggested to do in order to fix this issue.&nbsp; The system
 is setup with a Pop3 account and that is the one that it hangs on.&nbsp; I have deleted the profile and recreated the profile.&nbsp; I have deleted the pop3 configuration and recreated the configuration, but to no avail.&nbsp; It starts to send/receive and I get the message
 that it sends just fine and then it starts to download say 1 of 4 messages and part way through freezes.&nbsp; I have tried it in safe mode and that still does not work.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting the question. As per your description you are facing issues with send/receive in Outlook. Let me assist you with the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before troubleshooting the issue, I need more information:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Does the computer hang/freeze<span>&nbsp; </span>the Outlook application while performing send/receive in Outlook?</span>
</li><li><span>Does this issue occur on both the computers?</span> </li><li><span>Were you able to work with Outlook prior to the issue?</span> </li></ol>
<p>In order to troubleshoot the issue then try the steps below:</p>
<p>If Outlook hangs/freeze then you may follow the troubleshooting steps mentioned in this article and check if the issue occurs:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2652320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2652320</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However if the computer hangs/freeze while performing send/receive in Outlook, then start the computer in Windows clean boot mode and then check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the link below to know on how to start computer in clean boot:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>Note: Ensure to start the computer in normal mode once troubleshooting is completed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean boot is performed to disable all startup programs and 3rd party services on the machine and check if they are conflicting with the Office program.</p>
<p>If so, you may disable the unwanted software those conflict with the suite or get them updated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I am having a similar issue also.&nbsp; I am running Windows 7 Professional 64 bit version.&nbsp; I was running Outlook 2010 via my Office 2010 Professional installation.&nbsp; Everything was working great.&nbsp; On or about the time Microsoft issued the Office 365 upgrade,
 I noticed my sync function on this computer degraded.&nbsp; I sync the same account with an iPad, Android phone and several other computers running Outlook 2007 or Outlook 2010.&nbsp; None of the other devices have this problem.&nbsp; I originally thought this was an Office
 365 problem and contacted&nbsp;support for a remedy.&nbsp; This included running in safe mode, recreating the profile, etc.&nbsp; Once we determined the OWA version worked properly, their assistance ceased.&nbsp; In addition to the steps above, I have repaired my Office 2010
 installation, repaired my OST file, disassociated an archive PST file, uninstalled Office 2010 and replaced with Office 2013, removed that and reinstalled Office 2010, upgraded browse

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Did you setup the same email on a secondary computer and got the same results? was the secondary computer on the same internet?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) If you were able to send only some emails and not receive any, did you check your advanced settings and make sure you are using the proper ports?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) If you are using a pop connector, did you try uninstalling the connector and reinstalling it? (this step is beneficial for home server or SBS users where the server runs exchange that utilizes a pop connector)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Verify the profile settings again: make sure you put the correct details in the right field (example: some emails requrie the username to include the domain:
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** where others only require the username: username. so again make sure this info is correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) Wait for send/receive to spit out an error and report back. if no error, what percent does it hang at?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>on a side note - You said you disabled antivirus. I don't ever recommend this especially if you are storing your emails locally on the computer via pop. Make sure you re-enable this and do a scan.</p>

            <p>Thanks for responding, but I am not sure you read my entire post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; In it I stated that I have the same account accessed on various devices including iPad, Android phone and other Windows computers running Windows 7 and either Outlook 2007 or 2010.&nbsp; None of the others display this latency.&nbsp; Same Internet????&nbsp; Do you
 mean same domain? Each of these devices accesses the Hosted Exchange under Office 365 in its own fashion.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I did not say this.&nbsp; I stated that on startup, my Outlook sends and receives all messages appropriately.&nbsp; However, after a few minutes, nothing happens in a timely manner.&nbsp; New messages, both in- and out-bound take 20-30 minutes to send or arrive.&nbsp; Outbound
 messages just stay in the Outbox until they clear.</p>
<p>3. No pop connector.</p>
<p>4. How can I have the wrong details when they are filled in automatically by autodiscover?&nbsp; Remember, these work find on other Windows computers and smart devices.</p>
<p>5. No error.&nbsp; Generally hangs at 50 or 75 percent.</p>
<p>Antivirus was temporarily disabled to test effect.&nbsp; It was then re-enabled.</p>

            <p>I found the source of my problem.&nbsp; It was Office 365.&nbsp; After month after month of support calls, recreating my profile, etc., I finally gave up.&nbsp; I transferred my hosted Exchange account from Microsoft's 365 offering to Rackspace and set up my account exactly
 the same.&nbsp; I imported all of my messages and the problem disappeared.&nbsp; Microsoft refunded several months of fees and my mail works not and has for a couple of months without issue.&nbsp; I personally believe the initiation of Office 365 which simulates Office 2013
 was the source of my issues.&nbsp; Prior to that upgrade by Microsoft in February, 2013, I had no problem and nothing but good things to say about the service.&nbsp; Afterwards, cans and string would have been more effective.</p>

            In reply to your questions<br />
Yes, the Outlook application freezes after a few seconds, but notably more on one IMAP account than another (I have two).<br />
It occurs on my laptop as well as on my PC.<br />
I was able to work with Outlook 2013 prior to this.<br />
I have tried <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2652320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2652320</a> to no avail.<br />
I gather from the huge number of postings (under various headings) that Office and IMAP&nbsp; commonly cause freeze problems.
<br />
Like other I am getting to the end of my tether over this.<br />
Thank you.<br />

 work in my situation.

    <title>Cannot forward emails from company mailbox to a Yammer group. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot forward emails from company mailbox to a Yammer group.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a rule in Outlook that emails meeting certain criteria should be automatically forwarded to a Yammer group, but they never appeared there. The network administrator said that they were, however, sent to the Yammer group email. The same rule
 works perfectly with other Emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could be the reason? Is it possible to resolve this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Daria</p>

            <p>I have this same problem. My "stuck" reminders are from opening other colleague's calendars in my outlook. These are reminders for their appointments that show up on my outlook. I can't dismiss any of them and as new reminders popup, the list continues to
 grow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have removed their calendars from outlook, I have removed my own account and re-added it and they remain. I have tried to add their calendars back again and tried to dismiss and they still don't go away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a very annoying bug.</p>

            <p>I also had this huge pain after upgrading to office 2016 but I got it to work.. I use an exchange server, so it may not work for you. Do at your own risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create a folder on your desktop named outlook_backup. Close outlook. Open the terminal. Change directory to the Events folder. Type in:</p>
<p>
</p><p>cd&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">/Users/{your_username}/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/Main Profile/Data/Events</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ln here and you will see a bunch of folders if you type in the 'ls' command. You will want to delete all of them. But, to be safe, let's instead just move them all to the outlook_backup folder you created
 earlier.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">mv * /Users/{your_username}/</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Desktop</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">/outlook_backup</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Then, open outlook again. Your calendar will be empty (because you deleted all of the events). But, after a few seconds it should be repopulated after synching with your exchange server.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If this does not work for you, just close outlook and move it back.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">cd&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">/Users/{your_username}/Desktop/outlook_backup</span></p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t receive the reset password email from instagram.  Please help</h2>
                    <p>Instagram reset my password, and I can't seem to receive the email link, via Hotmail.&nbsp; I've looked in the spam folder, I've checked blocked list, and even added instagram to&nbsp;safe senders list, as well as a rule.&nbsp; Something is blocking them.&nbsp; I am confident
 that my email address with them is correct, as I have been able to reset passwords in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp; There doesn't seem to be a way to communicate with Instagram, but their (useless) help guides point to check with the email provider.&nbsp; Please help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to hear that you are still unable to receive the email from Instagram for password reset even after following the suggestions of my colleague. I have checked your account and noticed that it is working fine on our end. I suggest that you contact
 the support team of Instagram to check if they are receiving any error messages or bounce message when sending an email to your account or if the issue is on their end. Furthermore, please provide the exact steps that you have done when resetting your Instagram
 password in the Private Message tab that was opened for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will wait for your reply.</p>
<p>

            The solution is to go to options in outlook. Under the "writing email" section go to "reply-to address". Click on "other address" and type your hotmail address in the blank section. Then press save. Now send the password reset email from insta again it
 should work. This is a simple solution. They retard microsoft mods should get off their butts and find a job theyre good at.

    <title>Word 2010 Mailings tab is empty - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bob16&#35;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2010 Mailings tab is empty</h2>
                    <p><span>In Word 2010 (part of Office Home &amp; Student 2010), when I click on ribbon tabs like Home or Page Layout, numerous selections appear in the dropdown box below the ribbon. However, when I click on the Mailings tab, the dropdown
 box appears but it is empty (there is nothing to click on or select). </span></p>
<p><span>I ran the Repair function for Microsoft Office Home &amp; Student 2010 through Control Panel but nothing changed. What can I do to make my Mailings tab functional so I can print labels and envelopes?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My old computer is running Windows 7 Home Premium, Service Pack 1.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Would appreciate any suggestions. </span></p>

            <p>Thanks for the advice. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to paste a screen shot into this message but it wouldn't paste. When I click on the Mailings tab, the dropdown box appears- it is about an inch or so tall and extends from side to side in the Word window (just like it does for the other tabs) but
 it is completely blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I started Word in Safe Mode, the tab did look different. All of the options for Mailings appeared but they were all in gray and nothing would happen when I clicked on any of them.</p>
<p>I went to the section on Add-ins in the article you suggested. I made sure that all Windows/Office updates had been installed. It had been updating automatically but one update downloaded &amp; installed when I updated manually.
</p>
<p>I tried starting Word with the /a (as described in the article) but the Mailings tab was still empty. There are multiple additional options listed in the article. I don't have anymore time to work on this today or tomorrow. Fortunately, the point of this
 exercise was to print some labels but that can wait. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you think of any other suggestions, please let me know. I will provide additional feedback when I can try more of the options.

<p>

<p>
</p><p>and that by the "dropdown Box", you mean the items that appear outlined in red in the following screen shot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/611215ba-51d9-42ae-a39a-ebd2632808b0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/611215ba-51d9-42ae-a39a-ebd2632808b0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you double-click on any of the ribbon tabs, the ribbon will remain expanded.</p>

    <title>Remove Duplicates In Excel with Additional Criteria of Another Column - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geofftri  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remove Duplicates In Excel with Additional Criteria of Another Column Having a Value</h2>
                    I have an excel file that was exported from contacts in Outlook. &nbsp;This is a large file of several people's contacts mushed together. &nbsp;I would like to remove duplicates in a manner that favors the contact with the most information. &nbsp;For instance if two
 contacts have the same name and e-mail but only one has a phone number then I would delete the one without the phone number and keep the one with a phone number. &nbsp;How can I do this?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For instance:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Row 1 has the same value in column D as row 2 does but only row 1 has a value in column E</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So this would mean in our real life scenario that only Row 1 has a phone number, so we'd delete row 2 and keep row 1.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</div>

<h2>            Trend Micro toolbar not showing in IE 9.0.1</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesturday i installed Trend Micro Titanium&nbsp;Internet Security 2011. I found out that there is no Trend Micro toolbar! This afternoon i went to trend micro community, to discuss about this and I have been told that&nbsp;Trend&nbsp;Micro toolbar is compatible with IE
 9.0.1 and they told me to&nbsp;do this uninstall IE 9.0.1&nbsp;uninstall trend micro, reinstall trend micro and update it, and finally reinstall IE 9.0.1. I did this, but IE 9.0.1 still not showing trend micro toolbar.
</p>
<p>I also tried this, at the top right&nbsp;hand corner of IE 9.0.1, there is a screw button. I clicked that, clicked on manage add-ons, under toolbar and extensions, i scrolled down and enabled two functions under trend micro! Restarted IE 9.0.1, and same result
 no trend micro toolbar showing!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also wrote to trend micro community of what have happend after reinstalling trend micro and IE 9.0.1 at the moment i am still waiting for a reply! At the meantime, can you help me about this. Thanks.</p>

<br />Now I have been creating some folders and rules on the Outlook.com (web based outlook) but I don't see the folders or rules in my office outlook.
<br />How can I fix this, if possible. also will the rules work when I am not logged in to the outlook.com
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Rules you create in outlook.com on the web will process the mail as it arrives, whether you are logged in or not. You may not see the rules in Outlook desktop due to a change in the rules engine - but there will be an alert in the rules dialog if this is the case, as seen in the screenshot.
<br />
<br />If you added the account to Outlook desktop as an Exchange account (the default account type when you use auto account setup), it will sync all of the folders in the Outlook.com account with Outlook desktop. 
<br />
<br />If you switch to the folder list (ctrl+6) do you see the new folders you created?<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8843794a-80cd-4da3-96ab-0b0ead3d0ec5?upload=true" />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a GMAIL account.</p>
<p><del>I have set it up Outlook 2016 with IMAP.google.com</del></p>
<p>(I am unable to find the exchange server address, m.google.com doesn't work.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me explain further:</p>
<p>I have created in outlook.com different folders and rules for e-mail.</p>
<p>Now when I go to Outlook on my desktop, outlook 2016 <del>the folders are not there</del>, also there are no e-mail rules.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have been playing around and found the following option.</p>
<p>On my Desktop outlook I changed the IMAP and pop server to Outlook365.com and i am logging in with my Microsoft account (also my gmail address) I noticed that the folders I had created on outlook.com have now appeared in Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>I tested it also the other way around, I created a folder in Outlook 2016 and it indeed appeared in Outlook.com</p>
<p>It looks like this is a nice work around for now</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, the following have not worked yet and need solving:&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The rules have not imported from outlook.com to outlook 2016.</p>
<p>- Contacts, how to sync from Google to Outlook?</p>
<p>- Calendar has not imported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

<br />I have set it up Outlook 2016 with IMAP.google.com
<br />(I am unable to find the exchange server address, m.google.com doesn't work.)
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Google no longer allows Outlook 2016 connections using exchange active sync. If you have a paid G-Suite account, you can use their sync utility. 
<br />
<br />The only way to sync contacts and calendar is using the g-suite utility or using a 3rd party utility - companionlink or gsyncit. 
<br />
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />I have created in outlook.com different folders and rules for e-mail.
<br />Now when I go to Outlook on my desktop, outlook 2016 the folders are not there, also there are no e-mail rules.
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Is it an outlook.com email address? 
<br />If the outlook.com account is setup as Exchange (it is the auto account setup default), then folders will sync down. Rules will sync down too, unless they use values not supported in outlook desktop.

    <title>PC Wizard telephone scam - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jo-cornet  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC Wizard telephone scam</h2>
                    My Mum (in her 70s) has a laptop running Windows 10. She uses it for Facebook, online banking, a few games and Amazon. Recently she admitted that she had called a phone number, 0800 014 8983, having received some kind of alert that her computer had errors.
 As a result she spent 1.5 hours on the phone, plus received a couple of call-backs. During the course of this the caller accessed her computer and deleted lots of "bad files". He also removed the anti-virus software and acquired her bank details - in fact
 she authorised a payment, believing him to be a bona fide PC technician. Yesterday PC Wizards took a payment of £140 from her bank account. We phoned the bank and reported it to their fraud centre, and they will be refunding it. We also reinstalled AVG, and
 ran the Microsoft malware detection tool. But I'm worried that someone might still have access to her machine and could cause her a problem. I believe at some point they may have installed something like Team Viewer. What else sh

</p><p>Things have not changed.</p>
<p>There is no malware/virus scan that will help.<br />
</p>
<p>Once someone untrusted has remotely accessed your computer, you have little choice other then a&nbsp;<strong>Win10&nbsp;clean install, or Win10 Reset</strong>&nbsp;and to change all your passwords from a secure device, or after the clean install. Contact your financial
 institution.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You can try a Win10 reset, but it may not get all the areas of the computer that may be infected or the hacker might be hiding their hacking utilities (i.e. a D-Drive or an old Mfg recovery partition).</p>

<p>For the protection of what is important (if win8/10):<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Make sure your FileHistory backup is up-to-date (right click start, control panel, FileHistory-Turn it On). (it requires a usb external harddrive (Windows 8/10 will, automatically, create the FileHistory folder on the usb drive, when FileHistory is turned
 On); &nbsp;or network harddrive can be used (make a 'FileHistory' folder on the Network Harddrive to connect the app to).... If you keep things in non-standard places, make new Libraries, and add the folders to your custom Libraries. Check to see where quicken
 , printer scan-to folders, or any other user installed software is saving data. &nbsp;(You can backup quicken/intuit programs to a OneDrive folder, but&nbsp;<em>do not</em>&nbsp;let database files reside in OneDrive; &nbsp;although, they can be included in Libraries (and probably
 already are), they will not backup when open. &nbsp;(some (other) databases can not be restored easily from raw data alone).<br />
