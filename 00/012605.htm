<h2>            Outlook failing to sync messages with mail account on Outlook.com servers</h2>
                    <p>My Goal:</p>
<p>I have a PST file&nbsp;that came from an Exchange Server export that I want to sync with my Outlook.com account.&nbsp; In years past, with Outlook 2010, MAPI, and the old Hotmail servers, this worked flawlessly, even with multi-gig PST files.&nbsp; In fact, I could just
 copy folders and messages directly from the Exchange account to the Outlook.com account.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem:</p>
<p>Today&nbsp;this is broken.&nbsp;:( Thanks MS for breaking what used to work.&nbsp; Thanks for making your own mail products incompatible.</p>
<p>There is some bug in Outlook 2010 and Outlook 2013 just isn't capable.&nbsp; I'm hoping there is a solution for Outlook 2010, but I can't understand why it worked before and doesn't now.&nbsp; Any help would be most appreciated.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Outlook 2010 I can open my PST file&nbsp;and open my Outlook.com account.&nbsp; I can copy all of the folders and messages.&nbsp; Outlook 2010 correctly builds the OST file for the Outlook.com account.&nbsp; However, the upload to the Outlook.com mail servers never works.&nbsp;
 Outlook just churns FOREVER with a running "send process" in the Send/Receive window.&nbsp; No progress is ever made.&nbsp; In the meantime, Outlook chews through 25% CPU endlessly trying to process the&nbsp;upload of messages in the OST file to the server while accomplishing
 nothing.&nbsp; Actually, it chews through disk time, as well, always reading and writing to the OST file.&nbsp; However, the OST file&nbsp;size never changes and no progress on the upload is made.&nbsp; If I log into my Outlook.com account via IE, all the folders are there, yet
 no mail.&nbsp; The folders are empty.&nbsp; Outlook has been churning on this for 3 days now.&nbsp; I've deleted the OST file and started over, but the same problem just recurs.</p>
<p>Interim workaround:</p>
<p>In August 2013, using Outlook 2013, I was able to upload 99% of my PST file to Gmail via IMAP.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was just short of being perfect.&nbsp; I still have this account as a tool to move mail between programs, so I have some flexibility to suggestions.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempted workarounds:</p>
<p>Win 8 Mail:&nbsp; Unfortunately, I can't just use my Gmail copy of my PST file.&nbsp; Having several windows 8 devices I want to manage this account through Win 8's mail app.&nbsp; Bad experience with Gmail and Win 8 mail.&nbsp; Too many bugs to explain here, just know it is
 not a solution.&nbsp; So, I need these messages in an Outlook.com account as it works flawlessly with Win 8 mail app, Win Phone 8, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Outlook 2013:&nbsp; Outlook 2013 doesn't support MAPI.&nbsp; ActiveSync, the default protocol for Outlook 2013, isn't capable of moving messages between accounts.&nbsp; You cannot copy messages from outside of an account into the account, whether it be an account-to-account
 copy or a PST-to-account copy.&nbsp; :( Thanks MS for dumbing down Outlook's capabilities.&nbsp; Why do customers lose functionality when "upgrading" to newer products?</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMAP has always been a little bit&nbsp;buggy in any Outlook version.&nbsp; More significantly, the Hotmail servers and Outlook.com servers have NEVER supported IMAP correctly.&nbsp; Combine the two and using IMAP in Outlook 2013 instead of ActiveSync is just a dead end
 for the MS account.&nbsp; Worse, IMAP in Outlook 2013 used to work well enough to upload messages from a PST file&nbsp;to a Gmail account, but there are significantly more issues using Outlook 2013 and IMAP today.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; Again, thanks MS for breaking what used to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Mozilla Thunderbird:&nbsp; Opening my Gmail copy of my PST file in Thunderbird, I was able to make a local Thunderbird copy of my messages.&nbsp; I can access my Outlook.com account in Thunderbird via IMAP, but as I mentioned before, IMAP has major bugs on the Outlook.com/Hotmail
 servers.&nbsp; So, while&nbsp;I can move my mail between GMAIL accounts &nbsp;at will using IMAP in Thunderbird, Thunderbird is worthless with Outlook.com accounts and IMAP.&nbsp; :( Thanks MS for not supporting industry standard protocols.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That gets me to where I am today.&nbsp; I do have a possible solution, but it's feasibility is extremely low.&nbsp; If I&nbsp;use Outlook 2010 to individually create folder in my Outlook.com account, I can copy just the mail messages from my PST folders to the Outlook
 folders.&nbsp; If I do this 1 folder at a time, if I verify using Outlook.com that all messages have uploaded before going to a separate folder, I can move my mail.&nbsp; Yet, I have several hundred folders.&nbsp; The time it would take to accomplish this is just unreasonable
 to actually do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly I can do the same thing in Thunderbird.&nbsp; Copy messages folder-by-folder.&nbsp; It just takes forever.&nbsp; And, if I initiate a second folder copy before the first is complete, the initial copy is aborted<span>, just like in Outlook.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There must be a way to move messages into an Outlook.com account.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to move mails and folders to Outlook.com email account in Outlook 2013 you would need to setup the account as IMAP, you may refer to the section
<strong>'Apps that support IMAP and SMTP</strong>' to get the email settings to setup Outlook.com as IMAP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/send-receive-from-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/send-receive-from-app</span></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note : Do not move all the&nbsp;emails / folders at once as it would take&nbsp;a longer time to sync with the server.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Let us know if you need any further assistance and I will be glad to help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Deepak,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are quite obviously replying without having fully&nbsp;reading my question.&nbsp; You are insulting my intelligence by jumping to conclusions.&nbsp; Please actually read my messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I pointed out in my first post there are numerous IMAP bugs in the outlook.com mail servers which are legacy.&nbsp; Doesn't work with Outlook 2013 IMAP, doesn't work in Windows Live Mail 2011 IMAP, doesn't work in Thunderbird IMAP.&nbsp; Bugs, bugs, bugs.&nbsp; Didn't
 work previously as Live mail, didn't work before that as Hotmail.&nbsp; These are legacy bugs that I'm certain MS will never fix because IMAP is an industry standard protocol that doesn't force users to buy MS mail client products.&nbsp; In fact, I'm betting IMAP is
 intentionally broken on Live mail servers as a strategic decision.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh sure, you can DOWNLOAD new mail over IMAP from the Live mail servers and read it.&nbsp; Yet, try to sync a preexisting Live mail account with an IMAP client that has years worth of historical mail and folder structure and it never even comes close to succeeding.&nbsp;
 FAIL!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even worse, in the past year Microsoft has introduced previously unseen IMAP bugs into the Outlook 2013 mail client.&nbsp; Despite the bugs in the Live mail servers, IMAP in Outlook 2013 worked flawlessly with Gmail servers a year ago.&nbsp; I should know, it's how
 I uploaded my multi-Gig PST file to Gmail.&nbsp; TODAY, it doesn't even work with Gmail anymore.&nbsp; Nice job on breaking previously&nbsp;functional code.&nbsp; FAIL!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried Gmail uploads with Outlook 2010 and IMAP, and it still works.&nbsp; Like I said, these are new IMAP bugs in Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FAIL and FAIL.&nbsp; Your suggestion fails on both the server and client ends.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically concerning IMAP and Outlook 2013, I have some folders with over 5k messages.&nbsp; Outlook never succeeds in transferring even JUST the emails as you have suggested.&nbsp; It will fail over IMAP before the transfer is complete.&nbsp; Once that occurs, Outlook
 2013 never reattempts to sync the server to the OST file.&nbsp; You can click send/receive all day long.&nbsp; No errors and no data transfer.&nbsp; You are forever left with an OST file that doesn't match the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whereas Outlook 2010 and the Hotmail connector used to successfully sync large uploads over MAPI, it fails today as well.&nbsp; New bugs.&nbsp; Outlook 2010 will create the folder structure, but gets stuck forever trying to sync the mail messages between the OST file
 and the server.&nbsp; Every time it goes through a send/receive cycle it gets parked FOREVER trying to finish the sync but sits there moving ZERO data.&nbsp; While there is no network activity, it does chew through CPU time and disk time.&nbsp; Who knows what it's doing
 reading and writing to the OST file, but nothing ever changes.&nbsp; It will run for days in this state.&nbsp; No errors are ever reported, either.&nbsp;&nbsp;What's really odd is you can cancel the send/receive process, yet Outlook still churns through processor and disk resources,
 forever stuck.&nbsp; The only way to stop this loop is to close outlook and delete the OST file.&nbsp; FAIL!!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the Windows Live Mail client has NEVER worked correctly with IMAP and the Live mail servers.&nbsp; NEVER!&nbsp;In fact, Windows Live Mail doesn't even work correctly with Gmail over IMAP.&nbsp; FAIL!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Btw, I can transfer hundreds of folders and hundreds of thousands of messages via IMAP in Thunderbird to Gmail servers and guess what, IT WORKS!!!&nbsp; Little surprise&nbsp;as neither are Microsoft products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I connected Thunderbird to the Live Mail servers over IMAP and tried to transfer my PST folders.&nbsp; I works WAAAAAAY better than Outlook, but never actually succeeds.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunderbird created about 95% of the folders and moved about 40% of the mail over IMAP.&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
 Thunderbird doesn't use a local cache like an OST file to track sync progress.&nbsp; Therefore, once the Live Mail servers fail the transfer at a random point, you can't just restart a sync and have it pick up where it left off.&nbsp; You have to empty the folder and
 start over from the beginning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since your suggestion is clearly bogus, maybe you could offer a real suggestion?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even better, maybe you could file bugs against both Outlook 2013 and the Live mail servers and get IMAP fixed!</p>

            <p>I'd like to reiterate that IMAP doesn't work with the Windows 8 mail app, either.&nbsp;&nbsp;I simply tried to read my Gmail account that contains the upload of my PST file.&nbsp; The Win 8 mail app just churns forever giving me the circular progress indicator and NEVER
 finishes loading even just the message headers.&nbsp; If the folder is small enough it works.&nbsp; If there are a few thousand messages in a folder, FAIL!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's really hilarious, you can delete a Gmail folder using the web client.&nbsp; Go back into Win 8 mail app and it never figures it out.&nbsp; It thinks the folder is still there.&nbsp; The Win 8 mail app doesn't seem to be able to update it's folder structure over
 IMAP, so once a folder is created you're stuck with it forever.&nbsp; Of course you can delete the account and start over, but then it will take weeks waiting for the partial account sync that never actually succeeds.&nbsp; Who would want to go through that torture
 again, for something that will ultimately fail anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and don't do anything so foolish as try to delete a folder in the Win 8 mail client and expect it to work.&nbsp; Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the legacy continues . . .</p>

            <p>Deepak,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to prove a point, I did a test following your instructions to use IMAP and not copy 100% of the messages, and it failed miserably.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should file a bug.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Using Outlook 2013 client I&nbsp;copied 1 folder from the PST file&nbsp;to my Outlook.com account, including all it's messages, and that folder had less than 3k messages in it
<ul>
<li>Success, the OST file was synch'd to the mail server</li></ul>
</li><li>In the Outlook client I copied&nbsp;5 folders from the PST file to the Outlook.com account, no folder had more than 800 messages in it.&nbsp; Each copy was initiated serially so the copies were queued
<ul>
<li>Success, the OST file was synch'd to the mail server</li></ul>
</li><li>Using Outlook client, in the destination Outlook.com account I created 8 new folders, then folder-by-folder copied just the messages from the same 8 folders in the PST file to the new destination folders (as opposed to copying the whole folder).&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>No folder had more than 1,500 messages in it. </li><li>These 8 copies were all created serially and queued up.&nbsp; </li><li>In total almost 6k messages were&nbsp;copied </li><li>Success, the OST file was synch'd to the mail server</li></ul>
</li><li>Within Outlook client, in the destination Outlook.com account I created&nbsp;12 new folders, then folder-by-folder copied just the messages from the same&nbsp;12 folders in the PST file to the new destination folders (as opposed to copying the whole folder).&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>No folder had more than 2,900 messages in it.&nbsp; </li><li>These&nbsp;12 copies were all created serially and queued up.&nbsp; </li><li>There was a total of&nbsp;just over 14,000 messages</li><li>FAIL, the OST file never synch'd to the server.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Some of the folders were never created</li><li>Only about 2,200 cumulative messages were transferred before the hung synch</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>To be very clear, Outlook copied the folders and messages to the OST file associated with the Outlook.com account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The failure occurred during&nbsp;the sync operation to the Live mail server, the sync never finishes.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>There are no errors</li><li>I have 34% CPU on a quad core processor</li><li>I have 27% disk activity on an SSD</li><li>I have <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">zero</span></strong> network traffic.&nbsp;
</li><li>Looking in Resource Monitor, the CPU time is being consumed by Outlook.&nbsp; </li><li>The Outlook send/receive window indicates "Processing", no errors.&nbsp; </li><li>If I close Outlook my CPU and Disk activity drop to normal idle levels.&nbsp; If&nbsp;I reopen Outlook&nbsp;the same state resumes.&nbsp;
</li><li>Outlook client resumes trying to sync the OST file contents to the Live mail server, but there is no network traffic, so nothing is being accomplished despite lots of CPU and Disk activity.
</li></ul>
<p>The only way to recover from the failed stated was to blow away the OST file, let Outlook sync to the server, then start copying from the PST file, again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if the number of folders involved was the problem or the number of messages.&nbsp; Takes hours to test this, so not feasible for me to do.&nbsp; Your CSS team could easily setup repro on this and figure it out.</p>
<ul>
</ul>

            <p>I have some new info for you Deepak. &nbsp;Wanting to know if the number of folders was the culprit or the number of messages I created three folders with a lot of messages in them. &nbsp;Folder 1 - 5k, Folder 2 - 7.5k, Folder 3 - 12.5k messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They all copy successfully from the PST file to the Live mail account in the Outlook client, meaning the OST file is updated correctly. &nbsp;Getting Outlook client to sync the OST file to the Live mail server was a chore. &nbsp;I did get it to work, eventually, but
 I had to trick it:</p>
<ul>
<li>When sync would get hung I would have to copy a handful of duplicate messages in the folder (and later delete them). &nbsp;That would force the "Synchronizing subscribed folders" process in Outlook client to resume</li><li>It appears any of a number of things cause the syncing to be stopped. &nbsp;Even merely copying other messages in an unrelated folder breaks an in-progress sync operation.</li></ul>
<p>So, now I needed to see what happened if I copied many small folders, and if there was a threshold where just the folder count itself caused sync to get hung. &nbsp;Turns out, that can happen with as few as 2 folders!! &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>So, with folders that have fewer than 200 messages each, I can kick off a copy operation of 100 folders from the PST to the Live mail account within the Outlook client</li><li>Sometimes Outlook actually manages to generated all of the destination folders (not the messages, just the folder structure), but this is inconsistent</li><li>It NEVER copied more than 5% of the messages. &nbsp;With that many folders, getting the sync process resumed was utterly hopeless. &nbsp;I couldn't find any way to outsmart the hang.&nbsp;&nbsp;No workaround.</li></ul>
<p>This happens with as few as 2 folders, remember.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, the ONLY possible means of copying mail is to folder-by-folder create the folder structure in the destination account by hand.&nbsp; Then, folder-by-folder select-all on the messages in a single folder&nbsp;and copy them from the source folder to the destination
 folder.&nbsp; Even then success is not guaranteed.&nbsp; I found since my last post that the IMAP sync may still get hung for a single folder.&nbsp; You may have to delete the messages that were copied into&nbsp; the destination folder and start over.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, the folder structure may become corrupted.&nbsp; To fix that problem you have to delete the folder out of the Outlook client and login to the web client to delete the folder off of the server.&nbsp; Then you can start over copying that folder in the Outlook
 client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reiterate to you that in the Sept 2013 timeframe these problems did not exist.</p>

            Found out that sometimes the Outlook client sync with IMAP to Outlook server is so screwed up, you must blow away the entire OST file, let Outlook client build a new OST&nbsp;file that is synch'd to whatever state of progress you were at&nbsp;when it previously
 failed, and then resume moving messages.&nbsp; Huge&nbsp;waste of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>I ran into sooooooo many IMAP bugs in Office&nbsp;2013/2010&nbsp;I have finally given up.&nbsp; I went back to using Outlook 2010 and MAPI.&nbsp; Still buggy, but I could actually get it to work.&nbsp; If you don't have Outlook 2010, you can use Windows Live Mail 2011 (It's even
 more buggy that Outlook, so go slowly), which also connects over MAPI, to move mail between accounts.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; If you're trying to upload mail from a PST file to your Outlook.com account, an&nbsp;Outlook client is the only software that reads PST files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For anybody hitting similar issues, here's what I did:</p>
<ol>
</ol>
<p>Add your Outlook.com/Live.com/Hotmail.com/MSN.com email address(es) to either Outlook 2010 or Live Mail&nbsp;2011 (Outlook is much preferred if you have access to it)</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're copying from a PST file, open the PST file in Outlook&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>There are lots of things you can do.&nbsp; The most painstaking way and nearly 100% reliable way is:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're just copying/moving a few messages, copy your messages from folder to folder and click the Send/Receive button to force a sync</li><li>If you want to copy entire folders
<ol>
<li>Create a new empty folder in the destination account, </li><li>Select-all on the messages in the source folder and copy them to each destination folder</li><li>Click Send/Receive</li><li>Via the web client, login to your account and check that all of the messages have synch'd by checking the message count</li><li>Repeat with the next folder</li></ol>
</li></ul>
<p>If you have a lot of folders to copy, the above method can take forever and it's tedious.&nbsp; There are two other, faster, ways to get the work done.&nbsp; First, login to the Outlook.com web client so you can see what progress has been made on the server (note
 you have to refresh to see changes):</p>
<ol>
<li>Try to copy whole folders, including all of the messages in that folder, into the destination account
<ul>
<li>This can hang if you do more than one folder at a time, so click send/receive after each folder copy and wait for the synch to complete</li><li>Do NOT do this if a folder has subfolders.&nbsp; In this case, the failure rate is very high, use method 2</li></ul>
</li><li>By hand, create the empty folder structure in the destination account, then once complete, copy the messages folder-by-folder.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>It's best to login to the Outlook.com web client to create the folder structure
<ul>
<li>Either that or you have to hit Send/Receive after the creation of each new folder in the Outlook/Live Mail client, which is slow and tedious&nbsp;(creating 2 or more folders. then hitting send/receive,
</li></ul>
</li><li>You can queue up several copy operations this way.&nbsp; Select-all to highlight all the messages in a folder, copy them to the destination folder, and repeat for successive folders, then click Send/Receive
<ul>
<li>Be careful here, getting greedy and queueing up too many copies will result in the synch from the Mail client to Outlook.com account to hang</li><li>Just do 3-4 folders worth of mail at a time is best.&nbsp; I have had luck doing this for up to 8 folders, but it's unreliable.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ol>
<p>If the sync between the Outlook/Live Mail client and the Outlook.com server gets hung there are two ways to fix it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look on the web client and find the folder that was in-progress when the copy hung (hint: look at the message count in the web&nbsp;folder and compare to message count in the mail client to know)
<ul>
<li>Delete that folder in the web client</li><li>Delete that folder in the mail client</li><li>Hit Send/Receive</li><li>Start over creating the empty folder and copying&nbsp;it's messages</li><li>Sometimes the mail client's local cache file gets corrupted and you cannot get the new folder to synch with the server, move to step two</li></ul>
</li><li>Close the Outlook/Live Mail client and delete the OST (or equivalent Live Mail file type) local cache file on your PC.&nbsp; Open the mail client and let it rebuild the OST file by downloading folders and mail from the server.&nbsp; Once that process is completed,
 resume your upload copying.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, this is a huge PITA and took me several days to complete, but hey, all my mail lives in the cloud now, and I can access it anywhere anytime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gmail was having problems with this many folders and messages over IMAP.&nbsp; Their servers are PATHETICALLY slow.&nbsp; So, want to find a message, have fun searching it in something like the Win 8 mail app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Outlook.com servers are WAY more efficient at this.&nbsp; Now I can search my mail on my PC, my phone, or from anywhere in the world with an internet connection via Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's refusal to fix all these bugs is still in total disregard of their hundreds of millions of users.&nbsp; How can a company be so arrogant?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will they ever update ActiveSync to allow copying messages into a mail account?&nbsp; They could because it already works with contacts.&nbsp; Why stop there?&nbsp; Contacts work correctly but mail doesn't?&nbsp; Stupid.</p>

    <title>Transferring Music from phone to SD card on L730 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> l925  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transferring Music from phone to SD card on L730</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased L730, White, India with Lumia Denim out of the box. I downloaded few songs from the Mix Radio which were saved on the phone's internal memory as I did not have HC SD card initially. When I purchased it, I wanted to transfer all the music
 to the SD card.</p>
<p>I first tried to transfer it from with in OS using 'Files' but couldn't as it can't transfer folders. Need to enter each folder and copy songs individually. It's impossible as there were too many folders.</p>
<p>Second, I connected the phone to PC via USB and tried to copy form phone memory to SD card directly -&nbsp; from phone's music folder to SD card's music folder. But it used to get stuck up after some time. There was no progress for a very long time. If I press
 'cancel', the process gets cancelled but phone hangs which needs soft reset to get back on.</p>
<p>Third, I copied music from phone memory to PC and from PC to SD card - the process to extremely slow, taking 2 hours just to transfer 144 MB of music, even then it shows error copying some songs randomly.(Can Not Copy. The device has either stopped responding
 or has been disconnected.) The device is connected and working fine.</p>
<p>I downloaded all files from Mix radio - all DRM free. I wanted to maintain the directory structure as I received from Mix Radio, did not want to dump all music files in one single folder, so phone creates albums list properly. The card is transcend SDHC
 4 GB card. Also I formatted it from within the Lumia 730.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

    <title>Not receiving all emails - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Not receiving all emails</h2>
                    I am not receiving certain emails, specifically from companies I have an account with. I have changed my password, viewed in several browswers and checked that the emails were definitely sent. However as others are coming through, sending myself test emails
 isn't helping. Please help! <br />
Example: I did my online shopping yesterday, have received no confirmation emails (I normally would) and on checking my account with the supermarket online, everything is fine. This has happened noticably several times over the last couple of weeks. I've accused
 a company of not delivering a product when actually they emailed me 4 times to try and contact me.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
We understand how you feel about the situation of being not able to receive e-mails. I have provided the following suggestions:<br />
<br />
<p><span>You can check to make sure you haven't set up email forwarding on your account.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
1. Sign in to your account.<br />
2. Click <strong>Options</strong> and then <strong>More options</strong>.<br />
3. Under <strong>Managing your account</strong>, click <strong>Email forwarding</strong><br />
4. On the <strong>Forwarding</strong> page, click <strong>Don't forward.</strong><b><br />
</b>5. Click <strong>Save</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> If the radio button is on the <strong>Forward your mail to another email account</strong> and there's another address inside the box, we can conclude that there's another account receiving the messages that should be sent to you. However,
 the steps above will set your email address as the default receiver of your emails.<br />
<br />
You might want to check the Blocked Senders, to see if those contacts are in the list, remove them and add to the Safe senders. Please refer to the following steps:<br />
<br />
<strong>Check your Blocked sender list</strong></span></p>
<p><span>1. Sign in to your account. Go to inbox.<br />
2. Click <strong>Options </strong>located at the upper-right side of the page.<br />
3. Select <strong>More Options</strong>. <br />
4. Under <strong>Preventing junk email</strong>, click <strong>Safe and blocked senders</strong>.<br />
5. Click <strong>Blocked senders</strong>.<br />
6. In the Blocked senders list, select the name or domain (the part of an e-mail address that follows the @ sign, such as hotmail.com) that you now want to receive mail from, and then click<strong>&lt;&lt; Remove from list.</strong><b><br />
<br />
<strong>Add the email address to your Safe senders list</strong></b></span></p>
<p><span>1. Sign in to your account. Go to inbox.<br />
2. Click <strong>Options </strong>located at the upper-right side of the page.<br />
3. Select <strong>More Options</strong>. <br />
4. Under <strong>Preventing junk email</strong>, click <strong>Safe and blocked senders</strong>.<br />
5. Click <strong>Safe Senders</strong>. <br />
6. In the text box, type in the email address or domain you’d like to always receive email from, and then click<strong> Add to list &gt;&gt;.<br />
<br />
Check E-mail rules<br />
<br />
1. Sign in to your account</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>2. Click the gear icon at the top right portion</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>3. Select More mail settings</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>4. Under Customizing Outlook, click Rules for sorting new messages</span></strong></p>
<strong><span>5. Check to see if there’s a rule set-up to forward e-mails to an account(<i>you can delete it by ticking the check box and selecting</i> Delete)</span></strong><br />
<br />
I have sent you a private message . Make sure to sign in tot his forum and click on the red texts saying you have a private reply.<br />
<br />
Thanks!

    <title>Renewal date for Office Personal did not change when I loaded it. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobbibarb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Renewal date for Office Personal did not change when I loaded it.</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased an HP Envy with Windows 10 and 30 day trial of Office 365.&nbsp; I don't know which version (home or personal, etc.) originally came with my HP.&nbsp; According to my Microsoft account, the 30 day trial started on December 22, 2015 and will end
 on January 22, 2016. I purchased Office 365 Personal for 1 year and installed it a few days ago.&nbsp; When I completed the installation, I received a Microsoft&nbsp;message stating the installation was successful.&nbsp; However, I noticed after I completed the installation,
 the expiration date of the new software did not change, and it still shows the expiration date of January 22, 2016, not January 22. 2017.&nbsp; Please advise- is it normal for the old&nbsp;expiration date of January 22, 2016&nbsp;to not&nbsp;change on the date I installed&nbsp;the
 new Office 365 Personal software until the old expiration date of January 22, 2016?</p>
<p>If the date should have changed on the day I installed the new software from January 22, 2016 to January 22, 2017, I need to know why the date did not&nbsp;change for the one year I purchased.&nbsp; Please provide me with whatever procedures&nbsp;I need to&nbsp;change the date
 and verify&nbsp;the date&nbsp;has been&nbsp;updated on my Microsoft account.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to verify that the new office 365 Personal software is&nbsp;installed and the 30 day trial will expire on January 22, 2016 and the new software I purchased and installed begins on
 January 22, 2016 and expires on January 22, 2017.</p>
<p>I await your prompt reply and your assistance is much appreciated. </p>

            <p>Thanks for trying to help me. The following is answers to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I purchased the OFFICE 365 PERSONAL product key card from Amazon. My notebook doesn't have a CD reader, so I got the key card instead. Also, I read reviews that people who purchased the CD had too many install problems and the key card was easier to install.
 &nbsp;I'm now starting to regret thst I didn't buy it direct from microsoft, using my Microsoft account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I installed it by following the &nbsp;instructions that came with the key card-I went to office.com/setup, clicked on RUN, then clicked on YES to indicate its ok for Microsoft to make changes to my notebook. I got an indication that the installation was successful,
 but evidently it wasn't. &nbsp;After I sent my initial note, I found a screen on my Microsoft acccount that offered me to update the correct expiration date to January 22, 2017. I followed the instructions (I entered the product key again, then entered language
 and country options. However, when I entered the required information, I got a message, " You currently have no products stored here. To setup Office 365, please enter your product key and click on "get started") So I followed the instructions yet again, and
 got the same message as above. In other words, I'm caught up in a 'loop'. I would enter the key code, and get the same message over and over again. Then I found an option in my Microsoft account to install office 365 (again), and I followed the install instructions,
 &nbsp;and I got a message that it was successfully installed, but its not, and the expiration date still didn't update. FYI-the address is: setup.office.com/Default/index?referrer=Account</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I'm not sure I understand this question, but since I purchased this from amazon, I didnt have to use my Microsoft account info. Also, I set up my &nbsp;micro soft account before I attempted to complete the install process and nothing in my Microsoft account
 has been changed since I first set up the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I did go to my Microsoft account, and the renewal date is still for the end of the 30 day trial, which is January 22, 2016. However, the date should have upgraded to January 22, 2017, for the one year I purchased (if in fact it installed properly). I
 checked the expire date about 15 minutes ago and there has been no change-its still January 22, 2016, not January 22, 2017, as it should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps get these install issues resolved. Thanks for your continued assistance. &nbsp;I await your reply to this detailed info I've provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>I am adding a message to my previous reply. &nbsp;My display name has now been changed because the problem has been resolved- with the help from a Microsoft tech during a telephone call.I was advised that the problem was because my current email address was not
 linked to my Microsoft account and the product key. Unfortunately, &nbsp;my current email address couldn't be used, so a new one was created. Microsoft office was already downloaded on my notebook, but the expiration date wouldn't update until the 'link'procedure
 was complete, which has been done, and the expiration date is now current.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other microsoft users may not be aware of this issue and how to get it resolved. The link should be completed by a Microsoft tech rep, via a remote link. I thought this info might be helpful to others who have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank all who assisted me in getting this issue resolved.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you purchased and installed Office with a keycard, in the process you would have used/created an MS Account.</p>
<p>You log on to this account on the new PC to deactivate the old install, and install on the new PC</p>

            Rotation lock will be available in the next major software update from Microsoft, called GDR3. This is due to start rolling out in January along with Nokia's Lumia black update.<br />
<br />
A preview version of GDR3 is available now that adds that feature, you can find that by searching the forum or the web but you are probably better just to wait now.<br />

                    <blockquote>Split from <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_winother/language-issues-in-office-365-outlook-client/13f78857-6ce9-4e31-a49c-0d9575b2ae17" title="Split from this thread">
this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Not the OP, but same repeatable problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus Version 1702 (Build 7870.2024). I have installed the English and the German language pack. Both keyboard layouts are enabled. German is the default editing language. English is set as default display and help language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is within the Outlook quick search field. Searching for e.g. "hasattachments:true" does not yield any results. "hatanlagen:true" does yield results. As you can see the rest of the interface is English in my case, but I have to use German search
 operators. Also when clicking on "Has attachments" in the ribbon (or "Subject", or "From") - the search box always gets filled with the German equivalents for the search operators.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Working (with German within English interface (see unread/mentions/all):</p>

<p>Hi Suzanne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bloatware comes preloaded on your laptop and could be software that someone paid to be on there, or it could be something the manufacturer put on. The safest way to remove them is by uninstalling them as if they are normal programs<em> (which they are)</em>.
 Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Remove in Settings</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On the <strong>Start </strong>menu, select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Apps</strong>.</li><li>Select the program, and then select <strong>Uninstall</strong>. Some apps built into Windows can't be uninstalled.</li><li>Follow the instructions on the screen.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Remove in Control Panel</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On the <strong>Start</strong> menu, enter <strong>Control Panel</strong> in the search box and select Control Panel from the results.</li><li>Select <strong>Programs </strong>&gt; <strong>Programs and Features</strong>, and then select the program.</li><li>Click <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</li><li>Follow the directions on the screen.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you need further assistance, please do not hesitate to send a reply.</p>

<h2>            Grayed out Forms Controls in the Developer&#47;Insert Pop-Up window.</h2>
                    <p>I have design mode highlighted in green, but it changes nothing if it is not highlighted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the forms controls are accessible and usable except the last three in the group.&nbsp; These being:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Text Field (Form Control),</p>
<p>2) Combo List - Edit (Form Control), and</p>
<p>3) Combo Drop-Down - Edit (Form Control)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking I want to use #2, but since it is grayed out and inaccessible I can't test this.&nbsp; Is something broken with my installation, or do I need to install some other program (like a full blown version of Visual Basic) to have access to these controls
 for use on my worksheet(s)? Or some other issue entirely?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Perhaps I misunderstand...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further digging found an "article" which said these controls were only usable in Excel 5.0 Dialog Sheets and were not available in Excel 7.0.&nbsp; We are now at 15.&nbsp; If these can't be used currently, and saving the file in 5.0 format does not allow their use
 either, why are they even included in the options anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, maybe I am not understanding.</p>

<p>Im sorry. I didnt make myself clear. The person i want to add does not have a Skype account. Its just a name and phone number. I want to add the name and number to my contacts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done this many times in he past. When i look at my Skype contacts i see many people, including my 93 year old Dad, who are not Skype members. I also see government agencies, hospitals and other numbers that i regularly call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of those numbers were added using previous versions of Skype.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant figure out how to do that using the current Mac version of Skype.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont want to chat with people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to do what Skype was oroginally designed for: telephone calls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, amazing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No one can tell me how to add someone who is not a Skype member as a contact to Skype?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've attached a screenshot of a section of my Skype Contacts. None of these are members of Skype. They are just people or institutions that I call using Skype. I want to add more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I do that?</p>

<p>I assume its too late for you but this might help others as I had a hard time finding it out myself. To add a new contact first use the dialpad to call the number you want to add, then in the bar to the left side of skype right click that number and select
 the option 'view profile'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From there you can add the contact to your contact list and them modify the name from the phone number to whatever name you wish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No idea why they made it so hard, wtf. hopefully this will be fixed with an update meanwhile I hope this will help ppl searching for a way to do this.</p>

<h2>            outlook webapp phone tab not appearing anymore&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have reached the limit of mobile devices attached to my exchange account. I used to be able to log into the outlook webapp, choose options- see all options and the phone tab option would appear on the left hand side.&nbsp;From there I could wipe devices, delete
 old devices, etc. The phone option does not appear any more. In case it helps, this is the email I got:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>"You have 10 phone partnerships out of the maximum allowed 10 partnerships. After you reach the maximum, you can't create additional partnerships
 until you delete existing ones from your account. To do so, sign in to Outlook Web App, click Options &gt; Phone &gt; Mobile Phones, and delete any unused partnerships."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Did something change with the outlook webapp?</span></p>

            <p>This forum is for the Outlook client in Office - the Outlook web app is really an Exchange Server feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, yes, the Outlook webapp changes occasionally when Exchange server is updated. You should find Options at the top right corner of the screen - though that depends a bit upon which version of Exchange you're using (which you haven't said).</p>

    <title>OneNote 2016 Writing Get Scrambled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> briankim26  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote 2016 Writing Get Scrambled</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the Desktop OneNote 2016 to take class notes and do my class assignments. However, I am frequently getting a bug where the written text in my pages are getting scrambled. Lines of texts will be jumbled up and go on top of other written lines. Best
 case scenario is there is a previous page version before the scrambling occurred but I am often not as lucky which results in wasted time having to rewrite sections. A lot of my assignments deals with long equations, so, this rewriting process is often fairly
 time consuming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use OneNote between my Surface Pro 3 and my Labtop. I thought it may have been a syncing issue but even when only one OneNote open at a time, I still get this problem. Unfortunately, I am not able to reproduce the problem on command so I do not know how
 to work around this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice on fixing this problem or at least working around this problem would be appreciated. I like using OneNote to take my class notes and do my assignments (excluding the minor inconvenience during printing). But the scrambling text is something I
 can no longer deal with since fixing it wastes more time than the time I used to save using OneNote (along with the added stress of having to fix up pages with a closing deadline).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p />

    <title>Please explain how to diagnose problems in the Conditional Format - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> esmereldak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Please explain how to diagnose problems in the Conditional Format Rules Manager.</h2>
                    <p>Am I doing something wrong or is this MSNormal?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This project was designed over 8 years ago and has been mostly reliable ever since.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I was updating a column of entries and used Highlight/Delete to remove the old data.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That column is no longer formatted by color as determined by the program.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To explain things at this point would require a thesis to explain how the program works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, I have worked with Microsoft enough to know to that any time I am exploring the bowels of the software that I can inadvertently do a lot of damage long before making any deliberate changes to my project so I am working with a copy of my original.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have traced the problem down to settings in the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager but now have to understand how the CFRM works first.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Is it possible that my using Highlight/Delete would constipate changes back into these settings?<span>&nbsp;
<span>&nbsp;</span>Is it possible that my using Highlight/Delete would constipate changes back into these settings?<span>&nbsp;
</span>I now believe that I have to be cautious about all of the collateral damage I could induce just exploring how this works.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.1) Somehow, probably to do trial and error in the past, I have more than a dozen rules.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I am sure that most of them are not in use.<span>&nbsp; </span>Is there an option to disable a rule or do I have to delete one then check to see if it affected the project?<span>&nbsp;
</span>I get the feeling that if I simply rename one that the change would be reflected throughout the spreadsheet and the renamed rule would still be in effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.2) When I am looking at the text boxes in the “Applies To” column, I scroll down and see a lot of column/row ranges but when I scroll back up, all the column/row ranges disappear, the text boxes are blank.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.3) I click in the line of data and have to left/right navigate it since it does not fit into the unnecessarily short amount of space available.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I hit back arrow key and if I was not specifically looking at the line of data, I would not have seen that it changed the column data instead of moving the cursor.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In order to avoid adding error to the problem, I then have to exit the Conditional Formatting option and start over.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It now looks that if I use any navigation key such as home, end, arrow up/dn etc that it will change the data in the line rather than move the cursor.<span>&nbsp;
</span>How do I explore the row/column data in the field?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.4) For the purpose of diagnosing the problem, I cannot click around the spread sheet to check the data settings if I have the conditional Formatting Rules Manager open.<span>&nbsp;
</span>How counter-productive is that? </p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We just want to follow up on your concern since we noticed that it's been more than 48 hours. Have you already found an answers to your questions? If not,&nbsp; Conditional formatting is mainly used for highlighting cell values for easier visualization of data.
 The only preview that will be shown is what would happen to the formatted cells, and these previews are shown under the Format column:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6758031d-80d5-44e1-bca5-044572104282?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6758031d-80d5-44e1-bca5-044572104282?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>To find out which cells would be affected, check the Applies to column:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7601cef2-515d-47ec-add3-2dae43d8105b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7601cef2-515d-47ec-add3-2dae43d8105b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, =$K$32:$P$34,$K$30:$S$30 from the top rule are two sets of cells where the formula is applied. K32 is the starting point of the first selection, and this selection continues up to P34, which is the value after the colon. The dollar signs denote
 that these cell locations are anchored or absolute, so in case the formula is copied to a different place, the cell location will stay the same. The comma after this denotes a new set of cells where the formula is applied. This is true for all rules. Once
 you check these cell locations, you'll know specifically where each formula is being used. Another way to do it is by clicking the up arrow icons, circled in red above.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to scroll through the document while checking the cells where the conditional formatting is applied, use the scroll bars on the bottom or the side of the screen or the scroll button of your mouse instead of the arrow keys or the navigation keys.
 Using these keys would indeed change the selection. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Check each rule one by one to find out which cells they affect, then delete it or edit it as needed. You can also check this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-change-find-or-clear-conditional-formats-5823680b-8d8e-4f0a-99fb-402b349cb255" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Well, you really have not said anything that I did not know already except to verify that Home, End and the arrow keys have a yuuge potential to screw up everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess there is no way to disable a rule and to check anything, I have to do the finger calisthenics to copy information into a document then delete the rule.&nbsp; Then test the package to see what changes, If it was needed, attempt to recreate the original
 from the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see no option to left/right scroll the row/column data but will check this again<br />
It is so tiresome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really, there is no way to disable/suspend a rule?</p>

<p>Regarding point 3 - First press F2 then use arrow/home/end key. This is applicable for all RefEdit boxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that you have many columns and in each column lot of CF rule applied.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First about any one column pls check below...</p>
<p>
</p><p>A) Regarding "Applies To" box generally we will select entire column. It is rare that you need to apply different CF rule for few cells of a column and then again another CF rule for other cell of same column. It happens if you do copy/paste, insert/delete
 of cells. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that you set "Applies To" to entire column for all CF rule ? Then job will be easier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>B) CF Rules follow order and if not conflicting (in Aspect of Formatting) a cell can have many CF rule applied on it. If lot of CF rule is there, first put them in separate groups. Similar like Rule Manager.</p>
<p>DataBar/Icon, Top/Bottom, Above/Below Average, formula etc. Use separate formatting for each group so that effect of one group is not nullified by other. For one group use Number Tab, for one group use Fill etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then look within groups. You have to check every CF rule at least once if not more.</p>
<p>
