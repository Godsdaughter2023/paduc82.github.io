<h2>            Iomega GDHDU 1TB recognized incorrectly on Windows 7 Explorer</h2>
                    I have a 1TB Iomega GDHDU that I've used with my laptop for an external HD backup (manually). It worked fine. Then my laptop crashed. This drive is only recognized as a USB to ATA/ATAPI Bridge on my other computer, and it doesn't read it from Windows 7
 (laptop was same), but does from AVG and Anti-Malware! I don't want to reformat it, since it has data on it. Thank you for&nbsp;any help.

<h2>            GamePass &#40;Free 1 Month Promo for paying with PayPal&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on the promo on my Xbox for purchasing a month of GamePass with your PayPal account and recieving a free month in return. I spoke with Microsoft Support and they referred me here. Both my Amex and my PayPal account show that I made the purchase
 within the window of the promotion Sept 19th-Oct 31st. I purchased it on Sept 22nd and it is now 10/12 and I still have yet to receive the free code for a month of GamePass in my Inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Support Tag:&nbsp;<strong><span>[Mod Removed – Personal Information]</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Promo Link:&nbsp;https://www.xbox.com/en-US/promotions/paypal-gamepass</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help ya'll can provide will be much appreciated since Xbox Support couldn't help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jordan</p>

<p>When you buy from xbox store you do not get any code in email unless it’s a gift, rather subscription gets applied to your account by itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should already be subscribed to game pass. You can confirm it here&nbsp;<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/services/</a></p>

            My GamePass says it expires on 10/15. The small writing at the bottom says that I will receive the free code in my xbox message center after 2 weeks of purchase which was 9/22. I havent receivee anything and the free month haant been auto applied to my
 account. My GamePass auto renews but I was late paying it that month and took advantage of the promo once I saw it on my xbox. The charge went through on 9/22 within the promo window of 9/19-10/31.

            The gamepass is activated immediately it does not need any code ... you have activated the 22 and it should expire you on October 20 ..... if you have not used it ... well it's pity .... try to download, for example, FH4 from the store with game pass and
 see what it tells you

</p><p>Being that you had an existing subscription to game pass you was only entered in the sweepstakes. As the extra free month was for new subscribers. As the previous posted that line is at bottom of the promo link.</p>

<p>Having just spoken to support, I am very annoyed about the way this promotion was advertised. I received an email from paypal regarding this free month via paypal. These were the T&amp;C's at the bottom:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(140, 140, 140, 1)">* Xbox Game Pass “Bonus Month” offer cannot be combined with any other offer and is only available in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway,
 Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom to all consumers who purchase a single 1-month Xbox Game Pass from Xbox.com, Xbox console or Xbox app using PayPal as their purchase instrument and consumers who currently use PayPal for the their
 recurring Xbox Game Pass membership payments (does not include purchases or payments made with any PayPal branded debit or credit card when used outside of the PayPal wallet). Limited to one bonus month per person. This offer ends on 31 October 2018 or while
 supplies last, and is not redeemable for cash. Codes are valid until 29 January 2019. Please allow 2 weeks for delivery of your bonus 1-month code via the Xbox Message Centre. Microsoft reserves the right to cancel, change, or suspend this offer at any time
 without notice. Xbox Game Pass subscription continues to be charged monthly at the then-current price (subject to change; plus applicable taxes) unless cancelled.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>So this made me eligible for this offer. The email doesnt state further T&amp;C's. As I subscribe via recurring billing I didnt go to the Game Pass website. I also wasnt directed there to read further T&amp;C's. The next time I receive a promo from you, please make
 sure the T&amp;C's clearer than the above, expecially when they get amended 2 days before I receive the promotion and dont state this.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran into the same issue, which was also advertised on Windows Central stating that it also applies to existing accounts. I didn't had reoccurring billing but changed it last month and was billed twice already and also no code.</p>
<p>Here's the link:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/snag-free-month-xbox-game-pass-when-you-buy-one-paypal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/snag-free-month-xbox-game-pass-when-you-buy-one-paypal</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I also read that it will take up to three weeks to receive my code. If it's a sweepstake I would consider the promotion as a rip-off.</p>
<p>The Support Agent also confirmed that I'm eligible for the code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            NVIDIA GeForce 6150SE nForce 430, Version 5.61.32.20.1, Input Not Supported</h2>
                    I have an eMachines ET1161-07 with AMD Athlon Dual Core Processor 4050e 2.10GHz (32-bit OS). Running Windows Vista Home Premium with SP2.<br />
<br />
I recently installed a game from a DVD and when it started to run I received a message on my monitor "input not supported". I tried to reboot several times to no avail. I went into safe mode, deleted the program and&nbsp;changed the screen resolution as I thought
 that was the problem. After rebooting ... Still no go. I did a system restore and that seemed to work for a minute however when the monitor goes into energy saver mode I get the message "input not supported". This only happens on the start up screen. I have
 been able to navigate on my monitor from a reboot to get into my sign on however, I am unable to that on my husbands sign on.
<br />
<br />
I believe that since I installed the program under his sign on that I need to change the resolution and the defaults for NVIDIA GeForce there as well.<br />
<br />
I have been messing around with this since last night and I'm starting to get a wee bit frustrated.
<br />
<br />
Can someone help me please?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            Hi t_idos,<br />
<br />
It sounds like the system is running at a vertical refresh rate that is too high for the monitor to handle. The game that you installed might be a high-graphics accelerated game which would use a high refresh rate that your monitor wouldn’t have supported.<br />
<br />
So, let us try to boot the computer by<strong> enabling low resolution video</strong> mode using the
<strong>Windows Advanced Boot Options</strong> . You can use this mode to reset your display settings. Switch on the computer and use F8 key. Under
<strong>Windows Advanced Boot options</strong> select <strong>Enable Low resolution video (640 X 480)</strong> and hit<strong> Enter</strong> .<br />
<br />
Check if you’re able to sign on to your husband’s account. If you’re able to sign on to your husband’s account, then try setting the resolution
<strong>1280X1024 @ 64hz</strong> on your husband’s profile and check if that works.
<br />
<br />
If you’re still not able to sign on, then boot the computer in Safe mode and then reduce the video hardware acceleration to zero.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Display Settings by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appearance and Personalization, clicking Personalization, and then clicking Display Settings.
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click Advanced Settings, click the Troubleshoot tab, and then click Change settings.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that some video card drivers do not permit you to change settings.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Move the Hardware acceleration slider toward None to reduce or turn off video hardware acceleration.<br />
<br />
Save the changes and restart the computer back to the normal mode.<br />
<br />
By doing this, if you’re able to sign in to your account and not on to your husband’s user account, then I believe your husband’s user profile is corrupted and you need to fix it.<br />

    <title>Unable to download Episode 2 of The Walking Dead Michonne - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> buckswana  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to download Episode 2 of The Walking Dead Michonne</h2>
                    
<p>Purchased the main game and season pass. Episode 1 is included with main game. Should be able to download Episodes 2 and 3 in the game after booting up. When I go to the option screen for downloads, it shows both 2 &amp; 3 purchased, but not downloaded yet.
 When I click on episode 2 to download, I have no option to confirm the (free) purchase. It's a red circle with a line through it. However, episode 3 is perfectly fine and can be downloaded. I know episode 3 just came out, did they somehow screw up episode
 2? Playing episodes 1 &amp; 3 only isn't really what I paid for.</p>

    <title>Transferring Files from microSD card to hard drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomascar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transferring Files from microSD card to hard drive</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to transfer my photos and videos located on my microSD card to my computer's hard drive. &nbsp;When I upgraded to Windows 10, I didn't have a problem doing wholesale uploads of files by plugging my microSD card into my card reader and copying my files
 over. &nbsp;Now, when I try to copy files from my microSD card to my hard drive, the transfer starts at around 80 MB/s, drops quickly to around 20 MB/s, and then zeros out to 0 KB/s. &nbsp;It stays at 0 KB/s and presumably stops transferring my files. &nbsp;I then have to
 abort the transfer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files on the microSD card are fine. &nbsp;I can actually view the pictures and play the videos off the microSD card. &nbsp;I just can't copy those files onto my computer for back-up purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched for this issue, and I've tried many of the recommended fixes, such as running system maintenance and entering all the suggested command prompt commands. &nbsp;It hasn't helped, in fact, I think it may have made it worse. &nbsp;In particular, the transfer
 starts at 80 MB/s and then quickly drops to 0 KB/s, without first throttling down to the lower speeds as before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how to fix this problem would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might cause due to virus. I suggest you to perform a complete System Scan using Windows Defender or any other antivirus software installed (if any) in your computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, check for the issue&nbsp;in a Clean Boot state. </p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when
 you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>

            <p>Still no luck. &nbsp;I tried to back-up my microSD card again today. &nbsp;It has about 1,600 files totaling 25+ GBs. &nbsp;The data transfer rate fluctuated from a high of 80 MB/s, to holding steady around 20-30 MB/s, then dropping down to around 2 MB/s, then to 0 KB/s.
 &nbsp;I was only able to transfer about 40% of my files before the transfer would no longer progress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen that other Windows 10 users had similar problems. &nbsp;Strangely enough, I was able to wholesale transfer my my microSD card contents without issue around the beginning of the year. &nbsp;I've only run into these issues recently and finding a fix is frustrating
 to say the least. &nbsp;Please let me know if you have any other suggestions. &nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

 (20 MB/s), then drops to about zero and tends to stay there.&nbsp;</p>

            I have a GTX 960 and the game is disc version. The main problem is I don't know where to begin. The disc is registered in the drive so I go to my files and find the disc but I don't know what the next step would be from here.

<p>
</p><p>I'm still not clear what is happening, but it reads like you have never installed a game. If not,</p>
<p>locate the <em>Setup.exe</em>&nbsp; (or similarly titled file that has an <em>.exe</em> extension) and double click on that to start</p>
<p>the installation. Then follow the prompts to install the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your copy of the game is used it may have run out of activation authorizations. Game publishers</p>
<p>have been limiting the number of machines a game can be installed to for years.</p>
<p>(a scheme that stems form the greedy attempt to&nbsp; to squash the second hand market ) .
</p>
<p>Some games allow between 3-5 but some are limited to only one.<br />
Most, but not all, have a process for 'de-authorization' when the game gets uninstalled from the original
</p>
<p>machine, so you can use the activation key again, but many people don't&nbsp; bother, or are unaware of this
</p>
<p>so the game runs out of authorizations.</p>
<p>- Most games with this sort of activation also require you to be online to activate the game at some</p>
<p>point in the install procedure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If activation is a problem you may be able to get help from&nbsp; EA Games.</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Again... If there is a file on the disk with the title <em>secdrv.sys </em>the game will require a
</p>
<p>noCD fix/patch/hack to run on Win10. <br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t play game without a parent&#39;s permission</h2>
                    I recently bought Gears of War Ultimate Edition for Windows 10 so I can get nostalgic over the good old days when me and my dad would play it together when I was way to young to be doing so. Anyway, I am now 20 years old and every time I try to play the
 game it says I need a parent's permission and that I can send a request through email. I signed in to my account at xbox.com and my profile information says there are no other accounts, neither parental nor child accounts, tied to mine. I did this so I can
 find the email my parental account is tied to since it would be old and my dad doesn't use it anymore. I'm basically asking if anybody knows how to fix my problem, and how to remove my account's ties to some parental account.

<p>Hello!&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you reach the age of adulthood (which varies by country and region), you can promote a child account to an adult account. This promotion removes the Family Settings and Xbox LIVE restrictions.</p>
<p>To promote a child account to an adult account</p>
<p>Sign in to Xbox LIVE by using the account that you want to change.</p>
<p>Go to Settings, and then select Account.</p>
<p>Select Promote Child Account.</p>
<p>Note This option is available only if the date of birth for the account indicates that you have reached the age of adulthood (18 in the United States). The legal adult age varies by country and region. The age of an account owner is calculated by
 using the date of birth provided when the account was created. This date cannot be changed. If you entered an incorrect date of birth when you created the account, your only option is to create a new account using the correct date of birth.</p>
<p>Follow the on-screen instructions to promote the account.</p>

<p>Hey Jayman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out. It sounds like your profile is still considered a child account. In order to manage the restrictions on it you will need to access the adult account associated with it. Since it is an older account you might have a bit of trouble
 but don't worry, we do have an easy <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/17875/microsoft-account-recover" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>We have played in multi before. Each person signs in on their controller. One person opens a world then the other three hit the controller start/menu to join. The issue is it is not allowing anyone to join. Once one person brings up the game NO other controller
 can bring up their menu. It is as if their controller is dead to the game. When the game is on and you have the open split screen and it normally says "push start to join" it now says" no games." It's as if the game isn't reading being multiplayer.</p>

<p>The same thing happened to our family. &nbsp;I called Xbox support and they told me that they have discontinued "family silver membership" and that now, every profile or gamer tag must have an INDIViDUAL Xbox live account. &nbsp;That basically means that for my kids
 to play together, I have to pay Microsoft $140 a year for two account so that we can play a game I already payed them for. &nbsp;My kids do not play on- line, just with each other in creative mode. &nbsp;I would be happy to be wrong about this but that is what MS told
 me directly. &nbsp;Anybody else having the same " greed" problem? &nbsp;</p>

<p>I have worlds both in off line and online. Neither work for multi. I also have wireless controllers so it isn't a cable issue. &nbsp;Even before we had Xbox live my kids were able to play together because it wasn't online play but thru hdmi.

<p>wow you really have tried everything but maybe in the xbox settings do you have the display settings to match your hd tv? &nbsp;and also a few stupid things are all the controllers still synced to the console, correct? &nbsp;Then if all that is still wrong there is
 a official bug forum on the minecraftwiki forums you could scan through there might be a solution or post and tell them all the things you have tried might be a know issue.</p>

<p>Yep everything is the same. Haven't changed anything since we first downloaded it and started playing it. Just one day we couldn't do multi anymore. I have heard a lot of people have had this issue with the downloaded version and that I need to buy the physical
 game to be able to play multi again. Which I am not happy about. If that was the case I wouldn't have wasted my money on the download and would have bought the disc from the beginning.</p>

    <title>Checkmark Appears On Desktop Tile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zxxl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Checkmark Appears On Desktop Tile</h2>
                    I'm still trying to track down a sleep mode problem and have reverted to a clean install of Windows 8 from Windows 8.1.&nbsp; I'll be adding things one at a time to see if I can figure out what is causing the problem and I'll be upgrading to Windows 8.1 next.&nbsp;
 In the meantime I have chanced upon this anomaly that is not a big problem but is rather odd.&nbsp; On the modern UI page there is a large tile for the desktop.&nbsp; Windows 8 is running with just the essential programs and drivers installed such as sound card, Windows
 Defender, etc and I noticed this anomaly when Windows 8.1 was installed but didn't associate it with anything.<br />
<br />
If I set user settings to require a password when waking the machine from sleep mode there is no check mark on the desktop tile.&nbsp; If, however I change the setting to not require a password, when I wake the machine there is a check mark in the upper right corner
 of the tile and the menu bar is open at the bottom of the page.&nbsp; It's the same as if you right click on an icon to change it.&nbsp; Right clicking on the tile will remove the check mark and return the page to normal view.&nbsp; I've tried it several times to be sure
 and every time I change setting to not require a password the check mark will reappear.&nbsp; It's a strange phenomenon. &nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Edit:&nbsp; Just noticed that it only happens if computer goes into sleep mode from the Modern UI page.&nbsp; Doesn't happen if the desktop is open.

            Good morning John.&nbsp; I build my own computers and this one is based on an ASUS Sabertooth Z87 motherboard with an Intel i5 4670 CPU and 16GB of Crucial memory.&nbsp; Video card is an ASUS GT640.&nbsp; Everything is up to date including BIOS, chipset drivers and video/sound
 card drivers.&nbsp; I check for Windows updates every day and other hardware drivers once a week or so.&nbsp; As I said it's not a big problem but just an odd thing that happens.&nbsp; Thanks for your input.&nbsp;

<h3> jamesgeorge-davidson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nothing works Xbox one</h2>
                    At the start of the week, my Xbox started loading everything really slow sometimes taking 20mins just to get to the home page, I've done a couple of hard resets and even a factory reset. After doing this it would occasionally work for a couple of hours
 but since yesterday day nothing works at all, it will take about 30mins to get on to the home page and most of the games and apps dont even appear and when you try to click on any of the apps or try to go to settings it crashes. does any one have any idea
 what it wrong or how to &amp; how much it will cost to fix?

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>did you do a factory reset with or without keeping Games and Apps installed?</p>
<p>If you did it with Games and Apps installed then I suggest trying it again without keeping them installed to see what happens.</p>
<p>If it fails to work properly after a full factory reset then I suggest to create a service request for the console, the price will be shown when setting up the service request, since it can be different per region.</p>
<p>As service/repair request can be set up here: <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Smartglass, Party Chat, Dolby Sound, and other limited or missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sgt pnasty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Smartglass, Party Chat, Dolby Sound, and other limited or missing functions</h2>
                    
<p>I'm hoping an Xbox ambassador or Rep, or employee, or whatever you are calling yourselves this time around can clarify the status of non working or partially working (stuff in beta after launch??!!?? Wtf) functions of my $500 dollar console. It seems that
 many functions that were promised or just flat out expected in a high end console are either absent or not capable of performing their tasks!</p>
<p>Please, give us a list of the functions coming soon via patch, and then give us a list of apps or settings that have known issues (you know, make it easy for your day one loyal customers)</p>
<p>And hell, if you want to help me personally, I am all ears......so hears what's wrong:</p>
<p>Smartglass cannot connect to my console, and before you ask me a stupid question, yes I have the Xbox One version of the app....and to add insult to injury, I get an error code that when input onto the Xbox troubleshooting sit comes up with unknown error
 code. The code 08x000001E (I will dbl check it). Oh, I'm also using a WP8...nokia Lumia, which one might think should make things easier.</p>
<p>Dolby missing? I have a 7.1 turtle beach head set that apparently can only receive stereo code from my Xbox one. I might as well be using earbuds from a 1990 Walkman (yup, Sony reference)</p>
<p>Party chat? Last night tried to play some games with friends and just bask in how excited we were about our new consoles....but party chat left a little something to be desired, specifically the audio?</p>
<p>There is more, but its time to get real! A Pro tip as I like to say! Make it easy for the consumer! All of these issues should have been dealt with before launch. And I understand that at the launch of a major consumer electronic device there will be issues...
 So let us know what those issues are! and do it in an easy to find (an email to my account inbox maybe?) clear and honest communication. It is bad enough that a game install is 20-60GB, but its worse that we cannot even see how much space is being used, with
 500GB if someone were to buy all launch games and download all available apps, would they have any space left? If that functionality is coming later, then tell us! If it is not coming later, then tell us why we can't (or shouldn't) be able to manage the space
 on our hard drives?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Honestly, it seems that there is a sincere lack of leadership coming out of Redmond, this stuff is easy...its communication. If the lack of real leaders is that bad I would be happy to send Microsoft an application, heck; I don't even have to relocate because
 I am in the general area. And unlike the current bunch of hacks, I actually care about the brand! I want MS to succeed, I'm a passionate gamer (see my live profile) that wants the best for this company. Whichever employee responds, if you can't answer the
 questions, then send this to your superior, and if that person doesn't know, just keep sending it up! (also, I'm serious about helping you out)</p>

<p>I couldn't agree with you more. &nbsp;I've been experimenting with my shiny new console since I picked it up at midnight trying to figure out what I can and can't do. &nbsp;I haven't even played a game yet. &nbsp;Tried to install Ryse and my xbox crashed. &nbsp;Thankfully the
 second time seemed to work. &nbsp;What I still can't get to work is the audio. &nbsp;I have my xbox hooked up to my theater system by an optical cable but I can't get digital sound, only stereo uncompressed. &nbsp;When I select DTS digital surround no sound comes out of
 the speakers. &nbsp;I can't believe Microsoft would release a new console with no digital sound support. &nbsp;Especially no dolby digital support. &nbsp;My PS4 I picked up last week had absolutely no problems. &nbsp;I was playing and enjoying that new console within minutes
 and this one....so far very disappointed!</p>

<p>Right now digital audio is rumored to need a patch. If you use HDMI it should be fine, but there is a problem with Dolby encoding and digital audio....dont know how true this is as I haven't found anything official as of yet</p>

3. Are you able to boot to the computer?</div>
<div>4. Do you have Windows 8 CD/DVD?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><font color="#000000">Here are a few steps which you can follow:</font></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 1:<br />
Let's perform a startup repair using Windows 8 bootable DVD or USB drive and check if that helps.<br />
a) Insert the installation DVD or USB and boot Windows 8 from it.<br />
b) In the ‘Windows setup’ page select the ‘language to install’, ‘Time and currency format’ and the ‘keyboard or input method’ and click on ‘next’.<br />
c) Click on ‘Repair your computer’ and select ‘Troubleshoot’. </div>
<div>d) Click on ‘Advanced options’ and select ‘Automatic Repair’ and select the operating system.<br />
<br />
<div>Method 2:<br />
If the above does not work then let's perform System Restore using Windows 8 bootable DVD or USB drive and check if that helps.<br />
a) Insert the installation DVD or USB and boot Windows 8 from it.<br />
b) In the ‘Windows setup’ page select the ‘language to install’, ‘Time and currency format’ and the ‘keyboard or input method’ and click on ‘next’.<br />
c) Click on ‘Repair your computer’ and select ‘Troubleshoot’. </div>
<div>d) Click on ‘Advanced options’ and select ‘System Restore' and select the operating system.<br />
<br />
<b>If the above does work please contact the manufacturer for help because it could be a hardware issue.</b></div>

<p>Hi, I did check the link you provided and it seems when I sign in to my orignal skype it works fine and when I log in with my new Office 365 email it goes to my original account. So it seems to be only one skype account that I can access through my skype
 sign in as well as my MS login . I have another question, as I bought the Office 365 Home, it said I would have 60 minutes of skype per month, how does that work under my current subscription.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h3> sadaauk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reclaiming Beta Gamertag</h2>
                    
<p>I had the gamertag<strong> [Mod Removed]</strong> during the Xbox Live Beta, but let that account lapse. &nbsp;I would like to reclaim that gamertag if at all possible. &nbsp;I had attempted to change my gamertag, but I receive the message "Sorry, that gamertag is
 now reserved. Try another one." &nbsp;I also attempted to add it as a friend, but receive a message that it does not exist. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been in contact with the Live chat support area and they confirmed it was not associated with a Live account and directed me here for&nbsp;further&nbsp;assistance&nbsp;due to the&nbsp;"reserved" message&nbsp;concerning&nbsp;this gamertag.</p>
<p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

<p>Thanks for your patience.</p>
<p>Jzen: at 0:05:09</p>
<p>I see here thta you wanted to know if you can reclaim the gamertag "<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>", Am I correct?</p>
<p>Jzen: at 0:05:11</p>
<p>*that</p>
<p>Corey: at 0:05:20</p>
<p>yes. i had attempted to add shooter as a friend to see if it was available but it said it did not exist, but when i tried to change my gamertag to shooter it indicated it was a reserved gamertag</p>
<p>Jzen: at 0:05:45</p>
<p>Alright. Let me go ahead and check this gamertag for you then.</p>
<p>Jzen: at 0:05:47</p>
<p>A moment please.</p>

<p>Thanks for your patience.</p>
<p>Jzen: at 0:07:56</p>
<p>I do see here that this GT is not associated to any Microsoft Account. May I ask, what is the message prompted when you try to change the GT to<strong> [Mod Removed]</strong>?</p>
<p>Corey: at 0:08:10</p>
<p>the website indicated it was reserved</p>
<p>Jzen: at 0:08:51</p>
<p>How about on the console?</p>
<p>Corey: at 0:09:07</p>
<p>im sorry it was actually on the console not the web</p>
<p>Corey: at 0:09:15</p>
<p>i an try again and get the exact message</p>
<p>Jzen: at 0:09:47</p>
<p>Thanks Corey.</p>
<p>Corey: at 0:10:29</p>
<p>Sorry, that gamertag is now reserved. Try another one.</p>
<p>Jzen: at 0:12:59</p>
<p>Alright. For this one Corey, since Gamertag Availability is monitored by our Enforcement Team you need to get in touch with them and chcek if you can claim this GT and why this was reserved already. Let me post here the link on the Forums (Enforcement Team
 are the Moderators on the Forums) for you to create a new post to have this issue resolved, okay?</p>
