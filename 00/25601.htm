            As Bob said an Autonumber datatype has only ONE purpose. To provide a unique identifier to a record. It is not to be used for sequential numbering.
<br />
<br />
If you want sequential number, check out my blog on that subject. <br />
<br />
But if you are going to be deleting records, then you would have to renumber every time you do.
<br />
<br />
Why would it matter to keep the sequence?<br />

            <p>1. Autonumbers can't be edited.</p>
<p>2. The ID field (I'm assuming you mean primary key field) should NOT be changing if you delete a record, especially if there are other records&nbsp;in other tables that are associated with it.</p>
<p>3. If you are using an autonumber for a field which you care what it is then you are using it incorrectly.&nbsp; An autonumber should only be used for something which you need a UNIQUE number and normally that should not even be seen by users.&nbsp; It should be used
 to maintain referential integrity of your data between tables.</p>
<p>4. If you care what it is, then you would need to use something else, perhaps like the DMax + 1 method (do a search for that).</p>

<h2>            N8 Calendar Crashes everytime I try to open it</h2>
                    
<p>I sync my calendar using MFE and at the moment, everytime I click on it, it tries to open and closes immediately. I've hard rebooted the phone a couple of times but the symptom is still there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone ever encountered this issue before?</p>

<p>I had Coming Next before but found that it totally screwed up all my to do list in Outlook and I had that uninstalled. Situations (which I suspect also is tied to Calendar in some ways is also exhibitng the same symptoms (won't open, it blinks and then closes
 automatically). So I am uninstalling that as well. We'll see if that is the cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: Rebooted the phone after uninstalling Situations. The Calendar is back to normal. Thanks to JayJay for giving me the idea about Nokia Betalabs products. Kudos to you.</p>

<h2>            MS Project - Project Center Default View</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to set the default view of Project Center web part? I created a custom view that sort and group the projects accordingly to our need. I was able to change the default view for my account but struggling to find a way to set the default view
 for all users. Every time a new user logs in to the page, they are forced to view it in the original one (Summary view). It would be great to be able to change the default view since we don't have the most tech savvy users here.</p>

<p>
</p><p>No, it is not possible for the Project Server administrator to specify the default view in the Project Center page in PWA.&nbsp; When a user visits the Project Center page for the first time, by default, the system always displays the Summary view.&nbsp; From there,
 the user can select your recommended view.&nbsp; After that, the system will continue to show the last view the user selected, which I believe would achieve your purpose.&nbsp; So, I think you will need to make this a training issue with your users.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Word 2013 Signature Line does not display in Windows Phone 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> woogie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2013 Signature Line does not display in Windows Phone 8</h2>
                    <p>I'm investigating mobile signature services for Windows Phone 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To my surprise, I have discovered that if I insert a Microsoft Office Signature Line in Word 2013, this entity is not displayed correctly in Word on my Lumia 920.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this normal or is there something that I need to do to get this to display? Are there plans for future support?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is something that would really be helpful in a lot of situations.</p>

            <p>I'm not using Word 2013 on my PC so I can't check it Woogie (actually I uninstalled Office 2013 and went back to Office 2010).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I can say is Apps in Office Mobile are made for your phone and have a smaller set of features than those in Microsoft Office 2010 or later. So I am guessing that that is one feature that just does not work in Office Mobile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is a feature you think is important, I suggest you submit a suggestion in the Official Suggestion Box. The more folks ask for a feature, the better the chance of seeing it someday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feature suggestions can be made at <a href="http://windowsphone.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Thanks, I get that some features aren't supported, but I'm just shocked that it's not even displayed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would think the support would stop at editing or creating&nbsp;the feature...but the doc should always display correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a big deal for a lot of small businesses, and if Microsoft is really serious about capturing small businesses, they need to support mobile document approvals. All of the other pieces are there, it's sad that it hasn't been taken to completion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a specific function in Word called "Microsoft Office Signature Line". I think what you are doing would display OK, but I don't see any way to get the signature capture that I'm ultimately after.</p>

 As I have a ton of work to do I'm pulling my hair out here.</p>

    <title>Build 10130 Catalyst Control and digital displays - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wiln937  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 10130 Catalyst Control and digital displays</h2>
                    <p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>I was running bld 10074 and decided to install Roxio Creator 2012. I had previously installed it under bld 9926 just to see if it would install&nbsp;and as far as I can remember it installed and I viewed a couple of video clips and then I removed it. When I installed
 it under 10130 it downloaded the installer (like before) and the installation appeared successful. After completion&nbsp;the installation program said a restart was required.&nbsp;There was also a pending restart as the result of a Windows update. I gave the OK for
 the restart and the computer started a cycle of a shutdown followed by the Windows logo and then another warm start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THE PROBLEM:</p>
<p>After playing that game for about an hour I decided this was not going anywhere so I got out my original 9962 .ISO generated DVD and attempted to refresh the system. That failed because 9962 has expired so I went to the Microsoft site and 10130 was what
 was there so I downloaded it. I burned it to DVD and booted it. I first attempted a system repair and the program said it could not repair my system so I tried several of the options offered until I got to the one that basically amounted to zapping my installed
 programs and loading the new OS. It did retain my Microsoft and local accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I got the system up again I needed to bring up AMD Catalyst Control Center in order to adjust the scaling found under "My Digital Flat Panels". Catalyst was not there so I reloaded it and when I started it all I found was some power control settings
 for the CPU. Digging through the help file revealed that CCC only displays "My Digital Flat Panels" etc. if they detect a digital display attached to a DVI or HDMI port.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>This has all worked until 10130.</li><li>My display adapter is an ATI Radeon HD 4200.</li><li>Device Manager indicates that the monitor is "Generic PnP Monitor".</li><li>Control Panel indicates that there is a PCT2785 attached which is correct.</li><li>Connection is via HDMI and sound seems to work.</li><li>Touch sensing is active</li></ul>
<p>Can anyone help me?</p>

 Custom and uncheck the driver during Catalyst install):</p>

    <title>How To Install Office 2003 Pro Upgd on Win 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gabroker  say:</h3>
<h2>            How To Install Office 2003 Pro Upgd on Win 7</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased a new laptop with Win 7. I tried to install my Office 2003 Pro (which Windows 7 Compatibility says is compatable) but my versoin is the upgrade version - previously on my XP laptop I just upgraded from previous versions with no problem.
 However, the install said will check to verify either Office XP or 2000 is installed - therein is the problem - Office XP and 2000 will not work with Win 7 - I even tried to install Works 7 (Office Upgrades will install if that is installed) but it will not
 instal on Win 7 - error mssg was something like "cant find network on desktop"! I uninstalled the trial version of Office 10 starter but still no luck. My Win 7 Home Premium is updated&nbsp;w SP 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the solution or workaround?&nbsp; I certianly dont want to have to buy a newer version of Office Professional both for a monitary reason and because I have a ton of Office 2003 docs, and outlook 2003 contacts and emails&nbsp;backed up that probably wont even
 open in Office 2007 or 2010. </p>
<p>There should be some kind of patch to allow Office 2003 Upgrade to load on Win 7 since the required older versions won't work on Win 7, but I have not been able to find them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated - what I thought was a good move up Win 7 from XP) has turned out to be a serious handcuff to my small business. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>You&nbsp;should not need to install the qualifying product - just have the install disc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When 2003 asks for the qualifying product, insert the install disc in the drive and point the 2003 installer at the drive.&nbsp; It should recognise the disc and carry on with the install.&nbsp; Your problem is the reason MS no longer offer upgrades to Office 2010.</p>

            In addition Office 2003 is fully compatible with win7 and why win7 compatibility states it is incompatible is beyond me.

<h2>            Word 2016&#39;s latest update just overwrote my normal template</h2>
                    <p>AAARGH!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word is SUPPOSED to know the difference between its default normal template and one that the user has modified.&nbsp; Apparently Microsoft's highly paid programmers forgot about that - AGAIN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got the newest update and&nbsp; - POOF! - my customized normal.dotm is GONE.&nbsp; Once I figured out that Word looks for it in C:\Users\Loretta\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates I tried to restore the most recent version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EXCEPT - that some evil conspiracy has directed Restore to skip that file.&nbsp; If it's comparing dates, it should have at least ASKED me if I wanted the good September version.&nbsp; But nope; it just decided that it knows how to maintain my computer better than
 I do.&nbsp; This is a PC, not some ditsy Apple hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I had to go back into Restore and this time tell it to put the right normal.dotm version on my desktop.&nbsp; Then I&nbsp;manually moved that to the Templates folder,&nbsp;all the while arguing&nbsp;with Windows about administrator rights.&nbsp; Even though I'm the only person
 who has ever touched this PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When is Microsoft going to learn that we're not all iUsers?&nbsp; We chose Windows and Office&nbsp;because they're customizable, and we do indeed customize them to best suit our productivity requirements.&nbsp; It's foolish to assume that an automatic update can come in
 and trash all of our work simply to showcase a bunch of stuff we've lived without so far, and probably don't need now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW - With this update I also had to replace all of the Office icons pinned to my Start menu, and the Outlook link in my Startup folder because apparently the *.exe's are in a new folder.&nbsp; And in Outlook I had to turn the friggin' Reading Pain (spelling
 intentional) off in every single mail folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some people may be incapable of handling their own lives, but I certainly don't need fascism from a software company.</p>
<p>

            <p>It also deleted all the pins to favorite documents in Word, Excel, Access, PPT - everything! It also purged the most recent document list for all the Office programs. In addition, it cleaned up my taskbar.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, you could have warned us so we would have copied the NORMAL template and taken screenshots of our pinned documents and links on our taskbars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next time, ask the end user to test before you make us your beta testers - again. Do not have your programmers that have clean machines to do the smoke testing!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks.&nbsp; That's easier than doing a Restore.</p>

</p><p>Microsoft, you're killing me with all this wasted time spent "fixing" unwanted and unexpected overwrites of MY files with useless changes in updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you REALLY want me to look at cutesy new style stuff I never asked for, set Word to open the first time with the new template, and a built-in macro to restore MY normal.dotm if I want it back.&nbsp; WARN that if I close Word without running the macro, I'll
 be stuck with the new template.</p>

    <title>SQL query question - finding an exact match - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shaves74  say:</h3>
<h2>            SQL query question - finding an exact match</h2>
                    <p>I'm using SQL to query an Access database for cost centers.&nbsp; We have to cost centers, 1A and 1a, and I'm trying to retrieve the records for each one separately with&nbsp;the following code:</p>
<p>SELECT&nbsp;[tablename].* FROM [tablename] WHERE ((([tablename].fieldname)='" &amp; ChkVal &amp; "'"))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the loop, ChkVal contains either "1a" or "1A".&nbsp; Each cost center has multiple records.&nbsp; The problem is no matter what value appears in ChkVal, the records for cost center "1a" are always returned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way in SQL to ensure the appropriate records are returned?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried manually running queries and using the cost center criteria of "1a" and "1A" and I get the same results for either value.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there some code that will ensure I only get the records for the appropriate cost center?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help....</p>

            <p>SQL is by default case-insensitive: it does not distinguish between "sql", "SQL" and "Sql".</p>
<p>You can use the StrComp function to perform case-sensitive comparisons:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>strSQL = "SELECT * FROM [tablename] WHERE StrComp([fieldname], '" &amp; ChkVal &amp; "', 0) = 0"</p>

                    <p>Original title: KEN, ALL OF MY PERSONAL FOLDERS HAVE DISAPPEARED IN MY OUTLOOK.COM EMAIL ACCOUNT<br />
<br />
Hello, per Ken's request, I am posting a new question insteady of doing a "me too" on another thread.&nbsp; All of my personal email FOLDERS have suddenly disappeared.&nbsp; All I have left are the default folders of Inbox, Drafts, Sent, Junk, and Delete.&nbsp; NUMEROUS people
 have posted about this same problem on this site, and also on the Internet on various trouble shooting sies as well.&nbsp; This is NOT a unique problem I'm having because of something I did to my account, as i did absolutely nothing and have had this account for
 over ten years.&nbsp; It is CLEARLY a problem created by outlook.com,&nbsp;since so many people are reporting the exact same problem.&nbsp; PLEASE help.&nbsp; Not only did I loose the folders, i obviously lost all of the hundreds of emails that were stored away in those folders.
 Thank you so much</p>

            Yup same here, for me it seemed to stop syncing directly after the standard hotmail.co.uk webmail was updated to Outlook.com. Cannot comment if this is directly related but I noticed it within hours of the change to the webmail site. Hope this helps to
 potentially support solving the issue.

            <p>solved!!! :D<br />
<br />
from the outlook app remove the e-mail account you're having troubles with, then re-add it (even if it's the e-mail address of the main account of your phone, it won't cause you any data loss - well I didn't loose anything).</p>
<p>
</p><p>after I did so everything was ok except the fact that the "new" e-mail account wasn't going to stay in the unified incoming mail folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then turned the phone off and back on and re-unified all the e-mail folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>all back to normality :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>since I'm convinced the issue was caused by the update to the outlook.com service I hope Microsoft will pay a bit more attention in the future...</p>
<p>
</p><p>byeeee :)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3600s does support java files however, there are still some limitations. This unit is an S40 phone supporting only java files with file extension *.jar. Sometimes, even if your java file is a *.jar, it's programming may only be compatible with certain models.
 So, it may install but will not work properly. What I suggest for you to do to determine if it is compatible with this unit is to have it uninstalled and reinstalled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            installing windows 10</h2>
                    <p>alright, so I have a tablet with a dead screen, but which I could use with an HDMI connection to my TV. After installing an insider preview of
</p>
<p>Windows 10, ie the version before this latest one came out yesterday, I noticed my wifi and sound did not install properly. I decided to
</p>
<p>reset the pc hoping to fix the problem.</p>
<p>After rebooting I can't get in, I thought HDMI would work, but it doesn't. really feeling stupid.</p>
<p>Is there any way to clean install windows 10 without user input? i.e. not having to click on any options or preferences, but just to connect a USB and have the install start immediately, so Windows can come up and I can get HDMI functionality back?</p>
<p>Again, I have a dead tablet screen and no HDMI capability and so cannot see anything displayed on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks INsiders!</p>

<p>I validate Jeff's initial concern with Powerpoint 2016/OfficeMix, and wonder if there is an update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To summarize: If you insert audio to play across slides, (a) it works fine within powerpoint, but (b) when you export to *.mp4, the song only plays on the first slide.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on how you configure playback settings, you can either get stuck on the first slide until the song is done, or you can play a brief snippet of the song on slide 1 (for however long the slide timing is set), and then subsequent slides are song-free.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Jeff has noted, this is true regardless of audio file format (*.mp3 *.wav etc), and true across media players.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should also be noted that this is LOST functionality. In Powerpoint 2010, if you loaded the audio file on the first slide, set it to "play across slides", and exported (to *.wmv), the song plays fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that the song plays fine within Powerpoint 2016 (when showing as a slide show) and in Powerpoint 2010 (as a slide show, or when exported to *wmv), it seems this is a programming glitch related to exports in Powerpoint 2016/Office Mix.

<p>Same problem here. We use Office Mix for several presentation for our classes. &nbsp;They have been working fine. Now suddenly, there is no audio on the presentations. &nbsp;I have tried taking the Power Point presentation and re-uploaded it to Mix, but still no sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we can not get this resolved in the next week (before Fall Semester starts, we will have to find a substitute product. We use this not only to provide instruction to our students, but also require them to submit their required presentations back to the
 Instructors for grading. I am not excited about having to go out and research and test some other programs before the next semester starts, so I hope a solution can be found quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have re-uploaded all of the presentations, and neither the older versions or the newly uploaded will play audio on Chrome, Opera, or Microsoft Edge. &nbsp;I am using Windows 10 for Educators, and ALL software is the latest version. &nbsp;I find it strange that the
 Office Mix presentations have been working for several semesters, and only something that has changed in the last couple of months (since the start of last semester) has changed that make it so these presentations will now not work.</p>

            Corrections . . . SOME of them will play in Microsoft Edge. &nbsp;I can not see, or identify, the difference in the files that will play in Edge and those that will not. But this also presents the problem that many of the students do not have Edge, and rely
 on Chome, IE, Netscape, etc.

<p>
</p><p>You are right in that it is weird indeed something happening this way, as there is something seems to have appeared after your update installation and to fix the issue I would suggest you rather try removing the Office 365 install and then to install it
 again; to remove Office 2016 install - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2016-for-Mac-eefa1199-5b58-43af-8a3d-b73dc1a8cae3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>That's typically a LaunchService issue.</p>
<p>Id' select the file in the Finder, then press command-i to get the Info panel for the file.</p>
<p>From there, you should be able to make sure that Excel is indeed setup to open these files. If it's not, you can select it and make sure that the same action is set for all files of the same file type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In some cases, that still doesn't work. If that happens to you, I'd suggest using a free utility like Onyx to reset the LaunchService database.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thing is, I live in Vancouver, BC, Canada. &nbsp;And the IP address leads to somewhere outside Chicago. &nbsp;Also, it seems as if someone HAS my password as the only thing stopping them from gaining access to my account is the Microsoft/Hotmail security challenge
 (whereby Microsoft sends a code to my alternate email to use in a further login process due to a different login location). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed my password immediately but the access attempts keep happening (and every 5 minutes). &nbsp;Once in a while I'll see an attempt from somewhere else in the world (Venezuela, Romania, etc) but at least the notification for those attempts reads "incorrect
 password" or something like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have access to the account. &nbsp;Nothing seems different. &nbsp;Microsoft hasn't blocked my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But how is someone from that same IP address above getting to the security challenge portion of the login even AFTER I've changed my password for Hotmail? &nbsp;If there is some sort of keystroke logger that has worked its way onto my computer, wouldn't they
 have been able to access my alternate email account (which I accessed to get the code)? &nbsp;Wouldn't they have been able to fully take over my Hotmail account then?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an iMac (I know I know) and am using OS X 10.8.5. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. &nbsp;Thanks everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Unless I'm blowing this out of proportion and shouldn't be worried and just be thankful for the security challenge but someone trying to break down my front door every five minutes seems kind of worrisome. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PPS: Unless the original email was spam and I totally fell for it hook, line, and sinker. &nbsp;But then that "trusted sender" status was bogus.</p>

            <p>Well the affected iphone has the mBox app as well, I guess we found the offender! I've contacted Latisys about it this afternoon and I just an answer back :
</p>
<p>Good evening,<br />
<br />
I have sent an email to mFluent to contact you directly regarding this issue. It seems this may be the cause of an installed APP on an iPhone or Android platform, and the push notifications were allowed during the installation process. Do you have any microsoft
 mail application on a mobile device? If so, you should be able to disable the push notifications for the offending app and this should solve the unauthorized access attempts from other conflicting apps like facebook, etc. &nbsp;Please let us know if you have any
 questions. mFluent should be reaching out to you for additional troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
<br />

    <title>Add all members using a certain domain to a security group - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wn anthony  say:</h3>
<h2>            Add all members using a certain domain to a security group</h2>
                    
<p>Basically I'm trying to separate students from staff in our environment. I need 2 security groups. One for Students and one for Non-Students. All students use the domain students.domain.com and all staff use domain.com.</p>
<p>Is it possible to assign to a security group based on domain? </p>
<p>How could this be done? Powershell Commands? Would it&nbsp;be possible for it to be dynamic (when a new student is added, they are automatically added to the security group)</p>

<p>Thanks for any advice or direction!</p>

<p>Hello Nick,</p>
<p>Yes you can use the EAC to create a security group based on domain.</p>
<p>#In the EAC, navigate to Recipients &nbsp;&gt; Groups.</p>
<p>#Click New Add Icon &gt; Security group.</p>
<p>#On the Email address tab drop down to select the domain (students.domain.com or domain.com)</p>
<p>***No it's not possible when a new student is added, they are automatically added to the security group. You have to do manually adding.</p>
<p>Check this tech net article to manage mail-enabled security groups <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123521.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p>I have an external user who is unable to export a Sharepoint list to Excel.&nbsp; When they try, Excel opens and they are prompted to enter the email and password associated with their Microsoft account, then continuously prompted to enter their password.&nbsp; No
 other external users have this issue, and Sharepoint users with their exact same permissions in their business are able to export the list just fine.&nbsp; Their IT department has reviewed their Office 365 account and determined this was an issue on Microsoft's
 end.&nbsp; Is there anything we can do to fix this?&nbsp; Thank you for your time.</p>

<p><span>Hi JBSFM,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From your description, it seems that the issue only happens in the specific user in your environment. The user can open the .iqy file exported from the site list in SharePoint Online and the issue happens when the user type his account and password.
</span></p>
<p>
