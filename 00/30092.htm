<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. Please do not worry I will try my best to resolve it. Try the methods given below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 1: Run the program that you use to save the file as an administrator</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Right-click the shortcut that starts the program, and then click
<strong>Run as Administrator</strong> to start the program. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If the <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> option is not available, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a. Right-click the shortcut that starts the program, and then click
<strong>Properties</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b. Click the <strong>Shortcut</strong> tab, and then click
<strong>Open File Location</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c. Right-click the executable file for the program, and then click
<strong>Run as Administrator</strong> to start the program.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> If the program was installed by using an .msi package file, you must locate the executable file for the program to run it as an administrator. For example, a shortcut to
 a Microsoft Office program does not include the <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> option.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Save the file</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 2: Save the file to the Documents folder and then move it to the destination folder</span></strong></p>

2.&nbsp;Under <strong>Choose how preview builds are installed</strong>, select the top list, and then choose

 the folder's permissions, were not allowing Fax and Scan to save there. If you are using that program, or having a similar issue I would try SteSpence's answer in that post first.

    <title>4gb slim, only 1.5gb available after format - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blazur78  say:</h3>
<h2>            4gb slim, only 1.5gb available after format</h2>
                    
<p>I just bought a slim xbox which came with a 4gb internal memory unit. Initially it was unformatted, and after formatting it I was only left with 1.5gb of available space. I've since reformatted it several times but have never been able to claim the expected
 3.5gb (after the system takes its 512mb reserve). When I browser this memory unit there's no data showing on it.</p>
<p>Can anybody explain this anomoly? Is it possible the console shipped with a damaged or misappropriated memory unit?</p>

<p>I'm trying to reinstall this game because it stopped working (all my save game profiles were corrupted) and I cannot find it for the life of me in the marketplace or in the download history...</p>
<p>Is Microsoft dropping support for original game content?&nbsp; If so - that's not cool at all ...&nbsp; at all...</p>
<p>Where can I re-download Xbox original games?</p>

<p>This is either very clearly a:</p>
<p>- Bug</p>
<p>- Hard drive that's failing - given that I have absolutely no problems with this drive other than this, and I copy pretty much every single game I'm actively playing over to it.... &nbsp;I'd say the HDD is perfectly fine.</p>

</p><p>Hi, i have same problem, xbox "gamepass" don't run games on pc. I had this problem previously on my old pc (not resolved june 2018) and today on the new pc. My Minecraft work great but it was bought, so i think it's related to gamepass game's. I thinking
 strore problems was resolved so i resubscribed, but it's same on a new pc with new windows 10 license. So if you can look on this problems... this is unacceptable, don't forget consumers have rights, and i paid twice for nothing. Greetings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specs: Ryzen 5 2600, Ballistix 8gb ddr4 2400 MHZ, R9 Fury nitro, Windows 10 and all up to date.</p>

            Hi, sadly, i unsubscribed and i was refunded. But i can say you all of peoples on windows store can't run these games, if you look feedback,&nbsp; you'll see... As a informatician and as a gamer, in my opinion it's unacceptable and illegal to sell a unavailable
 sevice. With a new material not work, with old pc not work, never worked, that a bit odd. I tried everything but it's just not only me, it's for all of people... Greetings.

<p>Hi&nbsp;zexhal</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned already only some play anywhere titles work on PC when using Gamepass. Games like Sea of Thieves, State of Decay 2, Spyro. What was happening when you tried to play games that were eligible ?</p>

<p>I'm having the exact same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dealing with play anywhere games, so no issue there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried every troubleshooting tip I could find online, YouTube videos, etc. (Reset store, cleared cache, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The gamepass games worked fine until a few weeks ago, then just stopped - will throw an error that they can't launch and to view in Microsoft store (no help) or just crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Non game-Pass games (Minecraft, Roblox, etc.) work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night, I installed Sea of Thieves on a different PC (using same gamepass credentials) and it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, on the PC where the games won't work, I setup a new user account, installed Sea of Thieves - same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now, I've been on hold with Microsoft for 40 minutes and the only advice anybody can come up with is to wipe the PC back to factory.&nbsp; Are you kidding me?&nbsp; There has to be another answer!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>

<h2>            How to fix tablet issues&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>just installed Windows 8 on a computer using a wacom tablet and it has some serious issues:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. Whenever I try to drag a desktop window there is a 1-1.5 second delay which is really annoying.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2. I can´t find a way to turn of the click animations: left clicking always shows some ripples, right click always shows a circle around the corner.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>3. Right Pen Button does rarely work in the modern UI (or metro or whatever it is called now). I am forced to press the button on the tablett itself to get a right click although the cursor shows the circle around the cursor.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>4. Middle mouse scroll does not work at all in the browser. It works fine in google chrome and firefox but not in internet explorer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Are there any ways to fix this or is the only way to have a usable system to reinstall windows 7?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
                </div>

            <p>Have you installed the latest (Windows 7 version) Wacom tablet driver? There are no Windows 8 drivers for Wacom tablets yet.</p>
<p>Ask Wacom if the problem persists. Hardware function problems are its manufacturer's problem to resolve, not Microsoft's.</p>

            Yes, I have. And these are not driver issues (except for the missing right button click in the modern UI maybe), these are windows issues, it is not the driver that paints these annoying circles around the cursor.
<div><br />
<div>I finally figured out that when I enable (!!!) "Enable press and hold for right-clicking" I can at least get rid of that really annoying delay when dragging a window. Problem is, I don´t want that setting.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It seems like I am not the only one with these issues:</div>
<div><br />

<div><br />
<div>Seems like windows 8 has even made things worse for tablet users :(</div>

            <p>Michael,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am suffering the same dismal Wacom Tablet support in Windows 8 as you are.&nbsp; The animations with each click are absolutely unnecessary and they are NOT the fault of the Wacom driver.&nbsp; They are added by Windows, and they cause major headaches for tablet
 users.&nbsp; In Windows 7 we could disable TabletPC service and the stupid cursor animations would also be disabled - but that service does not exist in Windows 8.&nbsp; There is a similar service named "TabletInputService" but disabled this does nothing to help with
 the Windows 8 tablet problems.&nbsp; I've also noticed that Microsoft has taken away our ability to uninstall TabletPC using the Turn Windows Features On or Off.&nbsp; Very disappointing to see Windows take such a huge step backwards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really hope Microsoft fixes tablet input.&nbsp; We don't need a service running in the background to control our tablet - Wacom can provide the driver.&nbsp; It's hard to take Windows 8 as a serious platform when it can't handle basic input devices that have been
 around for decades.</p>

            No here comes the fun part: I just tried an old wacom graphire 2 instead of the bamboo touch I used at first and guess what: Everything works fine. Makes me think that there really might be a driver issue on wacoms side that screws up the newer tablets,
 especially those with a touch interface.

            Interesting.&nbsp; So maybe I need to bring some of my old tablets out of storage.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Currently, I'm using&nbsp; an Intuos4 and an Intuos5, and both have the same problem.&nbsp; The Intuos4 does not have a touch interface.&nbsp; I swear these graphic circles and animations
 belong to&nbsp;Microsoft - not Wacom.&nbsp; Otherwise it wouldn't have been possible to disable them by removing the Windows Pen and Touch component (in Windows 7).&nbsp; Maybe Wacom uses their driver to disable them?&nbsp; And since there isn't a dedicated Windows 8 driver,
 it doesn't disable them properly.

            <p>Another side note: I've found that the pen will sometimes lose the ability to use hotspots in Windows 8.&nbsp; For instance, when browsing the App Store, then pen will randomly lose the ability to bring up the start menu or change to the hand cursor at the top
 of the screen to close the app.&nbsp; You're just stuck.&nbsp; You can either press Alt- F4 to manually close the app, or you can switch to the Wacom mouse and suddenly you have hotspots again and can access the Start Menu and drag the app window down tot the bottom
 of the screen to close it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know if that's Microsoft's fault or if that's Wacom's fault, but I really miss the days when Windows had no clue what I used as an input device.&nbsp; The driver told the cursor to move and Windows obeyed.&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, I don't have confidence that the brains
 behind&nbsp;Windows are capable of treating the input device differently without forcing their stupid animations and buggy OS behaviors on the user.&nbsp; It was better when Windows couldn't tell the difference between a tablet, pen, or mouse.</p>

            <p>The Touch interface has changed significantly in Windows 8, so it&nbsp;is not surprising that Windows 7 drivers do not work properly.</p>
<p>I have been using the Windows 8 Enterprise trial and noted that (minor) problems came and went as Windows 7 programs and drivers were installed and then replaced by Windows 8 versions.</p>
<p>Until you have Windows 8 certified programs (for any which interact with hardware - any hardware) and Windows 8 drivers for all your devices (not just Windows 7 drivers which happen to work) it will not be possible to say where any fault or bugs come from.</p>
<p>Wacom tablet related problems should be reported and discussed in the Wacom forums. That is where you can expect to find known issues and workrounds.</p>

            I discussed this issue with wacom and they say it is a Windows 8 bug that you can´t disable the animations an microsoft has to fix this. They also told me that there will be a driver available in november so let´s hope it fixes the issues.&nbsp;

            <p>Michael, thanks for following up with Wacom.&nbsp; I'm glad they have been quick to identify the cursor animations as a Windows 8 bug.&nbsp; That seemed obvious to the users, but now it's confirmed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wacom support also got back to me on this issue.&nbsp; They directed me towards their press release on Windows 8:</p>
<p>"Starting on November 2nd., new drivers will be available for Wacom’s professional line of Intuos and Cintiq products. Starting on November 16th, new drivers will be available for the Bamboo line of pen tablets."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The full press release can be viewed here:</p>

            I managed to solve pen feedback/drag delay issue somehow. The problem is I don't exactly know how I did it - it was many hours of installing/uninstalling various drivers and messing up with registry before I got it working. I think setting this registry
 key helped:<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Policies/Microsoft/TabletPC/TurnOffPenFeedback=1<br />
Can anyone verify if it fixes anything?<br />
<br />
My configuration:<br />
Windows 8 Pro 64bit<br />
Wacom Intuos 2 (using Windows 7 drivers)<br />
<br />
Update:<br />
Setting registry key doesn't solve anything. But installation of old drivers does. I've had new tablet drivers (6.17-3), then I installed version 5.2.1.6a (this one's for bamboo, but it doesn't matter). This "broke" something and tablet started to act weird
 :) Then I removed old drivers and reinstalled new drivers. Miracle happened and my tablet started to work. This trick also worked for Bamboo Fun tablet.<br />

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same issue. Just updating the system regularly. First time to experience the same thing with the sxstracer.exe which keeps appearing when trying to open desktop applications (like MS Office, DOTA 2, etc.). I tried following some instructions from
 previous similar issues with responses from customer support. It included on uninstalling and reinstalling Visual C++ Redistributable Packages from 2005 onwards. But to my findings, can't even install the said program without the same dialog box appearing
 every time. And when trying to remove the program, Error 1719 keeps appearing. My computer seems to be healthy as far as I know until that issue happened. I just noticed it when some of the icons on my taskbar disappeared out of the blue, very weird I said.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was able to chat with a live agent from customer support. After screen remote and checking, the agent suggested on doing system restore. After loading, it just said that the process was interrupted, something like that which ended with nothing on my end,
 the system restore failed. I suppose I was stuck on the last update that it provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really desperate and frustrated by this because I keep the system of my computer healthy. Always up-to-date with all the security and cumulative updates provided by Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One day I was using my computer normally (just updating actually), and the next time I used it, it was like that. I can't find the cause on my end because I literally wasn't doing anything or even reckless with it. I DON'T WANT TO END UP RESETTING MY COMPUTER
 EVEN IF IT'S THE LAST RESORT, takes a lot of time and process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this issue gets resolved soonest. I'm not even sure if the next update will be installed because that current system keeps rejecting installations because of an error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any response from the Microsoft team will be greatly appreciated. Thank you and God Speed. T_T</p>

<h2>            App shown in web version of Windows Store but not actually in Windows Store</h2>
                    <p>The Web version of the Windows Store has an app for Windows 8 called Hexic:</p>
<p><a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-tt/app/b59f8567-6db8-47c4-90e1-f6fe4609b8b8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-tt/app/b59f8567-6db8-47c4-90e1-f6fe4609b8b8</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if one clicks "View in Windows Store" one is taken to a generic&nbsp;Windows Store page, and searching there for Hexic yields no results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The app seems to have been released in late&nbsp;December 2013 as detailed at:</p>
<p><a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Microsoft-Launches-Hexic-Puzzle-Game-for-Windows-8-1-412455.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://news.softpedia.com/news/Microsoft-Launches-Hexic-Puzzle-Game-for-Windows-8-1-412455.shtml</a>.&nbsp; Despite the app being produced by Microsoft
 Studios it has only 6 downloads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something is wrong, but I can't tell if this is mis-filed or withdrawn.&nbsp; How can one get this fixed or download this app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hexic was one of the classic programs on the original Tablet PC released in 2002.</p>

            <p>I'm using a Surface Pro 2 in the United States with no parental controls, so I don't see any reason why the app would be blocked for just me.&nbsp; The fact that only 6 people have installed an app by Microsoft Studios suggests the problem is very widespread.&nbsp;
 And for clarity, the app is listed as requiring Windows 8.1 and my Surface Pro 2 is running Windows 8.1, so there should be no operating system incompatibility.</p>

<p>When I go to that URL I get a screen "To continue, create an Xbox profile".&nbsp; As detailed above, I don't want an Xbox profile.&nbsp; You should be able to ask why an app is not available without creating an Xbox profile.</p>

<p>
</p><p>We checked in several Windows 8/8.1 computers using Windows Store and the app link. The Hexic app link shows when we Bing it, but the app is removed from Windows Store by Hexic app publisher. Hexic app is published by Xbox you need to contact their support
 site as suggested by Pinaki:</p>

<p>As explained in my response to Pinaki, and as detailed at&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-gaming/turn-off-pestering-to-access-and-update-your-xbox/c0c50f33-5d0c-400d-9435-efcba44cd111">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-gaming/turn-off-pestering-to-access-and-update-your-xbox/c0c50f33-5d0c-400d-9435-efcba44cd111</a>&nbsp;I
 don't want to create an Xbox account.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it seems like the answer is not that Microsoft withdrew Hexic, but rather is doing a soft release with the program being available for now only to people with Region set to Trinidad and Tobago.&nbsp; It is totally clumsy for Microsoft to have programs show
 up at URLs such as <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-tt/app/b59f8567-6db8-47c4-90e1-f6fe4609b8b8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-tt/app/b59f8567-6db8-47c4-90e1-f6fe4609b8b8</a> that are found with web searches, yet&nbsp;clicking through to download the program fails in a mysterious way that gives you no clue that the program is only available in an obscure
 market (unless you know to change your Region setting to that obscure market when downloading apps, though who knows what else that would do to your computer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is hard to tell whether the insistence on signing up for an Xbox account to access a support site is arrogance or sloppiness.&nbsp; The&nbsp;failure to realize that people will find app URLs by web searches and not imagine that an app is only for Trinidad and Tobago
 seems&nbsp;more clearly to be sloppiness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I reserve even if I didn’t get a notification? </strong></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Yes. You can reserve your upgrade at any time on any compatible PC by clicking on the Get Windows&nbsp;10 app or the Windows Update control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-faq</span></a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This update is not required to get Windows 10, you can still get it even though you don't get the notification. Just download it on July 29th 2015 when it becomes available. You will have one year to do so. The Reserve app is just a reminder/notification
 for its availability.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How can I cancel my reservation? I don't want to upgrade to Windows 10 at all.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the Reservation app in the notification area (double click it) </p>
<p>Click the&nbsp;Hamburger menu&nbsp;in the upper left corner, then select View Confirmation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the lower left, click Cancel reservation and then confirm (twice).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I change the email address used to reserve the free upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You have to cancel the reservation and reserve Windows 10 again if you want it to a different email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To cancel reservation follow the below steps:<br />
•Click/tap on the Get Windows 10 app icon on the taskbar notification area. <br />
•Click/tap on the "hamburger" style menu button at the top left corner in the Get Windows 10 app.<br />
•Click/tap on View confirmation under Getting the upgrade.<br />
•Click/tap on the Cancel reservation link.<br />
•Click/tap on Cancel reservation to confirm.<br />
•Click/tap on Close.</p>
<p>This will cancel the reservation, now go ahead and reserve it with the new email.</p>
<p><strong>Can I uninstall the Reservation completely from my computer?</strong></p>
<p>Click Start (or press Windows key + S for Windows 8.1 users)</p>
<p>Type: <em>view installed updates</em></p>
<p>Hit Enter on your keyboard </p>
<p>
</p><p>Look through the list for the <strong>KB3035583 </strong>and <strong>KB2976978</strong>&nbsp;update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click each update and click Uninstall. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><em>Other reasons why you might not be seeing it:</em></strong></p>
<p>Why don’t I have the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em>&nbsp;app? </p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>If you don’t see the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em> &nbsp;app on your PC, it might be because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your device isn’t up-to-date with at least Windows&nbsp;7 SP1 or Windows&nbsp;8.1 Update.</li><li>Windows Update is turned off or is not set to received updates automatically.</li><li>You’ve blocked or uninstalled the necessary Windows Update functionality.</li><li>Your device is not running genuine Windows.</li><li>Your Windows License is from a MSDN or TechNet subscription. If it is, you will be able to get Windows 10 through your subscription if it is still active.</li><li>Your computer is part of a Windows Domain</li><li>Microsoft has not determined your device capable of running Windows 10 even though it meets the minimum system requirements.</li><li>You are running a volume license client: Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows 8.1 Pro, Windows 8.1 Enterprise
<strong>(only retail store bought or preinstalled OEM licenses) get the upgrade offer.
</strong></li></ol>
<p>Running Windows Update and installing any available updates will fix the first three issues. Need more help? Go to our

<p>PCs that we determine cannot run Windows&nbsp;10 will not see the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em> &nbsp;app before July 29, 2015. After July 29, 2015, we’ll enable the icon in the system tray. This is to help ensure that you can easily check your PC’s compatibility if you
 choose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your device is managed as part of a school or business network, please check with your IT administrator about upgrading to Windows&nbsp;10.</p>

<p><span>Secnario #2 - Got a hate mail saying "Camp harder next time". The odd part of this message is I could not find him in any of my recent games but I did respond that I paid my 60.00 and I can play pretty much any way I saw fit. He responded
 your a B***H. Of th 5 games I had played that morning - I only "Camped" in one spot in Slums - 2-3 opposing team members were hardcore holding the blue house. I was getting a nice rampage mowing them down when they poppe dup or ran out. I like to call that
 a choke point rather than camping which ironically is what they were doing?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Scenario #3 - While in a lobby waiting for game to start could hear a father yelling at his daughter ( she sounded about 5 maybe) if she did not go to her room and find something to do and quit bothering him he would be angry.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I realize these&nbsp;3 examples are just a small taste and you all have experienced/suffered&nbsp;the same at one point or another. When I say "I regretted laughing"? I was laughing at first at this poor soul who was obviously out played and perhaps
 this was not his revenue of gaming that he should be pursuing. I felt truly bad for this person in the perspective of what made this person the way he was to become the way he was acting? Have games really become so competetive that it truly makes us angry
 enough to call people names, shout curses and generally make it bad for everyone around them? The third example just made my heart break that a game actually became more important than your own children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I remember when we played board games (we still do by the way) we would never rage quit , accuse our kids or parents of cheating. Can you even imagine competetive Parcheesi? Do world class chess players blame the game results on cheating
 or jet lag? From all the matches I have seen they both shook hands and walked away. I play games only to have fun. If I am a better player at one game I certainly do not gloat or put them down. Have kids and younger adults been raised in an electronics gaming
 era that does not teach them how to lose graciously? Or have compassion for the person who went 4-22 who might be and older person or someone who is physically challenged? Is winning that important in virtual gaming that will never improve your real life relationships
 in any form or another? Do parents really just abandon their children to play unsupervised on a game that was designed for an older generation?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We all complain of how horrible this game or that game is. The Lag, the perks , the mechanics, the hackers &amp; cheaters. However in perspective the cost of this form of entertainment is down right cheap. I love playing BO2, because quite
 frankly, I do not go into the game expecting any thing else other than having fun. Even more fun when I play with my son.&nbsp;I amusing&nbsp;only BO2 as an&nbsp;example as this applies to any game you are playing.&nbsp; At best I am an average player who&nbsp;usually&nbsp; breaks even&nbsp;and
 usually will just be downright embarassing and go 6-18. To me the game is just a game. It holds no power over real life or my family. For what they give us (even better I imagine for a PS3 person as they get free service) I cannot complain for the fun this
 game provides. I have been a huge World of Warcraft player since it launched and after hearing complain about this and that for years I just do not think they realize what they are getting for 15 dollars per month. For the price of what we pay for Xbox services
 and for each game is far cheaper than most sports. You cannot&nbsp; even take the family bowling anymore for cheap compared to what we enjoy online.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Perspective? Perhaps it is a lost belief?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thoughts?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Again I apologize for the long read but most of this comes from a fathers heart.</span></p>

<p>Well considering the definition .... &nbsp;"relative importance" &nbsp;makes perspective different for everyone. So while you might have a goal of just having a fun time, some other dude finds winning important, regardless of fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp; just consider any hate mail etc as a compliment. you were doing something the enemy didnt like, and thats basically the goal in any multiplayer type game.</p>

<p>People just don't have manners. Whether it's in a game or not, that's the root of the problem. It is possible to be super competitive and still not be a jerk to the other guy/team, so the competitiveness of the individual isn't to be blamed.</p>

<p>The 3 examples you just gave are a microcosm of society at large right now, especially with the upcoming generation. &nbsp;With COD being the most popular game out there now, and with it breaking sales records constantly, it's reasonable to assume that a large
 portion of society is getting online to play it. &nbsp;Are you really surprised to see rampant issues with a lack of morality and decency on COD when you consider our society as a whole right now? &nbsp;Sure there are a lot of cool, interesting, thoughtful people out
 there, but such a large portion of the online community is so rude and indecent that it's kind of alarming.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>When you look at this upcoming generation of young people, it's not that surprising that they act like this online. &nbsp;They're being indoctrinated in the public school system to believe that they're the best ever, even if they don't accomplish anything of
 worth. &nbsp;They're being taught that they deserve to win, even when they don't. &nbsp;So obviously when they get beat, it's because the other person cheats or uses some underhanded tactic. &nbsp;Furthermore it IS an issue with parenting a lot of times. &nbsp;Whether that be
 from lazy parents or whatever, too many kids nowadays aren't coming from stable, loving yet disciplinary households.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>And don't even get me started on the level of intelligence of the upcoming generation, which I also believe has a negative effect on their interactions with other people. &nbsp;There's nothing worse than a moron that has been taught their entire life to believe
 they're always right, or that there is no absolute truth in many things. </p>

<p>Ever since the Internet became a community, &amp; anonymous communication became a thing, the worst of people has come to light, changing our perspective on our culture as a whole. The simple truth is that the bad news will always be more interesting than the
 good &amp; the same is true for online gaming. In this forum alone, how many threads do you see of players being rude or cheating vs. even 1 where you had a great game with some wonderful people? You don't.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>When it comes to competition, there will always be those who will want to win at all costs. This has been true since the beginning of time when sports 1st became a thing. The natives of Central or S. America originally had a sport where they would literally
 kill the losing team. The human race as a whole is driven to succeed &amp; in many cases it can be taken too far - it's the sad, but simple truth.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>As for playing video games &amp; ignoring family or life in general, I believe that for some (myself included), gaming has become an addiction &amp; a powerful 1 at that. Many use it as their "escape" from everyday life in order to get away from it all since games
 have the ability to draw you in to their own unique worlds where you can be or do almost anything (Skyrim, Grand Theft Auto, &amp; World of Warcraft come to mind). This obviously has its repercussions as social withdrawal prevents those that are addicted from
 taking responsibility from what's really important in life. My advice if you're falling into this rut is to take a break every so often &amp; spend it talking to your family or doing something with or for them. Once you can do that, slowly wean yourself off of
 gaming a little bit more. It works; trust me. You can also take care of your family 1st &amp; play 2nd; that way, the important stuff is taken care of 1st. For example, you can put your kids to bed &amp; then play the game late at night for an hour or 2 before going
 to bed yourself. This way, your children can't distract you &amp; more players will be online to boot (this also has the added benefit of having the younger players going to bed early on account of school the next day leaving mostly more mature adults online).
 This largely works for those in the U.S. since that's where most of the Internet resides &amp; there's a large window of 3 or 4 separate time zones to take advantage of around 9 p.m. to midnight or so. If you live across the world, your time frame will sadly be
 limited as well as the amount of players you will be able to play with.</p>

<div>My parents raised me to be thoughtful and respectful of others, even on playgrounds away from adult supervision. &nbsp;Some of the diatribe I hear coming from some of these punks on a daily basis I would never in my life dream of saying to
 another person whether I was behind a mic or not. &nbsp;I know there are a lot of people out there that are the same way and hold similar values, many of them right here on these forums. &nbsp;And yes, culturally our society is changing, and not for the better, IMO.
 &nbsp;</div>
<div>-</div>
<div>Look at a lot of the popular entertainment media available now (magazines, TV, movies, etc). &nbsp;Having a sense of morality and decency is almost outright shunned upon. &nbsp;When parents leave kids to be raised by Hollywood, which is rampant
 with foul language, violence, lack of inhibitions and an overall "do what thou wilt" mentality, the final product is going to resemble the substance they grew up on. &nbsp;The problem is especially compounded when parents don't monitor what their kids are doing
 and allowing them access (either knowingly or unknowingly) to entertainment aimed at an adult audience.&nbsp;</div>

<p>This isn't true in my experience, even when comparing the communities of COD2 and COD4 with the newest generation of gamers in MW3 and BO2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The "ease of communication" point does have some validity in the console vs. PC game comparison, but it doesn't explain "gl hf" versus "I'm going to &lt;expletive&gt; &lt;expletive&gt; ..." (you know the rest).</p>

<p>original title: System restore does not work - volume id not found 0x80070495</p>
<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>I have a problem to restore an image of w7 ( professionale edition )&nbsp; create using the standard tool of w7 on a new laptop with the same characteristic , pratically i need from a laptop ( with several software installed and configured following business
 requirement ) created as a master , replicate the image created to 50 new laptop ( same model ) with windows 7 professional installed.</p>
<p>It seems that the problem is the volume id so my question is , there is a workaround to solve this error , what could happen having 50 laptop with same volume id ?</p>
<p>Sorry for the question but I'm a System Administrator of Linux System so Windows is not my primary task :-) .</p>
<p>Starting from the dvd recovery disk I have followed the different step propose and then after some minutes the restore has been started the error messagge in object comes out.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>

    <title>Xbox 360 Game Loading Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ross4991  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 Game Loading Problem</h2>
                    One of my Fable 3 saved profiles will not load. It freezes on the loading screen. The other four Fable 3 saved profiles that I have under my Xbox 360 Profile work, so I know it's not my Xbox 360 Profile; the game works on the other Xbox 360 profiles so
 it's not the disk or my Xbox 360 system; I don't use or have ever used Xbox Live on my 360; It doesn't say that the saved file is corrupted when I choose it to load or when choosing to move it from or to an external hard drive, it just freezes while loading.
 I tried installing it then uninstalling the game both on the hard drive and on two different usb sticks, signing out then back in to my profile.<br />
The one that doesn't load works when playing multiplayer though. I can trade items and fight in battles when doing multiplayer, but it doesn't load if I choose to play it on its own. Is there some bug/glitch in that saved file, or is it actually a corrupted
 save file? Is there a way to fix this?<br />

<p>I meant couch co-op when I said multiplayer and give gifts to the second player where you can join another players world on the same Xbox 360. I should have been more clear on that part. What do you mean when you say 'that you put name to the output is likely

<p>I cleared the cache but that one inparticular save file still froze when loading. I was able to start a new game though. I have 3 Xbox 360 profiles, totaling about 12 game saves when combined, all but this one work. Is there any way to know if a saved file
 is corrupted? I've seen online pictures of when they go to the room in the game where you choose which file to load it says the save file is corrupted and others where when you are choosing to move saves/games/profiles between internal and external hard drives
 it says it's corrupted next to the file but my freezing file has shown neither.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. What is the make and model number of the printer?<br />
2. Did you already have an old driver for the printer installed?<br />
<br />
When you try to reinstall a printer driver, the old driver is actually not replaced. I suggest that you check and remove the existed driver, then reinstall the same.<br />
<br />
<p>I'd suggest you follow these steps and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>a. Click the "Start" button, type PRINTER in the search box and press Enter.<br />
b. Find the icons which are related to the printer and delete them.<br />
c. Right-click on the blank part of the window, and choose "Run as administrator"-&gt;"Server Properties".<br />
d. On the Drivers tab, select the listed printer and click the Remove button. Please then select Remove driver and driver package.<br />
e. Open Start menu, input APPWIZ.CPL in the Search box and press ENTER to launch "Programs and Features".<br />
f. Try to remove all related printer software.</p>
<p>g. Now visit the manufacturer's website and install the latest drivers for your printer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You may also follow step from this link which talks about a similar issue:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/unable-install-printer-printer-driver-was-not/d486c875-e737-4a0c-b2b0-e48d6b415b95">

<div>Hi &nbsp;- thanks for your response. Here are answers to your questions.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Did you make any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div><br />
<div>This Dell Inspiron 15R laptop was bought from QVC two weeks ago. I made no changes other than downloading some software (AOL, Camera, Belarc advisor, Classic Shell, etc.) and moved some personal files from another computer. I then decided to return the
 laptop since the the CD drive didn't work and the laptop did not meet my needs. Reset would make this very easy.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What is the exact/complete error message?</div>
<div><br />
<div>"There was a problem resetting your PC. No changes were made." &nbsp;I clicked on the link "Check for solutions to this problem" and a small window popped up for a second or two saying Windows is searching for a solution but it faded and no solution appeared.
 I uninstalled the software that I had installed trying reset again after each uninstall but always got the same result.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How are you trying to reset the computer?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I followed the same instructions that were in your email.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What is the make and model number of the computer?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Dell Inspiron 15R</div>
<br />

            I am having the same issue. I have a Dell Inspiron 660s with Windows 8 64-bit.
<div><br />
<div>I have tried both refreshing and resetting my PC and I always get the same message:</div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>"There was a problem resetting your PC"</div>
<div>"No changes were made."</div>
<div>"Check for solutions to this problem" - this is a link and when you click on it you see a window for a few seconds but then nothing happens.<br />
<br />
<div>I have made no changes except transferring a few files (music and photos) and installing a few programs (iTunes, Chrome, etc.).</div>
<div><br />
<div>My computer came with a "Drivers and Utilities" disc, but no operating system disc. At one point I actually received an error code of 80070490 while trying to reset the PC. I searched online and this was a windows update error code - but I don't seem to
 have any issues with Windows Update.</div>

            Great to see Microsoft simply ran away and never responded to this issue. 


I bought a laptop with Windows 8 and need to return it so I am trying to reset it so none of my information is on it. I have the same problem as everyone else in this thread. I even tried downloading a file onto the desktop, then trying to reset and it still said that there were no changes. Well, Microsoft, there WERE changes and I want to reset the PC. How do I do that? **** Windows 8 and **** you Microsoft. Going back to Windows 7.

You're a little late.. I already returned the laptop and will stay as far away from Windows 8 as possible. I already knew I hated it but getting a laptop that had Windows 8 by default only solidified my hatred of Windows 8. Maybe someone else can try this and
 they can report back with the results.

            Just in case anyone else reads this, I had the same issue with a HP Envy Sleekbook 6 laptop and was able to fix it. Granted, I work for a company that services HP laptops so I have more tools available to me than your average user. The issue lies in the
 sysprep tool. I did an OS recovery using the HP recovery media on this unit and then I used the sysprep tool in order to create an account since I accidentally bypassed creating the account the first time. After I created the account and tried to do the reset,
 I got the same error, "No changes were made." After finding this page and trying the solutions Anil Kumar had suggested (to no avail), I performed another OS recovery on the unit. This time when I created the account without first bypassing and having to use
 the sysprep tool, the reset worked with no problem. So the solution (at least for HP users) would be to re-install windows using recovery media.
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps!!</div>

<h2>            Could we finaly get X-axis options please.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>hi i know there were an other tread but&nbsp; &nbsp;it has been locked yesteerday&nbsp; so&nbsp; i m writing mine&nbsp; &nbsp; to share my voice&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;on the X-axis tread ...&nbsp; &nbsp; as you may know&nbsp; &nbsp;now these days some games plays in&nbsp; with x and y axis on normal some on&nbsp; invert&nbsp; and other
 plays on x invert normal y&nbsp; &nbsp;or normal x and invert&nbsp; y&nbsp; it always&nbsp; depend on the&nbsp; &nbsp;developper and... even with thead for the request on their support and so many&nbsp; asking for it they dont lift&nbsp; the finver&nbsp; even when we reach our to them t directly to know it
 they plans to politely do something about then they just&nbsp; tell us that&nbsp; &nbsp; it is&nbsp; our faut if we cannot&nbsp; play their way ....&nbsp; &nbsp;worst part&nbsp; is&nbsp; that thoses games usually have hundreads&nbsp; of&nbsp; controls settings for every little detail even&nbsp; &nbsp; controls for&nbsp; left
 or right&nbsp; handed&nbsp; &nbsp;the only thing they wont offer s a x-axis ....&nbsp; for one thing&nbsp; i&nbsp; do not belive it is my fault if i cannot play in normal because i got&nbsp; used to play in invert&nbsp; my whole life and i should not feel shame about this&nbsp; and now theses days video
 games cam&nbsp; &nbsp; even use AI to ajust the game to your gameplay&nbsp; bur asking for a x-axis invert&nbsp; option seems like asking the moon .... but i am sorry&nbsp; &nbsp;but normal x and y axis were made for joystick&nbsp; &nbsp;which i never used&nbsp; and&nbsp; for something simple as inverting&nbsp;
 right, left, up and down or not&nbsp; &nbsp;i feel like games should adapt to me and not the reverse, as far as know&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;some that plays in normal axis wont either be able to adapt on a game that woukd be in invert axis only&nbsp; well it is the same for us ....&nbsp; and&nbsp; as
 no one&nbsp; write em on the case&nbsp; neither xbox live on the game description&nbsp; we then learn&nbsp; it the hard way after we bought&nbsp; &nbsp;th game..... but&nbsp; i m kind of tired to&nbsp; buying&nbsp; games i cannot even play&nbsp; and&nbsp; &nbsp; now that&nbsp; game disc are becoming a thing of the past&nbsp;
 &nbsp;for thoses who would sell their&nbsp; disk wont be able anymore&nbsp; in the digital and streaming era&nbsp; and&nbsp; &nbsp;lets be clear video games arent cheap&nbsp; ... so&nbsp; it would be&nbsp; a necessity&nbsp; &nbsp;for&nbsp; &nbsp;the&nbsp; &nbsp;everyone of us out there that&nbsp; invert the x-axis .. we may look like
 a inority for many but&nbsp; there are&nbsp;tens of thousends of games like me&nbsp; &nbsp;who knows but still microsoft did a great job when they decided to&nbsp; &nbsp; let us basically remap or et everything on the xbox one controller even to switch the analogs stick allowing&nbsp; &nbsp; left
 handed to play with ease they even&nbsp; made an assisted controller to permit&nbsp; people with disabilities to be able to play games without limitation&nbsp; ..&nbsp; &nbsp;but&nbsp; still microsoft&nbsp; wont&nbsp; either offer&nbsp; a x-axis&nbsp; invert&nbsp; option&nbsp; but you offer y-axis invert&nbsp; which i dont
 understand&nbsp; why&nbsp; &nbsp;someone&nbsp; would invert uo and down but&nbsp; not left and right to me it just has no sense at all and&nbsp; ai dont see&nbsp; why adding a&nbsp; x-invert&nbsp; would be more&nbsp; &nbsp;complicated to add to the setting menu than the y-invert was so i think it is about time
 we finaly get a permanent option on the xbox itself&nbsp; so&nbsp; then players like me&nbsp; &nbsp; woudnt&nbsp; have to go trought thoses issues everytime&nbsp; &nbsp;they end up buying thoses games that&nbsp; &nbsp; wont have the option&nbsp; ...&nbsp; ..&nbsp; and trust me&nbsp; &nbsp;games like skyrim or red dead redemption
 2&nbsp; &nbsp; or rise of the tomb raiser&nbsp; are already challenging&nbsp; enough&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;so just try imagine how hard of a challenge&nbsp; it becomes when you&nbsp; &nbsp; turn the wrong&nbsp; way all the time and&nbsp; just die and die due to that&nbsp; .. i personally call the hidden hell mode difficulty&nbsp;
 and&nbsp; one&nbsp; last&nbsp; argument i have in favor&nbsp; of my request is that many gamers&nbsp; tend to build up&nbsp; &nbsp; rage&nbsp; over time when they are unable&nbsp; to beat a level or other&nbsp; &nbsp;... and&nbsp; they react different&nbsp; &nbsp;and i m no exception to this&nbsp; i do get mad&nbsp; &nbsp;when&nbsp; things aint
 doing well when i play but&nbsp; at least when it does i m smart enough to&nbsp; &nbsp; turn off the xbox&nbsp; &nbsp; and&nbsp; do something else&nbsp; &nbsp;and just try some other time&nbsp; &nbsp;but not everyone thinks that way ...&nbsp; the past 2 years microsoft&nbsp; started to hunt&nbsp; &nbsp;players with a bad attitude&nbsp;
 &nbsp;or thoses with aggressive&nbsp; behavior&nbsp; as well as thoses chatting or speaking with corse, vulgar&nbsp; &nbsp;or inapropriate language so i m.sure that an x-axis invert&nbsp; &nbsp;could solve&nbsp; some of&nbsp; the bad&nbsp; behavior&nbsp; &nbsp;on players&nbsp; and althought i not violent at all&nbsp; are but
 i ve seen people hitting on their girlfriend while gaming so it you wonder if it worth&nbsp; &nbsp; the effort to add&nbsp; a x-axis invert option&nbsp; as well as any futur options to ease gameplay to the gamer taste then think of it&nbsp; this way if it could prevent even just one&nbsp;
 violent act then it would big step&nbsp; &nbsp;as well as a big win&nbsp; for everybody ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>... yes this was a long message&nbsp; &nbsp;but this is my moice on this topic as well as many positive reasons why bringing&nbsp; a x-axis invert would make&nbsp; a great&nbsp; add-on to have on&nbsp; the xbox settings .</p>

<p>As a y-axis invert player, I can relate to your frustrations. Occassionally, I will play a title without the invert setting and it is a very hard adjustment to make.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, adding X-axis invert settings would have to be done at the developer level. I would recommend starting a discussion in their forums or tweet your suggestion to their handles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

            I believe you can fully customize your own controller settings entirely if you have an Xbox Elite Controller, including this idea may be functional. I have one but I have yet to try this. I would research the Elite Controller and see if it's possible and
 if so, the price of the controller is well worth it with all of its extra functions and precision.

<p>Unfortunately there isn't an easy way to do it with the Elite controller. The only options the Elite controller offers is Y Axis swapping. You could invert the inputs on the D-Pad by assigning the opposites to each direction, but I don't think that would
 give a very consistent play and it would depend on the game accepting D pad&nbsp; as a form of motion.</p>

 directly or even with Microsoft about adding an X Axis option to the elite controller! Talk to others that share your preference for inverted play. With some persistence and reason, you'll get a response and maybe even some action!</p>

<h2>            Why does the Show Windows Side By Side no longer work right&#63;</h2>
                    I frequently work in two windows at once side by side. &nbsp;When I click show windows side by side instead the windows are stacked in the left third of the computer screen. &nbsp;When will this be fixed? &nbsp;Is this a setting issue? &nbsp;Is Windows 10 not capable of reading
 my screen shape and size? &nbsp;What is not working?

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues using Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the methods.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> Perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps
 eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to
 perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></a><span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. It will scan your system files
 and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows. To run the SFC scan, refer to the Microsoft article below.</span></p>

            Not fixed so far. &nbsp;In order to get it to work correctly I have to restart the computer each time I get irritated at it. &nbsp;Within a few hours it no longer displays correctly for me. &nbsp;It does not seem to have anything to do with the number of programs open
 on the task bar either. &nbsp;Sometimes they will stack at 1/16th screen size on the left, other times about 1/12 in the left third of the screen.

            I would not want to create and go into a different user account because I will never get back to my account. &nbsp;There is no reason for this not to work correctly, as the issue has only existed since the update to Windows 10. &nbsp;When I tell it to put windows
 side by side it will do so once and once only if I have just turned on my computer. &nbsp;The more windows I have used, even if they have been dismissed, the more side by side does not work. &nbsp;It reduces the windows to smaller and smaller boxes and stacks them on
 the left side of the computer screen. &nbsp;This can be stopped for one event by restarting the computer. &nbsp;I do not program. &nbsp;I have not gone anywhere to create or edit settings to affect the window presentation of side by side. &nbsp;This is an issue that came with
 and has to do with Windows 10 that did not exist in Windows 7.

            <p>Please do not try to fix anything...</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>The feature is not really broken.&nbsp;&nbsp; (There is a proof at the end)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is why:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you select show windows Side by Side it shows you <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">all</span></strong> of the windows that are not minimized so you may&nbsp;<strong>select which&nbsp;two&nbsp;</strong>you want to view side by side:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pick one and drag it to the right side of the screen</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click somewhere on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pick another and drag it to the left side of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you have 2 windows displayed side by side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The function has been changed and steps added, but it would seem this is to include further functionality.&nbsp; (You can pick and choose your windows and have more than two open and even full screen)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Life is change, we can either roll with it... or become jaded.&nbsp; This is not worth getting overly upset about.&nbsp; It is unfortunate that many of us did not know this or where to find the info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>Proof of Point Example:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>(Try this, open <strong>four</strong> windows.&nbsp;<strong>Make two full screen </strong>
and <strong>two viewable but not full screen</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Select view windows side by side.&nbsp; (all windows seem to become tiled.)&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Select one window and drag it to the right.&nbsp;<em>(Leave at least one full size window alone)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click and&nbsp; empty space on the screen and then</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Select another window and drag it to the left.&nbsp; <em>(Leave at least one full size window alone)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Notice the windows you have chosen are side by side</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Now you have windows side by side.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>HOLD ON,</strong> there is more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now on the task bar, select one of the fully expanded windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You see the window is fully expanded again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>POINT:&nbsp; You can have 10 windows open,&nbsp; select two to view side by side, then the rest should keep their original view settings BEFORE you decided to view two side by side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that someone will hit&nbsp; "answer" to put this to rest for over 11K people.</p>

</p><p>When you click "SHOW WINDOWS SIDE BY SIDE", it is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
supposed to arrange all non-minimized windows side by side from the left to the right of the entire screen, in columns,&nbsp;<strong>even if there are more than 2 open windows</strong></span>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>still broken</strong></span>.&nbsp; What you propose is a workaround at best (unless you're trying to arrange 3+ windows, of course).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>POINT: It is possible in the material world to arrange more than 2 objects "Side by Side", and Windows should allow the same (i.e. fix what's broken), remove the feature, or rename it to "Show all Windows"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks anyway.</p>

<h2>            Windows on my new SSD thinks it isn&#39;t genuine</h2>
                    <p>Hello all</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to try and give as much detail as possible so please bare with me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently got a new SSD, with the intention of making it my new boot drive. Using Macrium Reflect, I cloned my old SSD to my new one and changed the boot drive in the BIOS. On first boot, all seemed well. I changed the letters of my drives. My old C: drive
 (original SSD) became S: and my new SSD (which was cloned to) went from N: to C:. I did this in windows, and later down the line I changed them in regedit also. Now, when I turn on my PC I get a black screen after the BIOS which gives me the option of booting
 from two different "Windows 7".</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I boot on my new drive, it says that this copy of windows isn't genuine and it's a blank blue screen apart from that message. Following advice from another person, I used control alt + delete to start task manager. From here I ran explorer.exe. I tried
 to open the control panel but that gave the following error: No such interface supported</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using CMD from the start menu but I am unable to run it as administrator. When I try to run it as administrator, I get the following error:
</p>
<p>“N:/window.... The specified path does not exist Check the path and try again.”</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, N: no longer exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon further advice I tried running "sysdm.cpl" but I got the same error as above</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, any help would be super appreciated!</p>

<p>-&gt; I might bear with you but I never bare myself with strangers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Using Macrium Reflect, I cloned my old SSD to my new one and changed the boot drive in the BIOS. On first boot, all seemed well. I changed the letters of my drives. My old C: drive (original SSD) became S: and my new SSD (which was cloned to) went from
 N: to C:.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>-&gt; I did exactly the same a couple of years ago, but with some essential differences:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an image, using Macrium Reflect.</li><li>Disconnect the old disk, connect the SSD.</li><li>Boot the machine with the Macrium Rescue Disk.</li><li>Restore the image.</li><li>Boot up normally. No change required in the BIOS.</li></ol>
<p>Your problem was most likely caused on the first boot while both disks were connected. This confused Windows and it resulted in the reassignment of drive letters, the boot device and some registry entries that are responsible for the "not genuine" message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your old disk still works as it should (all by itself, of course!) then I would repeat the cloning process.</p>

            P am experiencing a similar problem...upgrading from W7 to 10. I had signed up for automatic upgrade; when the time came software asked if I wanted to install W10. I said yes (mistake?) and the computer went to work. Before completing download of new software
 the installation cut out, a windoe came up and said that it was checking start up file, that it might take a few tries. It checks and reboots constantly. I have let it go overnight, but it does not stop checking and rebooting. At this point, my laptop is completely
 useless. Please help.

            <p>Your best bet and perhaps only way to fix this problem is contacting Microsoft Tech support...I gotta be honest ,initially had little faith in fixing ,but after being passed to Senior Tech support,they remotely fixed issue ... but because of constant rebooting
 and sound issues (as No drivers available for Win 10)...took some 3 days of support ,but the chap ,had the patience of God and knew his stuff always keeping in contact via phone ...Finally fixed and Win 10 is excellent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So rarely would I compliment Microsoft in the past ...but they really came through this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give them a try ... oh if you do get a impatient support tech ....call again ...but the senior support guys should be fine to deal with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps as feel your pain and frustration.</p>
