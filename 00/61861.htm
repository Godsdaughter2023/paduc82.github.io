    <title>Sudden Backup Failure -- Error Message 0x807800C5 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sudden Backup Failure -- Error Message 0x807800C5</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to find out how to help my sister -- very recently when she tried to backup her computer (to portable drive 1) and backup her files (to portable drive 2) she got an error message --&nbsp;0x807800C5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at the information on the Microsoft site about this error code but it is all rather old and much of it is very technical.&nbsp; As I mentioned, this just started occurring recently -- her backups are all scheduled but she wanted to be sure she had backups
 before updating to the new Windows 10 Update Procedures.&nbsp; When she tried to perform the manual updates she got the error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This appears to be a recurring issue -- is there a solution available that someone can use without going into safe mode or editing the DOS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your help in advance,</p>
<p>Linda</p>

<br />
<br />The information below I provide is thorough and verbose, but its the truth regarding Backup in Windows 10. and the alternatives you will need to consider. 
<br />
<br />File History, System Image, Backup and Restore in Windows 10 are partially broken and they are not being actively maintained or developed. Microsoft is planning to remove them in a future release. You are seeing the effects of this. You should switch to a third party solution such as Macrium Reflect (Free).

<br />You can also try using the built in System Image wizard to make a complete PC backup.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Your recommendation that my sister should use a different product when this error message is a recurring issue with Windows (I saw LOTS of postings about it over the past several years) I find questionable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the answers recommend using a different product (I’m always very skeptical about these suggestions) or they give instructions for making changes to the DOS (and my sister isn't going to be able to that).</p>
<p>
</p><p>From reading the posts it looks like, sometimes, when Windows updates it doesn’t like old backups on the backup media.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I find it hard to believe a solution to this issue hasn't been found over the years (especially since it comes and goes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone else please help me (and us) to find a solution to this problem a normal person can use?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Linda</p>
<p>

<p>Windows 10 does not have a supported backup utility. Yes, there are things that look 'sort of' like backup ... but they're not really backup utilities. Windows no longer offers that. It's Microsoft's bad for not making that clearer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many excellent backup programs - so many that you'll have a hard time choosing (but we can offer suggestions.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to be very blunt, your choices are to use a&nbsp;<em>real</em> backup program or to struggle through something in Windows that can't really do what you want and doesn't work that well.</p>

<h2>            Acrobat 8.10 Activation</h2>
                    <p>I've been using Adobe Acrobat Standard 8.1 for about 15 years. I installed it on a new laptop and now I can't activate it because Adobe took their servers offline.&nbsp; This happened a few years ago for the same reason, but Adobe's solution was to offer us a
 more secure version of our registered products with a new serial number for activation. This time around, I haven't found a workaround for the problem!&nbsp; Does anyone have a suggestion? I'd be happy with a filename and location of the e-license that was downloaded
 automatically&nbsp;during activation.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p>There are lots of alternatives to Adobe Acrobat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, understand that if you do not need to create PDF files, you do not need to buy anything.&nbsp; Adobe reader is free.&nbsp; If you will switch from Internet Explorer to Chrome, you do not need even that because Chrome includes a built-in PDF reader.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do recommend Chrome under any circumstances anyway, as to well over 60% of users of the web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do need to create PDFs, you may need a program.&nbsp; I have been told that Sumatra PDF is an excellent alternative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, FYI, if you have Microsoft Word 2010 (and&nbsp; probably later versions), you can create PDF's within Word.</p>

<br />No, it does not require access, but by default, some of these settings might be disabled by default to protect your privacy. 
<br />
<br />If you wish to a video conference in Skype and you noticed the option is not available or your Microphone is not working, it might need to be enabled in Windows 10 settings.
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Camera 
<br />Toggle on Allow apps to access your Camera
<br />
<br />Scroll down and make sure Skype is toggled on
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Microphone

<h2>            Issue with games with gold</h2>
                    <p>A few months ago i downloaded dead space 1 using the games with gold offer on xbox live gold. Recently i tried to launch the game only to receive an error message stating that i need to renew my EA access, despite it not being the service that was used to
 download the game as well as the error code 0x803f800d. If anyone has any idea about what caused this and whether i can fix it or if i have to buy the game back if i want to play it i'd appreciate it.</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this situation. I understand you had acquired the game Dead Space 1 from either EA Access or Xbox Live Games with Gold is that correct? I recommend going to your
<a href="http://account.microsoft.com/orders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Account Order History</a>&nbsp;and seeing if you can find the order for when the license was acquired. If it is EA related you'd have to contact them and see if it was through
 their services that it was acquired. Let us know with a reply how it goes! </p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            The game was aquired through gold, i did not have an active EA access subscription at the time that the game was downloaded and i have not purchased a subscription to the Ea access service since. Also the order history only showed games that were purchased
 on the xbox, excluding all games with gold games that were simply downloaded through the service and thus technically not purchased.

<p>Hey there! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you are running into these problems with the games you acquired through Games with Gold. Now although these games might not appear in your Order History you can always pull them up through&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.account.xbox.com/mygames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.account.xbox.com/mygames</a>&nbsp;Once you&nbsp;click on&nbsp;the link go ahead and log into your account and see if the game appears in here.
</p>
<p>If you see the game I would advise you contact <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Customer Support</a> to see if they are able to pull up more information on the game itself.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps. </p>

            I checked the "my games" tab on microsofts homepage and the game didn't show up there(despite being in my library on my xbox as well as being counted as a owned game in the total that is shown at the top of the "games" section of "my games and apps").
 I also checked when dead space had been available on games with gold last, and i did not own EA access at that time nor after it (although i have owned it before.)

<h2>            itunes issues with windows 10</h2>
                    we upgraded to windows 10 and i was still able to use my itunes and sync my 2 ipods and i was doing this several times a week. this week i plugged my ipods in and receive this error thing that says: &nbsp; "ipod has been detected but could not be properly identified."
 &nbsp;i have uninstalled itunes and reinstalled it. i have done a hard reset on my ipods. i called the apple support and they say that they have been getting many complaints about itunes not working with windows 10 and that there is some sort of glitch. &nbsp;can you
 please tell me what to do? &nbsp;i am lost without my ipods - use them every day at work and i'm constantly adding and editing my playlists and i have no other option at this point.&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience you are facing. Let me help you in resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that there are several reasons why iTunes may not be recognizing your iPod. I suspect that it's a misconfigured service. iTunes registers 2-3 services that recognize Apple hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you&nbsp;to refer the&nbsp;link to the Apple support article below and check if that helps.</p>

<h3> cherry dolphin  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91; Guide &#93; How to create a custom Xbox gamerpic on your Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>Open the
guide menu by pressing the Xbox button on your controller. </p>

<p>Move the
joystick up to the profile selection at the top. </p>



<p>Use the
"A" button to select My profile. Use the joystick and the
"A" button to select Customize profile. Select Change gamerpic. </p>



<p>Select
Upload a custom image.</p>



<p>Next, you
will land on the new UWP File Picker app. Navigate to a directory containing
your picture, from a USB stick, for example, using the hamburger menu in the
top left. </p>



<p>Alternatively,
you can also press the view key on your controller to switch to a different
app, such as Photos.</p>



<p>Photos
brings together any pictures you have saved in OneDrive's picture directory.
You can access it on OneDrive.com or by signing into a Windows 10 PC with the
same account. </p>



<p>Navigate
to the picture you would like to use with "A" and the joystick.</p>



<p>Note: Any
picture you use has to be at least 1080 x 1080 image size.</p>



<p>Once you
have selected the picture you want to use, crop it using the controls displayed
on the screen</p>



<p>When you
are finished, select Upload. Microsoft will verify the picture, and in around
two minutes, you will be good to go.</p>

            I have had this problem as well and tried alot of recommendations but none apparently worked.On the update box on my computer has&nbsp; recent time update tried had NEVER.<br />
So if you have this maybe this will work for you I tried quite a path with all having the same apparent result with the error 8024402F Coming up.<br />
This is such a mad mad world we live in (murphies law seems to be in control.)<br />
Do exactly the opposite what is logical<br />
First set your update setting to NEVER RECEIVE UPDATES, then UNTICK the two boxes below if they are ticked (one about any one can update,) and the other about being informed about available updates.(That one a box comes up are you shore you want not to be notified
 etc.)<br />
NOW USING MURPHIES LAW&nbsp; Leave all settings as is eg NOTHING SHOULD WORK<br />
NOW CLICK THE UPDATE BUTTON SURPRISE SURPRISE YOU NOW CAN UPDATE.!!!!!<br />
After updating ,check for further updates after the first batch.<br />
Then the settings can be put back to normal eg Receive updates Automatically, the tick the other two boxes.<br />
As you I have Windows 7 64bit.<br />
If this does not work let me know I will go back and mention other things I did that apparently did not correct the error but may be needed as well for the FINAL SOLUTION.<br />

    <title>What the heck happened to Kingdoms of Amalur&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            What the heck happened to Kingdoms of Amalur&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I played the game a few years ago, back when it first came out, as a rental from Gamefly. I bought two DLC for it back then, the Online Pass and the Sorcery Bonus pack. I still had them both on my hard drive, since they didn't take up a lot of space, for
 this whole time.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I saw the game was on sale for about seven dollars thanks to the Deals with Gold thing, so I figured I would finally buy the game, perhaps another DLC bonus pack or something. But when I started the game, it locked up when I chose New Game, when
 it was loading. So I figured, you know, it was just a one time thing, it happens with every Xbox once in a while. So I tried to play the game again, and it locked up at the exact same point.</p>

<p>Turns out, it was the Online Pass. As soon as I deleted that, it was playing perfectly. So I figured I could live without that and go on. After about an hour of playing, I finally got to the chest in the first town, thinking 'Alright! I'm starting as a Warrior
 this time, so I can use Shepard's armor!' (I played both the Reckoning Demo and the ME3 Demo as well), but... well, not even the DLC I paid for was showing up in the chest. The only item that was in the chest was the OmniTool Dagger things, only one of the
 items that was supposed to come out of playing the Reckoning Demo.</p>

<p>So I got to ask... what the heck happened to this game? As soon as I downloaded the game, my Xbox began to act freaking weird, and would even lock up on Xbox Home! It has never done that before, and it happened exactly after I downloaded the game! When I
 first played the game years ago, it ran perfectly fine, but now... geh.</p>

<p>I already have an EA Game Adviser supposed to email me in '2 to 3 business days', but since today is Saturday, that means the earliest I can expect it is to be about Monday, if I'm lucky. I would just like to know... well, what's going on? The first EA guy,
 who had a fairly hard time typing English mind you, I spoke to was being stubborn about it all. As soon as I mentioned that I wanted a refund, he was just about begging me to redownload the Online Pass from a code he game me. Of course, it didn't work, and
 the game froze again. And I have cleared my cashe, twice, and deleted and redownloaded the DLC, but nothing has been working.</p>

<p>I also read that the digital version of the game has the Online Pass already in it when you download it, which is why it freezes when you try and play the game. If so, that is even more of a reason why I want my money back. If I can't even USE it, I'm not
 going to let them keep my money. That is ten bucks right there!</p>

<p>Basically, I just want to know if anyone else is having these problems. Well, I searched for it, and apparently, A LOT of people are, with the exact same problems I'm having, so I know it's not just me. And if other people have the problems, then someone
 might have an answer for me.</p>

<p>Also... the first EA guy I spoke to was copy and pasting solutions from the internet for me to do. Seriously? He was asking me to go to a tower, I think, in the game, and walk back to the first time. I just freaking STARTED the game after two years! I don't
 know where that is! And while that might work, again, it was a new game, so I couldn't fast travel and walk back to and from that tower.</p>

<p>At least the guy gave me 300k in ingame credits for the Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer. I've been playing that recently anyway. :P</p>

<p>So then why is the DLC still up? While it may work for the disc version of the game, the fact that it doesn't for the digital version (which confuses me to no end as to why the two versions are so different) should at least require a warning on the DLC description.</p>
<p>Since the game locks my Xbox up with the Online Pass on it, as well as the DLC unable to work, I... well, I guess I will just have to try and get my money back. Even if the developer is gone, it is still EA's responsibility to make sure the DLC still works
 correctly, otherwise... actually, isn't it illegal to sell something that doesn't work like this? Or am I just thinking too hard about it? I'm not going to say "I'll sue you!" for about $13, but... well, it just doesn't sit right with me, that EA can have
 the DLC still up without at least a warning of some kind, and can get to keep my money. And if it happened to me, that means a whole bunch of people had this happen, too, especially since the game is one of the better games out there.</p>
<p>Meh, I guess I will have to wait until a day or two to get any further with this.</p>
<p>BTW, does anyone know exactly why the digital version has so many problems while the disc version works perfectly fine? That really makes no amount of sense to me.</p>

<p>I didn't mean that I am putting the blame on Microsoft, I mean putting the blame on EA, since they own the game and DLC and are responsible, no matter what, that it works. Microsoft has... well, alright, in a way, it is also slightly their fault, too, since
 they should check to see if the items they have on their marketplace even work properly for EVER version of a game, which is normally just two, the disc and digital versions.</p>
<p>But that would be me just being really picky. In the end, though, it's EA's fault. It doesn't matter if the developer is gone, it's EA's job to ensure the DLC is of good quality. It's not my problem if they don't have someone to fix it. I paid for something
 that should work. If it is a little buggy, if I had to run away and come back for the items to appear, ok, fine. I can live with that. But I have done everything that was suggested on the Internet for me to do to get the items. I fast traveled from one point
 and ran back to the town that has the items appear in, run back and forth, etc. The chest would reset, but it would say it doesn't have any items.</p>
<p>Ugh... and to top off my few days, I found out someone hacked into one of my Yahoo accounts to make a PSN account. At least it was one of my spare accounts and I caught it quickly. I even had the PSN support staff freeze the guy's account. Hopefully they
 can ban his Playstations as well, since what he did was very illegal, but I doubt it. Still, it was a win for me. :P</p>
<p>But anyway, no one still has answered as to why the digital version is so... messed up compared to the disc version. You would think they would have caught something like that when it was released... or was the digital version released after the developer
 went out of business? Because that could explain it.</p>

<h2>            Change administrator status on my Call of Duty 4 Application</h2>
                    I opened my <strong>Call of Duty 4</strong> Program&nbsp;by clicking <strong>Run As Administrator</strong>. Now I can't get the darn thing to change back. I can't get some files or programs to open the application when it is in this mode. It has for permission
 each time and some files or programs can't bring that screen up to say yes. My case in point My Logitech Controller has to open the Program from It's own Page, and since Call of Duty is run as administrator it can not play the application.

                    <p>Hi There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently my Webcam does not show up on my laptop<br />
<br />
I have tried all of the basic fault finding (updating drivers etc....) to no avail<br />
<br />
The Toshiba website does not have a specific driver listed for my model to that I am able to do a fresh driver install (compatibility mode etc)<br />
<br />
Can you point me in the right direction please</p>
<p>

            Toshiba would be the place to go to. Here is a good article I found.
<br /><a href="https://support.toshiba.com/support/viewContentDetail?contentId=4009117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.toshiba.com/support/viewContent...</a>
<br />
<br />If none work for you, try contacting Toshiba for the link to the driver.
<br />Hope this helps.

<h2>            IEEE 1392 Driver &#47; Hardware issue after reinstllation of Windows XP</h2>
                    
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I have recently rebuilt my editing PC with Windows XP SP2 (which was the same operating system that required a rebuild) and have had a few issues with the software in regard to Liquid Pro 7 and I now have issues with HD Capture from my Sony Z5 camcorder.
 Note that prior to the rebuild all aspects of Liquid operated perfectly including HD Capture from the Sony Z5</p>
<p>Initially I could not capture from the camcorder in any mode but with resolve I now can capture via the firewire (IEEE 1394) connection
<br />
With the camera in DV mode all works correctly&nbsp; and within device manager the camera is recognised in the imaging devise section as a Sony DV camera.</p>
<p>Changing the settings on the camera iLink from down convert on to off then allows the camera to transfer HD tapes to the firewire.&nbsp; Both the fire wire and the camera are disconnected and reconnected, then the camera is turned on, as is the PC which was advised
 by Liquid support and the system restarted.</p>
<p>When switching the camera on windows recognises that the camera is there though this time no imaging devise appears in the device manager (However when connected to another XP PC this takes the same format and the system allows capture in HD)</p>
<p>On the rebuilt PC, when attempting to capture the HD going into the logging tool with the correct iLink settings the camera is controlled i.e. play, stop and scrub but no picture or sound is seen or heard.</p>
<p>I am aware that in the past there has been a similar problem with other windows rebuilds and Liquid and as a result of this I have carried out a reinstall of Direct x 9 without a result!!</p>
<p>Both sound and graphics card drivers have beeen reinstaled post rebuild and all appear to operate correctly with the exception of HD Capture</p>
<p>It would appear that the problem is a common one with XP rebuilds and with the IEEE 1392 interface</p>
<p>Any ideas please????</p>

            Did you also install the motherboard (chipset) drivers? If not, you need to do so. You also need to update to Service Pack 3.

    <title>AD1984A Audio Driver Bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dpalmer3564  say:</h3>
<h2>            AD1984A Audio Driver Bug</h2>
                    We're an OEM company building computer boards (Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, Haswell) which include the Analog Devices, now Connexant, AD1984A HD Audio Codec.&nbsp; With Windows 7 and above, the codec is naturally recognized and a Microsoft driver (UAA) exists.&nbsp;
 The boards include headphone out, line out and internal speaker capability and all seem to work.&nbsp; It has been noticed in Windows 7, and in Windows 8.1, that the mute function for the internal speaker, which&nbsp;uses Mono Out on the AD1984, does not work properly
 in the lower right-hand tray.&nbsp; Mono-Out will mute, but will not indicate that it is muted nor can it be unmuted.&nbsp; This last state commanded is carried over across restarts and power-cycles.&nbsp; All other channels operate normally.

<p>Hi Chun, <br />
<br />
<br />
This is a possible hardware issue. Here are some solutions that you can try:<br />
<br />
<strong>Unplug your Surface and detach the Cover</strong><br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Wet a cotton swab with rubbing alcohol. (Use 95% or stronger isopropyl alcohol if possible.) Rub the cotton swab back and forth over the six circular magnets on the Type Cover's connector. After you're done, make sure the pins are dry and that no cotton
 fibers remain on the connector. Then clean the connector on your Surface.<br />
</li><li>Reattach the Cover, making sure that all the magnets touch the bottom edge of your Surface.</li><li>Reinstall the Surface Cover driver.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Reinstall the driver</strong><br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the search box in the taskbar, enter device manager, and select <strong>
Device Manager</strong> in the results.</li><li>Expand <strong>Keyboards</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Right-click <strong>Surface Type Cover Filter Device</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>Uninstall </strong>&gt; <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Restart your Surface. It'll automatically download and install the Surface Cover driver the next time you connect to the Internet.<br />
<br />
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Force shutdown the device</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.</li><li>
<p>Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both.<br />
The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.</p>
</li><li>
<p>After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.</p>
</li><li>Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, you can bring your device to a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/find-a-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Store near you</a> and have it checked by one of our personnel. If you're outside the US, contact our

            Hi  yashshah, activation issues are generally caused by installing a wrong Edition (Pro, Home . . . etc.) of Windows 10 and the activation servers at Microsoft refuse to activate . . .
<br />
<br />The only method for fixing this is to backup your data and reinstall the correct Edition of Windows 10 . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />If you are not running Windows 10 Single Language:
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />If you are running the Single Language version:
<br />
<br />Click this link and download the Windows 10 1703 ISO file
<br />
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />
<br />Then click this link to download the Microsoft tool to create the Installation Media:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<br />Are you using a TP Link WiFi device?
<br />
<br />If so, try downloading and installing the TP-LINK Wireless Configuration Utility software again from the TP Link website

            To synch Android phone with your PC, follow the below Microsoft help. This has 2 approaches
<br />1. Microsoft Phone Companion app
<br />2. Through File Explorer

            If it's the contacts, calendar, and mail you wish to sync, the best way, in my opinion, is to connect both to the same Microsoft account and sync through that mailbox.

<h2>            How do I customize the size of Paint 3D&#8217;s Canvas&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><div>In Paint 3D, I can click "Canvas" icon,</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2d997a8c-d4d4-4efd-b3e2-cdd2e13f2bb2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2d997a8c-d4d4-4efd-b3e2-cdd2e13f2bb2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>then can drag the canvas' corner to change the size of the canvas.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3e0ec3c-bc66-463b-93b2-a7a80205e47b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3e0ec3c-bc66-463b-93b2-a7a80205e47b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/20c4f905-54b5-4281-82b5-9f53015a8470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/20c4f905-54b5-4281-82b5-9f53015a8470" /></a></p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>Now I wanna each time while opening Paint 3D or using it, its canvas can have a fixed custom size of matching my mind.<br />
How should I do?</div>
<p>
</p><div>Take Paint as an example to clearly explain further:<br />
We know, we can easily customize the size of Paint’s Canvas, as for me, I can use Notepad to create a batch file named
<strong>ResetPaintView.bat</strong>, which reads as follows:</div>
<div><br />
<strong>reg add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Applets\Paint\View" /f /v BMPWidth /t REG_DWORD /d 0x00000021</strong><br />
<strong>reg add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Applets\Paint\View" /f /v BMPHeight /t REG_DWORD /d 0x00000016</strong></div>
<div><br />
(Why is its size set to so small? because I frequently paste the screenshot to Paint, so need it become small enough.)</div>
<div><br />
then save it.</div>
<div><br />
Each time use it, right-click on it and then run it as administrator.<br />
