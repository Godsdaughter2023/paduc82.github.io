<h2>            Black Screen, Cannot boot to Bios or UEFI, Win 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>After trying to log in with my password on my HP Envy 23 TouchSmart, MS locked me out.</p>
<p>The pc shut down and when I tried to restart, all I get is a black screen. I cannot boot into Bios or UEFI.</p>
<p>I have reset the cmos battery and reset the bios. </p>
<p>Still a black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the MS account site and changed the pw for the Envy 23, but I still cannot get past the black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other systems all work with my old ms password. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>
<p>Martha </p>

Thank you for your advice.&nbsp; I investigated how to back up the registry first and the instructions tell you to locate and click on the registry key or subkey that you want to back up.&nbsp; When I enter regedit in &nbsp;the start search menu I get 5 folders - all start
 with HKEY_.&nbsp; They are classes_root, current_users, local_machine, users, and current_config.&nbsp; There are also numerous files within each folder.&nbsp; Not sure which to back up.&nbsp; Frankly, I am concerned to do it since I am not that computer technically savvy. If
 I bring the computer into a Microsoft store, can they help me with what you told me has to be done?</div>

    <title>Custom labels in the Windows 10 mobile People app - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clive_930  say:</h3>
<h2>            Custom labels in the Windows 10 mobile People app</h2>
                    After much soul searching my wife and I have recently purchased Lumia 550 phones running Windows 10. However we find that the People app doesn't allow us to customise the labels of contacts phone or email addresses. For example the bank has three different
 phone contact numbers viz... Abroad, Fraud/lost/stolen and Enquiries. Yet within People the labels cannot be defined. My old iOS devices and a Nokia C5 and Asha 503 had no problem allowing labels to be defined. The work around with the Lumia 550s seems to
 be to create three different phone contacts. Are we doing something wrong? Or are there apps that can handle such basic requirement?

            <p>Thank you but that doesn't answer my query. The problem I have is associated with businesses that have multi numbers and the labels in Windows 10 cannot be customised. An example would be a bank. The main contact name I have used (in IOS/MAC and Nokia) is
 RBS. Then there are three numbers which I may have to call. One number is General enquiries. The other is Card Damaged or Lost. The third is Card Fraud. As far as I can ascertain Windows 10 does not let me enter custom labels into the People app. Yet the People
 app &nbsp;can read such details. For example when I share a contact with multiple numbers from ICloud to my wife's Windows 10 phone I am asked do I want People to open it. I press "Yes" and it opens it and shows the multiple numbers each under its own custom label.
 Yet when she saves it the saved contact has lost the Custom labels and shows only Windows 10 labels so she cannot see which number to ring if for example she lost her card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if the People app can read the custom labels why cannot it save them as contacts, and allow users to customise their own labels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have quite number of such contacts where a feature available on earlier generations of Nokia phones and Apple devices isn't available on Windows 10. I appreciate that one answer is to create three separate &nbsp;contacts for each custom number. Ie RBS General.
 RBS Stolen-Fraud. RBS Damaged-Lost. But this seems a rather backwards step for such new OS as I would have to do it for all bank and credit cards, health centre, car service and &nbsp;assistance, travel insurance etc. All the types of business that have multiple
 numbers some of which are used whilst in UK, others whilst overseas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Clive</p>
<p>I had a Lumia 930 on the Windows 8.1 version and had the same issue, no custom contact labels. I was hoping they were going to solve this on Windows 10, but obviously not. I really liked the phone but could not do without that business feature, therefore
 I went back to IOS. Microsofts loss I'm afraid.</p>

<p><span>Hi <strong>Rebecca</strong>,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the Proxy won’t retain its settings as turned off, it’s possible that a software conflict has occurred after the installed updates or it was configured incorrectly. To learn more about the concern, we’d like to confirm the build and version of Windows
 10 that’s installed on your computer. Type <strong>winver</strong> in the search box to get this information.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, have you tried changing the Proxy settings from Control Panel? If you haven’t done it yet, follow these steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Type <strong>Control Panel</strong> in the <strong>search</strong> box.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Network and Internet</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click<strong> Internet Options</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select the <strong>Connections</strong> tab once the <strong>Internet Properties</strong> window will appear.</span><span>Click
<strong>LAN settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Uncheck <strong>Use a proxy server for you LAN (These settings will not apply to dial-up or VPN connections</strong> under
<strong>Proxy server</strong> section.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>OK</strong>, then <strong>Apply</strong> and hit <strong>
OK</strong> again.</span></li><li><span>Restart your computer and check the result. </span></li></ol>

<h2>            I&#39;ve been unfairly banned</h2>
                    
<p>So, today I came home to find out that I had been comms banned, I was super confused as to why, I checked all my recent messages from the past week and found nothing. Absolutely nothing that would cause me to be banned, so I filed a case report.</p>
<p>When my case was looked over, they said that my ban would not be removed because I had said a racial slur to someone. So I looked over all of my messages from the past two weeks and still found nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it's unfair for Xbox to not provide any proof that I had actually done something wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that I found that could be offensive was me messaging someone with the gamertag "<strong>[Mod Removed - See Guidelines]</strong>" and saying "Who is the loser now" after team killing him in a game as a joke.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Hello Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate the time and effort you have put in to resolve the issue. I would like to assist you further from here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before proceeding any further, I would suggest you to start the computer in Safe Mode with networking and check if the issue still persists. If it doesn't, then place the computer in a Clean Boot state and check if any third party application/software is
 causing the issue with the IP configuration. Follow the below steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A. To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called <strong>
Clean Boot</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow: </span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Disclaimer: A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may
 also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a
 clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings
 may prevent you from following these steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>B. To disable any 3<sup><span>rd</span></sup> party unwanted startup programs in Windows 8 and above, follow:
</span><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/20119.how-to-enable-or-disable-startup-programs-in-windows-8.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/20119.how-to-enable-or-disable-startup-programs-in-windows-8.aspx</span></span></a></p>
<p><span>(Applies to Windows 10 as well)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, also temporarily disable the installed antivirus in your computer to see if it is blocking any incoming connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">NOTE:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily
 disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if the above does not apply, follow the below suggested methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method&nbsp;1 </strong>Release and renew IP address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also follow these steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>a. Press Windows key + X, <span>Select <strong><span>Command Prompt (Admin) </span>
</strong></span>and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>b. At the command prompt, type the following command and then press ENTER:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ipconfig /release</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ipconfig /renew</strong></p>
<p>c. Close the command prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method&nbsp;2 </strong>Reset TCP/IP settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press Windows key + X, <span>Select <strong><span>Command Prompt (Admin) </span>
</strong></span>and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>b. At the command prompt, type the following command and then press ENTER:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; netsh int ip reset c:\resetlog.txt</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you do not want to specify a directory path for the log file, use the following command:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; netsh int ip reset resetlog.txt</strong></p>
<p>c. Reboot the computer.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Windows button doesn&#39;t do anything</h2>
                    <div>Hello. My Surface Pro 3 Windows button does not work. I mean the capacitive button next to the screen. When I press it, it vibrates, but nothing happens. I downloaded the surface app and toggled both on and off the switch for it. It did not make a difference.
 I do not think it is a hardware issue, but a software bug. It is also completely up to date. Thank you for your help.</div>

<h2>            Says &#39;No device found for given serial number&#39; when trying to register my surface book</h2>
                    When I try to register my surface book I receive 1 of 2 deifferent error messages each time I try. First is 'No device found for given serial number' (sqju89lgqxP0qgofvtR+Yy.0). &nbsp;The other possible error message is 'Were sorry, but something went wrong
 on our end. Please try again later' (same error code as other message) &nbsp;....I've received these for 3 days now.

            I think you´re trying to register the serialnumber on the keyboard, correct?<br />
You need to register the serialnumber on the screen/clipboard which is located on the bottom (not under the keyboard)

            Unfortunately the cause of why i was registering the surface book was because its "broken down"... The serial number is actually on the bottom edge of the tablet/screen where it connects to the keyboard. I was able to disconnect the screen from keyboard
 by latches located on the left and right sides of the screen.&nbsp; One on each side between 4 and 6 holes up. The hole was at an angle too. Hopefully anyone in a similar situation will find these posts. THANKS TO ALL WHO CONTRIBUTE INFORMATION FOR OTHERS!

<h2>            cannot register new surface book 2 &#38; cannot contact support as endless loop</h2>
                    <p>i just purchased a surface book 2 and am trying to register it. I select canada, then Surface and then enter the SN from my device, tick the accept terms and hit Register. Error message "please provide a valid serial number. (/W8+zWDJg0GITIx/.0)&nbsp; My device
 serial number is correct and&nbsp; i have tried repeatedly to register with the same results every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>also your support online sucks for this issue as it puts you into an endless loop as it requires the device to be registered...VERY VERY frustrating!!&nbsp; perhaps some coding should be done to resolve the problem and some phone support to register an expensive
 new device when problems arise like this....not impressed! And now i see below that there isn't even an option applicable to this problem so i selected anything.</p>

            Look on your box. There are two SN #s, use the one on the top. One would assume that the SN # under the base that matches the on the bottom SN# on the box would be the one that you use to register, but no, Microsoft does not want you to use their warranty.&nbsp;

<br />
Why on earth MS supplies *two* serial numbers and decides to treat the one etched on the device as invalid I really don't know. But try the other SN on the label, and hopefully you should be good to go<br />

About Gamerscore corrections
<p>A gamerscore correction occurs on a player’s LIVE account when they gain achievements through avoiding game play and the use of external tools.&nbsp; LIVE is committed to keeping the service free of this type of behavior as it violates the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbox.com/Legal/LiveTOU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">LIVE
 Terms of Use</a>.&nbsp; When abnormal achievement or gamerscore activity is found, LIVE modifies the gamerscore of players who meet specific and automated criteria.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A LIVE player who obtained their gamerscore in this abnormal way will</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Find their gamerscore reset to zero, and</span>
</li><li><span>Be unable to regain all previously earned achievements, and</span>
</li><li><span>Be labeled as a “cheater” for the community to view (for members over 18 years old).</span>
</li></ul>
<p>While players who have been identified by these criteria will start from a zero gamerscore, they will still be able to gain achievements for future games.&nbsp; In other words, we give them another chance to earn future achievements by earning them as other “fair”
 players do.&nbsp; The original gamerscore correction will<em>remain permanent without any way to appeal.</em></p>
Questions and answers
<dl><dt><strong>Under what circumstances does LIVE correct a specific gamerscore?</strong></dt><dd>Specific and automated criteria are used to determine if a player has earned achievements by using tools that circumvent the game or avoid game play entirely.&nbsp; A player who meets these criteria has their gamerscore corrected.</dd><dt><strong>How does LIVE know a player has been cheating on their gamerscore versus another player?</strong></dt><dd>We look for abnormal achievement and gamerscore activity using criteria that identifies users who have used external means to earn achievements without really playing the game.&nbsp; Users who play games legitimately to earn an achievements are unaffected by
 this.</dd><dt><strong>Does being a “cheater” change a player’s experience on LIVE?</strong></dt><dd>We only correct the player’s current gamerscore and label them as a “cheater.”&nbsp; This label can be observed on Xbox.com, and through the player’s view of their gamercard on a console or PC connected to LIVE.&nbsp; They are still allowed to legitimately gain future
 achievements and the player’s experience doesn’t change in any other way.</dd><dt><span><strong>I think I know someone who has been “cheating” – why haven’t you corrected their gamerscore?</strong></span></dt><dd><span>For gamerscore corrections, cheating is when you gain achievements through avoiding game play and the use of external tools.&nbsp; If a player hasn’t met specific criteria then we don’t correct their gamerscore.&nbsp; If your
 definition of cheating is different, then gamerscore correction isn’t the answer – you should consider reporting the user through the feedback reporting system.&nbsp; It is also possible that the player is not cheating at all.</span></dd><dt><strong>I’ve had my gamerscore corrected, is there any way to appeal the decision?</strong></dt><dd>There is no way to appeal a gamerscore correction.&nbsp; We only correct gamerscores for players who meet the criteria 100%.&nbsp; Your best choice is to show the community you won’t do it again.</dd><dt><strong><span>But it was my little brother/roommate/guest that did this using my gamertag. Can I appeal?</span></strong></dt><dd><span>No. As is outlined in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbox.com/Legal/LiveTOU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Terms of Use</span></a>&nbsp;you are responsible for all activity on your account.</span></dd><dt><strong>I’m worried I might get my gamerscore corrected.&nbsp; What should I do?</strong></dt><dd>Like the vast
 achievements.</dd><dt><strong>I’ve heard of other players getting banned. Why don’t you just ban these gamertags?</strong></dt><dd>We believe in players reforming themselves, which is why gamerscore correction only applies to previously earned achievements.&nbsp; This allows these players to earn achievements like other “fair” players without having to get banned from LIVE.&nbsp; However, any
 user who violates the LIVE Terms of Use is subject to having their gamertag banned.</dd></dl>

<p>They don't do resets immediately. They do look at the account and it's dealt with in sweeps. Your account just might be in their next sweep.

<br />
If you'd like to continue earning gamerscore legitimately without the random chance of one day getting a reset out of the blue then you'd need to make a new gamertag. Other than that, you can try to post in the suspensions forum

                    <p>I have W7 64Bit Professional installed. &nbsp;In attempting to upgrade to W10, I was asked during the progess to uninstall security software, I think that the installer was trying to get me to remove fingerprint software. &nbsp;I uninstalled
 the security mangement packages but then it ask me to uninstall the DigitalPersona software. &nbsp;I have searched everywhere but I can't find any reference to DigitalPersona. &nbsp;I may have created a problem because while I was uninstalling the two security programs,
 a message flashed asking that I remove a certain one first - too late. &nbsp;I even tried to install DigitalPersona and unstall it - no effect. &nbsp; I know that I am vague about which programs were uninstalled but I can't remeber their names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I try to install W10, I get stopped to uninstall Digital Persona which I have never seen in my system - not in any listing to uninstall. &nbsp;Help, I really want to ,ove to W10.</p>

            <p>If you are using an HP computer over two years old there may not be any updates for the software you are being directed to remove , so you would be on your own to find replacements if you use any of the software. I manged to remove the security programs
 with a 3rd party uninstaller</p>
<p>
</p><p>Post upgrade the audio drivers were incompatible&nbsp; so no Cortana ,Skype, or audio recording though the speakers worked. Also after the upgrade the power manager failed which there was no update for and the computer would not shut down . I returned to Win
 7 Pro and preformed a factory reset to get things back to normal. &nbsp; </p>

            When you performed the reset, did your install pure W7 Pro or you reinstalled the original HP system? &nbsp;I was hoping that a pure W7 install rather than deleting HP software would create a smooth upgrade.

            The reset will install all the HP software as it was from the factory, so no pure Win 7 . I first had to restore / downgrade to Win 7 and then used the F11 key for the factory reset. If the Win 10 upgrade is not complete&nbsp; you can back though it will take
 some time to clean up. The Windows and HP updates after the factory reset took hours so be prepared if you choose to do so.&nbsp;

What is DigitalPersona Personal?
<div style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">DigitalPersona offers centrally-managed solutions that help Small Businesses and Enterprises achieve security and compliance with endpoint protection for access, data and communication. DigitalPersona offers fingerprint-based
 Windows log-in and an extra-cost file encryption module.</div>
Overview
<div style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">The most common release is 4.11.3826, with over 98% of all installations currently using this version. During setup, the program creates a startup registration point in Windows in order to automatically start when
 any user boots the PC. Upon being installed, the software adds a Windows Service which is designed to run continuously in the background. Manually stopping the service has been seen to cause the program to stop functing properly. It adds a background controller
 service that is set to automatically run. Delaying the start of this service is possible through the service manager. It adds a Browser Helper Object (BHO) to Internet Explorer. A scheduled task is added to Windows Task Scheduler in order to launch the program
 at various scheduled times (the schedule varies depending on the version). When installed, it will add a context menu handler to the Windows shell in order to provide quick access to the program. The primary executable is named DpRegApp.exe. The setup package
 generally installs about 83 files and is usually about 16.54 MB (17,339,456 bytes).</div>

 want to. &nbsp;I only search that finds a DigitalPersona reference is the W10 install program which wants me to uninstall it. &nbsp;Thanks again.

            <p>"The primary executable is named DpRegApp.exe." This makes me wonder if the program is buried in win32 or a similar type of folder. I didn't get a prompted to remove DP perhaps because I used the uninstaller which allowed me to remove all the registry keys

            My home build desktop is upgraded. As for the HP , Ive down loaded the media creation tool and may initiate the upgrade again before next July though I need to make sure my sound and web cam are going to work. Win 10 has bio-metric software and is expanding
 support for different finger print readers. The power manager problem is a major concern on a Laptop/Netbook though. As I wrote there is no current replacement for the driver on my particular model. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<div>1. Have you made any changes in the computer prior to this issue?<br />
2. Were you receiving any activation notices before all this occurred?<br />
3. Have you tried to start the computer in safe mode?<br />
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>I would suggest you to start the computer in safe mode and check for the issue status. If everything works in safe mode, you can infer that some third party services are causing the problem. Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party
 service. <br />
After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program, if you seldom use that software you can consider uninstalling it.<br />

<strong>Note:</strong> Please go through step 7 of the Kb to keep the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.<br />

<p>In Action Center, Windows Firewall is turned off and Norton Security is turned on. The system’s checkbox for each won’t let me alter these settings, and so I cannot “try removing it from the list and adding it again.”</p>

<p>
</p><p><br />
I am using a MICROSOFT "camera": LUMIA 930.</p>
<p>The 24.6 MB RAW (.dng) photos of the camera are not "previewed" (view - large or extra large icon) by my Windows 8.1 (at the moment up to date). System has 8GB RAM, Xeon processor and a lot of empty space in its SDD drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
File Viewer Lite 1.3.2 shows the photo and in the details it indicates:</p>
<p>Type: Digital Negative Image</p>
<p>Category: Camera Raw</p>
<p>Developer: Adobe System.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Thank you for any clue.</p>

I am trying to delete files in \Program Files\WindowsApps directory.</p>
<p>tried with a user who is an Administrator, cannot delete.</p>
<p>Activated built-in Administrator account, switched to it, still cannot delete file.</p>
<p>Opened elevated cmd prompt, did (icacls "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps" /grant Administrator:F)</p>
<p>Output: Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files</p>
<p>now I try to delete a folder&nbsp;</p>
<p>rmdir /s "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsofts.Advertising"</p>
<p>Output: Access is denied.</p>
<p>I also tried deleting file by file using del command, same output.</p>
<p>if I go and delete it normally, it asks for permissions?! I am root, it doesn't make sense to me.</p>
<p>I manually gave myself permissions via security tab, still cannot delete file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me gain real "full control" on my Windows 10 machine in order to delete/access files as I please?</p>

            Hi John.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year WIndows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />The most you can do for this in Windows is Take Ownership here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3841-add-take-ownership-context-menu-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3841-add-ta...</a>
<br />
<br />But using bootable media you can remove anything you want because Windows is inert and cannot protect it's System files that it won't let you delete normally because it will damage Windows.  This could be done with the Windows bootable media with a method like this but is strictly at your own risk:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Laptop only sees main computer as media device, not as file sharer&#47;sever</h2>
                    <p>I recently performed the April update on my main computer, which didn't start right and&nbsp;destroyed the partition on my HD.&nbsp; I reconsititued from an older image backup (with Homegroup) which was working properly, and this time the April update went through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that with Homegroup gone, my laptops only see my Main computer as a media device, but I can't share files (since I can't see the computer).&nbsp; All permissions are turned on (everything is set to "shared" on the Main computer), and it is not
 a Norton firewall issue (just checked with t/s).&nbsp; Network is working, since the laptop does see Main, but only as a Media Device.</p>

<br />Click Change advanced sharing settings

<br />
<br />Microsoft apparently has a workaround which does not require enabling SMBv1, for those who rely on the ability to 'browse' the network.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4034314/smbv1-is-not-installed-by-default-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/403431...</a>
<br />
<br />Explorer Network Browsing
<br />
<br />The Computer Browser service relies on the SMBv1 protocol to populate the Windows Explorer Network node (also known as "Network Neighborhood"). This legacy protocol is long deprecated, doesn't route, and has limited security. Because the service cannot function without SMBv1, it is removed at the same time.
<br />
<br />However, if you still have to use the Explorer Network in home and small business workgroup environments to locate Windows-based computers, you can follow these steps on your Windows-based computers that no longer use SMBv1:
<br />Start the "Function Discovery Provider Host" and "Function Discovery Resource Publication" services, and then set them to Automatic (Delayed Start). When you open Explorer Network, enable network discovery when you are prompted.
<br />
<br />All Windows devices within that subnet that have these settings will now appear in Network for browsing. This uses the WS-DISCOVERY protocol. Contact your other vendors and manufacturers if their devices still don't appear in this browse list after the Windows devices appear. It is possible they have this protocol disabled or that they support only SMBv1.

<p><span><span>Hi andreamholmes,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Did you make any software or hardware changes on your machine prior to this issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let’s follow these methods &amp; check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may boot into ‘safemode’ and check if the issue reappears. It will start Windows Vista with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs
 do not run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed, follow the steps to boot the computer in safe mode:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Restart the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Start tapping F8 key.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. You will get advanced boot option window.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. Select the option “Safe mode”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></a><span><br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue doesn’t occur in safemode, you may perform clean boot and then check if the issue persists. It will start Windows Vista by using a minimal
 set of drivers and startup programs and helps to eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The following link has steps showing how to perform clean boot:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Please ensure that the computer is set to start as usual by following
 the step 7 from the article: How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows7:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></span></span></p>

                    My windows 7 PC has not been updated for many months as I am having trouble checking for and installing any updates. &nbsp;It just stays on 0 percent when trying to download updates so I have given up doing them. &nbsp; I am going to upgrade to Windows 10 soon anyway.
 &nbsp;Does Windows 7 have to be up to date before I do the upgrade to Windows 10 or won't it matter at all. &nbsp;Hopefully someone can advise me.

            <p>Hi Terrell,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue could be caused due to some incorrect display settings or due to an incompatible display driver. I would suggest you first check if the screen resolution is set for the recommended setting by following the suggestion sin this link:</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note; Though this article is for Windows 8/8.1, the suggestions provided holds good for Windows 10. The way to access certain settings might be a little different in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, it could be due to an incompatible display driver. In this case,
 latest Windows OS and install it in compatibility mode. Type 'Compatibility' in the search box and select 'run programs made for previous version' to run the compatibility troubleshooter.</span></p>

    <title>Xbox game digital resale value&#47;return option - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frostthevii  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox game digital resale value&#47;return option</h2>
                    <p>So in todays day and age we have digital downloaded games more than ever before and I don't know about you but I mainly buy all my games digitally now. I have 150+ games at least digitally downloaded. But there's one huge flaw when buying digital games. No refunds or resale value. That and no ability to let friends borrow games but that's another subject I may get to after my main point. How about we add the ability to "return games". I mean even if I didn't get 100% of the funds back I'd be ok with getting partial return back, especially if I finished/got bored of a game. I'd say add the ability and give 1/4 - 1/2 of the funds back to the purchaser in some way(like maybe a button like the uninstall button but it just says return/partial refund). And as for the sharing games, maybe make it to where there's a page or something that shows what all games your friends have and add a button to "request to borrow" from said friend. And if they agree, just make it a timer like Xbox does with v

            <p>"there's one huge flaw when buying digital games - No refunds or resale value"</p><p>&nbsp;- It comes down to the game developer. If you buy Call of Duty, that game is made, managed and controlled by Activision. Microsoft I'm sure get's a small percentage of that and you get the digital license for that game to remain licensed to your account.</p><p>&nbsp;- Unless or until companies like Activision, EA, Rockstar and so on, want to give their money back to you for a "return" process</p><p>&nbsp;- You can buy most games on disc and then sell that game back to Gamestop or whom ever and you'll get $10 or so for that</p><p>&nbsp;- Another option for EA games is their EA Access or the Xbox Game Pass<br /></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for the updates.</p>
<p>Did you perform Refresh the PC and then tried to update to Windows 8.1 to check for the issue?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you haven't performed Windows 8.1 update, the I would suggest you to update the sound, graphics, chipset and other device drivers to the Windows 8.1 version by referring to the computer manufacturer website and check.<font color="#000000">

    <title>Question about Skype Description in app store - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Question about Skype Description in app store</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I was wondering why the description on Skype is full of symbols. Is it safe to download skype? Just want to double check that skype from the microsoft store wasn't hacked since these symbols show up on the Descriptions, on the what's new in this version
 section and where it says published by. I get the same symbols on my laptop, windows 10 tablet and desktop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>None of the above fixed the issue. This is a fresh install of windows on my desktop. My windows tablet and laptop have the same exact issues with windows installed earlier this year. I've checked 20 or so other apps and none of the other apps show those
 same symbols you see on my picture above. It only shows up on Skype's description. All computers are up to date. Delivery optimization that allows downloading updates from other pc's is turned off on all devices. They're all running windows 10 home running
 Microsoft store Version 11808.1001.9.0. Laptop and tablet have been scanned for viruses and malware with various programs and both come up clean. Desktop doesn't have an antivirus since it's a fresh install. Just find it odd I'm having the same issue on all
 devices and it's only with the skype app. As you can see below other app descriptions show up normal.&nbsp;</p>
