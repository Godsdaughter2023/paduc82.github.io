    <title>Setting up default connection for accessing emails &#40;N96&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Setting up default connection for accessing emails &#40;N96&#41;</h2>
                    I had a quick look and found similar problems on here, but none that I thought were the same.<br />
<br />
I've been able to set up Gmail to be received through my 'Messaging' on my N96. Turns out its quite a handy function. Also figured out that you can get it to automatically check you mail at regular intervals. I want to use this, but I don't want to have to
 select the connection every time the phone wants to check for new mail. So I need to set up a preferred connection. That's no problem...<br />
<br />
The problem occurs when I try to select my WLAN as default. However, every time I select it, the phone freezes up. Not completely, as I can change programs and even exit the messaging settings via the hang up key, but if I do that, it doesn't make any changes.<br />
<br />
I have deleted and restored the WLAN connection, I have accessed my inbox manually, so it isn't a problem on Google's end, and I have checked the various connection options to no avail.<br />
<br />
So, does anyone know why it my phone would freeze when trying to set up my WLAN connection as the default connection for accessing my e-mails? Any questions about my situation, just ask and I will gladly supply whatever you ask for.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

<p>I think I've finally discovered why the "uninstall support tool" is unable to remove Office 365 for me.&nbsp; When I tried to use the manual method: The first thing it told me to do, was delete the "Microsoft Office 16" folder.&nbsp; But as you can see from this screenshot.&nbsp;
 It doesn't exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>&lt;image&gt;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd already set it to show hidden directories, as you'd advised me to do earlier, but it can't find it.&nbsp; I've even tried looking the old fashioned way, using the command line.&nbsp; To no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I did try to use the "uninstall support tool", it initially told me that it couldn't find Office, then claimed to have removed it (how can both be true?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a specific file I could search for, that should be in the "Microsoft Office 16" folder?</p>
<p>As it's obviously using a different folder name.&nbsp; Hopefully that will be enough to complete the instructions, and remove Office 365, so I can reinstall it.&nbsp; And there won't be any more discrepancies.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, that reply does not show up on the question ... </p>
<p>
</p><p>Try looking for Winword.exe . That will be in the Office folder.</p>
<p>Try looking for OfficeC2RClient.exe&nbsp; as part of CTR.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is nothing to remove, then the job has been done successfully, right?.&nbsp; It's an optimistic program, don't rain on it's parade... &lt;g&gt;

<p>Hi MlamleliMpofu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to know more about this concern to better assist you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you received an error code/message when trying to print HTML content in your emails?</li><li>Is the issue also happening in other emails without HTML content?</li><li>Is your Outlook updated?</li><li>Did you make any recent changes prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Also, here are the steps that you may try to sort out the issue:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1: </span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Investigate possible add-in issues.</span></strong></p>
<p>Although add-ins can enhance your user experience, they can occasionally interfere or conflict with Outlook. Try to start Outlook without any add-ins running.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>Type <span><strong>Outlook.exe /safe</strong></span>, and then click <strong>
OK</strong>.</li><li>If the problem is resolved, click <strong>Options</strong> on the <strong>File</strong> menu, and then click
<strong>Add-Ins</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>COM Add-ins</strong>, and then click <strong>Go</strong>. </li><li>Clear all the check boxes in the list, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Restart Outlook.</li></ol>
<p>If the problem does not occur after you restart Outlook, one of the add-ins is likely the cause of the problem. Restore the add-ins one at a time until the problem does occur to determine which add-in is causing the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2: Repair Outlook.</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Right-click the <strong>Start</strong> button <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.content.office.net%2fen-us%2fmedia%2fde9c1ffe-f29a-47b1-a811-95ca547d07c6.png" />(lower-left corner), and select
<strong>Apps and Features</strong> on the pop-up menu.</p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.content.office.net%2fen-us%2fmedia%2f14988695-f994-4dbe-992c-de81eeacf23d.png" height="240" width="173" /></li><li>
<p>Select the Microsoft Office product you want to repair, and select <strong>Modify</strong>.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;This will repair the entire Office suite even if it's just one application you want to repair such as Word or Excel. If you have a standalone app installed, then search for that application by name.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Depending if your copy of Office is Click-to-run or MSI-based install, do the following.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><strong>(Click-to-run)</strong> </p>
<p>-In <strong>How would you like to repair your Office Programs</strong>, select
<strong>Online Repair</strong> to make sure everything gets fixed, and then select
<strong>Repair</strong>. (The faster <strong>Quick Repair</strong> option is also available, but it only detects and then replaces corrupted files.)</p>
<div>
<p><strong>(MSI-based)</strong> </p>
<p>-In <strong>Change your installation</strong>, select <strong>Repair</strong> and then click
<strong>Continue</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the repair.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 3: Repair Outlook data files.</span></strong></p>
<p>When you install Outlook, an Inbox repair tool <strong>(scanpst.exe)</strong> is also installed on your computer. The Inbox repair tool can resolve problems by scanning your Outlook data files, and repairing errors. To use the Inbox repair tool, exit Outlook,
 and then follow the steps provided in this article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-outlook-data-files-pst-and-ost-25663bc3-11ec-4412-86c4-60458afc5253?ocmsassetID=HA010354964&amp;ctt=1&amp;CorrelationId=b8bd93fe-2d53-440e-a2dd-127257538db7&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Install Outlook Icon on desktop,unable to create a shortcut, either the Task Bar or the Desktop.  Outlook App does not appear on the listing in all app</h2>
                    <p>Running &nbsp;Windows 10 on Laptop and have been using MAIL for emails.</p>
<p>Last week I installed the free copy of Outlook. The system created the Blue Box Icon on the start menu, similar to &nbsp;Mail. When I click on the Icon it works.</p>
<p>I attempted &nbsp;to create a short-cut to either the Task Bar or the &nbsp;Desktop.. The Start Blue icon has no option to Pin to Taskbar. I tried to create a link on the desktop using Right-click, new ..... but could not find the outlook.com file.</p>
<p>How do I create a one-click link on Desktop or Taskbar.</p>
<p>If I &nbsp;click on All Apps the Outlook App does not appear on the listing.</p>
<p>If I &nbsp;hover the mouse over the blue &nbsp;icon it shows as *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you perform a soft reset. Press and hold the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong>&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><span>and<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><strong>Power</strong>&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f71780ab3-e8a1-45b0-a0d1-220bfbe6b989%2fhardware-icon-power-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />button
 until your phone vibrates and restarts. Note that you should not touch the device screen during this process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears). After performing a soft reset, try to check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>If a soft reset didn't work, we suggest that you perform a hard reset instead. You can reset your phone under Settings:<strong>Settings<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><strong>&nbsp;&gt;
 about &gt; reset your phone.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Make sure to back up all of your files before performing a hard reset.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Go to Settings<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Backup
 &gt; Apps + settings &gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>Back up now.</strong></p>
<p>If performing a soft reset and hard reset didn't work, we suggest to use the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows Device Recovery Tool</strong>. Start by downloading and installing&nbsp;<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows
 Device Recovery Tool</a><span>&nbsp;</span>(for Windows 10, 8.x and 7).</p>
<p>When the installation has finished, start the application and the main screen will appear:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f15d5ce4-a84f-4de7-ad34-a83e6a7a349f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The procedure to restore your phone using&nbsp;Windows Device Recovery Tool is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect&nbsp;the phone to your PC (using the USB cable that came with the phone).</li><li>After a few seconds, the PC should find the phone and you'll see the Phone Selection screen. Click your phone in this screen to select it.</li><li>After a few seconds more, the latest available firmware version for your device will be shown. Click the '<strong>Install software</strong>'/'<strong>Reinstall software</strong>'&nbsp;button to flash your phone</li></ol>
<span>Windows Device Recovery Tool will then download and install the latest firmware + OS available for your phone</span>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note!</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Your phone will be reset to factory status when using this tool.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>cannot edit curve control points in PowerPoint 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williamejohnston  say:</h3>
<h2>            cannot edit curve control points in PowerPoint 2016</h2>
                    <p>In PP 2010 I could edit the control point types: smooth, corner, straight, etc. In PP 2016 the menu comes up when right-click a control point, but the options are always greyed out:</p>
<p><strong>PP 2010</strong></p>

            <p>No idea what is going on.</p>
<p>I though that it might be an artifact of having imported a PP 2010 drawing, but that is not the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The simplest example fails:</p>
<p>- open a new PP 2016 slide</p>
<p>- draw a curve</p>
<p>- right click curve and select "edit points"</p>
<p>- when control points appear, right click a control point.</p>
<p>- all control point options are greyed out:</p>

            <p>I should also point out that I can operate the control point "arms" but only in a fixed, symmetrical configuration.</p>
<p>Operating them asymmetrically or independently requires that you change the control point type, which is what is not available.</p>

<h2>            Build 10061 Shows That Windows 10 Might Be A Contender</h2>
                    <p>While there are still bugs (lots of bugs), the Start Menu needs major work and Update needs to be fixed,&nbsp; the performance and response of Windows 10 is finally back like the early TP builds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Build 10049 scared me,&nbsp; I was afraid I'd have to actually use
 Linux for an OS.&nbsp; And while that's not awful, I just knew there would be a steep learning curve (my laptop that I use to TP Windows 10 is a dual boot with Linux Mint).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I will never use half the "FEATURES" of Windows 8, 8.1, 10, e.g. Store apps are ****.&nbsp; But I knew that eventually I'd have to update my Windows 7 to Windows Future (10)&nbsp; and as I stated before I was scared that the future was awful.&nbsp; I think I could
 live with Windows 10 based on Build 10061. &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            <p>For me 10061 is no better than 10049 - indeed, there's a new problem for me where the start menu loses focus every couple seconds so I can't use it. &nbsp;For example, if I click on all apps, just as I'm scrolling way down to find something, the menu disappears
 and I'm staring at the desktop. &nbsp;I have to rush to get anything done before it slips away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then again it's just running on a spare computer so it's not in my way, but this experience doesn't make me at all confident in the idea of using Windows 10 to do anything useful.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not happy at all with Windows 10 as it is now.&nbsp; The Start Menu bug in the latest build should have taken mere minutes of one programmer's time to fix.&nbsp; I really expect better from the world's largest software company.&nbsp; The Start Menu seems to crash
 Explorer a lot too.&nbsp; Back to Classic Shell (which is is an amazing piece of software despite being freeware written by a couple of people).&nbsp; Oh, and build 10061 broke the
<strong>Apps</strong> menu in Classic Shell.&nbsp; This just goes to demonstrate why we need Microsoft to give us a good Start Menu and Aero Glass theme too: Windows Updates can break 3rd-party hacks/workarounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm still seeing a lot of little bugs (redraw errors and other glitches) that didn't exist in some of the early builds.&nbsp; I sure hope it's at least&nbsp;<em>stable</em> when they release it!&nbsp; And meanwhile, the ugly "Metroification" of Windows is continuing
 unabated despite heavy feedback.&nbsp; The Start Menu remains a mess; not catering to either Start Menu or Start Screen enthusiasts.&nbsp; Cortana is clumsy and less secure compared to the search bar we used to have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, what else...&nbsp; Oh, I hate the new color scheme on Calculator.&nbsp; Black was classy.&nbsp; Now its titlebar merges in with the rest of the UI (I notice this on other programs too).&nbsp; Still it has no buttons, just text printed on a boring background.&nbsp; It really
 doesn't take anything fancy to make it look like it has buttons—just a vertical gradient for each row with gray 1px lines between buttons.&nbsp; Here's an example of what that could look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88532021-17d5-4ccc-ad35-f237f0429940" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Versus the cheap, boring, flat, and undefined (i.e. Metro) theme it has now:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/13583b6c-d46f-471f-a59e-bbfe0a72f681" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the plus side for this build, I like the black and yet transparent taskbar.&nbsp; And this build does seem to respond faster than some of the recent builds.&nbsp; Just an impression since I haven't measured anything.&nbsp; Oh, I partially take that back.&nbsp; I did
 benchmark Spartan, which did a couple hundred points better than last build.&nbsp; It also had&nbsp;fewer redraw issues/breakdowns.&nbsp; Still it has over 1000 points to go before it reaches the speed of Firefox.&nbsp; And it still lies and tells sites that it's Chrome.&nbsp; C'mon
 Microsoft, it's time to proudly make your browser advertise itself as Spartan!</p>

<h2>            My Bing Ad Account Got Closed. Please help. Newbie in Bing Ads.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I am new in Bing Ads but have experienced in other AD Platforms. A friend of mine recommended Bing Ads so I have reviewed the policies and studied how to run an ad. Since I am a newbie, I failed to edit the ad distribution and made a mistake on the ad
 schedule since I am used to the scheduling of other platforms. I thought it will also work the same way with the other ad platform. When I realized that I made a mistake I deleted the campaign and created a new one then I got an error and got logged out from

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I am new in Bing Ads but have experienced in other AD Platforms. A friend of mine recommended Bing Ads so I have reviewed the policies and studied how to run an ad. Since I am a newbie, I failed to edit the ad distribution and made a mistake on the ad
 schedule since I am used to the scheduling of other platforms. I thought it will also work the same way with the other ad platform. When I realized that I made a mistake I deleted the campaign and created a new one then I got an error and got logged out from
 my account. It says that Bing needs to review my account.&nbsp;</p>

            Yes, the prompt just keeps reappearing and the document doesn't load. I have never had this happen before. I think it has something to do with Windows 10 that I upgraded to.

<p>
</p><p>As per your concern to access the anti-virus software on Windows 10, we will help you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender it runs automatically and continuously, preventing new spyware infections and removing old ones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</p>
<p>

            <p>I think you are asking the wrong question.&nbsp; And most definitely you are asking in the wrong place, since very few here in these consumer forums even know what EMET is, let alone what it does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A better question&nbsp;to ask&nbsp;yourself would be: Do I know what EMET is and what it does and if so, do I need the additional protection it provides and wish to learn how to use it properly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I say this is because virtually anyone could benefit to some extent from the exploit protection that EMET provides, but very few really understand what this is or how to configure and use such a relatively complex tool.&nbsp; Though it's claimed by
 some to be easy to use, in reality few of these people truly understand what they are doing and so are likely creating configurations that if even functional, are probably at least questionable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'll turn this around and ask you, do you feel you fully understand what EMET is and does and would you feel comfortable configuring its settings for your specific operating system, including whether that is a 32-bit or 64-bit version?&nbsp; If you didn't
 understand even one single thing I've mentioned above, you at least need to read much more before attempting to use EMET and might be better off avoiding it altogether if you don't wish to make the effort to learn everything I've discussed and more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason for this is that EMET was really designed for use in large organizations where technically knowledgeable systems administrators and security professionals would select and configure such tools.&nbsp; Though it's been designed for a simple initial default
 installation, that both doesn't insure the best protection the tool can provide and more importantly, doesn't help if you later decide to remove it, since some of the changes it makes must be manually reversed before removing the tool itself.&nbsp; It also doesn't
 help you determine whether problems that EMET may cause with certain applications are due to the tool or something else entirely, so some willingness to trouble-shoot these potential issues may be necessary.</p>

    <title>Macros disabled and can&#39;t enable them to run - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Macros disabled and can&#39;t enable them to run</h2>
                    <p>I have moved my default folders for templates and add-ins to customized locations, so Normal.dot and my macro add-in template are both in other folders that are not the defaults. &nbsp;I just went through a situation where Word did an "update" and they blew away
 all my macros that I've been building up over months. &nbsp;Now that I have customized the folders and created some macros, they worked for a few days and then stopped working on a particular file. &nbsp;I get the warning,&nbsp;<em>"The macros in this project are disabled."&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;I
 have gone into the macro options on the Developer tab (as well as File &gt; Options) and enabled all macros, but it still doesn't work. &nbsp;I have closed and restarted Word after changing settings. &nbsp;Any ideas on how I can get my macros to work? &nbsp;Thanks in advance
 for any help.</p>

<p>I have had this problem in the past and I fixed it by updating the Skype version. I have window 10.</p>
<p>This time I have the most updated Skype version but I can't communicate through Skype since my contacts are offline (but I know they are available and I can contact them using another device).</p>

<h2>            Excel page size in relation to rows</h2>
                    <p>I have an issue with Excel 2016: I have a spreadsheet which is meant to be printed as a report to a pdf. When i use it on an connected screen (res: 1920x1200), it fits 56 rows on to one page. But if i use the spreadsheet on the screen built in to my laptop
 (res: 1920x1080), it only fits 54 rows on a page!!! This means that I can not be sure of how many rows will be on each page, if printed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Romel</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your message. I am well aware that i can change the print settings (margins, zoom, etc.), and also frequently use the printing preview. But my problem is that the screen resolution affects what is fitted on to one page: With a screen resolution
 of 1920x1200 excel can fit 56 rows on one print page in this document, but if the screen resolution is 1920x1080, it can only fit 54 rows! The same document on the same laptop!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This means that you can not make a spreadsheet, for printing as a pdf, and be sure that it has the page breaks after the same numbers of rows, independent on the computer(or screen resolution) that it is opened on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to work around this specific issue, because it is a big problem.</p>
<p>

</p><p>What you see on the screen or how it was shown using either of the screen resolutions you have set on the display settings, will not affect the actual printed document as long as you set it on the print settings.<br />

Have you tried printing test pages using both screen resolution to see if they have different outcomes?<br />

                    <p>I am unable to print text in Word 2016 or Excel 2016. I can print highlighted, but no text. Grid lines print in Excel, but no text. I checked my printer (Canon MG6230) by printing from a Mac. Printer test documents print also.</p>
<p>I was able to print several weeks ago, but not now. Wonder if latest Windows update caused a problem. I'm running Windows 10 on an HP laptop.</p>

<h2>            Shared Mailbox not showing up in Outlook 365 but it does in OWA</h2>
                    
<p>had an instance where an employee is no longer with us, converted the mailbox to shared and set another user with full permissions. &nbsp;Outlook 365 (2016) doesn't show the mailbox, even after manually adding. &nbsp;Error message is: "Cannot display the folder. Microsoft
 Outlook cannot access the specified folder location." &nbsp;Tried clearing cached/offline mode as well. &nbsp;No joy. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Works fine in OWA but the boss wants this working in Outlook. &nbsp;Suggestions?</p>

<p>hi stevebatchelder,</p>
<p>please make sure the permission has been assigned &nbsp;correctly, i would suggest you use powershell to give the permission via the steps below:<br />
a.&nbsp;.<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">connect to exchange online using remote powershell&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;<br />
b. run the command using windows powershell to check if the permission exists in the exchange online server:<br />
<strong>get-mailboxpermission –identity “*** Email address is removed for privacy ***” | ft user,accessrights</strong><br />
c. run the following cmdlet to add the full access permission for the mailbox.<br />
<strong>add-mailboxpermission -identity "sharedmailboxidparameter" -user "username" -accessrights fullaccess</strong></p>
<p>if the permission is correct and the issue persists, to better understand the situation, i’d like to collect the information below:<br />
1. a screenshot of the error message.<br />
2. has the user tried&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manage-profiles-in-outlook-2016-for-mac-fed2a955-74df-4a24-bef6-78a426958c4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">creating a new outlook profile</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;and check if the shred mailbox show up?<br />
3. do any other users who have access to the shared mailbox have the same issue?</p>

<p>HI Steve,</p>
<p>Thanks for the update and screenshot. Moreover, I would like to confirm the following information below to better understand the problem.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;How did you converted the user mailbox to shared mailbox via using <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2015/02/06/single-click-mailbox-conversion.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Exchange Admin center </a>or the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-in/library/jj710164%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Set-Mailbox cmdlet</a>?<br />
•&nbsp;When you say “<em>User already has one shared folder working</em>”, do you mean that the issue specifically only happens with converted shared mailbox not the other shared mailbox?<br />
•&nbsp;Could you please try to check this issue via using another PC or different user who can access this converted shared mailbox via Outlook 2016 client to see whether the problem still occurs? (<em>It will help us to determine whether it is a specific user or
 client side issue</em>.)<br />
•&nbsp;Have you tried to troubleshoot this issue via PowerShell to disable automapping and then re-enable to check this issue?</p>
<p>To do this, follow these steps:<br />
Connect to Exchange Online by using remote PowerShell: <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Connect to Exchange Online Using Remote PowerShell</a><br />
Remove full access permissions for the user from the mailbox.<br />
o&nbsp;<strong>Remove-MailboxPermission -Identity &lt;Mailbox ID1&gt; -User &lt;Mailbox ID2&gt; -AccessRights FullAccess</strong><br />
Grant full access permissions back to the user for the mailbox.<br />
o&nbsp;<strong>Add-MailboxPermission -Identity &lt;Mailbox ID1&gt; -User &lt;Mailbox ID2&gt;-AccessRights FullAccess -AutoMapping:$True</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In this command, &lt;Mailbox ID 1&gt; represents the mailbox to which the user is granted permission and &lt;Mailbox ID 2&gt; is the mailbox of the user to whom you want to add full access permissions.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Could you please provide us with a screenshots about the detailed steps which you have tried to manually adding the shared mailbox for further analysis?</p>
<p>Your patience and cooperation are highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Shyamal</p>

    <title>Syncing Music - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Syncing Music</h2>
                    I want to sync music from my laptop to my mobile phone, and previous to the windows ten update, I would connect my phone to my laptop, go on windows media, and sync the music easily with no trouble. This is the first time I have tried to sync music from
 my laptop to my phone since the windows ten update, and it won't let me. I have tried everything, I've checked that sync is on in my account in settings, and I did some research online and it said to download zune which I did, but when I go on zune it tells
 me to connect a device even though my phone is connected. Someone help me please!

            <p>Thank you for your quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mobile device I am attempting to sync my music to (the same one previously used to sync music before the windows 10 update which worked perfectly), is the Samsung Galaxy Fame GT-S6810P, full name Samsung Galaxy Fame GT-S6810PWNBTU. And i'm not quite
 sure as to what you mean by the currently installed version of the Operating System, but if you mean on my PC, it's windows 10, and I'm trying to sync my music using Windows Media Player. I'm not sure of the version of this, but I'm assuming that it probably
 got updated with the windows 10 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, after posting my question, I continued to try and figure out why it wasn't working, and have come to realise that Windows Media Player cannot recognize that a device is connected, however when I go on computer, it does recognize my device and lists
 it. I don't know if this is helpful to you?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>You can't recall an email. Once it is has been sent it is out of your reach.</p>
