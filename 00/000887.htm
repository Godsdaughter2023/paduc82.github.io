<div>When I try to download a program from Windows Essentials such as Movie Maker or Photo Gallery or Internet Explorer 9.0 from the download center I get the following message.</div>

<div>I did have Internet Explorer 9.0 installed when the download problems first arose.</div>

<div>That is why I now have version 8.0 installed.</div>

<div>If I try to download version 9.0 to reinstall I get this message</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Answers forum!</p>
<p>This error normally means that the download timed out causing the server to close or reset the connection. If you are using a dialup connection or your broadband connection is
 being slowed for some reason it can cause this to happen.</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:
</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b>: Add the websites that are not being accessed to trusted sites on the internet explorer.</p>
<p>Security zones: adding or removing websites<br />

<p><b>Step 2</b>:
<span>I would suggest you to run the Internet Explorer in No Add-on mode. To run in No Add-on mode follow the steps below –</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using My Phone service.<br />
<br />
If you did a master reset, then just install MyPhone application again, insert your credentials, select the type of contents you want to sync and then hit sync.<br />
It will restore back to the&nbsp;phone anything you have on the cloud.<br />
<br />
<br />
After doing that please be aware that this is a synchronization service, so after the first synchronization (after installing the application) when you delete something on the&nbsp;phone it will deleted&nbsp;on web when you hit sync.
<br />
<br />
<br />
The service will restore anything you have in the cloud back to the Phone in these cases:<br />
&nbsp; You deleted the device in web portal<br />
&nbsp; You did a master reset and installed the application again<br />
&nbsp; You uninstalled and installed the application in the device<br />
&nbsp; You selected stop using service in the application and after some time you use it again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Be free to ask any questions and enjoy My Phone service<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />
Helder

    <title>compare two worksheets for adds and changes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robin ann  say:</h3>
<h2>            compare two worksheets for adds and changes</h2>
                    <p>I need to compare data between two worksheets to track for any additions or changes. Each week I will receive a new set of data that will need to be compared to the previous week. I envision creating a workbook that contains worksheets with the old and new
 data - for example, I'll name the worksheet containing the old data as "Control" and new data as "New Data". Each week, I'll move the data that's in the "New Data" worksheet over to "Control" and then repopulate the "New Data" worksheet with the latest data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new data will contain the same columns, but the data will change for some records. In addition, new records will appear as inserts between records as opposed to showing at the end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since new records won't appear at the end, I can't do an apples to apples comparison between worksheets. For example, this formula that I found won't work:
<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">=IF(Control!A2&lt;&gt;'New Data'!A2, "Control: "&amp;Control!A2&amp;" │ New Data: "&amp;'New Data'!A2, "")</span>. The other problem is that I get #REF errors with that formula every time I move data around as I described above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, my data doesn't have a unique key, but I can create one by concatenating two columns (i.e. column A will now contain a unique key, which is a concatenation of columns B &amp; C).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping there's a solution that isn't over complicated. I'm not averse to using Access if this is an easier option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Let's say that you have this formula to create your unique keys, in cell A2:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=B2&amp;C2</p>
<p>
</p><p>copied down to match your data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, in another column, use</p>
<p>
</p><p>=COUNTIF(A:A,A2)</p>
<p>
</p><p>copied down to match your data set.&nbsp; That COUNTIF will return&nbsp;the count of the cells in column&nbsp;A that match the value in A2 - it will always be at least 1, since A2 is in column A, but if it returns 2 (or more!) there are duplicated keys in column A.</p>

<p>Before data de-duplication, in the old section, 1 will indicate that the record has been removed and is no longer in the new data. In the new section, 1 will indicate that the record was added and never appeared in the old section.&nbsp; 2 in either section indicates
 just that the record appears in both, but does not indicate if it was changed or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After de-duping, 2 in either section will indicate a changed record - but 1 in the old can indicate either an unchanged record or one that was&nbsp; deleted from the new records.&nbsp; A 1 in the new section will indicate a new record.<br />

                    <p>I have been scanning documents into another software but I am trying to learn how to do more with Microsoft 2010.&nbsp; I think it may offer advantages that I think I would appreciate.&nbsp; However, when I tried to scan legal size documents the entire document did
 not come out in my blank document.&nbsp; My page orientation was set for legal but it didn't work.&nbsp; I really would like to do a lot more with micosoft 2010 since I am an executive secretary of a body of churches and I also do other things on the side.&nbsp; I would
 hate that one simple thing such as this would hinder me from utilizing something that I would feel could bring enhancement to so many areas in my life.&nbsp; Would you PLEASE help?</p>

            MS 2010 OCR is not very good, you should ideally be scanning the document as a picture, once that is done, you could use ocr tools available online to move over the text to word.<br />
Onenote is also as option, which you may look into.<br />

            Some thoughts that may help: Scanners produce picture files as a starting place. Thus while a picture of an automobile can be quite engaging, trying to drive it anywhere will leave you frustrated. Likewise, a picture of text is just that, a picture.<br />
<br />
Word does try to interpret that picture and turn it into text. This is called optical character recognition (OCR). There are other programs, probably one that came with your scanner, that are better at this than Word. None are perfect. If you are using scanned
 text, you need to proof-read.<br />
<br />
I am a lawyer. I use scanned text often. When I do, I scan into a pdf form that is searchable. This means that an OCR process has been applied to the text. Then I copy the scanned text into a Word document as plain text (without formatting) and apply formatting
 using Styles in Word.<br />
<br />
This gives me something that I can use for years without formatting problems. Just scanning directly into Word will give me a document that looks good, but is put together like a jigsaw puzzle. When I try to edit it, weird things happen.<br />

    <title>Refresh Data Connection on a protected worksheet&#47;book - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> devildancer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Refresh Data Connection on a protected worksheet&#47;book</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am.... mediocre... at Excel. I am trying to create and dummy proof a workbook for co-worker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have everything working well where all the user needs to do is open the workbook, which will auto refresh a data connection to an external data source and then all he needs to do is print a preformatted report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However.... once I protect the document... the data connection cannot bring in the updated data (because the sheet is protected).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any sneaky way you guys know where I can allow the data connection to perform and still make it impossible for the user to enter or change anything?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any and all help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>--Gerb</p>

    <title>Change defunct xboxlivefamily.com primary alias to my Outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Change defunct xboxlivefamily.com primary alias to my Outlook.com alias</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Just to give a little background, I had a Xbox Live Family Membership so both of my sons could have their own gamertags. When you created a child gamertag under the family membership, it would automatically generate an Live ID email address (ex: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***)
 that matched the generated gamertag. Fine, whatever, no harm, no foul until... Microsoft decided to do away with the Xbox Live Family Memberships.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Now all of those child gamertags were converted into their own full Microsoft accounts and the ID primary alias is locked in as the original email address created on the account. When you go into the manage alias section, it says "Your organization's policies
 prevent you from changing your primary alias."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
In searching for assistance, I found a thread from 2014 (linked below) but when I go to domains.live.com it appears that site is now defunct. How do I go about getting rid of this ridiculous email alias and getting my Outlook.com alias set as primary? Every
 one of my MS devices (W8 laptop, W8 tablet and Lumia phone) all show the primary alias. I've spent three months calling, emailing, tweeting Xbox and MS support and cannot get assistance. This shouldn't be this hard to fix considering this wasn't a custom domain
 that I controlled. Please help!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Why can&#39;t Windows phone do Copy&#47;Paste requests made by - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff a. davis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t Windows phone do Copy&#47;Paste requests made by Friends&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Facebook or Microsoft should probably fix their Windows phones. My Nokia Lumia 635 simply can't do what some of my friends want me to do to help them pass along a message. I'm very sure that these all come from big sources and those sources should realize
 that the whole world doesn't use iPhones or Androids which I'm sure can Copy status posted text.</p>

<p><span>I see this often where Friends say to do that in their postings and they all seem to have something to do with Mental Health or Veteran Suicide.<br />
So could somebody who is connected directly to either of those groups, tell them of this deal &amp; ask them to rewrite their posting that they've got that their members post?<br />
I'm not going to ask this over in the Facebook Community since this isn't really their problem. I don't use the Facebook APP since it has a few limits that I don't like. I access Facebook on my phone at facebook.com which it automatically decides should refer
 me to <strong>m.facebook.com </strong>even it I have it set in IE Setting to use the
<em><strong>desktop vers</strong></em>ion and not the <em><strong>mobile version</strong></em>. It knows and it doesn't obey my command. GRRRR</span></p>
<p><span>Here are 2 of my latest examples and as you can see, this first guy chose to ignore their Copy/Paste request and he just Shared it, or maybe he has a Windows phone
 too?:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5047f294-4668-4e9c-93d3-e458ce3e6bd7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5047f294-4668-4e9c-93d3-e458ce3e6bd7" /></a></p>
<p><span>This second one I had to go grab with my IE-11 on my Windows 10 computer and, of course, on that device I could have hilted the words to Copy them so that I could Paste
 them as my own Status. But quite often, I along with the rest of the world, use Facebook on our smartphones and some of us even prefer to us a Windows phone so that our life stays in sync automatically thru outlook.com.</span></p>

            My workaround has always been to just screenshot it and then post the picture. Obviously, if the original poster's intent is to stay anonymous, this works for them. I don't like for them to be offended by my Sharing it, even though that would be much simpler,
 because maybe they're somehow personally connected to someone who is feeling suicidal, or maybe they are themselves, so they don't want the world to know.<br />
But whatever, I just wish that someone could tell someone at Microsoft to fix both their Facebook APP for phones and also how their m.facebook.com site works on phones, as neither of them will let stuff be Copied to be Pasted.

            I was hoping that someone who monitors this board could pass this upstream to IT so that they could fix this for the next update. Surely they know of this shortcoming, as both iPhones and I think Androids can Copy stuff in Facebook postings and they'd
 surely like some of the marketing share that those have since us Windows phone fans are a tiny crowd.

            Printing is controlled by the Operating System and the Print Driver supplied by the manufacturer of your printer and not the Word application. If you have recently changed you OS version, for example to Mojave, then you need to check with the printer manufacturer
 and find out if there is a compatible Print Driver software.

    <title>Embedded pdf not opening in Adobe Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tsawyer64  say:</h3>
<h2>            Embedded pdf not opening in Adobe Pro</h2>
                    <p>I created a PowerPoint using Office 2013 on one desktop computer. I embedded several PDFs in the PowerPoint. When I click on the PDFs, they open in Adobe Pro. I saved the PowerPoint on the cloud.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened the PowerPoint on a second computer at another location. That computer also has Adobe Acrobat Pro, which is set as the default program. All PDFs I open on this system open in pro. I saved the PowerPoint to this computer. When I open the PowerPoint,
 and try to access the embedded PDFs, they open in Adobe Reader DC, Not Adobe Pro (the default on this computer).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have removed the embedded objects, saved them to my desktop, opened them, and they open in Pro. I then re-imbed them (Insert &gt; Object &gt; Create from File &gt; Browse...), tried to open them, and they open in Reader. This appears to be a setting within PowerPoint
 on this specific computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me find where to change the settings that tell PowerPoint how to open PDFs in Pro?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no option in PowerPoint which can select different versions of programs/applications to open. As a workaround you can uninstall Adobe DC and then repair Adobe Pro.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check if this step helps you to resolve the issue.

    <title>Office Home &#38; Student 2019 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidp01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Home &#38; Student 2019</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a <strong>Office Home &amp; Student 2019 </strong>license. I used the Office app in the Start menu and typed in the product key and I started using the included apps (Words, Excel, PowerPoint). Then I found out I can still install the Office
 programs while I was working on my MS account. So are these Office programs different form the Office apps in the Start menu?<br />
</p>
<p>I also need to sent my laptop to repair, from what I know, I need to deactivate my Office in case my data or programs are lost, but I don't see any
<strong>Deactivate</strong> button, only <strong>Install</strong> button. Does that mean I haven't activated my Office yet and the office apps I've been using are entirely account-bound?</p>

<p>The Office app in the start menu is most likely a free trial of Office 365. Your activation may or may not have worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start any Office application.</p>
<p>Go to File menu &gt;Account command.</p>
<p>Look under the Office logo on the right side of the pane.</p>
<p>What Office bundle does it say, and does it say "activated" or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it says Office 365 you will have to go to the Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features.</p>
<p>Look through the list of installed applications to find Office 365. </p>
<p>Right click on it</p>
<p>Select change</p>
<p>Select Uninstall.</p>

            Hi David
<br />
<br />It sounds like you have paid for Office and you hvae not really used the full applications yet . . 
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in.
<br />
<br />Under your Account find that Office installation and from there you can deactivate that PC, while it is in for repair .. .
<br />
<br />Then when you get that back, to make sure you are using the full Office products you have paid for
<br />
<br />Use this tool from Microsoft to remove all remnants of any previous Office Installation:

<p>Hello Rohn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>yes, in the Office app, it does say “activated” and I noticed that there is a “deactivate” button somewhere but i can’t find it. I tried logging in my Microsoft account page, in the “Services &amp; subcriptions” tab. I found my purchase “Office Home &amp; Student
 2019”.</p>
<p>It says: “Install on PC or Mac. Added to your account on [Insert date]”</p>
<p>but there are only two options for me to click: “Install” or “View product key”. I don’t see any “Deactivate” button.</p>

<p>So that is the actual installation of the Office programs?</p>
<p>my laptop is about to get repaired or possibly replaced by another one, so is it wise to log out of the laptop for now, not installing the programs, then wait for the laptop to get repaired/replaced and then log in and download and install the programs for
 good?</p>

<p>I’m starting to think that I don’t need to find the “deactivate” button. From what I’v read, “deactivate” is for Office 365 relocation.</p>
<p>In my case, it’s a permanent license, so I just need to uninstall my Office programs from the computer. And since I haven’t installed them, I just need to check to remove any remaining of the Office and I’m good.</p>

            Many users have been having trouble with OneNote in last day or so. Microsoft  may be having technical trouble with it. I’d suggest waiting a bit and then try to see if it works or if there are any updates.

            This seems to happen a lot with OneNote 16.10 for MacOS. Microsoft is aware of this problem (according to a OneNote engineer especially in conjunction with MacOS El Capitan 10.11.6) and looking into it.
<br />I personally am on OneNote 16.12 (insider fast) and do not experience any crashes. So maybe either rolling back the installation or switching to an insider update program and upgrade to the most recent version could fix it)

    <title>Office Starter Edition 2010 Keeps opening documents as Read Only - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john felstead  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Starter Edition 2010 Keeps opening documents as Read Only</h2>
                    <p>I am having a problem with a relatives installation of Office 2010 Starter Edition that came with her Windows 7 computer. It has suddenly started to open word documents as Read Only and despite what I have tried it still reverts to Read Only files.</p>
<p>Background Info</p>
<p>PC: Asus Touchescreen AIO</p>
<p>OS: Windows 7 Home 64 Bit</p>
<p>Office Version: Office 2010 Starter Edition with SP2 installed</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the following:-</p>
<p>1) In Trust Centre turn off All settings relating to <strong><em>Protected View</em></strong></p>
<p>2) Checked all files involved did not have read only attributes</p>
<p>3) Checked that permissions on users <em><strong>Documents</strong></em>&nbsp;library folder were set to Read/Write and not Read Only</p>
<p>3) Ran sfc /scannow from command prompt but no problems were found</p>
<p>4) Scanned the PC for viruses with both active antivirus and Malwarebytes and Hitmanpro utilities which all returned clean results apart from a few PUPs</p>
<p>5) Uninstalled Office starter and Click to Run and reinstalled sameOn re-installation the same behaviour occurs. I have scoured the internet and this appears to be a know problem but all the fixes appear to relate to removing Protected
 View setting in Trust Centre or turning off preview in Windows explorer both of which I have tried or do not apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a registry setting that holds information about protected view that might not be altered by the Word GUI?</p>
<p>Any tips or advice would be greatly received</p>
<p>regards</p>
<p>John</p>

<p>Thank Stefan. I am aware that Starter Edition is a cut down version of Office. However I have successfully repaired the application on other installations in the past without having to resort to a factory restore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes I have had to manually remove Click To Run as it would not uninstall through Control panel. However I have normally resolved most problems by uninstalling and reinstalling. In this instance due to time constraints I did not clean the registry of
 keys relating to Office Starter prior to re-installing. Something which I normally do to ensure a clean install. However I am interested to know if there is a specific registry key that works with Protected View which might not be changing when you toggle
 settings in the application.</p>

<p>Since you have repaired or&nbsp;reinstalled&nbsp;Office Starter&nbsp;successfully in the past there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to do it again, of course. I'm just saying that if those fixes fail, there isn't much that you can do.</p>

    <title>N73 freezing after Battery dead - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            N73 freezing after Battery dead</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I have a problem with my Nokia N73.<br />
<br />
My battery completely ran down, and the screen was completely black, nothing unusual there, so I put it on to charge. After a couple of hours, I took the charger out, and attempted to switch it on. Half the screen lit up, the other half was black, with a pixelated
 border between the two. The screen then lit up white, and then went to the Nokia page (Lit white with Blue Nokia text), and it looked like it was going to load as normal. But it froze on this screen, and has not moved. I tried switching off and removing the
 battery, and recharging, but no luck. It always just hangs on the Nokia screen.<br />
<br />
Any advice?<br />
<br />
Richard.

            The system might be accessing some important data when your battery ran out, I guess. You could perform an hard reset to see if it will be ok.<br />
<br />
Seems to hard reset your phone you have to hold * key,3 key and the red key. I'm not sure, may be *+3+red, or *+3+green, or *+3+multimedia. You can try each. Hold them and turn the power on, DO NOT release them until you see the standby screen.

            Hard reset should be:<br />
<br />
press the "power up" button, together with "call", "3" and "*" (all four pressed at the same time).<br />
Yes, it takes some thought and at least two hands.<br />
<br />
Keep all buttons pressed until you see the Nokia startup screen.<br />
<br />
You will lose data.

<p>Hi Anna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That didn't work for me. What I'm trying to put into the body of an email is a URL that is initially dragged from the header bar of a web page onto the desktop (when this is done the file ends up with '.webloc' at its end). When&nbsp;clicked it opens&nbsp;the web
 page. I used to be able to just drag these into my emails but now, while it looks like it's dragging, it doesn't pop into the email. JPEGs and TextEdit files can be dragged in, just not these '.webloc' files. I did try dragging the file onto the Inbox in the
 list&nbsp;on the left side of my Outlook window, and also the Inbox to it's right but nothing at all happened.<br />

<p>Hi 8888user8888,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is Barry. I read this thread and know that you are unable to attach a .webloc attachment in a new email in Outlook for Mac client. If I misunderstand your situation, please feel free to contact me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to help you solve this problem, we’d like to collect the following information:</p>
<p>1. The detailed version of your Outlook for Mac client.</p>
<p>2. Does this problem occur on all .webloc attachments with different links?</p>
<p>3. Can you open the webpage when you directly open the .webloc file on the desktop?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we recommend that you keep the Outlook for Mac client up-to-date and use the Attach file in the Outlook for Mac client to attach the .webloc file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Barry</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi 8888user8888,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the detailed version of the Outlook for Mac client, please navigate to Outlook &gt; About Outlook. It looks like 15.37 170815.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For now, we recommend that you use the Attach file button to attach the .webloc files. Meanwhile, about the “draft not sent” problem, please open a new thread in our forum and our engineers will continue to help you.</p>

<h2>            What happened to the Start-up Sound in the latest build &#40;10130&#41; of Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My computer is an Elitebook 8570p - HP.&nbsp; I've been able to successfully run Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 with all functions working properly.&nbsp; I've had Windows 10 Preview for quite a while and have been receiving/installing the updates in the "Fast" pace as I have
 time.&nbsp; I am greatly disappointed that Microsoft has removed the Start-up sound in Windows 10.&nbsp; (I checked "Play Windows Start Up Sound on the Sound Control Panel). &nbsp;I realize that Microsoft removed the shutdown sounds in Windows 8/8.1 --&gt; that didn't bother
 me too much.&nbsp; Now, the start-up and shutdown sounds are both missing in Windows 10 Preview.&nbsp; My sound drivers all up-to-date and sounds do work.&nbsp; It would be appreciated very much if someone from Microsoft would reply to this question and tell us/explain what
 is really going on here -- is the Windows Start Up sound going to work in Windows 10?&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

    <title>Account is being created falsely by someone else. I need to recover - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ayushibhagat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Account is being created falsely by someone else. I need to recover it. PLEASE HELP.</h2>
                    Dear Support Team,<br />
<br />
I am a Microsoft user since May 2013. I created my fisrt email ID then by myself. Since then, I had no issues with Microsoft or any of its products.<br />
<br />
Around Januray 2018, I got to know that someone else has made my email ID (By my name) on Outlook.com without my knowledge. How this happened? The issue is as follows -<br />
<br />
I was associated with a company who had my personal details. They created an outlook account to help get access to their services instead of using my own existing account. I do not know why they did this. Now, I am no longer associated with their company. I
 got to know later that they created this ID without my information which is illegal. I tried recovering its password but they had used their contact information in the account recovery settings. Hence, I cannot proceed. Since it is on my name (Full Name) and
 the account verification number is set as his, I can't recover my password that ways since I am not associated with the company anymore. I tried seeking help from Microsoft.<br />
<br />
I had put enormous account recovery requests multiple times which were rejected each time and closed without actually helping me. They ask me to fill stupid information on the form like tell me the last time you sent email, the subject you used when I do not
 know since I have never created the ID myself. How can I provide such information when I have not operated the account myself?<br />
<br />
I tried your website "Support.microsoft.com" which proved useless since in the hacked account section, I can't possibly do any of the options since I have not operated the account.<br />
<br />
I tried calling the customer service number but it said that we have high call volume. Please increase your efficiency in answering people.<br />
<br />
I tried contacting you through your virtual agent whom I belive is just programmed text. I wanted to talk to an agent on the other side which never happened. Numerous times it said I am connecting to you, but then never went ahead after that.<br />
<br />
Somehow, just for once it got connected when "Kristine A" answered. I told him my problem, he told me a few steps I filled the form as directed by him or her. The form unfortunately had the same questions as the account recovery form. I tried my level best
 to answer them but I failed since I told them I have never used the account myself. I got a reply saying "I am an unauthorised user to proceed with the request. They too closed my case. He or She gave me a chat ID to reconnect anytime but that is not opening.<br />
<br />
I even tweeted multiple times to Microsoft and Office Support. Again, they didn't get what I meant.<br />
<br />
Now, if you consider me an unauthorised person to access my own account (Created by someone else without my knowledge), then I think you are really not doing right. I am ready to provide all sorts of ID verifications. Also, I have a few logical points to defend
 myself -<br />
<br />
If I am a hacker (If you presume so), then I won't be asking you for the password. I would have simply done it.<br />
<br />
I need it urgently because that ID has been used in other services. As soon as, I will be dont with those services I will get this account closed. Also, I would not have asked you guys to do so. I would have done it myself.<br />
<br />
This is sheer crime that someone else has done this on my behalf. However, I thought I would get suitable help from you guys so that I can take legal action against that person, but you guys have failed to provide me my account details.<br />
<br />
If he or she is missusing it, the name is mine. I will be caught. and you being microsoft people, I guess won't even help. Hence, you are just putting my life and work at risk. This is giving me sleepless nights. Being a student, I must say I am really fed
 up filling account recovery forms daily.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I HOPE IF I HAVE A SUITABLE AGENT SITTING ON THE OTHER SIDE HE OR SHE WILL REPLY.<br />
Now, tell me what should I do?

            Hi
<br />
<br />I understand your frustration, as I would certainly be if it happened to me. However, from a service provider point of view, the account belongs to a person that had created it. So they are not going to give you access to an account that was opened by someone else, just because it has your name on it. 
<br />
<br />If someone is actively impersonating you, it's a matter for your local enforcement to deal with. 
<br />
<br />Microsoft (or any other provider) will not close someone's account just because another person is saying it's their real name.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>So, if the account belongs to the person who has created it (Even without my knowledge) and that account is his as you claim. Then I must say, it was no use for me to waste my energy and type so much. I thought atleast you will help me recover it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I wont tolerate the way you projecting me saying that you won't give the details saying that it's my real name. Well, it is my name and I am not fake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel sorry that you people do not appreciate honesty and believe on your company policies even if they are supporting something that is not true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have lost faith and a genuine customer today. I had some trust on your services which I lost today. You have really caused me a huge amount of loss.</p>

            Please remember this is a community support website and we are not Microsoft's employees. We cannot recover or delete someone's email account. I'm sorry that we cannot help you any further, but this is a matter for the police for impersonating you if that is the case. 
<br />
<br />Sorry if you misunderstood me, but someone having an email account with the name exactly like yours isn't a crime or a reason to delete, unless you can prove they're doing it deliberately. There can't just be a blanket ban on your name because someone else will surely have the same name as you.
<br />
<br />We're just trying to help and give you the reason why Microsoft can't delete someone's email on anyone's request.
