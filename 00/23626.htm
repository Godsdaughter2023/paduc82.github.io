                    <p>I have been using Skype numbers earlier, very successfully. Now I took a new Skype number and when someone dials it, I do not hear any ringing tone. How can I then know there is a call coming through ? Skype to Skype calls come through fast and clearly,
 my Skype number does not seem to know me.&nbsp; I have a worldwide subscription for both landlines and</p>
<p>mobile phones. &nbsp; I use Skype only in my Samsung Galaxy J 5 mobile. The app has been terminated and reinstalled several times, 6 different men with IT background consulted and Skype support chat, - no help.&nbsp; What shall I do ?????</p>

<h2>            Template was created in French dictionary, need to change it to English</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I found a PowerPoint template on Microsoft.com that I decided to use.&nbsp; It must have been created by someone using the French version (or the defaulted dictionary as French) as all the English words are showing up as misspelled in my PowerPoint (using English
 as the defaulted dictionary).&nbsp; I have found under the Proofing tab in the PowerPoint options window, where it lists "French modes".&nbsp; It does not allow me to change this.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to do this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your assistance,</p>

<h3> david98465198  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why are my PowerPoint 2007 animations appearing in the wrong order&#63;</h2>
                    I made a slide with Custom Animation that includes a long list of elements that appear. Some of them are set to "Start After Previous" with a set time interval, and the rest are set to "Start With Previous". "Previous" means the item immediately above
 this item in the list, right? However, when I play the show, some of the "Start With Previous" elements appear
<b>before</b> the previous item in the list. This appears to be a defect in PowerPoint.<br />
<br />
I've also noticed that the Timing dialog box lets me enter times such as 0.5 seconds or 0.1 seconds, but all of the appearances occur after whole numbers of seconds.<br />

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand the custom animation that you have set in PowerPoint presentation are not working correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have set an animation to <span style="font-weight: bold"><font>start with previous,</font></span> it will start the animation along with the previous animation according to the order displayed in the animation pane. To check the order in which the
 animation is set open the animation task pane and check the order. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the order is set correctly but till the animation does not work then remove the animation and re-add it and check. Right click on animation in the animation pane and click on Remove to remove the animation. Now, re-add the animation and set it to proper
 order in the animation pane and check if it works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue is not resolved then create a new presentation and check if it works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists then upload a sample file on the SkyDrive and provide us the SkyDrive link to help us work on the file and assist you further. Refer the link which explains how to upload the data onto SkyDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</font></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Note</font></span>: Make sure that there is no confidential data in the document before uploading the document on the SkyDrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the above suggestions help. Let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>That is not a very helpful answer. &nbsp;It boils down to "do the work over again and hope for the best". &nbsp;One step above "turn machine off, turn machine on." &nbsp;I know you're doing your best, but PLEASE! &nbsp;I've got hundreds of animation events that need to appear
 in the correct order, and now I have to redo the work and it may or may not solve the problem?</p>

            <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you set something to Start With Previous, it will be set to start with it at the point in time you set it. If you then move the preceding item (e.g. add a .5 second delay) the second animation will not move to the new start time. That is, it will use
 the original start time of the predecessor for it's start time. If you re-apply Start with Previous, it will move to the new start time. OK, this is kind of hard to make clear in words :-) Let's repro!</p>
<ol>
<li>Put 2 things on a slide (thing 1 and thing 2)</li><li>Give them both an animation and set both to start with previous</li><li>Add delay to thing 1</li><li>thing 2's start time&nbsp;will not move, it will start before thing 1</li><li>Re-apply Start with Previous to thing 2</li><li>thing 2 now starts with thing 1</li></ol>
<p>One of the easiest ways to see how the animations fit together is to use the Animation Pane. I'm sorry I can't remember if that opens automatically in PPT 2007 or not (I'm on 2013) but it should be on the Animation tab somewhere...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps,</p>
<p>Lucy</p>

    <title>Outlook.com not sending email to every member of a group - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnmw&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com not sending email to every member of a group</h2>
                    I help run a large golf society and we have a society email account using outlook.com (also mapped to an email address from the society domain).<br />
<br />
We have a group list of around 300 members that was working fine in hotmaIl but does not send to every member of the group now I am using outlook.com.<br />
<br />
I get an error message such as:<br />
<br />
"Please use the following format for email addresses: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. If you're using category names or nicknames, make sure you don't have any typos. Unknown names: Neville"<br />
<br />
For this reason I created a completely new group in outlook.com to try to overcome the issue.<br />
<br />
This new group still displays the same type of error message for one or a number of members of the group. If you remove one member of the group temporarily to try to send an email as they are causing the error it just displays another name at fault. Eventually
 after removing 5-6 names from the list as a test an email was sent. However it was not received by all members in the group.<br />
<br />
So at present we are unable to email the members of the society as it looks like our people/groups records are corrupted in some way.<br />
<br />
Please can anyone help?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John<br />

            Thanks for you response.<br />
<br />
I tried expanding the group on another email and the problem is still there.<br />
<br />
There are only two people named Neville in my contacts list and I have successfully sent emails to both of them individually.<br />
<br />
I will send you a private message now.<br />

            <p>It sounds like your problem is caused by the number of contacts in a group.</p>
<p>There have been several posts were people with large groups are getting error messages.</p>
<p>Try sending to 10, 25, 50, 100 contacts.</p>
<p>When do the error messages start?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even with a good reputation and history of sending emails to a large number of contacts, an email can only be sent to 100 contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When an email contains too many contacts, you will never get an error message saying that there are too many contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you do get your groups small enough, there is also a limit of emails per day.&nbsp; The limit is 300.</p>
<p>An email with 50 contacts counts as sending 50 emails.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
OK. I did not know about these limits and did not have any problems when we were using Hotmail.
<br />
<br />
I will look to break the group down into a number of smaller groups. Then send out some test messages to see whether this resolves the issue.<br />
<br />
I have a lot of other stuff going on at the moment. So it may be a few days before I am able to allocate some more time to trying to resolve this issue.<br />

            I have now split the group up into 3 separate groups each with less than 100 contacts in them. With a total of 204 contacts spread between the 3 groups split by alphabetic order of surname.<br />
<br />
I have successfully sent out emails to all 3 groups today without receiving any error messages when trying to send.
<br />
<br />
I have requested that all members respond to confirm receipt of the email. So far, in less than 2 hours, I have received 27 responses from members.
<br />
<br />
So it is looking reasonably positive that splitting the group may resolve the problem. However if will probably take a few days or more until we have a reasonable degree of certainty. I will post again in a few days time.<br />
<br />
Many thanks for your help so far with this matter.<br />

<h2>            Everytime I turn on Outlook, it kills my internet connection and I have to reboot the router</h2>
                    <p>As the title says, each time I turn on Outlook with Office 365, it kills my internet connection and I have to reboot the router. I can still login to the router admin and do a soft reboot. This kills the internet for all the computers on my network as well.&nbsp;
 The weird exception to this is when I'm connected to my work VPN, then everything is fine.&nbsp; Also, should be noted, it never did this at first...then started doing it randomly and stopped after a while...now a few months later, it started doing it agian.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some sort of weird port forwarding I should be using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running through an Exchange server.</p>
<p>Windows 7 Pro</p>
<p>Router is a D-Link 857 - HD Media Router 3000..running latest firmware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything is setup standard. No firewalls except the standard Windows firewall and the router is a really basic config.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please any insight would be great!</p>

<h2>            I cannot connect to Twitter through apps when using WiFi only, why&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I recently got my HTC HD7 phone (2 days ago) that I won in a giveaway. It doesn't have a SIM card so I'm using the WiFi connection I have in my house.</p>
<p>I have tried to use many different apps such as: the official Twitter app, Seesmic, Twitpic, et al. None, however, let me connect to Twitter and an error message returns saying my username and password may be incorrect even though I have made sure they are
 correct and they are.</p>
<p>I had previously posted this problem in other forum and someone over there made valid point; maybe the Twitter apps are trying to use cellular data but because I lack a SIM card I'm getting this error.</p>
<p>I can, however, access and log in to Twitter throght its mobile site. I would like to know why exactly this is happening to and whether you guys have experienced this same problem when you try to log in to any app but it returns saying your username and
 password may be incorrect but you know the're not.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance and I look forward to reading your feedback.</p>

<p>In order to connect to Twitter you need to authenticate with your username and password. This is handled via&nbsp;your cellular data connection and wont happen via WiFi. Once you have authenticated you can use Twitter via WiFi with no problem. But since you dont
 have a cellular data connection you cant authenticate.</p>
<p>Worst case scenario you could go pick up a sim card and load it with&nbsp;a couple dollars of prepaid data and then connect for a few minutes to authenticate.</p>

<h2>            Data Validation</h2>
                    <p>Hi, there is this excel file which we are working on as a team. Why is it that for the input message under data validation, some members of the team can see the full message, yet some only see part of it and we didn't know how can we adjust the settings
 so the whole message can be seen. See picture below. Does anyone know how can we resolve this issue? Thank you!</p>

            <p>When I opened your .xlsx file, I could display both the messages completely. </p>
<p>I did not face any problem of message being cut.</p>
<p>Hence, I could not replicate the problem which you have mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As regards the 'input message' of a data validation is concerned, we the users, have no option available</p>
<p>to set/re-size this message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A final guess which I can make as of now is the possibility of the display resolution on your user's computers may be different - and perhaps that could be the possible reason. Have a look at it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, pls have a look at the following url. - see if this helps. </p>

<p>In the mean while, can you share screen-shots of both scenarios - where full message is displayed and the other where full message is not displayed. If there are variations then try to share more screen-shots.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Universal Foldable Keyboard- iPad Mini 4 caps issues</h2>
                    I recently purchased the Microsoft Universal Foldable Keyboard to use with my iPad Mini 4. When I first used it with Word on my iPad everything kept typing in caps lock, even when the caps wasn't pressed. I tried it out on other apps and other people's
 ios systems and this issue didn't constantly happen but tends to happen right after it has been reconnected. The keyboard has been updated and so is my iPad so i'm not sure if this is a hardware or software issue.

    <title>Unable to Open or Reset Internet Explorer, or Download Latest Version - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tindawg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to Open or Reset Internet Explorer, or Download Latest Version</h2>
                    <p><b>Problem</b> - I’m running Windows 7 and when I try to open Internet Explorer, I receive the following pop-up message: “Internet Explorer has stopped working – A problem caused the program to stop working correctly.&nbsp; Windows will close
 the program and notify you if a solution is available.”&nbsp; Nothing happens afterwards – the pop up message will remain on the screen until I close it and I am unable to use IE.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Background</b> - A couple of days before this occurred, every time I opened IE, it would begin opening a new window every minute or so that had what appeared to be some random address – something like
<a href="http://www.rwgcntl.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.rwgcntl.com</a> (this is not the actual address of one that attempted to open, it is just an example of what it might look like) – and it would search for that address, then display a message something to the effect that
 it could not find this page and I could instead attempt to open it by pasting the address into my browser.&nbsp; I did that several times but would then receive a message saying something like this page could not be displayed. The same random looking address would
 come up each time, over and over until I did a restart of my computer; then, it would begin looking for a new random looking address.&nbsp; I figured this to be a virus, but nothing showed up when I ran a full scan with my McAfee (subscription) virus protection
 software.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>What I’ve tried</b> – I attempted to restore my computer/system to a previous date.&nbsp; When that didn’t help, I restored it back to the current date.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>I attempted to restore IE to a previous version and received the message that “Some program or system files were skipped because they cannot be restored to the original location.&nbsp; To restore these files, try restoring the files again
 and select a different location”, then a View Log File. &nbsp;I didn't know what this meant and did not act further on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I attempted to reset IE using Microsoft Fix it 50195, but every time I ran the program, it would freeze up early in the process with the message “Please Wait”.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Since I am unable to open IE, I don’t know how to tell which version I actually have.&nbsp; But, I tried to download the latest version 10 from the Microsoft website and received the message that “Internet Explorer did not finish installing
 – Setup can’t continue because a more recent version of Internet Explorer is installed on your computer.”</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Everything else on my computer appears to be working fine – and I am able to run Google Chrome.&nbsp;&nbsp;I opened GC, went to Google and searched “which version of IE do I have” and the first result that came up was a windows Microsoft site.&nbsp;
 When I clicked on it, the page that opened had the following message:</p>
<span><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">“Which version of Internet Explorer am I using?</span></span>
<span><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">“Which version of Internet Explorer am I using?</span></span>
<p>
<span><span style="color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 1)"><span><b><span>Internet
<span><span style="color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 1)"><span><b><span>Internet
 Explorer 10</span></b></span></span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 1)">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<div>
<hr />
</div>

<span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">You're using<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Internet&nbsp;Explorer</span>&nbsp;10 for<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Windows&nbsp;8</span><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Windows&nbsp;RT”</span></span>
<p>So, is it possible that my computer auto updated to the latest version of IE, but mistakenly did so for the wrong version of Windows (since I’m running Windows 7) - or my computer tried to download Windows 8?&nbsp; What should I do next? &nbsp;I
 appreciate any help anyone can offer. &nbsp;I have limited knowledge when it comes to computers.</p>

<p><font><font color="#000000">This will open the Internet Explorer with all the Add-on disabled. So now, try to access the web pages that caused the Internet Explorer to crash. If you are
 able to access those web pages without any issues, then you may check which browser add-on has caused this issue by referring to the article: “<b><i>Manage add-ons in Internet Explorer</i></b>” from this link:</font></font></p>

            Go in any profile which u want to keep active..go in personalize ..in that there is an option called warning tones..if its 'off' then the camera shutter will be mute for that particular profile.

I'm sure you're aware that many people would love to get rid of the shutter sound. So when you find out what caused your phone to lose the shutter sound, please post it here so others can remove the shutter sound from their phones as well.

            I've done some research about your issue and it seems that only a hard reset will solve your problem. Make sure you do a backup as a hard reset will erase your data. You can download PIM Backup from www.dotfred.net to backup your contacts, calendar and
 Tasks. You won't need it if you already sync with Outlook. Keep me posted.

<p>Hi Laura,</p>
<p>To troubleshoot this issue, could you let us know the following information?<br />
1. Did you download the Word app from Office portal?<br />
2. Does this issue only occur to Word app? Have you tried opening Excel to see if it works fine?<br />
3. Regarding the “I don’t have permission to connect” error, could you let us know if this issue occurred when you tried to save the file to a SharePoint site or OneDrive for Business site? If it’s convenient, please send us related screenshots if the error
 page for investigation. To upload screenshots, you can click <strong>Use rich formatting</strong> and then click the icon of
<strong>Insert/Edit Media.</strong><br />
4. As you have mentioned you’re unable to sign into the pop up box with your Office 365 account when creating a new file, would you mind providing us with related error page for our analysis?</p>
<p>Please let us know any updates when you’re free, we’ll help you further.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Kerwin</p>

    <title>Office 365 Email Essentials &#40;Business Essentials&#47;Small - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Email Essentials &#40;Business Essentials&#47;Small Business&#41; from GoDaddy vs. Office 365 Small Business from Microsoft</h2>
                    
<p>I currently have&nbsp;an Office 365 Email Essentials/Business Essentials/Small Business&nbsp;account from GoDaddy (they have changed the name so many times, but my understanding is that all of these are equivalent products), but I am noticing some very serious administration
 issues in SharePoint Online. These issues include menus that are illustrated in support.office365, but do not appear at all in my godaddy version, missing site deletion icons/abilities, and service settings pages that do not load so I can't navigate from one
 to the next, etc. Does anyone else have (or had) this problem?</p>
<p>I have been told there is no difference in the godaddy product vs the Microsoft version, yet I am finding that hard to believe as I continue to encounter strange things when trying to set up my first SharePoint tenant. How can I trust a product to build
 my businesses file management system on when no one can give me a straight answer about the differences in capabilities and operation of the SharePoint site? Can anyone give me any insight into these issues?
</p>
<p>If you have experienced this problem, what was your solution?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jeff Null</p>

<p>Hi Jeff,</p>
<p>I’d like to first clarify the difference between three subscriptions you mentioned.<br />
1. Over all Office 365 business subscriptions, we don’t have <strong>Office 365 Email Essentials&nbsp;</strong>via our channel. It looks like this is a subscription from GoDaddy. Based on my research, it may include Exchange Online service. For details of this subscription,
 I suggest you find GoDaddy support.</p>
<p>2. For <strong>Office 365 Business Essentials</strong>, we have this subscription and the subscription includes Office Online, SharePoint Online, Exchange Online and Skype for Business Online service. For more details, you can find it via
<a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/business/office-365-business-essentials." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
products.office.com/.../office-365-business-essentials.</a></p>
<p>3. For <strong>Office 365 Small Business</strong>, we do have this subscription and is renamed as Office 365 Business Essentials with additions and improvements via our official channel. In SharePoint aspect, Office 365 Small Business does not have SharePoint
 Admin Center, which is used to centrally manage SharePoint Online, compared with Office 365 Business Essential.</p>
<p>For “missing site deletion icons/abilities” issue, if you are looking for deleting subsite created by your own, you can delete it via navigate to the site &gt; the gear icon &gt; site settings &gt; delete this site. If you are looking for deleting the three default
 site collection created by the system, it is not feasible to do that within Office 365 Small Business subscription.</p>
<p>For “service settings pages” and other issues, we need more detailed information about what service or settings you want for managing your SharePoint Online. You may capture a screenshot to help us understanding your requirement. You can upload screenshots
 by clicking <strong>Use rich formatting</strong> &gt; the first <strong>Insert/Edit Media</strong> icon.</p>

<p>Hi Jeff,</p>
<p>From the screenshots, it shows that the user interface has been customized by GoDaddy. Thus, I suggest you&nbsp;reach out&nbsp;to GoDaddy support for the issue. Thanks for your cooperation.</p>

<p>Hi Amir,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to ask for more information so I could provide a proper resolution to your concern. Kindly answer the questions below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Since when have you been experiencing this issue? Were there any changes made on your settings prior to this?</span></li><li><span>Does the issue only occur on a certain PowerPoint file?</span></li><li><span>Can you tell us the&nbsp;</span><span>version and build of Office that you're currently using? To get this, refer to this article:&nbsp;</span><span><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/about-office-what-version-of-office-am-i-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">About
 Office: What version of Office am I using?</a></span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I suggest l<span>ooking for similar behavior in other presentations so we can isolate if the issue is with the file itself, PowerPoint, or with the&nbsp;</span><span>Office suite.&nbsp;</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It’s a good idea to make sure your computer has the latest updates installed for Windows. Updates often fix problems that occur with software. For initial troubleshooting</span><span>, try installing updates, restarting your computer, and then launching

            Sounds similar to my issue. I shot a video on my wp8, shared it to my family room and others could view it but I couldn't from the room. Like I said, I shot it on my phone and it views properly in my camera roll. I even posted it to skydrive for non-family
 room members to view and no problem with that either. Just the version of the video in my family room wouldn't play. So this morning, I powered off the phone, powered back up, and bing-o. it plays. Sounds like a bug to me.

            <p>Hi Alf,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds like a rogue infection - it would have helped to know what the message said (word-for-word) and anything you know concerning the infection (like a name), but lacking that we will need to treat it generically.&nbsp; Absolutely do not touch that message
 or click on anything in it or even close it (use Task Manager to end the task for that instance of IE).&nbsp; Does it occur if you try to boot into Safe Mode with Networking?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following additional information and potential approaches are comliments of Rob Koch:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>"These ransomeware families are most commonly related to the Blackhole Exploit kit, though other infections are often involved as the TechNet discussion and ESET links below indicate.<br />
&nbsp; <br />

<a href="http://blog.eset.com/2011/12/04/carberp-blackhole-growing-fraud-incidents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.eset.com/2011/12/04/carberp-blackhole-growing-fraud-incidents</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
It also appears that Java exploits are an early part of the infection path in most of these."</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>That being the case, if Java may be involved, the first step would be to make sure you have removed/uninstalled all prior Java versions on the computer and then download and install the most recent one applicable to you from
<a href="http://www.java.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.java.com</a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above is true, the underlying infection could be a great many different or combined infections. This makes it harder to combat, but the process essentially remains more or less the same until we can identify the specific infection(s) and then we may
 be able to find some special removal procedures (but you need to tell us if anything specific&nbsp;is identified as you go through the process).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full ESET online scan: <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>. Give the unknown nature of this one, I'd also try Microsoft Safety Scanner:<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a>
 and TDSSKiller: <a href="http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/solutions?qid=208280684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/solutions?qid=208280684</a>. This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected or the
 problem goes away, you shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first or just skip over all of this and get the expert help you really need as described below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you can ignore
 the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</p>

<h3> planomike  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Error 0x8004210A - Can&#39;t Receive EMail</h2>
                    <p>There are hundreds of people posting this problem but I think my situation is different.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday morning Outlook was sending and receiving email with no problems. It has done that for the past 3 years, though occasionally I did get the error code but on retrying the problem went away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday though, about two hours after I booted up, email retrieval stopped. I kept getting the error message all day. I restarted multiple time, checked all the ports, etc, but the problem kept up. I can send emails, but could not receive. I was able to
 see my incoming mail only by going to my ISP's web site and looking at it there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shut down for the night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I booted and started Outlook. To my surprise I found all of yesterdays emails were now in my inbox. I was overjoyed, but only briefly. I sent an email with no problem. But then I noticed that Outlook was now going out to retrieve incoming emails
 and it was showing the progress bar, but nothing was happening. Then I got the error message again, and I have kept getting it for the past 3 hours. I have restarted Outlook three times and still have the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened that on an overnight shutdown and boot I was able to receive emails, but not after? Obviously my system is configured correctly. Right Ports, SSL's, etc., AND Norton was running before anything else was started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem has existed since 2003 on all versions of Outlook and yet there is no fix from Microsoft. Who do we have to contact there to get this fixed once and for all?&nbsp; None of the answers I have seen on multiple boards have gotten anywhere near to solving
 the problem.</p>

            <p>I am on Outlook 2013, Office Home &amp; Business 2013. I am on Version 15.0.4875.1001 of Office Updates. Windows 7, 6.1.7601 SP1 Build 7601.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my laptop, running Win 10 2016 and Outlook 2016. I am having NO problems accessing my ISP and retrieving emails on the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An associate of mine, running the same system, same settings, same OS as me is having no problems.</p>
<p>
I have powered down and restarted three time this morning and each time Outlook retrieves all the emails that hadn't yet been retrieved. So on 1st shutdown and reboot it retrieved emails from 2 days ago, yesterday and this morning. On the 2nd shutdown and reboot
 it retrieved emails that arrived since the last shutdown. And on the last shutdown and restart, prior to which I sent emails to various email addresses from my wife's email account, it retrieved all of those. But each time, after it retrieved those emails
 immediately after the reboot and restart it does not retrieve any more emails that may arrive at my POP server and just gives me the error message.</p>

            <p>Just a followup. The retrieval on Power up restart continues. Outlook will only retrieve emails after a total power down and restart of the Outlook application. Once it does that retrieval it refuses to retrieve any more until a power down and restart. I
 shut down each night and restart the next morning, and that is when I get yesterday's emails.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any progress on this?</p>

            <p>Jessica,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read all the suggestions in the first link, which I have also done a few days ago, most of which do not apply to this problem. I also repaired Outlook 20013 by running my Office CD and installing again. Which, by the way, must also reinstall Word and Excell
 as it clears out my previous documents list. Is there any way to just reinstall Outlook, or repair just Outlook? And if I did that, can I then copy my pst files back into the new, fixed, installed version?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case the problem still exists. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the second link, I do not understand what Security Info &amp; Codes I am supposed to change in Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, as I have previously pointed out, when I run Outlook right after I boot up, it retrieves all of my email. The problem is that it does not retrieve email after that. So obviously all of my settings are correct, my ISP is performing, and there are no
 security problems. An Outlook works, but only one time on each boot up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely there is some Outlook problem that occurs after the first time it retrieves emails.</p>

            <p>For the past two weeks I've been unable to retrieve emails in Outlook 2013. However on my laptop, running Outlook 2016, I have had no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, starting yesterday, Outlook started to retrieve emails. I made no changes, Windows had no updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I no longer need any help here, but it sure would be nice to know what caused it. Since the laptop and the PC both access the same ISP, and the settings are identical on both machines, I can only think that something is different in Outlook 2013, and
 in all versions of Outlook since at least 2007.</p>

            <p>Well, I spoke too soon. The problem went away but only for a day and I've been too busy to post. So, here's what I did. I switched to a wired connection. That did not help. I started shutting down during the day so that on restart Outlook would download
 my mail. It would continue working fine for as long as an hour or two, Then I would get the same error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The frustrating thing is that my wife's laptop, running W10 and Outlook 2016 has no problems. And while I get the timeout messages she has never gotten even one. When I'm having the problem she is not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am back now asking someone at Microsoft to tell me how to get this fixed without having to buy W10 and Office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone at Microsoft believe there is a problem?&nbsp; Or do they think that all the posts for the past years are just hallucinations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done speed tests on my connection, I have checked all the setting on all my email account and all of them have the correct settings. I have shut off Norton and I still get the problem. I have started my PC and only loaded Outlook. I have done everything
 that Microsoft's responders have asked and the problem still exists. It's obvious to me too that my ISP does not have a problem and is somehow giving my wife's laptop excellent connectivity and giving me poor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone?</p>

            I have this exact same issue that started yesterday. &nbsp;Have you managed to find any fix?

            No. But the problem has gone away for the past month or so. I think the issue had to do with my ISP but they will never admit it. There was another possible cause but I can't prove it. I was unable to PING or TRACERT successfully. I called Norton and their
 tech said some of the firewall settings were causing the problem. He uninstalled and reinstalled Internet Security and fixed the PING/TRACERT problem. About that same time my Outlook problem seems to have gone away as well as a problem with Firefox loading
 tabs very slowly. Maybe it was all related. My suggestion for now is uninstall Norton and reinstall it, assuming you use it. Good luck.<br />
