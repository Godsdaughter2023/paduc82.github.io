<h2>            Windows cannot boot normally only in safe mode after Driver Power State Failure</h2>
                    <p>As the title says i can't boot normaly into windows 8.1, or do anything because all I get is a black screen without cursor.</p>
<p>Only after I shut down the power 3 times I am presented with a blue screen that says Automatic Repair that makes my chose to "restart" or "advance settings" (sorry if I didn't translate well, the blue Automatic Repair screen in not in english).</p>
<p>I've followed a video on YouTube that used the Console from advance settings to create some kind of directory backup. After that it seemed to be fixed, the only problem was that the start up was EXTREMELY SLOW, the laptop would heat up quickly from only
 browsing and run slow as well. </p>
<p>When I wanted to shut down the screen freezes&nbsp; with the white circles next to "Shut Down". I let it go for about 45 min but nothing happened so I pressed the power button to force it to shut down. The next time i opened my laptop i was back to the black
 screen so the fix only worked 1 time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The System restore that was saved by Windows before the&nbsp;Driver Power State Failure are saying that System Restore couldn't extract a file "...\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Adera_8wekyb4d8bbwe\AC\....."&nbsp; "Restore point damaged or deleted"(system restore

<p>Before going any further with this problem, read this about overheating:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the vents for dust, hair, etc&nbsp;and do not use a Laptop when it is resting&nbsp;on material surfaces: bedspreads, blankets,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem persists, as it is a Laptop, take it to a local and reliable Computer Repair Shop and get them to open it up and clean the dust from inside it..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an interesting discussion about the varied reasons for your problem:</p>
<p><a href="http://pc-trickandsolution.blogspot.com.au/2011/07/fix-laptop-overheating-shutdown-problem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://pc-trickandsolution.blogspot.com.au/2011/07/fix-laptop-overheating-shutdown-problem.html</span></a></p>
<p>N.B&gt; However 9 out of 10 cases of overheating are caused by an airflow blockage.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Cannot Edit in Windows Movie Maker</h2>
                    I cannot edit in windows movie maker.&nbsp; The area to edit in windows movie maker is shaded in gray and does not give me access to edit my project.&nbsp; When I open up a picture file, fade-in, fade-out and speed are not available to me.&nbsp; The only thing that I
 can edit is the duration of the picture. What do I need to do to correct this problem and get access to editing?&nbsp; Please Help.<br />

            <p>I believe you are talking about the <strong>Video Tools | Edit</strong> tab.&nbsp; Most of those controls apply to
<em>video</em>.&nbsp; When you are editing photos (a static image), the only relevant settings are things like
<strong>Duration</strong>.&nbsp; The volume / fade-in / fade-out don't apply because pictures don't have audio.&nbsp; Similarly, all the choices for splitting, trimming, speed are only applicable to video and are therefore grayed out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of it this way, if you want to <u>double</u> the speed of a 7 second photo, it will now display for half the time (i.e. 3.5 seconds).&nbsp; So you can get the same result by
<u>halving</u> the duration of your photos.&nbsp; A 3.5 second photo appears for half the time of a 7 second photo and hence is twice as fast.&nbsp; In mathematical terms Speed and Duration are inversely proportional.&nbsp; Another way to adjust the speed of your slideshow
 is to use the <strong>Project</strong> tab and choose <strong>Fit to music</strong>.&nbsp; That will automatically adjust the duration of all your photos to end when the song(s) end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>P.S.</strong>&nbsp; You can set any duration setting you like by typing into the Duration field and then pressing Enter.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>P.P.S.</strong>&nbsp;If you are looking to fade a clip in or out (whether it be a photo or a video), you should be using the Visual Effects tab.&nbsp; You can choose Fade to/from black or white.&nbsp; For adding transitions between photos, use the
<strong>Animations </strong>tab.</em></p>

    <title>Mouse Pointer Speed Reduced to its Half Speed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mouse Pointer Speed Reduced to its Half Speed</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First time I have encountered this. I always set my pointer speed (touchpad on netbook) to maximum, and using Synaptics Touch Pad, also enable "momentum."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I booted on a USB using GParted Live ISO. The mouse pointer speed was so fast there. I rebooted back to Windows, then this strange thing happened: the speed of the pointer was reduced to half. At full speed scale, it was the average, normal speed. Even though
 I use momentum, still slow for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried these:</p>
<p>
</p><p>0. Do a System Restore prior to that.</p>
<p>1. Uninstall/reinstall Synaptics.</p>
<p>2. Uninstall/reinstall mouse/touchpad driver.</p>
<p>3. Adjust registry settings and reverted again to its normal settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All these four things resulted to NOTHING. Still the speed was half its normal speed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pls help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do NOT want to reinstall Windows!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p><span>Hello Francis,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected and
</span><span>I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for providing a detailed information on your issue. However, there are few more steps that we can try to diagnose the root cause.
</span><span>This issue can be caused due to third-party application conflict or corrupted user account.
<span>Let’s try to identify the actual cause and troubleshoot accordingly.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">However, before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1. Did this problem recently begin? If so, do you remember making any changes to the system prior to this issue?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. What is the make and model of the netbook?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would suggest you to run the <strong>hardware and devices troubleshooter</strong><span> and check.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Press <strong>Windows key + W</strong> on your keyboard.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>b) Type <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> and click <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>c) Click on <strong>View All. </strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>d) Click on <strong>Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>e) Click on <strong>Next </strong>button to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the above troubleshooter doesn’t help, then try method 2.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There could be possibility of some background programs conflicting with the smooth running of the
</span><span>computer. To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‘<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>’.</em></span></span></p>

            <p>1. Hello. As far as I could remember, I did nothing to Windows system. Only, as I have mentioned, after I have booted in my USB using Gparted Live (it uses Linux), then the problem occurred. I could tell that maybe Linux ran on a USB affects Windows OS because
 it affects the time zone of Windows OS once I rebooted back to Windows. Maybe the same thing happened with my touchpad, Linux affected it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. eMachines netbook, M355.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. This is the diagnosis of Method 1:</p>

<h2>            Would you like Pok&#38;&#35;233&#59;mon Go on Xbox One&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Pokémon Go has far too much hype this week. My Xbox friends talking about. My real life friends talking about. Randoms during my lunch break and at the bus stop talking about it. They're talking about it on Planet Coaster forums, a PC game under development
 by Frontier. I watched a YouTube video by an Australian Youtuber he posted a recent video Warning from Microsoft to Xbox 1 users. Microsoft is releasing a Notification where it alerts you to when you've been playing too long on your Xbox. In that video, I
 think it happened in America, a driver crashed into a police car while being distracted while playing Pokémon Go on his phone. I also decided to download it on my phone too and give it a try.</p>

<p>How would you expect this to work on a console considering it makes you physically walk to places to catch Pokémon and stuff? A new peripheral or your phone which would defeat the purpose in the first place? The game is designed for mobile gaming and I think
 that's where it should stay.</p>

<p>I got bored so looked in the newspaper. "Have you been swept up in the Pokémon Go craze?" 5 people from my city (I live in a NZ city) interviewed said they liked it. All of them did. It would be interesting if a Pokémon game came to Xbox 1. It tends to be
 like the Nintendo platforms which get Pokémon games. Certain games like The Sims 3 are made in a variety of different platforms. I actually like Pokémon I use to watch it when I came home from school. But considering how much hype is out there for the game,
 it would be kwl if we had a Pokémon game on "XBOX".</p>

<p>I actually did try it on my Samsung S5 (the like water proof rain proof phone with gorilla glass 2). I've dropped my phone badly several times and it remains undamaged. I did honestly play the game for like 2 minutes. But I uninstalled it as I didn't want
 it taking over my life. And because my phone's OS (Android KitKat) said it wanted access to my identity and everything.
</p>
<p>I still would like a pokemon game on Xbox. But I can watch it on YouTube and Netflix. There's a lot of hype about the game. I might give it another go though. Microsoft does have it so we can take our Xbox stuff with us. Like Windows 10 on PC and Smartglass
 on our phones. </p>

<h2>            Google Mail Connection is not private - New Root Certificate not trusted</h2>
                    <p>Recently, when trying to connect to mail.google.com or gmail.com some users are failing with "Connection is not private".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem has been isolated to a new root certificate NOT being automatically installed/updated in Trusted Root CAs.</p>
<p>The problem impacts both IE and Chrome.</p>
<p>Manually installing the new root certificate fixes the problem.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello Vince791025,</p>
<p>Apologies on the late reply.&nbsp; Is this still an issue for you?</p>
<p>I have read the issue and I would suggest you to do a chkdsk /r from the command from by booting from the Vista Disc.To do so please follow the following steps:</p>
<p>1&gt;Please insert the Vista Disc into the tray and restart the computer.<br />
2&gt;When you see " press any key to boot from the cd ", please press any key.<br />
3&gt;After that please click on the " repair your computer" option.<br />
4&gt;Now select " command prompt" and type the command ( chkdsk /r ) which will repair all the corrupted files.The computer will restart once the process is done.Please try to do the updates one at a time.</p>
<p>If you do not mind, please rerun the SFC Scan and send us the last 30 to 50 lines.</p>
<p>The steps to do the SFC scan are listed below:</p>
<p>Running the System File Checker…<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and select Run as Administrator.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Continue or supply Administrator credentials if prompted.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Command Prompt window type the following, and press Enter:</p>
<p>sfc /scannow</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should see the following on-screen messages:</p>
<p>Beginning the system scan. This process will take some time.</p>
<p>Beginning verification phase of system scan.</p>
<p>Verification % complete.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the scan has completed you will receive an onscreen message resembling one of the following:</p>
<p>…found no integrity violations</p>
<p>…found corruption but repaired it</p>
<p>…found corruption that it could not repair</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please reply with the completion message that you received.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
If the above SFC Scan produces errors and says it cannot repair them, stay at the command prompt and do the following:<br />
At the command prompt, type in:<br />
notepad sfcdetails.txt then press the ENTER key<br />
copy/paste the last 30 to 50 lines here so that we may look at the contents of the log file. - Thank you</p>
<p><br />
Please try these steps and let me know of the outcome.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Shaolin Roger Thapa.<br />

<h2>            Wifi limited access fix.</h2>
                    <p>This for anyone that has a limited access etc. Or Wifi problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>All i did was do go to recovery and go to options and chose</p>
<p>----full reset (deletes everything)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then i downloaded a bootable USB Windows 10 iso from this website</p>
<p>----https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then i installed the iso it takes about 10 - 15 minutes to complete. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just use you're email address to reactivate Windows 10. That fixed my limited access connection.
</p>
<p>
That's what helped me. I couldn't find anything else.</p>

    <title>HOW CAN I STOP WINDOWS UPDATE FROM EXECUTING A FILE&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the3rdeye_695  say:</h3>
<h2>            HOW CAN I STOP WINDOWS UPDATE FROM EXECUTING A FILE&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After receiving the Windows Update showing I have the Windows 10 Pro update sitting in my Windows Update application, waiting to be executed, I have read about the many complaints and, specifically, the inability of so many users to recover their systems
 and return to Windows 7, that I decided I no longer want Windows 10 on my computer&nbsp;(at present). A more underlying reason, is I was told by the manufacturer of the computer that because it came with Windows 7 reinstalled, it will warranty that OS, but if I
 change to Windows 10, the OS will no longer be warranteed.&nbsp; Inasmuch as I paid for a highly extended warranty through January, 2018, that would represent a significant loss of money.&nbsp; There is still, at least in theory, the possibility of saving the warranty
 and preventing Windows 10 from executing (running) and loading onto the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I AM SEEKING THE HELP OF SOMEONE KNOWLEDGEABLE THAT CAN EXPLAIN HOW TO DOWNLOAD THE UPDATE THAT IS CALLED "UPGRADE TO WINDOWS 10 PRO" SOLELY IN ORDER TO DELETE IT.&nbsp;&nbsp;That update or upgrade is sitting in my Windows&nbsp;Update&nbsp;application waiting for me to click
 on the button that would download AND execute or run that file (which contains 2699 MB).&nbsp; It occurred to me that if there is a way to stop my system (Windows 7 w/SP1, Ultimate) from executing the file, as long as I can reliably download it, locate it and then
 delete it, without it containing some code that will cause it to "self-execute," so that I can be confident I will be able to delete it for now.&nbsp; I currently have my Windows Update settings to notify me before downloading and to notify me before installing
 ALL updates, so it is probably safe to assume that the Windows 10 Upgrade has not yet reached my computer, but I want to make certain that it never does -- certainly not in its present form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen a lot of blogs from Microsoft useers (specifically, Windows 10 users) complaining that Windows Update would not run certain files.&nbsp; IRONICALLY, THAT SCENARIO is exactly what I wish to happen -- in other words, I want to find a way to download
 the file and then delete it, and, hopefully, to say GOODBYE to Windows 10, at least until there is a version that has the present bugs fixed, however long that might take.&nbsp; I would even prefer to pay for the OS on a DVD that I could then load, knowing that
 if I wish, I can return to Windows&nbsp;7 Ultimate, at a time of my choosing, with little time and effort.&nbsp; I can't afford to lose my data or my hard disk, which contains a protected partition that contains the image "as installed" from the factory, and which formats
 the hard drive, except for that protected partition, and then reinstalls the factory installed image, all in a matter of minutes, leaving the user to utilize Windows Update to bring the system current with whatever updates are necessary by the time the system
 is updated.&nbsp; At present, there are some 296 updates, although some of the latest ones relate to Windows 10, although I have been repeatedly told that if I do not reserve Windows 10, it will not simply appear in Windows Update.&nbsp; About reserving it, yes, I had
 done that, but I was able to cancel the reservation.&nbsp; Unfortunately, when I cancelled the reservation, my system was already informing me that the Windows Upgrade was ready for download and install.&nbsp; I do not like setting Windows Update to deliver anything
 automatically, except for a notification, and that is how the OEM manufacturer of my computer recommended we set up Windows 7, and I have done so every time I have reloaded Win 7 to repair some imperfect setup (i.e, a failed update attempt even if later successful).&nbsp;
 So, I have no failed update attempts from 296 updates, which, even if I must pat myself on the back, I think is quite an achievement.&nbsp; Whether it will ever matter remains to be seen, but it is running exceptionally smoothly.&nbsp; What I do NOT know is what will
 happen next since it already notified me that the Windows 10 Update/Upgrade to Win 10 Pro is waiting to be downloaded AND installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, here are my questions, now that you have the background info:</p>
<p>
</p><p>How reliable would it be for me to reset Windows Update to Notify When Ready to Download, and Notify when Ready to Install,
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>so that inbetween the two operations, I would (HOPEFULLY) be able to delete the downloaded file, in any case, before the file would execute</strong></em></span>??&nbsp;
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>Please -- a Microsoft engineer very familiar not only with Windows Update on Windows 7 Ultimate, but also with the file used for Windows 10 that is downloaded to Alienware desktop systems with Win 7 Ultimate
 (64 bit) -- someone that could tell me if the file is designed to self execute when downloaded, regardless of the specific setting used on Windows Update.</strong></em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, is there a dependable method of temporarily modifying the normal operations of Windows Update so that I can DOWNLOAD that file, WITHOUT running (executing)&nbsp;it -- which assumes the file is designed to self execute upon download, regardless of how
 Windows Update is set?&nbsp; The benefit of doing so would be to allow me to then delete the file without running it, and that would assure me that I will not get stuck with Windows 10 on my&nbsp;system -- an operating system that might actually prevent me from going
 back to Windows 7, based on some of the blogs by MS users trying Windows 10, which blogs I have already read.&nbsp; (Even the Windows 10 info from Microsoft states that a computer may be downgraded to the OS it had before it was upgraded to Windows 10, but ONLY
 for a 30 day time period, and some users have reported that already (just a couple days after upgrading), they are unable to return to their prior operating system.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP OUT THERE.&nbsp; My system is an expensive desktop, and I discovered that the manufacturer will NOT warranty Windows 10 on it, because it came preinstalled with Windows 7 Ultimate, and I have neither the time nor the energy at this point
 to beta test an operating system on such an expensive desktop computer, not to mention risking causing damage to the computer that is simply not covered by warranty.&nbsp; As it is, the computer was factory overclocked from 3.6Ghz to 4.3 Ghz -- with an Intel Core
 I-7 4960X processor.&nbsp;If I could turn back the clock and NEVER have reserved it, that is what I would have done, but it is too late for the cries over spilled&nbsp;milk.&nbsp; I need those who have tried and erred their way to the knowledge that some engineers have (or
 more).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a way (or more than one way) to get rid of this file (including the possibility of formatting the hard drive and reinstalling Windows 7, although I have a suspicion that will NOT get rid of a file which has not yet been downloaded to my HD, i.e.,
 a file I have been NOTIFIED is ready for download, but has not yet been downloaded.&nbsp; (That is why I would like to download it, if only so that I can then delete it and, on that basis, I would be sure I have successfully gotten rid of the file, at least until
 my warranty expires in January of 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I have succeeded in cancelling the reservation, I do not expect any further downloads, although if I can download it once (and delete it), there should be no sound reason that I can't download a file again
 and delete that, in the event a repeat reoccurrence of this situation takes place -- such as an update to the upgrade, although that is why I cancelled my reservation, AND the system returned a notification at the same time that my cancellation was successful,
 EVEN THOUGH IT STILL TELLS ME THE FILE IS READY TO BE DOWNLOADED AND INSTALLED..</p>
<p>
</p><p>As part and parcel to my question as to how to get rid of this upgrade effectively,
<strong>what about switching Windows Update to download, only, and then wait until I indicate I wish to install; at least in theory, this SHOULD allow me to delete the downloaded file.&nbsp; However, I wouldn't risk doing that unless I knew that it would work.&nbsp;
 Does anyone know whether this will permit me to delete the downloaded file (which would, in theory, be the upgrade file) which I want to delete????&nbsp; And, where would I find this downloaded file so I could delete it.&nbsp; I have heard it would be in C:\windows\SoftwareDistribution???&nbsp;
 It should stand out based on the size, I would think.&nbsp; If anyone believes he/she knows the name the file should have, PLEASE post it.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have edited this several times in an effort to shorten its length, and I hope I will get some answers, now that it contains the essential and salient facts.&nbsp; PLEASE, I NEED YOUR HELP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>There is NO KB3081048.&nbsp; Second, I wrote that if your claimed "fix" did not work, I WOULD POST THAT FACT HERE, AND I AM POSTING THE FACT YOUR CLAIMED FIX -- NAMELY, TO FORMAT AND (RE)INSTALL WINDOWS 7 DID NOT HELP, EXCEPT IT SIMPLY GAVE ME A FALSE SENSE OF
 SECURITY FROM AUGUST 29 TO OCTOBER 11TH, ON WHICH DATE A MULTIPLE SET OF WINDOWS 10 PRO UPGRADE FILES WERE AVAILABLE AND TRIED TO DOWNLOAD ON MY PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TO THOSE WHO WOULD TRY TO HIDE KB3035833, IT WILL KEEP COMING BACK.&nbsp; I HAVE A LAPTOP WHICH HAS ABOUT 5 OR 6 KB3035833 FILES THAT ARE HIDDEN AND HOPEFULLY WILL STAY HIDDEN.&nbsp; STILL, I NOW AGREE THIS CONDUCT BY MICROSOFT IS THE MOST BLATANTLY ILLEGAL CONDUCT
 I HAVE SEEN BY A CUSTOMER DRIVEN BUSINESS IN MY LIFETIME.&nbsp; BEING OVER 50 YEARS OF AGE QUALIFIES ME TO SAY I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF BAD APPLES OUT THERE, BUT MICROSOFT IS AMONG THE WORST.&nbsp; THIS GAME THEY PLAY WITH WINDOWS 10 IS MERCILESS AND IS NOT IN THE BEST
 INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS, DESPITE THEIR CLAIMS TO THE CONTRARY.&nbsp; KEEP YOUR RECEIPTS, PEOPLE, BECAUSE JUDGMENT DAY WILL COME FOR MICROSOFT, AND THEY WILL HAVE TO REPAY YOU EVERY PENNY THAT YOU HAVE SPENT TO BRING YOUR COMPUTER IN COMPLIANCE WITH WINDOWS 10 (IF
 YOU ARE ONE WHO DID SO, BECAUSE YOU DID NOT HAVE A REASONABLE CHOICE).&nbsp; IF YOU BOUGHT A WINDOWS 7 OR WINDOWS 8.1 COMPUTER IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, I KNOW THAT WINDOWS 7 END OF LIFE (IF YOU HAVE SP1) IS NOT UNTIL JANUARY, 2020, IF MY RECOLLECTION IS CORRECT.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>MANY COMPUTER PURCHASERS COULD REASONABLY HAVE DESIRED TO KEEP THEIR COMPUTERS AT LEAST UNTIL THE END OF LIFE OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM THAT CAME PREINSTALLED WITH IT, IF AN OS DID COME PREINSTALLED.&nbsp; I, FOR ONE, WAS TOLD BY THE MANUFACTURER OF MY COMPUTER
 THAT IT WOULD NOT BE WARRANTED FOR WINDOWS 10 -- ONLY FOR WINDOWS 7 -- WHICH WAS WHEN I CHANGED MY MIND AND DECIDED TO CANCEL MY RESERVATION OF WINDOWS 10.&nbsp; THE POPUP INDICATED THAT MY CANCELLATION WAS SUCCESSFUL.&nbsp; WHAT A BLATANT FALSEHOOD, MISTRUTH BY THOSE
 WHO CREATED THAT POPUP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ALL OF THESE SO-CALLED FIXES TO PREVENT WINDOWS 10 FROM DOWNLOADING -- I DO NOT BELIEVE THEY WILL WORK.&nbsp; IF I CAN HAVE SUCCESS FROM AUGUST 29 TO OCTOBER 11 ON THE WORD OF A MICROSOFT ENGINEER WHO WRITES ON THIS BOARD THAT I NEED TO FORMAT MY HARD DRIVE AND
 REINSTALL WINDOWS 7, AND THAT IS THE ANSWER TO MY QUESTION AS TO HOW TO STOP WINDOWS 10 FROM TRYING TO DOWNLOAD ON MY PC EITHER SPOKE WITH DELIBERATE MISREGARD FOR THE TRUTH, OR HE CALOUSLY AND WILFULLY SPOKE WITH MALICIOUS INTENT TO DECEIVE, DEFRAUD AND/OR
 TO LIE.&nbsp; AS A MICROSOFT ENGINEER, HE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER, AND IF HE DID NOT KNOW BETTER, HE SHOULD NOT HAVE HELD HIMSELF OUT AS SOMEONE IN THE KNOW MAKING SUCH A FALSE CLAIM.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>EVERYONE WHO BELIEVES HE/SHE/IT WAS INJURED AS A RESULT OF MICROSOFT'S WINDOWS 10 SYSTEM WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS DOWNLOADING ON COMPUTERS THAT NEVER REQUESTED MICROSOFT'S WINDOWS 10 AND NEVER RESERVED IT SHOULD IMMEDIATELY FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THEIR LOCAL
 FTC OFFICE.&nbsp; THAT IS THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WITH HEADQUARTERS IN WASHINGTON, D.C.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ANYONE WHO CHOOSES TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION SHOULD FIRST CONSULT WITH A LAWYER TO FIND OUT ANY POTENTIAL RAMIFICATIONS OF FILING A COMPLAINT.&nbsp; THE FTC IS A FEDERAL AGENCY WHICH PROSECUTES OFFENDERS OF THE LAW AND
 OFTEN SEEKS REDRESS ON BEHALF OF CONSUMERS TO FORCE LARGE ORGANIZATIONS (AND SMALL) TO REPAY CONSUMERS WHO HAVE SUFFERED DAMAGE AT THE HANDS OF A BUSINESS THAT ENGAGES IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IN MY OPINION, MICROSOFT'S CONDUCT IS COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY REPREHENSIBLE.&nbsp; TO CLAIM THIS IS DONE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE CONSUMERS SOUNDS LIKE OUR POLITICIANS WHO CLAIM THAT A CERTAIN HEALTH CARE LAW WAS GOOD FOR CONSUMERS THAT DID NOT KNOW HOW TO DECIDE
 FOR THEMSELVES WHAT WAS BEST FOR THEM.&nbsp; (SOUND FAMILIAR?????)</p>

2.Check &nbsp;Wi-Fi function and Wi-Fi tray icon<br />
3.Wi-Fi tray icon &nbsp;won't change to Wi-Fi type &nbsp;after turn on WiFi.</p>
<p>Under this condition,I find can access internet by WIFI connection,but the tray icon display airplane mode</p>
<p>That's strange!</p>

    <title>How to prioritize Audio over Explorer refresh and indexing&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> astara__  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to prioritize Audio over Explorer refresh and indexing&#63; &#40;both accessing a network file system&#41;...</h2>
                    Under some OS's, I can set the I/O priority on a process and have that regulate that processes I/O...but on Windows, it seems to be a feature that such control is removed and all network/file system I/O is collectively merged into 'system', so that it
 can't be prioritized monitored, accounted for, regulated, or anything else!&nbsp; I know this doesn't help consumers (as I sit here typing, I'm hearing dropouts and windows search is still running -- at lowest priority (4)...but the cpu priority isn't the network
 priority and it isn't the disk priority.<br />
<br />
So very little control over the most critical resources is given to the users...after all, CPU power is fairly plentiful, but compared to disk *bandwidth*, (not space), but time spent reading/writing to disk, and, worse, network speeds, which are abysmal by
 any measure, it's easy to have unwanted background programs destroying your media experience.<br />
<br />
I thought Win7 was supposed to be better about this?<br />
<br />
I have QoS running, and the multimedia scheduler, but those are likely looking for streaming video, or audio -- not video or audio played either over the net from a network fs, or even a remote file-system over HTTP/webdav...&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I can't very well lower the priority on the System process doing the I/O, as it's also doing the I/O for the audio....<br />
<br />
(What idiot came up with the idea to move attributable I/O out of processes and klump it all together in the low-level system processes where it can't be differentiated?<br />
<br />
Are they insane or am I missing something obvious and am in need of a large clue stick?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks...<br />
<br />
Help!<br />

<br />
It remains unanswered.<br />
<br />
<br />
It seems MS has provided no technical solution to allow traffic network file-system prioritization, on ANY OS...<br />
<br />
In fact, it seems they've made it near impossible in Win7, to differentiate and limit network and disk access -- as both are now attributed to 'System' and not to any process.<br />
<br />
This is a huge step backwards -- at least before, you could tell if I/O (file or network) was coming from a process.&nbsp; Now MS, hides most of this -- the I/O, _it would appear_, by accident, as I/O's over 64k are now handled differently than regular I/O (which
 is why you see 'zero disk usage' when your disks are thrashing with a defrag....no way to really see what is causing it, ya just have to know.<br />
<br />
Same with network, it seems,&nbsp;&nbsp; if a process is hogging the network through a mounted file system, then It's protected from being 'limited' by having it's I/O hidden as 'System' I/O....<br />
<br />
Makes it alot easier for virus and malware writers, I'm sure!...<br />

            <p>the edtech magazine was a pre-production article on Win7.</p>
<p>The netbalancer tool is for Windows XP/2003/Vista only.</p>
<p>And for your first response on URL's, a local network file system ISN't on the web.</p>
<p>So URL control is completely worthless for QOS on your internal network where you need to separate out priority to AV and voice from explorer refreshing it's thumbcache, because MS removed indexing of network drives in Win7....</p>
<p>If they hadn't removed the indexing Explorer could have used cached copies most of the time and update what was needed or out of date, but without that - Explorer refreshes every time you open a new session....sometimes saturating a 1Gb ethernet for well
 over a minute -- sometimes 2-3 minutes...&nbsp; That's with 60-100+MB/s reads from the server....(the disks speed capacity is ~1GB/s, or about 8-10 times the network speed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, no technical responses to this, and nothing applicable.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a feeling, it's yet ANOTHER design flaw in windows that MS doesn't really care about....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No wonder businesses aren't upping to Win7 very quickly -- when they see the performance problems and management problems they are gonna scream...though by then maybe Win8 will be out and who knows, they might fix it...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Too bad we have to live with 1 alpha and 1 beta quality product before a real one comes out (assuming win8 is solid, which is a large assumption.</p>

            <p>Branch caching does nothing for a local network....only for extended works...<br />
<br />
I'm having problems with network access to a server on the same local link (separated by 1<br />
a 1Gb Netgear switch).<br />
<br />
As far as netbalance goes...they claim things I'm pretty sure they CAN'T do...<br />
<br />
<br />
If the process does the network I/O by opening up a port...THAT they can regulate...so can QOS, built-in to windows,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What they can't regulate -- and what the problem is **local processes accessing a a mounted network share....***...&nbsp;</p>
<p>It use do be they got charged for their own I/O when they did that, but in Win7, MS moved all the network accounting for accessing a network file-share to the process named "System:"...&nbsp; It's 1 proc-id...and all your system I/O goes through that 1 process
 over the same</p>
<p>TCP/IP ***session***.&nbsp; On NFS, or on http or on an IMAP email server, outlook will open 30-50 parallel connections if you let it....HTTP, varies from 4-40+ depending on settings, but CIFS/SMB...1 connection for everything in your system.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why my
 music stops -- because</p>
<p>explorer is saturating System. with 1000's of requests/second to refresh it's file view)...my players measly request once over 1-2 seonds for a packet gets delayed just waiting for explorer's last batch of requests to go out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did reduce my network card's send and receive buffers, but all that's done is take my max network throughput for file reads/write from over 100MB/s down to &lt;30MB/s.&nbsp;&nbsp; (a huge hit when writing out multi gig files).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Network performance has gotten so bad due to explorer having to do real-time indexing tasks (due to MS killing off network disk indexing for home user network disks) that I'm exploring setting ethernet bonding to get the network speed up to 200Mb.&nbsp; I just
 hope Win7 can handle it...it's not a champ when it comes to network perf due to it's poor design of handling all hardware events in *rescheduled*, *deferred*, soft-interrupts....that adds well over 100% extra cpu cycles .</p>
<p>But the fact that both my media requests AND explorer's network'ed I/o are being funneled through the same process and the same **1** sesson (when other protocols like HTTP use up to 30-40 parallel connections)... makes it impossible to regulate the traffic
 -- cause you can't downgrade the 1 TCP connection without affecting everything that uses network file I/O.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a horrible design decision on someone's part.&nbsp; They did the same wth large file I/O&nbsp; -- it's no longer attributed to individual processes,
 (anything over 64K), ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both of those were HORRIBLE decisions for resource management....I can't prioritize I/O in any useful way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully this gives more insight into why none of the suggested solutions work...I'm not trying to be difficult -- it is a real problem.&nbsp; When business start to move enmasse to win7, there is going to be some part of the business segment that really is
 into monitoring and controlling and needing to regulate resource control that is really going be upset at the changes.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not saying they&nbsp; are the majority, but its that group of people that is able to keep tabs on performance and metrics better than anyone
 else -- because that's what they do all the time.</p>

Hardware support - including the software and drivers that make it work - comes from the manufacturer.&nbsp; So - yes.<br />

            Hello satish reddi, welcome.<br />
<br />
You could try to a fix that has worked before on S2k3.&nbsp; Try this on the systems affected:<br />
<br />
1. Click START<br />
2. Type 'notepad' (without quotes) and press enter<br />
3. Copy and paste the following into notepad:<br />
<br />
%SYSTEMDRIVE% <br />
CD %windir%\system32\wbem <br />
Mofcomp.exe cimwin32.mof <br />
Regsvr32 /s wbemupgd.dll <br />
Regsvr32 /s wbemsvc.dll <br />
wmiprvse /regserver<br />
<br />
4. Click File &gt; Save As<br />
5. Change the drop down menu (file type) to 'All Files'<br />
6. Name the file sqlfix.bat and save it to your desktop<br />
7. From there, right click the file and choose 'Run as Administrator'. If it does not work that way, you can alternatively open it up WITHOUT choosing Run as Admininstrator and see what happens.<br />
<br />
8. Now try to install SQL 2k5<br />
<br />
Let us know,<br />
<br />
Thanks!

<h2>            Windows RT8.1 updates</h2>
                    Lately I've been having problems accessing one particular website with IE11 on my Lenovo Ideapad running Windows RT8.1.&nbsp; I've been advised that there's an upgrade to Windows 10 that might fix this but want to find out whether this truly is a fix or whether
 I'm just going to completely muck up what functionality I have on the machine.&nbsp; This has only happened over the last three weeks with one site and I've been told by the site owners that there have been no other reports of problems running their webinars.&nbsp;
 Any advice/suggestions??

    <title>Windows 10 BIOS - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 BIOS</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying for the past hour to get into the BIOS on my Windows 10 Enterprise PC (it is custom built and uses an MSI motherboard with the shortcut key to enter BIOS being F11) however for whatever reason, windows disables the keyboard until windows
 itself stars to load. Is there anyway to make it not due that so that I can actually get into the BIOS? I have already tried using the command prompt (shutdown.exe /r /p) and using shift restart to get into the troubleshooting and then advanced options but
 the UEFI Firmware Settings never shows up as an option for me. Is there any other way to access BIOS besides what I have already tried? Thank you and sorry if I posted this with the wrong topic I just didn't know what topic this is considered.&nbsp;</p>

            HI AC.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You should ask your company's IT desk since Enterprise is a business version only legally activated by large companies and organizations which use an on-site activation server.  
<br />
<br />Double check the BIOS key for your maker:  <a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />See other methods to access UEFI BIOS:
<br /><a href="http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-methods-to-access-uefi-bios-setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-...</a>
<br />
<br />There is an issue where Fast Boot can cause the BIOS to skip hotkeys and needs to be turned off first.  But the catch is that you must then be able to enter via Windows using the above methods.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Is there a BIOS Update for your PC or motherboard?
<br />
<br />The hard drive can sometimes block entering BIOS, so you can first power down to unplug it then try again.  
<br />
<br />The next step then is normally to reset the CMOS:
<br /><a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/how-to-reset-cmos-and-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.maketecheasier.com/how-to-reset-cmo...</a>
<br />
<br />There's something dysfunctional causing WIndows not to give access to UEFI.

            Hi AC_3333001
<br />
<br />Windows cannot block your keyboard before Windows actually loads, on the MSI screen when you start your PC, Windows has absolutely no control over your PC
<br />
<br />If F11 does not get you into BIOS, try Fn + F12
<br />
<br />Depending on the actual model No. of MSI motherboard, you might also try these keys . . .
<br />
<br />F2
<br />
<br />Fn + F2
<br />
<br />Esc
