<h2>            Solver installation problem</h2>
                    Solver does not appear to be on my computer despite having the Professional Plus 2016 version of Excel. I have gone through the standard procedure (File/Options/Add-ins etc) but it is not in the list and browsing says it does not exist! Do I have to download
 it separately from somewhere?

            Thanks Sheeloo. The problem seems to be that although solver.xlam is on my c drive it does not appear in the list of add-ins and does not even appear when I try to browse from the path you suggest. I wonder whether this has something to do with the Dell
 protection system (it was a pre-loaded version of Office). Anyway, I seem to have found a workaround. If I locate Solver.xlam on my c drive and open it then excel is fired up. This excel spreadsheet does have solver in the Data tab and when I do a "save as"
 the renamed file also has solver. It is a bit of a clunky approach but seems to work.

            <p>Hi Damian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What it means is that the people in Marketing make promises that Engineering can't deliver. &nbsp;They will point the finger saying that the device manufacturer will have to make a compatible driver. &nbsp;There is no way that Windows 10 will have drivers for all
 hardware in the Win7/8 universe, and compatibility mode doesn't always work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device manufacturers have little incentive to make drivers for devices that are no longer being manufactured - indeed, making new drivers again and again for old hardware would be a huge drain of resources for any device manufacturer. &nbsp;They're usually busy
 making drivers for their current products.</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One way to keep your most-used folders easily visible is by adding it to <strong>
Favorites</strong>. This will help you find specific folders and unread e-mail items faster. Also, you won't have to scroll through the Folder Pane to find the folder you want to check. To add or remove folders to
<strong>Favorites</strong>, we suggest that you follow the steps provided in this article:&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Keep-frequently-used-mail-folders-in-Favorites-f5712d2e-a34e-4566-a278-8279b8595c7e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Keep
 frequently used mail folders in Favorites</a>.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you have further questions.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Clark</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank-you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps I am missing something, but I see things differently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to be able to see an Unread Mail folder at the top of the list as was previously possible in earlier editions of Outlook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have many Rules which I use to pre-sort the majority of my inwards emails. &nbsp;Even if I thought it practical to identify five or even ten most-used folders and shift them to the Favorites section, I would still have to scroll down the folder list to find
 the rest of my unread mail. &nbsp;Accordingly I see the suggested solution as a partial work-around - not as a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, and I don't know if this is relevant, but there is no label "Favorites" at the top of the folder list. &nbsp;At the top of the list, the common folders like Inbox, Drafts, etc are there - standing alone - not grouped in any way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>hopefully Microsoft will see the error of its ways and reinstate Unread Mail to its previous prominence!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards ... David</p>

    <title>Is there a way to backup Outlook.com&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edterry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a way to backup Outlook.com&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just learned the hard way about using a "cloud" service like Outlook.com. While it has many good features, there is one glaring problem. I use Outlook 2010 as the "backup" as suggested here. Only to find out that Microsoft in its wisdom, does not allow
 the MAPI to be stored on your PC. I had an important folder for one email address on Outlook.com. When I set up the account in Outlook 2010, it automatically created the folder, but DID NOT create any kind of .pst file for the MAPI connection. Using Windows
 8.1 with a touch screen, I have to manually clear my "Junk File" on Outlook 2010 because it will not stay in sync with Outlook.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With my fat finger I accidentally hit the folder above the Junk folder and proceeded to "Empt<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">y</span> Folder" Windows 8.1 touch screen is not as precise as a mouse.</p>
<p>When I realized what had happened, seconds later, I went to restore from a .pst file, NO there is none. Went to the web at Outlook.com and all that you can restore is items that went into the "Delete Folder". I may be the first, but I know I am not the last
 person that has done this. And there is NO support I can find about this glaring hole in the "Cloud Outlook.com". Now to remove all the Outlook apps and go back to just Outlook 2010 and gmail. ugh. Unless someone knows how to recover my lost emails? Tick Tock.</p>

            If you use Outlook 2010 to access your Outlook.com mailbox, create a new Outlook Data File (New Items&gt;More Items&gt;Outlook Data File) and copy your Outlook.com folder contents to that new data file.&nbsp; You can them back that up in any way you wish.&nbsp; Keep in
 mind that it's static.&nbsp; You'll have to update yor local copy from time to time to make sure it's up-to-date.

<h2>            &#34;spinning Cursor&#34; problem with documents.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title &lt; Spinning corsor &gt; </p>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a "spinning cursor" problem but slightly different from those raised by others and probably something really simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Timing of it may be just coincidence but it may be, as usual, that messing around with the Screen Resolution and Icon Size options confused it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I dunno, but the coincidence is odd. &nbsp; What happens is specifically that the cursor jams for a few seconds before working as normal, as if it needs to correlate with the page every time afresh. &nbsp; What I mean by "jams" is that it moves around the page but
 eg I can't close the page. &nbsp;I activate the cursor by clicking on the page whereupon the "spinning disc" routine occurs for a few seconds&nbsp;<em>and the whole page fades</em> a bit for a second or two, then it all comes back and works perfectly well without any
 more glitsches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's as if the mouse is working out what the screen resolution is, or something.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It's a good wireless mouse, not too old. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried unplugging the little USB connector which picks up the signal and delivers it to the computer. &nbsp;Obviously to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read the other threads. &nbsp;If necessary, I could try booting up in safe mode but that seems excessive for such a simple thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the other link kindly given by Hannah. &nbsp; It seemed to return me to such a general Help page, I read that page top to bottom but nothing did I see related to spinning discs or any other obvious next steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas ? &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the issue occurs only with Word 2010 or with other applications as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us try to open Word in its application safe mode and check if any add-ins is causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To open Word in application safe mode:</strong> Click on ‘Start’ &gt; in search bar type ‘winword /safe' (Without the quotes and note the space in the command)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re able to work with Word in safe mode, then follow the steps below to <strong>
disable add-ins</strong> and once done try to open Word normally and verify the status.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Click File menu, click Options &gt; Add-in, click Go button in the Manage: Com-in Add.</li><li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Check if there is any add-in, clear the checkbox to disable it.</li></ol>

            <p>Hello Nayana</p>
<p>
</p><p>As usual, such a simple procedure; logical and clear, but it took ages for me to get on the case, with that spinning disc driving me nuts ! &nbsp;but, no such problems in safe mode and I didn't have to untick any adins since there were none to be found at that
 level except for 'OneNote: Notes about word documents". &nbsp;which was untickked anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far so good. &nbsp;What next ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p>It's strange that grammar is suddenly underlines with green squiggly lines, and so I unticked the box in 'File' 'options' 'autocorrect', but ticking that box is not something that I could have done without knowing it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possibly, deleting then reinstalling Office is bigger in my mind than necessary. &nbsp;My notion is that this edition has got corrupted. &nbsp;Viruses ? not likely to be so tame.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. &nbsp;Am I the only one, or isn't the whole thing badly overdesigned ? whisper it very quietly but I'm getting an itch to see if Apple solves the basic problem that the whole&nbsp;<em>shebang</em> is just overdesigned. &nbsp;Jeez ! &nbsp;I'm soooo paient but it still drives
 me nuts.</p>
<p>

            <p>Nayana. &nbsp;Thanks for getting involved but you might be regretting it when I tell you what happened. &nbsp;What happened in the usual story: Fresh and with unlimited time today, with painstaking little step by little step and with above average intelligence coupled
 with endless hours and diligence to teach myself what "regedit" means and how it all works, it's frustrating when things aren't clearly explained and/or they seem to be wrong and/or I just should understand things better. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a start, I somehow doubt that the problem does lie in things like "rename the normal.dot or normal.dotm global template file" (a phrase to freeze the brains of 99%, or is it just me ?!). &nbsp; Am I not thick ? getting bogged down in minutiae like that when
 else something simple is available eg buy a new copy of Word ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I must be a bit thick because commands given in the instructions aren't recognised even when I cut and paste then straight into the command menu. &nbsp; It's Word 2010 that I have (Windows 7) so I enter "cmd" into the search box and then paste the massive
 instruction next to "Users: Charles&gt;" only to be told "Nope ! we don't recognise that instruction".</p>
<p>
</p><p>That happened both when trying to rename the normaldot and when trying to disable the startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something that I should know about ? eg when it says to enter </p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: bold">ren %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Normal.dotm OldNormal.dotm</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>it doesn't actually mean what it says.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being faced with C:Users\Charles&gt;" on the page already might mean that I should just have started with "AppData\Roaming" but that didn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer's probably simple and obvious to you. It's the sort of thing that leaves people like me pulling our hair out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've started so I'll finish. &nbsp;No matter how long it takes. &nbsp;Usually it's just me making stupid mistakes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I did do the first two of the things on the list, burrowing down into the data registry key and deleting 'options' and deleting 'data', and I did copy them into somewhere safe first (Why ? they both popped back uninvited of their own accord anyway
 !).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to slog away if anyone kind enough like you steps forward to help. &nbsp;I want to educate myself. &nbsp;I'll get there in the end. &nbsp;Even just knowing how to phrase questions to you is quite a difficult thing to do. &nbsp;I'm longwinded so that things are as
 clear as I can make them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short: &nbsp;Why doesn't exact entering of the command deliver the goods ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; And is this sort of glitsch a bit like what happened with my printer ? when it didn't work, I spent a day or two on the phone with someone going &nbsp;right left and centre and getting us both up a gum tree whereas in fact deleting and reloading the printer
 driver solved it at a stroke. &nbsp;My version of Office wasn't the one with a CD so I don't know if I even have that option. &nbsp;And someone elsewhere with a similar problem said that reloading didn't do them any good (and took an age).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily I don't need to use Word very often so I can afford to muddle around for ages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But plodding through it all, getting stuck with the easiest of things such as entering commands (what's up with the " %profile%" bit of the command, for example ? is that where I'm going wrong ?!").</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in anticipation when you are ready.</p>

            <p>
</p><p>Here's another couple of iddites:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I worked it out that "Start" and then entering gargantuan instructions into the search box really just confuses in comparison with finding the files manually. &nbsp;My own instructions to a novice would have been, on that basis: Look for "Computer" below "Libraries"
 then run down the list to "Program files" and click on that then click on Microsoft".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially, that's the other way of achieving the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then instead of a useless and frustrating thing: "Nope ! the search is inoperative" , instead of that I can see for myself that the last bit of the search ( "startup" ) doesn't exist. &nbsp;It's not on that list. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting it all off my chest, for example, the man on the street cllicks on "Start". &nbsp;Blithe instructions to then click on the Microsoft OIffice button lead nowhere, just a dead end. &nbsp;It's not how to find prgram files, it's just one way in to &nbsp;"Excel" and
 "Powerpoint".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So: Normal stupidity on my part. &nbsp;Ferocious logic on their part. &nbsp;I follow it to the letter and with inestimable patience and time to get my head around "regedit" and the various concepts involved but end up stuck when the fiercely logical bit takes me up
 gum trees like that ! &nbsp;(or fails to say why I can't just cup and paste their instructions into the command prompt).</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's where you come in. &nbsp;Thanks. &nbsp;And I hope you get paid for doing so.</p>

</p><p>"cup and paste" ?! &nbsp;slight dyslexia on my part doesn't help either; how else did "cut" become "cup" ?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, a month after this post I found the answer by accident, nothing to do with 'regedits' with 'renaming the normaldotm', with deleting the "registry documents", with running the diagnostics programme and so on which left my head aching and wasted the
 best part of three days spread over a period of weeks. &nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd gladly have paid for a quick solution. &nbsp; Stumbling across MS Help, the 'premium service' was $99 'plus tax'/ &nbsp;1. &nbsp;It only took two seconds to fix, and 2. their person wouldn't have solved it anyway. &nbsp; (Opening exchange went something like this:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;"Spinning
 cursors: Is this your domain ?". &nbsp; &nbsp;"What's your (company) domain (name) ?" </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As it happens, the answer was indeed bedded in my original hunch which was part of my original question.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS Word ? &nbsp;I'd call it 'desktop publishing' more like. &nbsp;Who needs all that ?! &nbsp;Isn't it over engineered ? &nbsp;and isn't that why such obscure glitsches arise ? and why kind volunteers / moderators can't fix things. &nbsp;I become a Professor of Regetits/Normaldots/Registry
 files etc. &nbsp; &nbsp; Days later, they give up baffled. &nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The same sort of thing happened to me before.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Win Mo 6.1&#58; Cannot connect to LAN</h2>
                    Hello! TIA for your help.<br />
<br />
I have an HP iPAQ h5550 running&nbsp;PocketPC (2002/3) v4.20.1081. With it, I can browse my local network via a WiFi connection. In particular, I can access shared directories on the other PCs connected to the network using their netbios names (e.g.
\\aardvark\public\). I set the network card to connect to work and ticked the box in advanced network management, proxy settings that says: "this network connects to the Internet".<br />
<br />
I recently acquired an HTC Touch 3G running Win Mo 6.1 (PocketPC 5.2.20765) and have set it up in the same way as the iPAQ - except that I have noted that it ignores the tick box in advanced network management, proxy settings that says: "this network connects
 to the Internet". When I try to connect to a PC on my LAN (that the iPAQ connects to without problem): I get "cannot connect with these settings". It turns out, using Total Commander that this is due to Error 53: BAD NET PATH. Using VxUtils, I can ping my
 other machines using their IP addresses but I cannot resolve their netbios names as required by the File Explorer. Looking at the settings, using&nbsp;the equivalent of IPConfig /All in&nbsp;VxUtils, they would appear to be correct (mirror those of the iPAQ) and I can
 browse the Internet without problem.<br />
<br />
Has anyone got any suggestions as to what has changed between these versions of the PocketPC software that stops connecting to a PC on a LAN from working?<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />
<br />
Mark

            Hello. OK, I don't usually recommend third party apps for something that should be seamless but here are a couple to try:<br />
<br />
http://www.handango.com/catalog/ProductDetails.jsp?storeId=2218&amp;platformId=30&amp;productId=25004<br />
<br />
http://www.freewarepocketpc.net/ppc-download-network-folder-plugin-v1-0.html<br />
<br />
The second is free and might map the network drive. The first is trial and might give some insight to what is wrong. Although, $15 is worth it in lost hours if it works. LOL. Alot of ppl also use Resco Explorer to map drives. I forgot to mention that I use
 Network Magic on my networked PCs and added the mobile device via the software. It might have facilitated my connection. I guess if you aren't a networking genious, there is room for this type of software! Good Luck. I'd be interested in any solution you find
 so post back.<br />

<h2>            Macro to insert a row above the last row, and copies the format and formulas from the one above.</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to create a Macro that inserts a row above the last row, and copies the format and formulas from the one above.</p>
<p>It is basically a list of items that have a couple of drop down lists and some formulas.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Row 9 has all the information, including two drop down lists and 6 cells with formulas.</p>
<p>The last row sums all the totals from the previous rows.</p>
<p>I would like to insert a row after row 9, that copies all the formulas and the format from row 9. After this, the last row should continue summing up the totals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>[EDIT]</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TasosK's Macro can be tested in the following worksheet:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/28708054/Macro%20to%20Insert%20New%20row%20with%20formulas%20and%20format.xlsm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/28708054/Macro%20to%20Insert%20New%20row%20with%20formulas%20and%20format.xlsm</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your help.</p>

            Press and hold the power button until the phone restarts, maybe ~30 seconds.<br />
If it restarts with the same symbols again, then the volume-up button is stuck. Take off the battery cover if it's removable, and inspect - or send it for repair.

            <p>Hi Heather,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft community and thanks for posting the question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand, flags for Outlook emails flickers between set and completed. I will help you with the issue:</p>
<p>However I need more details:</p>
<p>How is the email account setup (POP3/IMAP/MAPI or Exchange)?</p>
<p>Since when are you facing this issue, does the issue occur with particular type of emails or all emails?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provide more details to assist you better.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Aravinda,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The account is set up as a POP3.&nbsp; It occurs on whatever email is highlighted.&nbsp; The issue may not just be Outlook, however.&nbsp; When this is happening, I cannot go down to the toolbar and switch between programs.&nbsp; And I'm having keyboard issues as well (shift
 biutton acting as paste, etc).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, the issues happen immediately after start-up or opening the program and sometimes it works fine then starts acting up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue might occur if the language has been changed from English (US) to English (UK). I would suggest you to change it back to English (US). Refer to the section “Switch between input methods” in the following article and test the
 issue:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sorry for the delayed response. I understand that you were unable to access your account before and you want to check your previous passwords after changing it. Let me assist you on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's no option to see passwords you have used on your account before. I know how it feels thinking someone may have accessed your account. Since you were able to change your password, your account is&nbsp;now&nbsp;secure. For more information on how to keep your
 account secure, you may check this article: <span>

</p><p>This happened twice that my friend tried to sent me a video via Skype in a group chat like this:</p>

<p>But when I clicked on <strong><em>play</em></strong>, it re-directed me to the following website

<p>

<p>My Skype version is&nbsp;&nbsp;and I am using Windows 10.</p>

<p>Hello Beth,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to post here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It depends on your requirement.
</span><span>As </span><span>we all know,</span><span>
</span><span>the Office 365 Business Essential subscription only provides the online version Office suite. If you want to those 3 employees also use the desktop client of the Excel, Word and Outlook, the best way is that
</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/buy-licenses-for-your-office-365-for-business-subscription-36081d8d-b3fa-4948-8c34-e217bba825e1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">adding 3 Office 365 Business Premium licenses for them</span></span></a><span>
 in your tenant not purchasing 3 essiential accounts. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if the those 3 users only work with the online version office suite, the Office 365 Business Essential plan is enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the above information helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Right.&nbsp;We really should have the option to override this; as I'm sure that most users do watch their data limits.

<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>The full error message is:</p>
<p>"Error 1935. An error occured during installation of assembly component {63E949F6-03BC-5C40-A01F-C8B3B9A1E18E}. HRESULT: 0x800736FD"</p>
<p>Trying to install Office 2007 Ultimate purchased as Retail. I've tried disabling and enabling Microsoft .Net Framework&nbsp;3.5.1&nbsp;in Programs and Features. I've also uninstalled/downloaded/installed Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable (x64). Operating system
 is Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit. Currently in a clean boot with no non-microsoft processes/startup programs running.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your time toward getting Office installed.</p>

<p>The links provided didn't solve the issue. Also running the setup as Administrator resulted in the same error. Ultimately I created a new partition on the harddrive and installed a fresh copy of Windows 7, and then moved the user profiles over to the new
 installation.</p>
<p>An upgrade install may have fixed this issue, but for my situation a fresh install seemed like the better option.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2013 Apps Crash Internet Explorer in RDS Session - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mariolatragna  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 Apps Crash Internet Explorer in RDS Session</h2>
                    <p>I've just installed Office 2013 (32bit) on a Windows 2008 R2 RDS Server and enabled a few apps for users to test.&nbsp; (Bing Maps, Action Items, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a user tries to launch an app we get an Internet Explorer APPCRASH pop-up and the app won't launch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the default browser does nothing as the apps in Outlook will only launch IE, even though Chrome is set to the default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I've tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Repair Office.&nbsp; No change.</p>
<p>2. Downgrade from IE 11 to IE 10.&nbsp; No change.</p>
<p>3. Create a new profile for the user.&nbsp; No change.</p>
<p>4. Since Outlook was installed by an admin I added a non-functioning user to the Local Admin group and tested again.&nbsp; This time it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the same system I can launch OWA in IE (both 32 and 64bit) and the apps work without crashing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Application Event Log Error:</p>
<p>Faulting Module:&nbsp; iertutil.dll</p>
<p>Exception Code:&nbsp; 0xc0000005</p>
<p>Faulting Process id:&nbsp; 0x160c</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Office 15 Alerts:</p>
<p>App could not be started.</p>
<p>P3:&nbsp; 0x800706BA</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be nice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

            <p>I got it fixed, but I'm having a hard time remembering how I did it.&nbsp; Sorry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty sure I had to adjust the UAC settings.&nbsp; The previous admin had UAC totally disabled, but once I reset it it back to the default settings the apps worked.</p>

<h2>            Phone Lost, locked using Find My Phone options in Devices. Now the only option I have is to Remove the Device</h2>
                    <p>Hi There,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I lost my phone/it was taken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Find My Phone and the device location hadn't refreshed since I'd last had it, 1.5 hours before it went missing.</p>
<p>I tried ringing it through my Devices and refreshed the map 100s of times.</p>
<p>Then I locked it. It said it was unable to lock the phone but I'd be notified when it was done.</p>
<p>I changed all my passwords etc. but figured it may come back to me so didn't erase the phone.<br />
</p>
<p>It's been a day since I last checked and under my devices, I no longer have the find my phone option. Just the option to remove the device.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Does this mean the person who has the phone has reset it so it's no longer associated to my account?</strong></p>
<p><strong>How come I was never notified about the phone being locked? I was expecting this to happen once it was turned on.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming someone has the phone and something's changed in order for the Device Options to change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>

<p>
</p><p>If it is then get a recovery key NOW and save it incase you find your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not find it in a few days then disable your cell connection through your provider. If you find it then you can re-enable it again through your provider.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Transfer to a new Mac</h2>
                    This is pure unadulterated ****.  I can't do it via automation, via phone automation as I have to be transferred to the Mac section (phone) and then I'm on hold forever and no one answers.  All I want to be able to do is use it on my new replacement iMac!! 



I'm in Canada.   



What gives with Microsoft?  They say 1 license/device and then when you need to transfer they treat you like a nobody.  I paid for this product.  Has anyone got any suggestions at all on how to get MS to respond?  It's not like I'm pirating or mis-using their license.   



This is mind blowing.

            You need to find the folders referenced in the email message, right click on one and if Delete [foldername] is available, delete the folder. If its grayed out, you need to try the other folder. 
<br />
<br />I'm  seeing a lot of reports on this but can't repro. If you could explain your configuration a little better it might help me figure out what is going on so I can share it with the product team.

            Hello RoyFinlay, <br />
<br />
I understand that it is frustrating to receive this error notification email from Outlook: Folders in your mailbox have name conflicts
<br />
<br />
Luckily, it seems to be a technical problem with your IMAP client setup. Do you setup your Outlook email account on other devices?
<br />
<br />
The simplest solution is to stay with Outlook mail client on other devices to access your emails like Outlook for iOS and Outlook for Android.
<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you may consider setting up your email as POP3. (which is a radical idea to fix this issue, since POP3 downloads and deletes your email from server instead of syncing it like IMAP)

    <title>Freeform Shape Editing Changes the Shape Properties from Straight to - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Freeform Shape Editing Changes the Shape Properties from Straight to Curved</h2>
                    I use the INSERT&gt;&gt;SHAPES&gt;&gt;FREEFORM function a lot to outline areas on maps.&nbsp; On my machine, I can snap out multiple-point shapes anwhere between 3 and probably 100 points, all with each segment being straight.&nbsp; I move, add and delete lines just fine, again
 with each modification resulting/remaining as a straight line segment.&nbsp; But on my wife's (co-worker) machine, when she picks the shape and alters a point or line,&nbsp;it turns adjacent straight sections into curved sections for no reason.&nbsp; After 2-3 attempts,
 the shape is non-distinguishable it is so distorted.&nbsp; Why does it change the shape format without being prompted to???&nbsp; I cannot find a variable/setting that makes it do this and it is seriously affecting our productivity having to go back and redefine each
 line segment.&nbsp; Any ideas why this is doing this?&nbsp; We are both using PC-base gear from HP

 changes the Shape Properties from Straight to Curved.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Freeform shape in Office 2007 has both curved and straight segments. Ideally if you click on Vertix (Black dot) you will be able to change it straight

Check if are clicking on the black dot or white dot after clicking on edit points.</font></font></font></p>

            I am also having this same issue since Saturday afternoon. &nbsp;Mobile devices won't sync but the outlook.com webpage works fine. &nbsp;Microsoft also makes it near impossible to report the issue. &nbsp;I have deleted my email account from my phone and added it back
 a few times and still says unable to connect to server. &nbsp;Hopefully they fix it soon.
