<h2>            Foldabe keyboard messenger send button</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i just bought my microsoft foldable keyboard and opened up Messenger. The problem that I'm facing is that I can't send messages from my keyboard (using neither Enter nor Ctrl+Enter). Instead, I have to use the on-screen send button. The tablet is a Sony
 Xpoeria Z4 running Android 5.0.2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/ed997492-7121-426c-85ab-57504b37207c" title="AlvarVirkus">
AlvarVirkus</a>. Thank you for posting on the community. It could be a compatibility issue between the keyboard and the phone.&nbsp;To confirm,&nbsp;we'd recommend contacting your local phone manufacturer for assistance and more info&nbsp;regarding this matter. We look forward
 to your reply.

<h2>            Auto answer with Video on Fire 7 Tablet</h2>
                    <p>I have both a Fire Tablet and an Android I am trying to set it up so I can Video call my mom who is in a disability home with Dementia, I have previously had a Tablet with Skype on it where when I called it used to Autoanswer and I could see her on my mobile,
 that tablet since has died and I have tried to re-create this set-up on these other devices but the option doesn't seem to exist anymore whereby I can get Skype to auto answer but there has to be some user intervention in order to show the video from my mom's
 end to my mobile (which never used to be the case).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a setting or a way to get this to work only I now live quite far and I cannot communicate with my mom via video chat, I am trying to get this completely 100% automated as she cannot do anything for herself these days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2010 contact group not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rachel.boettner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 contact group not working</h2>
                    <p>I'm a delegate with full permissions for my boss' Outlook contacts. He's having me create a distribution list/contact group with about 200 people for a monthly email. When I&nbsp;first tried&nbsp;to do so, every thing&nbsp;worked fine, I added all the names, saved and
 closed, and&nbsp;was able to immediately pull it up and view all 200 contacts. </p>
<p>However, with about an hour, none of the contacts remained on the list. It was empty. I thought I had simply forgotten to save, so I redid the list, added all 200 contacts, saved and closed. Again, I was able to pull it back up immediately and everything
 was fine. However, later on when I checked on it, there were only about 20-30 contacts showing on the list. At that point, a coworker who also has full delegate access tried to add contacts on her computer; the results showed up about 20 minutes later but
 not immediately. That contact has remained on the list however. I added another six contacts on Friday and they are still present today (Monday).</p>
<p>My questions are: is there a max # of contacts allowed for a contact group? Do I need to take extra steps to save the changes I make since I'm a delegate? Why is the problem not consistant?</p>

            Hi EUGENWILL
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. First you will need to unblock and then delete it.
<br />
<br />Open Skype application &gt; Click 3 dots on above &gt; Settings &gt; Blocked contacts &gt; Just put your pointer here and unblock will appear. Now unblock it. 
<br />
<br />After unblocking - Right click on the contact / conversation &gt; View profile &gt; Scroll down &gt; Remove from Contact list
<br />
<br />If you still face a problem, you can delete a contact through Web Skype as well. - Can you login to Web Skype (only Edge/Chrome browsers) and follow the above steps.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>Hi Cliff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your quick response!</p>
<p>It seems I found the solution on my own right now:</p>
<p>I recognized my OneDrive was freezed as it was not used for a long period - Login to OneDrive and an unfreeze solved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BR, Andreas</p>

<p>
</p><p>Micah:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought Office 2016 to specifically interact with another program (Solidworks 2017) for report generation in Word and Excel. So far I've tried the Excel 2016 and get the following two messages:</p>
<p>Message 1:</p>
<p>Excel cannot open the file 'Gearbox_Study1.xlsx' because the file format or file extension is not valid. Verify that the file has not been corrupted and that the file extension matches the format of the file.</p>
<p>Message 2:</p>
<p>The converter failed to open the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I got Message 1, I changed the format of the saved file to Gearbox_Study1.xls and was able to open the file manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading various message board replies I've gone into the following and set per the message (BTW this was from https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_excel-mso_win10/2016-excel-wont-open-xlsx-files-but-xls-files-are/129925ca-f6c2-44e9-a840-b4ceed639371):</p>
<p>File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; File Block Settings &gt; Uncheck all options
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not had a chance to try the Word report export from Solidworks yet but will shortly - should I expect a similar problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, we bought this specific version because Solidworks indicated it would work with this version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your soonest reply.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Please provide an address I can send a Powerpoint presentation to. I've captured all the dialogue boxes and messages after trying all the assorted "fixes" - none have worked, I still can't doubleclick and open an *.xlsx or drag and drop and *.xlsx file and
 have it open. If I rename to *.xls it opens every way imaginable.</p>

            <p>Hi Rusty,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that you're having problems making Excel interact with your third party program. We would like to know if you are experiencing the same issue opening different .xlsx format. Also, have you checked if your third party program is compatible with
 .xlsx files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted and we'll be willing to provide further help.</p>

<h3> saltyshipwreck  say:</h3>
<h2>             Office Professional Plus 2010 v Office Enterprise 2007</h2>
                    I have just purchased Office Professional Plus 2010 via the HUP; I have two questions:<br />
1. I also have Visio 2010 pre -release installed currently, the above installation rejected installation until I delete this programme, is this correct?<br />
2. Is the above backward compatible with Office Enterprise 2007? partiucularly with email? will I be able to keep my current 'My Folders' and Contacts lists? I have two other User Accounts on my system so I need to be sure what will happen if I delete Visio
 2010 and install Office Proffessional Plus 2010?

<p>Well I bit the bullet and went for it today, deleted the Visio Beta and activated the Outlook Proffesional Plus. It took about ten minutes in all, once I put in the Product Key it gave me the option to Upgrade or Customise. I chose Upgraded and away it went.
 Once completed and rebooted, I checked all three User Accounts, all data;files and email files/contacts/diary etc all intact, re-selected Outloook as default email setting, all files migrated. Checked random&nbsp; existing Word/Excel files&nbsp;; all okay and Bob's
 your Uncle! perfecto!</p>
<p>Many thanks to Ron and Robert above for the reassurance.</p>

<br />What happens if you open the document with the Shift key down?
<br />
<br />If the document is either a .doc or .docm format document, what happens if you save it as a .docx format document?
<br />
<br />Was the document created in a Windows version of Word?
<br />

<h2>            I have ten slides with content on them.  In slide sorter view only two slides show content. The rest are blank.  What is wrong&#63;</h2>
                    Using PowerPoint 2011 for Mac. &nbsp;I have ten slides with content on them. &nbsp;In slide sorter view and side slide viewer only two slides show content. The rest are blank. &nbsp;I can see the content on the main screen for these pages, but not in the slide viewers.
 &nbsp;It was fine when I opened the project before. &nbsp;What is wrong? &nbsp;

            <p>Another thing to check:&nbsp; this is an odd one that sometimes bites people ... have you somehow created some/most of your slides while in master view (which would give you lots of slide masters but not slides).&nbsp; It wouldn't necessarily create blank slides,
 but it might, depending on a couple other factors.</p>
<p>If your slides appear when you&nbsp;choose View | Master | Slide Master but not when you choose View | Normal or View | Slide Sorter, then we may have a "Bingo".</p>

            <p>Does it happen with a particular PowerPoint file or it does the same with all the PowerPoint files?</p>
<p>Check if the Computer is up to date with the latest updates.</p>
<p>To Launch the Microsoft Auto updater, you can open any Office application and select ‘Check for Updates’ under Help in the Menu bar.</p>
<p>If the issue occurs even after the updates are installed, try to open the same file on a new user account and check if it opens in there.</p>

<h2>            Error code&#58; 0xE402005F When Migrating OneNote</h2>
                    <p>I am having a hard time getting several notebooks to sync after moving them to ONB. &nbsp;I have migrated my OneNote notebooks from being stored locally on my computer to ONB. &nbsp;Most of them moved fine. &nbsp;But 8 of them didn't and won't sync. &nbsp;Ending up with a "We're
 sorry, something went wrong during sync. We'll try again later. (Error code: 0xE402005F)" in the sync status and in the notebook I get the "We couldn't open this section." and a nice light gray area where some of the 30GB of OneNote data used to be. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What I have tried:</strong> (none of these worked obviously)</p>
<ol>
<li>Close/reopen</li><li>Close/reopen in OneNote online - same error "We couldn't open this section."</li><li>Using a backup copy, open each one in OneNote to restore it, then try to move it and sync &nbsp;- same results.</li><li>Move it - not share it, and point it to the local folder where my OneNote notebooks are stored and let that sync. This ended up producing a dialog box every 15 seconds or so, notifying me it was syncing and taking focus away from the window I was actually
 working with.</li><li>Export the notebook, copy it to ONB/SharePoint Online folder, then open it from OneNote using File - Open.</li><li>Screaming at my cat.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I have about 30GB of notes, a lot of information I have collected over the years. &nbsp;I moved these specifically because I had an issue recently with data loss. &nbsp;Now it seems that several of my notebooks are corrupted, possibly their backup copies as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA for any assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update</strong>: If I tell it to move the notebook back locally, it opens just fine. &nbsp;The sections are out of order but other than that they are all still there from what I can tell. This still doesn't help me with my ultimate goal of getting them
 into ONB so I don't have to back them up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Update 2</strong>: I guess I spoke too soon. &nbsp;Now I get a different error when they try to sync.
</p>
<p>"It looks like this isn't a valid OneNote section file. It could be a different file type that's been renamed with a .one extension. (Error code: 0xE00000C8)"</p>

            As you've mentioned only Word and Excel in your description, it may be inferred that you are speaking of Office 2010 Starter edition. If this is the case, you need to disconnect from the internet and run
<i>Repair</i>&nbsp;from the Control Panel's <i>Programs</i>&nbsp;applet on your Office 2010 Starter installation. This should remove the necessity for a live internet connection during the use of Word and Excel 2010 Starter. See&nbsp;the&nbsp;following thread from Microsoft Office

    <title>Can&#39;t Delete Duplicate Calendars - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jpr-iii  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Delete Duplicate Calendars</h2>
                    
<p>Have used Mobile Me to sync calendar between pc and mac for one year with no problem.&nbsp; Suddenly, PC has duplicate calendars. Names are "_ModCal????.Calendar in Personal Folders"&nbsp; (eg _ModCal1at11.Calendar in Personal Folders).</p>
<p>I have run office Diagnostics tool and everything came back okay.&nbsp; I am running XP and Office 2007.</p>
<p>I right click on the name of a calendar and select delete.&nbsp; I get the following message.</p>
<p>"Cannot delete this folder.&nbsp; Right-Click the folder and then click properties to check your permissions for the folder.&nbsp; See the folder owner of your adminstrator to change your permissions.&nbsp; The folder is full."&nbsp; (This is a useless suggestion.)</p>
<p>I also renamed Outlook.pst to Outlook.old and let Outlook give me a new pst file.&nbsp; The calendars are still there.</p>
<p>I would sure appreciate some help getting rid of them.</p>

<p>Never manipulate a PST that is currently a part of a mail profile.&nbsp; You can damage the profile.</p>
<p>Try starting Outlook once with the /resetfolders command switch.&nbsp; Press WinKey+R (or click Start&gt;Run) and in the Open field, enter</p>
<p>outlook.exe /resetfolders</p>
<p>Be sure to include the space.&nbsp; Press Enter.&nbsp; Does that help?</p>

            When I open the excel program and instead of creating a new one from scratch I downloaded a pre-made one that I found in the search for online templates which was called&nbsp;Employee&nbsp;Absence Schedule.&nbsp;I am part of a fire department and&nbsp;trying to change the
 wording from a&nbsp;absence schedule to a vehicle assignment and day off scheduling type template for each month of the year.&nbsp; In the row that says absence type key I am trying to change the wording and add some additional keys and it will not let me change or
 add the wording, change the color, etc. etc.&nbsp;Someone mentioned that the formulas may be locked or hidden?&nbsp; I am not an excel master at all, in fact I would say just a basic user so I am not sure what to do to make these changes happen.

<p>No. There are just a few formulas in that file, none of them is hidden or locked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess you have a different security issue: Close all applications, then right-click the file and choose Properties:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6de2ac1e-f7f2-4ebd-b9a6-893412e3b16f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6de2ac1e-f7f2-4ebd-b9a6-893412e3b16f" /></a></p>
<p>I guess you have the security note at the bottom!? Click Unblock, Apply, Ok. Then right-click the file and choose Open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you should be able to modify the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, the colors in C7:AG11 are controlled by a conditional formatting, tab Home\button Conditional Formatting\Manage rules...</p>

</p><p>The <strong>Move to</strong> option will be in the main banner <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">if you are using Outlook Mail</span></strong> . See this

this one</a> which will show the&nbsp;location of the <strong>Move to.</strong>&nbsp; You mention "Hotmail".&nbsp; To the best of my recollection Hotmail has migrated into Outlook.&nbsp; Although I had Hotmail a month or so ago, to be honest with you, I can not recall any procedure
 in the old Hotmail which performed moving items from the deleted items, unless it was performed by a
<strong>right-click</strong> and then a <strong>contents menu</strong>.&nbsp; I'm sorry; I just do not remember.</p>

            Did you find a solution. I have the same issue. I was deleting a group of selected emails and the screen froze. When I hit delete again, it deleted all the emails in my inbox. There are thousands of them and I need to get them back into my inbox.
<p>
</p><p>When I select 1 email or 1 page , I can see the "move to" option when I right click but when I select everything in the folder, the "move to" option from the top banner and right click disappears. I tried ragging and dropping but that doesn't work. I am
 using the new outlook (black logo). Please help!</p>

<h2>            How to create pie of pie chart&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I'm new to creating pie of pie chart. Would like to know how to create. I have the following data:</p>
<p>AA = 50<br />
BB = 20<br />
CC = 90 (this is the sum of three items&nbsp;under CC)<br />
&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp;Apple = 30<br />
&nbsp; -&gt; Orange = 40<br />
&nbsp; -&gt; Lemon = 20</p>
<p>I have tried to create the chart but it kept showing me that 'Apple, Orange and Lemon' (secondary chart) is&nbsp;related to 'Others' (in the main chart - this is created by excel).</p>
<p>How do show that 'Apple, Orange and Lemon' (secondary chart) relate to 'CC' in the main chart?</p>
<p>Thank You very much!</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Jacqueline Neo</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Format the series and on the Options tab set the last 3 items to be contained in the secondary pie.</p>
<p>The chart will automatically name the summary slice Others rather than CC. If you are displaying datalabels with Category you can manually edit the label.</p>

    <title>Refused repair under warranty - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Refused repair under warranty</h2>
                    
<div>I sent my N95 to Anovo and completing the form on Nokia's website. The volume control buttons on the side are no longer working because the microswitches have broken off the main board. It appears that this is a common problem.<br />
<br />
Anyway I received my phone back and it has been returned unrepaired because of liquid damage. My phone has at no time ever had any form of liquid ingress whatsoever. A document came back from a company called Regeneresis which says it has been deemed Beyond
 Economical Repair (B.E.R) due to Liquid Damage.<br />
<br />
This seems complete nonsense to me - the fault could have not in any way been caused by liquid damage. The phone is functioning and looks cosmetically fine.<br />
<br />
Anyway I called Nokia Customer Care this morning and they have raised a case to investigate and have arranged a call back which will be tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Anyone got any suggestions please?<br />
<br />
Many thanks.</div>

<p>There are many causes of water ingress and often it causes no effect on performance. &nbsp;The problem is that if they find any evidence of it during a repair then it instantly voids your warranty. &nbsp;All electronic manufacturer's act in this way, not just nokia
 or it's 3rd party repair agents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most common cause of water ingress is using the phone in the rain or the phone getting damp in a pocket whilst it's raining. &nbsp;Other causes are prolonged exposure to steam (i.e. left in a bathroom&nbsp;whilst you shower or a kitchen). &nbsp;Sweat is also a know
 cause if the phone has been in a pocket against your skin and you have sweated heavily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately all you can do is carry on with your complaint to Anovo and possibly seeking legal advice. &nbsp;As it stands you are in a your word against their evidence situation. You also have to remember that they have no reason to lie to you at all so your
 phone most likely does have evidence of water damage.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply Psychomania. Nokia Customer Services have called me back but they weren't very helpful. They just said there is nothing they can do and gave me the address for their complaints department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was going to take it to a Nokia Service Centre (CPW) but was concerned that the warranty have been voided by Anovo / Regeneresis on the Nokia database. So I'm going to write to them.</p>
<p><br />
It seems to me that "liquid damage" is a favourite way of getting out of honouring the warranty. But what annoys me is that I've owned about ten Nokia phones over the last 12 years and this is the first time I have had to have one repaired under the warranty
 and they have refused. What annoys me is the actual problem is a common one and just requires new microswitches soldering on. The parts cost pennies and I doubt the job takes any longer than 20-30 minutes in total.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it feels like Nokia are just making my life difficult. The microswitches have absolutely nothing to do liquid damage anyway. Also Regeneresis took the liberty of upgrading the firmware on my phone even though it was out of warranty - why? They also completely
 removed both of the microswitches so it know looks like I have tampered with it. I thought I made save myself some time and hassle by paying to get it repaired but I've got 3 quotes now</p>
<p>ranging from £45-50 which I think is ridiculous......</p>
<p>I wonder if Nokia would even defend the claim if I took them to the small claims court. Anyone ideas?</p>

<p>You wouldn't stand a chance taking nokia to the small claims court as it's not them that have worked on or damaged your phone. You may stand a chance if you take it's 3rd party repair agents to court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They have no reason to get out of honouring the warranty as the repair agents get paid for every unit fixed.&nbsp; They gain nothing by saying that it's water damaged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do feel that it's wrong that they returned it to you in the state that they did. There have been a lot of horror stories about anovo's quality control in the past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck with your legal action.</p>

Surely I would have to take Nokia to the small claims court because my warranty is with them and its legal contract with them. Nokia have appointed Anovo / Regeneresis as a 3rd party agent but I do not have any legally binding agreements with them. I will need
 to check to verify this but it seems to me that ultimately Nokia are responsible for the consequences of Anovo when they are acting as repair agents on their behalf.</p>

<p>@ breeder,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For what it is worth, here in Australia, Nokia and it's service agents use "water ingress" as a favourite excuse to get out of repairing phones under warranty. Unfortunately Nokia and it's service agents have been informed by the consumer affairs authorities
 in Australia that they cannot use "water ingress" as an excuse to not repair the phone. There is a thing in Australia called a "statutory warranty" which apparently covers this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not know which country you are in but perhaps you could check with the government authorities in your country. I do know that there have been thousands of complaints in this country to the government authorities about Nokia and it's attitude towards
 it's customers. I believe the ACCC and the telecommunications ombudsman have taken this matter up with Nokia.</p>

<p>Hi Bazyeo,</p>
<p><br />
Many thanks - I'm from the UK. Yes it appears that "water ingress" is also a favourite excuse to not honouring the warranty here too. I've just been made aware that there is a little white label in the battery compartment of the N95 which is a water ingress
 indicator. It changes colour to red if there has been water damage. However, mine is completely white!</p>
<p><br />
I'm going to be writing to Nokia's Complaint's Dept and if they still refuse to repair it I will make a formal complaint to my local Trading Standards / Consumer Protection office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is just one of the ways of detecting moisture, it doesn't always turn pink. That labels main purpose is for detecting total immersion in water. For example if you spill liquid over the keypad it can cause the damage but the liquid doesn't reach the
 back of the phone. There are other internal indicators that show this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many people do claim that "water ingress" is used as an excuse not to honour the warranty. In reality it's usually the case that the user cannot accept that they've caused damage to their own phone. I do not know if bazyeo's claims above are true or not
 as they are unsubstantiated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an example a friend of mine tried to get their phone repaired by vodafone after it stopped working correctly and it was returned unrepaired because of "water ingress".&nbsp; They argued with voda and eventually voda sent photographic proof of the damage with
 a note saying that it was most likely coffee.&nbsp; My friend then suddenly remembered that they had spilt coffee over it a few months before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you asked if they have any photographic evidence to back up their claim? This will help you when you visit trading standards.&nbsp; If they can prove it you don't have a leg to stand on in court, if they can't then you may get lucky.</p>

<p>@ pyschomania</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My claims are true. Over the past two/three years talk back radio has been flooded with complaints about phone manufacturers refusing to repair a device because of water ingress. Both the head and relavant minister of the Office of Consumer Affairs in my
 state as well as the head of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission have been on both radio and television advising consumers that phone manufacturers can not use water ingress as an excuse to avoid repairing a device under warranty. I also believe
 that the relevant authorities have had discussions with the manufacturers/agents advising them of their obligations under the "Trade Practices Act" I also believe that legal action by the ACCC has been threatened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above is fact. Full stop. End of story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also Eldar from Mobile review did an experiment with several Nokia 5800 xm phones whereby the phones were placed in a humid environment. After less than two weeks the phones were corroded inside as a result of (1) the humidity and (2) the crappey materials
 used by Nokia. So because a phone is corroded does not mean it suffered water ingress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eldars article is on the Mobile Review website.</p>

<p>Fair enough, thats your view as I have no idea what has been said in the Australian media as you have provided no links to back up your "facts", but it will not help this user in the UK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the 5800 that article (which I read a while ago and have been a victim of) related to one part in the phone (the earpiece) which nokia is aware of and will replace under warranty without claiming water ingress. All authorised service personal have
 been made aware of it but it is irrelevant to this thread as it relates to the N95, not 5800.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All he/she can do now is complain to the relevant people and seek legal advice. Nothing can be done here to help with this case. No one from nokia is going to step in here to resolve this issue or admit to any misuse of "water ingress" by it's repair agents.</p>

            Hi Ravi,<br />
<br />
If you are referring to “<em>error (0x800CC1A): Your server does not support the connection encryption type you have specified</em>”, then the issue is most likely to lie with the ISP server side. Therefore, I would suggest you please contact your ISP to get
 your account information <em>(such as Port settings and the address of your Incoming/Outgoing mail server)</em> or contact your email account administrator to get the exact information and further assistance.<br />
<br />
Your time and understanding will be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Shyamal

<h2>            Unable to access remote desktop connection</h2>
                    <p>I have tried different ways to access remote desktop settings, and none have worked out for me,</p>
<p>I have tried going through Systems, Control Panel, Advanced Settings Options, then Remote, but my Remote Assistance only has one options, which is 'allow remote assistance connection to this computer". I've also tried to change the settings. on my laptop
 it only has RemoteApp and Desktop Connections, so i'm not quite sure I actually have it on my Laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've honestly run out of options on how to access this on my computer.</p>

            <p>Excuse me, but I'm not really sure what problem you are having, so I'll give ya some general information about Remote Assistance/Remote Desktop Connection. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the system you want to allow Remote Assistance, right click the Start button and click System. &nbsp;Click Advanced system settings. &nbsp;Click the Remote tab. &nbsp;Check "Allow Remote Assistance connections on this computer" to activate. &nbsp;Click Advanced to change
 options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the system you want to access a remote system from, click the start button. &nbsp;Click All apps. &nbsp;Click Windows Accessories. &nbsp;Click Remote Desktop Connection. &nbsp;You will need to enter the name of the system you are try to take control of and you will need
 to enter login credentials when you connect. &nbsp;The user you select to access as will need to be a user on the remote system and that user will have to have permission to access the system remotely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a good one!</p>
