            <p>If you are logged in with a temporary profile it's because your regular user profile has become unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A temporary profile is just that - it only lasts for the current session. As soon as you sign out or shut down Windows, everything in the account is lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can determine how your regular user account became unusable, you can try to fix the problem(s). Otherwise, the easiest thing to do is to create a new user account. Once created, you can move your user data (documents, pictures, email, bookmarks, etc.)
 from the old user account to the new user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10, <em>syncing</em> means that all your devices that run Windows 10 look and work the same. You can do that, if you want, by signing in to a Microsoft account on all your devices. But that's not required to use Windows 10.</p>

            <p>The internet is your best source of information for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?complete=0&amp;hl=en&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=hp&amp;q=how+to+create+a+user+account+in+windows+10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">how to create a user account in Windows 10</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just bear in mind that you need to be signed in to a user account with Administrator permissions in order to create a new user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, to avoid confusion, I'll explain that a user account can be either a <em>
local account</em> or a <em>Microsoft account</em>. A local account exists only on the computer where it's created, so it can only be used on that computer. A Microsoft account exists in the cloud, so it can be used on any computer or mobile device (tablet,
 phone) as long as you're signed in to your Microsoft account on that computer or device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While there are certain advantages to a Microsoft account, some people are uncomfortable with the idea of storing so much of their personal data on Microsoft's servers. It's a matter of choice.</p>

<h2>            I&#39;ve been waiting for at least 10 minutes now for a call from Microsoft when the expected wait time was 2 minutes.</h2>
                    <p>What's going on!?!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The chat support was next to useless -- the member of 'chat staff' knew just as much as I did and was completely clueless about my problem -- tried to create small talk like 'How are you doing?' -- I'm not doing well obviously as you're delaying my problem
 -- I do not have time to be pissing about with someone who doesn't know sh** about technology.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I thought I'd give the call a go. But I've been waiting for far too long for a call which should have been coming through in 2 mins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHAT'S GOING ON MICROSOFT???&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh and I don't know which category to put this in as they only provide you with hopeless options for this sort of post.</p>

<p>No, you cannot be banned for single player. You MIGHT get profile banned for modding/system tampering if caught. But glitching you cannot get Profile banned but R* can IP ban you online if they want for glitching. That is if they want actually want to.</p>

    <title>Audio&#47;Microphone Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> liger rlder  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio&#47;Microphone Issues</h2>
                    I am an owner of a turtle beach headset, I bought the xbox one knowing full well it would not be compatible til a later date. However, I now have tons of chat issues. 1) The kinect microphone does not work in games unless in party. 2) While in party using
 the connect mic as opposed to default headset mic, the in game audio then drops to ridiculously low quality and volume levels with no way of adjusting it. 3) Lack of audio settings. Going from point 2, I should be able to lower voice sounds and increase in
 game audio sounds so that I can actually use my kinect mic while still hearing in game audio clearly, but not the case. Side notes. - I play on a monitor that does not have speakers, therefore I need my turtle beach headset for in game audio, but I can't wear
 two headsets at once, so I figure hey, the xbox 360 was able to play voice audio through headsets as well as speakers at the same time, why shouldn't the xbox one be able to? But no. Sadly it hasn't been implemented to my knowle

<p>@Mister Urkel - same issue here, here is my setup.</p>
<p>I am using a Tritton Gears of War 5.1 Surround headset. The mic cable on this was designed to work on Xbox 360, so the microphone isn't plugged in at all. Which is good, because then there's no way for the headset to interfere with the Kinect.</p>
<p>The headset is plugged in to the Optical Out on the back of the Xbox One. The Mic Cable doesn't interact with the system at all, it actually connects to a little volume control which is about halfway between the headset and the mixer box. So, the mic cable
 isn't plugged in at all.</p>
<p>Now, with the "Use Kinect for Chat" option turned on, when I go into CoD Ghosts multiplayer, the Kinect Mic does not work. I can issue Voice Commands and participate in Party Chat, however the regular "in-game voice" does not work. So, if I'm just talking
 to people in a free-for-all match, they don't hear me (also, there is no Microphone icon next to my name in the lobby.) If I plug in my wired Xbox Headset that came with the One, I can be heard, but the audio goes to the Xbox headset, so I can't hear other
 voices in my headphones anymore.</p>

<p>So, I've seen a lot of questions about the netsvcs using a lot of cpu, but my cpu is fine.&nbsp; It's staying between 1% and 5%.&nbsp; It's my network utilization that's being affected by it.&nbsp; For some reason, it's running between 3.5 and 7%, which though it may not
 seem like much, it just about slows my connection to a crawl, as well as all the other users on my wireless network.</p>
<p>Not exactly sure what other information to include, but here's some brief system specs:</p>
<p>Win7 home premium 64bit</p>
<p>AMD Phenom II X4 945 processor (4 cpus) 3.0 GHz</p>
<p>8192 MB ram</p>

<h2>            Win32 error&#58; -2147418113</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a Dymo LabelWriter 450 Turbo and use it attached to my windows 10 laptop.&nbsp; It worked beautifully for quite some time and suddenly&nbsp;the Dymo app&nbsp;couldn't print.&nbsp; Following Dymo's written instructions (for windows 8) I deleted all references to
 Dymo and LP Sanford that I could find.&nbsp; By doing this and then downloading the latest version of the app, everything would be well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried doing all this several times.&nbsp; Even writing back to Dymo that their instructions make references to things I just can't find in windows 10.&nbsp; Didn't seem to compute with them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Diligent searching for all relevant files and deletion of same followed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloaded the latest version of the Dymo app, again.&nbsp; The app then said I had to download the printer drivers for my printer.&nbsp; This I have done and I still can't print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the above error message and cannot find a fix on the message boards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a terrific printer and label making system.</p>

            <p>Hi Robyn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If updating the driver didn't work, you can try reinstalling your driver. To do so,
<span><span>open<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><strong>Device Manager</strong></span></span><span><span>, right-click the name of the device, and select<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><strong>Uninstall</strong></span></span><span><span>. Restart
 your <strong>PC</strong> and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver. </span>
</span>Also, reinstalling your driver didn't work, we recommend you to use the <strong>
Printer Troubleshooter</strong>. You can download Printer Troubleshooter on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/bdff0c68-6204-6025-dcc1-3aefaa14ab40/fix-printer-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing, <strong>error code -214741811</strong><strong>3</strong> corresponds to an<strong> HRESULT of E_UNEXPECTED</strong>. If the above methods did not fix your issue, you may need to identify the function on the app that causes this error which
 needs a highly technical approach. Meaning, your Application has some functions that causes this error and your app needs to be updated or fixed by its developer.<br />
</p>
<p>Let us know how these fixes go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>Standard user account able to install programs without admin - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kristofferfh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Standard user account able to install programs without admin</h2>
                    I have two accounts on my Windows 8 machine, one admin (with password) and one standard user with no password. I recently noticed that while logged in only on the standard user I could download the install file for firefox, nothing wrong with that.<br />
<br />
However I could also start it and install the application. I did this by starting the install app, a dialogue popped up asking me for admin password however this dialogue had a regular windows frame with an "X" to close it in top right. By simply closing the
 dialogue the install file would run and install firefox, no password required.<br />
<br />
This seems very odd to me and also circumvents the main reason why I made a standard user account, to have control of what is installed.<br />
<br />
I tried to do the same thing with a more "obscure" program and found that this time instead of the old windows framed dialogue I was now presented with a windows 8 looking blue strip across the screen again asking me to enter admin info but with no "X" button.
 So perhaps because firefox was recognized as "safe" by windows I got a different dialogue, still seems odd though.<br />
<br />
So to question,<br />
Can I set it up so that the standard user can not install any program, regardless of what windows think is secure?<br />

            <p>Hi Kristoffer, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Thank you for your post and giving us an opportunity to assist you.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I understand that you want to completely block a user from installing programs while logged onto a standard account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A user logged into a standard account will be allowed to install programs that do not affect other user accounts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>With the Firefox example, if the password was entered instead of clicking the X, the program would've installed in the Program Files folder. Since you did not enter the password, it would be installed in a local folder that is accessible only from the
 standard account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In the second instance, the "obscure" program's installer would only have access to the Program Files folder and since the password was not entered, it did not install.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You will not be able to set the standard account to block all programs from installing.</div>
<div>For information on account types.<br />

            This is lame. You should have the ability to simply block programs from installing on a standard user account. why would MS take abilities away that you had in windows 7. Program installation prevention is a great way to maintain stability.

<p>I had this same issue.&nbsp; What I found was I purchased the game and loaded it onto their computers under my account, but my kids where playing the game under their accounts.&nbsp; What I had to do to solve this was log into the Microsoft store and sign off of my
 account and they signed into their accounts and purchased the game again under their accounts - I know it is a bummer to have to purchase it again...&nbsp; But this fixed the problem.&nbsp; The easiest way to see if this is the issue is to have them log into their Xbox
 live account and look at the PC games they have purchased and you will notice Minecraft is missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once they purchase their own copy under their own accounts the coins will show up when they log into the store and click on the coins.&nbsp; They will just have to click on the option that comes up to complete past transactions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>I have also tried updating drivers (os says drivers are up to date), as stated earlier bios is up to date,&nbsp; &nbsp;adjusted ram clock, i have attempted to run the system w/o IDE disc drives, only one HDD.</p>
<p>What i am getting is the following errors all still occurring:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Windows media player: "server execution failed" &nbsp;these require a system reboot</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;The (way too common on this forum) "not responging error" with any and all actions to include opening file folders, start menu, Library searches, etc.<strong>&nbsp;If you can name it, the system hangs doing it!!!</strong><strong> sometimes for MINUTES (with
 this cpu and ram combo.... ARE YOU KIDDING ME!)</strong></p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Video playback is slow, hangs and when attempting to fastforward, audio will play while video is frozen</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Control+Alt+Delete "the logon process was unable to display security and logon options when CTRL+ALT+DELETE was pressed.If the Operating System does not respond press ESC or restart the computer by the power switch In windows 7." &nbsp;OR system hangs when
 ctrl+alt+delete is pressed.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;The progress bar is RIDICULOUSLY SLOW when displaying files in a folder or drive. &nbsp;this may take upwards of 30 seconds or more to open a folder (like I said, common windows tasks)</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;Error messages DO APPEAR IN SAFE MODE!</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;Reboots fail, even when trying to end safe mode and reboot, system takes forever like a program is not responging or hanging when asked to stop.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;I ran a boot time virus scan with avast and found NO infection.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;I have no, yes I did say NO programs installed on that machine other than windows 7.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;I assumed it was a problem with the 64bit OS's ability to allocate ram, but the 32 bit version is still causing issue. &nbsp;I am leaning towards an I/O problem with the os (unable to process multiple requests or something????)</p>
<p>I have a laptop with a single core 2GHz cpu, 4 gigs of ram and it is 10 times faster with start up/ shut down, and normal windows tasks. &nbsp;The laptop is running 64bit windows 7, avast, zonealarm, &nbsp;bluetooth....... WTF?!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have read through several posts in this forum where the MS engineers were not responding. &nbsp;I know there is a lot going on on this site but look at how much faith and money I have invested in your product with multiple os's. &nbsp;Can someone please make an
 attempt at answering this problem? &nbsp;If you need more info, I will provide it. &nbsp;These problems are very common all over this board, but VERY prevalent on faster systems. &nbsp;Please help.</p>

<p>Note: If you are OverClocking or use any automatic overclocking or power saving BIOS features,<br />
start out by disabling them: Intel EIST, Turbo Mode, Cool and Quite&nbsp; <br />
and drop back to the stock speed as a starting point.</p>
<p>Disconnect any other internal hard drives and external USB devices.<br />
Check for any loose hard drive power or SATA cables, Graphics card or other power cables.</p>
<p>First try running Memtest86+:&nbsp; This runs from a boot disk or CD and should eliminate or<br />
confirm if your one or more of your memory sticks are bad or the SPD values in the BIOS are correct.<br />
Let it run for as long as you can: 2,4,6,8 or more hours (at least 3 full passes), if no errors by then your ram is OK.<br />

<h2>            Razer Atrox joystick LT RT problems</h2>
                    
<p>I am a proud owner of the Razer Atrox joystick for the Xbox One. It works absolutely great with Killer Instinct. But everything else outside of this game, LT and RT buttons do not work. That means I can't use it in messaging, or punching in my preferred
 passkey. Can we get this fix?&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the the LT &amp; RT buttons work on the official Xbox One controller and not the Razer Atrox in the same situation then you will probably need to contact Razer directly as this joystick does not appear to be an officially approved MS accessory.</p>

    <title>Windows popping noise that appears only if a program that requires - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sharkbowman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows popping noise that appears only if a program that requires sound isn&#39;t on.</h2>
                    <p>I just got this problem today. It appears when I don't have any program on that requires sound. The problem is a popping noise that appears when I am in windows explore and clicking through files, the sound that triggers when opening a folder sort of cuts
 off and makes a popping noise. It doesn't appear when I am running a game such as counter strike or a program such as FL studio. After closing one of those programs I will hear a small click like something turned off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also updated my realtek drivers today manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 not recognizing an .exe file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> preschuck  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 not recognizing an .exe file</h2>
                    I recently bought Grand Theft Auto 5 from the Rockstar store and downloaded the installer from the Social Club website. Upon finishing the download, the file will not have any extension on it, and when trying to open it, asks we what program I would like
 to use, even though this should be an executable. I've already ran a clean boot, Malwarebytes, Super-Antispyware, and the Microsoft scanner, without any results. I haven't seen any other players with this same problem, and am getting kind of desperate. Please
 help!&nbsp;Thanks.

            Then you need to contact Rockstar to find out what is happening. If it has no extension it would indicate the file is wrong in some way. Download is unlikely to truncate the file name if complete. Even a partial download has an extension.&nbsp;

<p>Verse Software is just a publisher of a third party app (that probably is just a web wrapper for the website). how did you come to the conclusion that that is the app used by Jules?</p>

<h2>            My Xbox Gamepass is overdue and so, suspended. Will it continue to rack up debt if it is suspended&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, I recently forgot to cancel my Xbox Gamepass re occuring bill. It is suspended because of the overdue. Will it keep adding on £7.99 every month or will it stay frozen until i am able to pay it again? It says it's suspended.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>No other apps have failed to work since upgrading to Windows 10 and the front facing camera is working perfectly. The problem I have is that there is no longer an option to use the rear facing camera! Prior to Windows 10 it took sharp, clear photos.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for keeping us posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your patience on this issue. I would like to assist you with further information from here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the imaging device is not working just after the Windows 10 upgrade. The most effective solution is to re-install the relevant drivers in Compatibility mode, as the drivers will work in Windows 8/8.1 settings if it was working earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the suggestions provided by <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/954a6288-6431-45a7-94cf-bcf3c52f32ba" title="Joy Kemprai">
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend the below suggested methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>
<span><strong><span>Use Driver Verifier</span></strong><span>: </span></span><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff545448(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Driver Verifier</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;monitors
 Windows kernel-mode drivers to detect illegal function calls or actions that might corrupt the system. Driver Verifier can subject the Windows drivers to a variety of stresses and tests to find improper behavior.</span></span>
</p><p><span><span>You can run Driver Verifier on multiple drivers simultaneously, or on one driver at a time. You can configure which tests to run, which allows you to put a driver through heavy stress loads or through more streamlined testing.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn305113(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn305113(v=vs.85).aspx<br />
<br />
</span></span></a></p>
<p><span>Windows has in built Driver Verifier&nbsp;as well </span><span>to identify problematic drivers. The Driver Verifier Manager, tests each specified driver at startup. If it detects a problem, it identifies it and then stops it from running. Here's how:</span></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Type <strong>verifier</strong> in <strong>Windows Start menu Search box
</strong>and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Navigate to <strong>Create Standard Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>
Click Next </strong>&gt; <strong>Automatically select unsigned drivers </strong>&gt; <strong>
Next</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3.</strong> At last you have two options <strong>Cancel</strong> or <strong>
Finish</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you click on <strong>Cancel</strong>, no changes are made to your system configuration.</li></ul>
<p>From the list which is presented, you can manually try to <strong>Roll back</strong>,
<strong>Update</strong>, <strong>Disable</strong> or <strong>Uninstall the Driver</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you click on <strong>Finish</strong>, then restart the system, you may be presented with an error message.</li></ul>
<p>This will include the name of the buggy driver along with an error code. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Now reboot the system in <strong>Safe Mode with Networking
</strong>to update, disable or uninstall the particular driver.<br />
(Safe mode with Networking starts Windows in safe mode and includes the network drivers, services needed to access the Internet or other computers on your network).</p>
</span><span><br />
</span><span>
<p><strong>5. </strong>Type <strong>verifier/reset </strong>in Windows Start Menu Search and hit Enter to
<strong>disable</strong> the <strong>Driver Verifier Manager</strong>.</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Method 2</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow these steps to run the Windows in built troubleshooter to help detect any hardware setting changes</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>in the search box and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>
tab<strong>. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>view all</strong> option on the upper left corner.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the <strong>Hardware and Device </strong>
option from the list. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Next to run the <strong>Hardware and Device
</strong>Troubleshooter. </span></p>

            My camera is now working. I suspect it was a combination of upgrading the drivers and a Windows update. 😊

 mail is able to read my reference and my name - but apart from this, the page is blank. Has anybody experienced this? And can it be repaired.

There have been reports of the program sending out blank messages. In at least one case, the cause was security software insinuating itself between client and server. It's not possible to say whether this is your problem; we would need a more detailed explanation
 of the problem to be able to do so. </p>
<p>Do you have security software that, say, inserts a footer into each sent message?

    <title>Bluetooth keyboard not working after upgrade to Win 10 from win 8.1 on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richard in michigan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth keyboard not working after upgrade to Win 10 from win 8.1 on Samsung Tablet</h2>
                    <p>The device&nbsp; is a Samsung Tablet, model XE700T1A-A06US. It was running Windows 8.1 and was working fine until I&nbsp;tried installing the free Windows 10 upgrade. After win10 installed I cannot use my Samsung Bluetooth keyboard (model AA-SK2NWBB/US). Under Win
 8.1, the keyboard was paired and working fine.</p>
<p>After installing the free Win-10 upgrade, the keyboard does not connect to the tablet. (Initially, I had no internet connection either and that was fixed by turning off Hyper-V. See:&nbsp; http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/error-one-or-more-network-protocols-are-missing-on/ea619da7-437a-48fd-8f6e-b2265873757d).</p>
<p>To make sure Bluetooth was working on the tablet, I successfully paired a headset to it.</p>
<p>My attempts at getting the Bluetooth keyboard to work:</p>
<p>Went to Settings/Devices/Bluetooth. The keyboard device&nbsp;showed up there but since it wasn't showing what I typed, I removed the device so I could pair it again. It took a couple tries to get it removed. After removing it I rebooted and went back to Settings/Devices/Bluetooth.&nbsp;
 Pressing and holding the power button on the keyboard for over 2 seconds puts it into pairing mode (blue light flashes twice, pauses, repeats) "Samsung Keyboard" shows up with "ready to pair". Tapping "Pair" brings up a box "Enter the Passcode for your keyboard".
 I'm&nbsp;unsure what goes in there.&nbsp; Typing on the Bluetooth keyboard does nothing. I bring up the on screen keyboard and enter 0000 and tap "next". Sometimes a box comes up that says "Time's up Your keyboard quit waiting" (but it didn't, the blue light is still
 blinking twice.) Sometimes it says "Connecting" with a waiting cursor, and eventually pops up the "Time's up. Your keyboard quit waiting. Try aging it again." box.</p>
<p>So, what am I doing wrong? How do I pair the keyboard?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 &#34;Startup Repair could not detect a problem&#34;</h2>
                    <p>All of a sudden my Windows 7 64-bit laptop boots into Startup Repair instead of Windows. It reports "Startup Repair could not detect a problem". When I reboot it boots into Startup Repair again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly enough I can select Safe Mode from the F8 menu, and it will boot into Safe Mode OK. If I select "Safe Mode with Networking" the machine boots into Startup Repair again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not added any software or hardware to the laptop and I have not installed any Windows updates for a few weeks.</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 is programmed to automatically boot in startup repair when a problem is detected. If Windows can boot in safe mode without a problem, chances are that a program or a corrupted driver is causing such issue. We suggest, uninstalling the most recent
 program or update that you installed, booting Windows with nothing but mice and keyboard can also help us isolate the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
