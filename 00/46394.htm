<h2>            Wi-Fi disabled</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have windows 10 and in the past 3 days I haven't been able to connect to my Wi-Fi because it is disabled. I go to network settings to enable it, even though it says enabled my wifi is still disabled. I go to windows update and there I see "Error 0x80070103".
 I try to update the wifi adapter but it shows the error above. Not only this, but the wifi icon in the right bottom of my laptop has disappeared, and the light of my wifi button is red not white. Please I need help cuz I don't know what to do :(&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>

            <span>I have a DELL Latitude D830, that I have upgraded with an SSD, maxed out the memory, installed Windows Pro 7 and now have installed Windows 10 pro. My Intel 4965agn wireless
 adapter worked fine under Windows 7, not so much with Windows 10. Every time I started the machine from an off position (whether from sleep or a hard off) the network adapter would fail to start. I could get it to connect by running the troubleshooter (which
 said the adapter was not working properly). I spent 4 days of searching, trying to get any answers that would help from DELL. Microsoft, and Intel, to either resolve the problem or find a suitable replacement card. Somewhere in all that research I ran across
 a hint about denying Windows from shutting down the card to save power. Guess what. It works. Go to Control Panel, Device Manager, Network Adapters. Click on the Intel 4865AGN. Click on the Power Management Tab. UNCHECK the “Allow the computer to shut down…..”.
 Problem solved. Too bad neither Intel, DELL nor Microsoft will share this simple fix to a major headache.</span>

            I have tried literally 20 things over 4 days and nothing works.&nbsp; Roll back to previous release until the monopoly fixes the problem.&nbsp; Rolling back took 20 minutes and now I am connected again with no issues.&nbsp; The problem is within Windows 10 Upgrade.

<h2>            Error code 0xc000012f on playing games that work fine on Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My previous thread was locked (guessing after too much time went by), and so I re-ask the above question.&nbsp; Feel free to append this thread to the first, as it merely continues the dialog.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that I can play certain games *only* under Windows 7.&nbsp; In particular, I've chosen one of these games as the basis for my question in the hopes that I can resolve the issue for myself and others.&nbsp; In particular, I must run Windows 7 despite
 the fact that I would like to just run 8.1 due to the fact that my games simply WILL NOT RUN under Windows 8.1.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The game is typically run from the Steam console.&nbsp; However, it is possible to simply click the executables from the File Explorer.&nbsp; In my dialog here, I only run from the command line.&nbsp; When I run from the command line, I get the specific error code mentioned
 above in the title.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I've tried: (1) I've tried "<strong>checking online for solutions</strong>" - didn't work, (2) tried
<strong>Windows compatibility mode</strong> (for Windows 7 and Vista) - didn't work, (3) I've tried
<strong>completely uninstalling and reinstalling</strong> - numerous times, (4) I've run
<strong>file comparisons </strong>between the Windows 7 installations and the Windows 8.1 installations - these indicate every single file is identical between the two installations, I have tried
<strong>running from the command prompt with the system PATH set to an empty string</strong>, so as to avoid any possible issues from this angle, (6) I have gone to the Control Panel and tried running
<strong>Repair </strong>for Microsoft Visual C++, this reported "Success", but didn't fix&nbsp;or change the problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should point out that I installed these games <strong><em>just after I performed a clean install for this machine, and have had the problem from day one</em></strong>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are about 7 different games that all give me very similar issues, so I'm quite eager to resolve the issue.&nbsp; Previously, Liezl Fal requested some logs from my event viewer, and so I've taken the initiative to include those here.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon checking, it seems that error code 0xc000012f is common in games that are installed using Steam. For isolation purposes, can you tell us if you're getting the same error when trying to play games that are not from Stream? Kindly check and verify. If
 not, we suggest that you get in touch with Steam Support for assistance. Please visit
<a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1223-qroc-4460" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>How do I contact Steam Support?</strong></a> for more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out for your response.</p>

<p>Okay, let me make sure what you're telling me.&nbsp; You're saying that if the problem occurs only with Steam games, that it must be a Steam problem, right?&nbsp; Is this your logic?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, I see your logic, but it seems a bit too convenient for you, since it effectively entitles you to not have to&nbsp;worry about the question any more.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But Steam hosts thousands upon thousands of games.&nbsp; Your reasoning is similar to a doctor observing if a patient has repeated seizures while driving her automobile, then the problem must be with the car, not the patient.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you somehow miss that Windows itself is reporting the problem to be that the Direct X DLL is either bad or not for the correct system?&nbsp; How, exactly, can that be?&nbsp; It is s standard Direct X installation.&nbsp; I've tried running it numerous times.&nbsp; I've tried
 removing it and rerunning it, to no avail.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I need expert help, here, either from someone who actually understands Windows technology, that is, understands the differences between Window 7 and Windows 8, or can escalate to someone who does.&nbsp; Can no one there help me<strong> understand why Windows
 8 is complaining in this, </strong>when <strong><em>the exact same executables run fine under Windows 7?&nbsp;</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that in both cases, that is, Window 7 and Windows 8, Windows separates each application to having their own DLLs.&nbsp; I ask this, because one of the links you supplied mention a tool that searches out dependencies between
 various libraries.&nbsp; Did you intend to suggest that library dependencies might be the problem?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I posted a link to the logs which were requested.&nbsp; Did you not see anything helpful there?&nbsp; I find it curious that it took me so long to get a clean snapshot of the problem,&nbsp;but when I submit this information, you do not even find it appropriate to
 comment on it.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I read somewhere that the error code I mention above "usually" that Windows has a 32-bit application attempting to load a 64-bit driver (the source was not more specific).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can any of you please either confirm or correct me as to what the error code is supposed to mean?&nbsp; Part of the issue I've found
<strong>most </strong>frustrating over trying to deal with the problem is the absolute uselessness of the error code Windows returns.&nbsp; Even you guys haven't offered anything as to what the code is supposed to mean.&nbsp;
<strong><em>If technical support can't tell what the codes mean, then why is Windows still using them?&nbsp;
</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming there is some truth to the idea (that the problem is lack of compatibility between a "legacy" 32-bit process, and a 64-bit DLL), can someone please tell me why Windows would give the 32-bit version of a DLL to a 32-bit process in the first place?&nbsp;
 There are both 32- and 64-bit versions of Direct X drivers for each and every release, right?&nbsp; Further, when an application attempts to load a driver, it may only specify the driver name, which is exactly the same in each case, isn't it?&nbsp; Thus, I'm back to
 square one.&nbsp; If a process may only specify a DLL by its name, then apparently there's nothing the application can do to prevent the mismatch.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doesn't the fact that the application runs fine in other circumstances (i.e., Windows 8) strongly hint at a Windows problem?

<p>Sir/Ma'am, </p>
<p>
</p><p>You mention to "try reinstalling the program", but you're not making sense.&nbsp; I mentioned that I have already tried this numerous times.&nbsp; Also, I have done a direct file comparison (kindly research the FC.EXE utility) on every file in the folders for the
 application I describe, and compared these with another installation that WORKS.&nbsp; There is no difference between the files.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The exact message states "<strong>C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\d3dx9_43.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error.&nbsp; Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software
 vendor for support.&nbsp; Error status 0xc00012f.</strong>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly read all of my description of the problem, please, before responding.&nbsp; I wrote the steps I took in order to help the diagnostic process.&nbsp; But, you waste both your time and mine by not even fully&nbsp;reading my description of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, everybody knows that Microsoft produces the DirectX installation.&nbsp; I have also re-run this installation many times.&nbsp; The question is
<em><strong>why is my system reporting an error when the files are no different from another installation which runs perfectly?&nbsp;
</strong></em>Also, why are you not even commenting on the system logs of the errors I supplied?&nbsp;

<p>I mentioned in the previous answer that I have re-run this installation many times.&nbsp; It should be understood that the installation itself also checks for any errors in its own image and will not run if there are any.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I have re-downloaded the
 installation many times as part of my own diagnostic process.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a question for you:&nbsp; should the x64 packages always be used for x64 machines?&nbsp; Because my system is a x64 machine, I have always downloaded this binary and installed it in the appropriate folder for the game in question.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it comes to mind that the error message could also indicate a mismatch between a 32-bit process and a 64-bit DLL.&nbsp; Is it not possible that loading the x64 package for games that use 32-bit images might create a problem?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a further thought along this line.&nbsp; For better or worse, the Steam environment itself is installed under
<strong>Program Files (x86) </strong>directory.&nbsp; However, larger games require more memory, and likely employ 64-bit executables (indeed, many of the executable names strongly indicate they have been compiled as 64-bit executables).&nbsp; How can I ensure that Windows
 8 is not somehow registering an error (or mismatch) between the DLL and process that is loading it?&nbsp; Do the logs I provided give any clues here?</p>

<p>Jose and others,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, sir, I disagree.&nbsp; I myself performed all the basic troubleshooting steps before I posted the question.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because your site specifically asks for the steps already taken to resolve an issue, and because general diagnostic progress demands that a technician has such information, I gave as much (appropriate) detail as I could.&nbsp;
<strong><em>Yet, none of the responses by your team referenced any of this information.&nbsp;
</em></strong>On the contrary, when you or your team commented, it seems apparent&nbsp;from your postings that none of you paid attention to the steps that I had already performed.&nbsp; Why, I wonder, is that?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The basic question all along involved a simple interpretation of&nbsp;a&nbsp;vague&nbsp;(and quite possibly misleading) error returned by the operating system, and what might cause that error.&nbsp; I relayed from the beginning that binary comparison of the DLLs involved ruled
 out what the message appeared to say, but no one paid attention to that, either.&nbsp; Why, I wonder,&nbsp;is that
<strong>that</strong>?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of a genuine diagnosis, I received the standard, worn-out suggestions which were made without even bothering to do a preliminary investigation of basic facts I provided from the beginning.&nbsp; Suggestions such as reinstalling the application (game),
 reinstalling the operating system.&nbsp; (Really!)&nbsp; Maybe you think that's helpful, but I don't.&nbsp; I further suggest that, were the situations reverse, you would likely not appreciate such unhelpful responses, yourself.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 10 Activation screen is blank - and running &#39;slui&#39; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kylespencer1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Activation screen is blank - and running &#39;slui&#39; does nothing</h2>
                    <p>I recently reset my pc of all its files due to a problem with it's network connectivity. It couldn't find any networks at all, and wouldn't even recognise my internet when I had it plugged into Ethernet. But resetting it fixed that problem, bringing about
 a new problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't activate Windows 10 on my newly reset PC. I don't know my product key for Windows 10 because I haven't had to reinstall it for 6 years. Now, when I click on the Activation pane in the Settings window, the screen is blank, but you can still click
 on the buttons even though they aren't there. So when I click on where the 'Activate Windows' button should be, it just closes the window. I assume that this is supposed to bring up the Activation wizard, because the same thing happens when I Windows+R the
 'slui' command. The Run tab just closes, and nothing happens. No activity in Task Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions for what I can do to activate my Windows 10 without the product key if the activation wizard isn't working?</p>

            Hi Kyle
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Sometimes when you reinstall Windows 10, you need to apply some updates after.
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />Restart then check if the problem is resolved. 
<br />
<br />If not...
<br />
<br />Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Check if it activates.
<br />
<br />If not, leave it for a few days and it should sort itself. 
<br />
<br />Last resort, try performing a repair upgrade:

    <title>Spec Ops rank not transferable&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the viggysmalls  say:</h3>
<h2>            Spec Ops rank not transferable&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My brother recovered his account on my Xbox but his Spec Ops rank was reset to Level 1 from Level 28. Is the Spec Ops rank just on one console and not stored in the cloud like your multiplayer rank?&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is kind of annoying for the game mode in general. If that is the case, hopefully the December 6th update with cloud saves fixes that annoying problem. Or is this a unique issue and his rank just got reset? I remember in MW2 I beat the spec ops missions
 on my friends Xbox and it showed that I beat it on my xbox.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Try putting all your MW3 save details on Cloud Storage then downloading it to your new console.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>That might take your rank across. Otherwise, I don't really know what you could do other than naturally releveling.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Education downgrade and license transfer</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a laptop is using Windows 10 Home Single Language upgraded from Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Then I upgraded it using Windows 10 Education key.</p>
<p>I have some questions below.<br />
</p>
<p>1. My Windows 10 Home Single Language can be considered as an OEM license, right?</p>
<p>2. I am planning to downgrade back to Windows 10 Home Single Language from Windows 10 Education, can it be done? If so, would like to know about the steps to perform it.</p>
<p>3. After downgrading, I would like to use my Windows 10 Education key for another PC. Would also like to know can it be done and the steps to perform it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate if anyone can help on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks and regards,</p>
<p>Low Wen Hong.</p>

            Hi WH
<br />
<br />1
<br />To go back to the Windows 10 Home edition on that PC, you will need to backup your data and clean install Windows 10 Home, that will self-activate from the Microsoft Activation servers, once that is put on the Internet after it is installed. You will need to re-install all 3rd party applications after the re-install
<br />
<br />2
<br />To use your Education licence on another PC, you just need to clean install that. then if you get any activation errors, you need to contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you activate your Windows 10 Education, by explaining you have moved that to a new  PC . . .
<br />
<br />Call/Chat/Schedule a Call
<br /><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />Or choose a local Phone Number: 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />3.
<br />Steps to clean install Windows 10 Home:
<br /> 
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues

<h2>            Movie issue</h2>
                    <p>First and foremost, the fact that there isn't a forum titled "Movies&nbsp;&amp; TV" seems very.....unwise.</p><p>The issues is that I bought a movie today and can't play it. It's not a pre-order, but a movie that was released on the Movies &amp; TV app yesterday. There was apparently an issue with this service earlier. The support website has signaled that everything is running fine again, but I&nbsp;still can't play this movie, that I&nbsp;paid for. Why?</p>

            <p>Hi Barry</p>
<p>I found your Q on google after searching here failed to find anything. I was away last week, so today was the first time I noticed the absence of this tool - without it the app is pretty useless and I don't want to download yet another third party program.
 I've posted a similar q in the music/photos/video section... let's keep nagging&nbsp;MS! -&nbsp;Also send feedback about it. - Cheers, Ric.</p>

            I can't believe this, MS changes things without any notification, it's not an UPgrade at all so why would they do this? It's DOWNgrade! I just wasted 2 hours finding an answer to this!

            Jim Wynne's reply to me in the other thread (link in previous post) suggests this happened via an update in Windows Store along with&nbsp;a possible means of controlling/preventing it. Send feedback via the feedback hub... MS may pay attention (but don't hold

<p>I have had this problem for a couple of weeks too; however when I opened the app today I found that I now have the warmth slider again (see attached image): it has been placed in the colour adjustment alongside a tint slider. I have tried it and it seems
 to do the same job as the previous, stand-alone, warmth slider. </p>
<p>Maybe Microsoft has been listening.</p>

            <p>The Missing Sliders have returned, Warmth&nbsp;and Tint. As with the&nbsp;'Light' grouping, today I clicked on the existing 'Color' heading and&nbsp;the drop-downs indeed showed the reappearance&nbsp;of the missing adjustments.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How long will they stay around?? Don't know, but they're here now.</p>

<p>How do I prevent &nbsp;Feature update to Windows 10, version 1703.</p>
<p>I did&nbsp;already install it&nbsp;once and messed up all my office applications. I did revert back to previous version.</p>
<p>I have selected option Defer feature updates. And now after a one week it says: A restart is required to finish installing following updates: Feature update to Windows 10, version 1703.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything I can do, I do not want Creator update right now!</p>

I need an actual answer to the question above rather than a user-hostile "Updates are for your security."<br />

How do I prevent feature updates without preventing security updates?</p>

            Stopping all updates is absolutely the last thing you want to do.  Trying to block the specific update is a much better approach, if you can make it work.  Here are some articles on blocking updates

    <title>Is an unrepairable OpcServices.dll the cause of previous runtime - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is an unrepairable OpcServices.dll the cause of previous runtime errors&#63;</h2>
                    Hey all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Over the past week or so, I've been getting some funky happenings. I recently upgraded my PC (new motherboard, ram, and psu), and I started to get static-sounds when I shut down, and then, later
 this week, while a new game, Planetside2 using Skype, my PC would stop, give a static feedback to those in the Skype call, and proclaim that I'm missing an Nvidia driver. While using Google Chrome, pictures on web pages wee mixed up or non-existent, and would
 barely function as a program.</div>
<div>Afterwards, my browsers would refuse to work, save for IE8 (go figure), and right clicking on my desktop would cause a Runtime Error where something caused to terminate unexpectedly.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now, I've gone ahead and reinstalled my graphics drivers to a WHQL-certified driver (306.97) because installing the newer beta drivers (310.70) would cause an installation failure with the 3D
 drivers. I've tried to uninstall and do a clean install, but that only resulted in a failed HD Audio driver install. To see what was going on, I did sfc scannow and got a handy CBS log.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My question here is that the logs says it could not repair the OpcServices.dll, and I'm wondering, is this the cause of all of the Runtime Errors? How do I repair this .dll file? And how do
 I get the 3D Vision Drivers to properly install? I'm aware that his the Microsoft forum, but pointers in the right direction are much appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As of now, I have not done any intensive gaming, completely out of fear that this might happen again., so I have not had any of the previous errors. &nbsp;I will also post my PC specifications, as
 well as the CBS.log:</div>

            <p>Hi Satvik,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear that you are facing such issue with your computer. I will do my best to get the issue sorted out. However before we begin I will need to ask
 a few troubleshooting questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>When was the last time the computer worked fine?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you have any anti-virus program installed in the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is an
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/822521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a> with some good steps on dealing with runtime issues. Go through it and check if it helps.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: If you perform the steps to reset internet explorer. Be advised that it is an irreversible option.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer
 Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also check the
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/use-compatibility-view#ie=ie-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a> and see if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to perform the System File Checker scan. This time around, I would suggest you to insert the Windows 7 installation DVD and perform the
 scan. Windows will copy fresh files and replace the corrupted ones. Check if this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists you may start the computer in safe mode and perform a clean boot.
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clean boot</a> helps eliminate any third party software conflict.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: After you have finished troubleshooting,
 follow step 3 mentioned in the article to boot the computer to normal startup.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have to contact the graphic card manufacturer for any updated drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to help.</p>

            <p>Rohit,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for replying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last time it was working fine was the first day my PC had been upgraded, which was roughly a week ago.
</p>
<p>I have Avast! Anit-Virus software installed, but now it doesn't work, so I'm looking into fixes with that. I'm quite lost with this entire situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My browsing problems are not only limited to IE8, but also Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. This must be an issue with my PC, not with each individual software, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll look at your links and see how they work with IE8. Right now, IE8 is the browser that actually functions, letting me click on links and images actually being shown correctly. I'll reinstall Chrome and Firefox and see how that goes as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Satvik</p>

            Hi<br />
<br />
You will need to do some homework.<br />
<br />
First, download and run the <span>

This application will check your system and report any known hardware/software&nbsp;incompatibilities. It will also
 show which versions of Windows 7 you can upgrade to.<br />

Check the <span>

 you tips on using the compatibility center.<br />
</span><br />
It would also be a good idea to check with Toshiba about support for any of their proprietary hardware components.<br />

<h2>            Cannot Connect to Network Share on Windows2008 R2</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have an Laptop Running Windows10 Build 1809 - And A Windows2008 R2 Running running Role as Fileserver</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suddenly I cannot connect to that server at File share </p>
<p>I removed all drives through explorer - made sure no one else is mapped through net use * /delete</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I sure the drives etc are shared correctly - since I can connect from others PC to the same drive
</p>
<p>But From the Laptop I can connect to another shares - But not the Windows2008 Server. This have been working the last 5years without any problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When connecting through Explorer - I'm getting this error without explanation = 0x80004005
</p>
<p>When Using cmd and net use commands - I'm getting systemerror 6 </p>
<p>
</p><p>From laptop I have removod all remembered Credentials from this Account. </p>
<p>The network Profile is Private - But have allso tried with disabled firewall - I've checked SMB1.0 are enabled as client -&nbsp; but all in all the same result.
</p>
<p>Its not possible neither through IP-address or DNS name for the server - same error result !
</p>
<p>But no problem ping but IP and DNS name - so not sure where to look from here.&nbsp; but Through VPN but allso locally in Headquarter office.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a problem only on one out of 8 Laptops - All others can connect to the same drive without problems.
</p>
<p>Is there anywhere in 2008 R2 Server a user can be blocked ? The problem started this morning where explorer shows the drive - but with a red cross over - so not connected.
</p>
<p>So just getting the above errors from this morning - it does not even shown the Credentials login or anything - Just the error 0x80004005 and in CMD it shows systemerror 6
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What to do from here.- as </p>
<p>

    <title>Microsoft Points discontinued&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Points discontinued&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So I was on Google, trying to find away to spend 30 Microsoft Points because that's all I have left. Then I came across something interesting. It seems by the end of 2012, Microsoft Points might be discontinued. Quoting insidemobileapps.com</p>
<p>[quote]</p>
<p>Microsoft Points are currently used to purchase games and media content on Xbox Live, the Zune Marketplace, the PC and Windows Phone, but the system isn’t used universally. On Xbox Live, the prices for full games are listed in dollars, but downloadable content
 is purchased with Points.&nbsp;On Windows Phone, apps are priced in dollars, but users can make
<a href="http://www.neowin.net/news/windows-phone-7-to-use-microsoft-points-for-game-microtransactions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
in-app purchases with Points</a>. Windows Phone users can also use Microsoft Points to buy accessories for their
<a href="http://betanews.com/2011/06/07/windows-phone-now-accepts-microsoft-points-and-other-news-you-may-have-missed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Live avatars</a> and purchase Points directly from their phones.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>While the decision to eliminate Microsoft Points may seem to be a surprising move, Microsoft has been gradually introducing
<a href="http://www.flesheatingzipper.com/gaming/2012/01/microsoft-why-are-you-still-using-microsoft-points/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
cash purchases to Xbox Live</a>, the most popular platform where Points are used. It makes sense for the company to move to a single cash-based payment system, as it brings it in line with its app market competitors and eliminates a consistent criticism of
 the system — that the Points to dollar conversion ratio is not only confusing, but it forces consumers to purchase more Points than they actually need. The smallest amount of Points that a consumer can purchase at one time is 400, or $5 worth.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>So, with that being said. What do you think about this? Would this change effect you in any way? I personally wouldn't mind it considering, I some how always have some little currency of Microsoft Points on my account &amp; that really irritates me. It would
 be like achieving an achievement that has the gamer-score of something like 17. That is just me. So what do you think of this?</p>

<p>it seems logical to convert to cash, as the games and apps on windows phone are sold as cash and the same goes for games for windows and possibly the new market place on windows 8, and to have everything merging together they would have to dump the points
 system.</p>

 Windows 10 app in my notification area (system tray) a few days ago but when i click on get Windows 10 I get the compatibility issue "There are no supported networking devices". I have been on each of the manufactures websites trying to find updated drivers
 for Windows 10 thinking that might resolve the issue but I currently have all of the latest drivers installed. I built this machine and installed a fresh copy of Windows 7 Pro and it seemed as all the networking drivers I needed where already in the Windows
 7 driver database. Did windows 10 not build on the currently available driver database? Will any of the networking devices i have ever be supported or do I need to buy another networking solution either wired or wireless? Or should I do lik

<h2>            VIdeos freeze and take forever to load&#33;</h2>
                    I have a brand new sony vaio. i've had it for about a month or less. right after i purchased it there was something wrong with the hardware, it had something wrong with it, where it was not compatible with youtube or whatever. the videos would freeze and
 take forever to load. now with my new vaio it was fine for about 3 weeks and then it's starting to do the same thing again. the videos on youtube or music&nbsp;on any page will start to load and then freeze and just stop loading or it will take forever to load.&nbsp;
 not only that but sometimes the internet is slow. i have clearwire and its pretty fast. so i dont think it would be my internet connection. someone help me please?!

<p><span>Hi asianCHICK7,<br />
<br />
Thanks for using the Vista Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
Would you say it's experiencing the same issue as your first laptop?<br />
Did Sony mention what piece of hardware went bad in the first laptop?<br />
<br />
From another thread:<br />
When the video stops playing does it freeze / pixelate / go blank / or&nbsp;crash the player?
<br />
<br />
Are you getting an error message when it stops working?<br />
What internet browser are you using?<br />
<br />
Looking forward to hearing back from you.<br />

<p><span>Hi AsianChick7,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>So it could be anything that was installed after you got your laptop back.
<span>Let's try clean booting the system to remove 3rd party software and see if that clears up the problem.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps below to place your computer in “clean boot”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;orb on your Desktop</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Type
<strong>msconfig </strong>in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>On the
<strong>General tab</strong>, click <strong>Selective Startup</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Under Selective Startup, click to
<strong>clear the Load Startup Items check box</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Services tab</strong>, click to <strong>select the Hide All Microsoft Services</strong> check box, and then
<strong>click Disable All</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click<strong> OK</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>When you are prompted, click
<strong>Restart</strong>.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span>Try your videos.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Is it still running slow?<br />
<br />
If this <strong>does</strong> resolve the issue, then see the following Microsoft Article on “Clean boot” and the section “How to determine what is causing the problem” to determine which program or service maybe causing the issue.

    <title>windows installer and shredder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alanpickard  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows installer and shredder</h2>
                    something has installed onto my laptop. when I click on some icons Windows Installer tries to work but nothing happens, even for a long time. Shredder is also involved. The only way I can work is to log out and log back in again and not use the icons or
 File Explorer.&nbsp; How do I solve this?

            You may have malware.
<br />Try running these programs:
<br />MBAM free: <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br />Eset online scanner:  <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/</a>

<br />
<br />If these do not fully remove the virus/malware then it will be wise to register with a malware removal site to receive dedicated malware removal instructions, an expert will remain with you throughout the process until confirmation that your PC is 100% clean.

<h3> 111mike111  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 update wiped out my pics and docs&#33;</h2>
                    I updated Windows 8 to 8.1, and now ALL of my file folders are empty??!!&nbsp; They are not in SkyDrive.&nbsp; How do I retrieve everything that was on my laptop?&nbsp;Is there a restore point on Windows 8 like there was in 7 and XP?&nbsp; &nbsp;I am somewhat computer illiterate
 and hate Windows 8 with a passion, so would very much appreciate a detailed reply.&nbsp; Thanks for any help.

            <p>There won't be any restore points, but at the root of Your C: drive should be a folder called Windows.old. You may be able to find your missing docs &amp; Pics here. This is another reason your should always back up your info you don't want to lose. Hope this
 helps and if you need any further assistance&nbsp; post and we will be glad to help you.</p>

            i had similar problem as 111mike111, but only lost my photos. i can see most of the file directory where the photos used to be, but it says that the subfolders are not available. &nbsp;also when i search computer, none of the folders/files come up. i have tried
 the windows.old method, but the old file directory does not appear there. is that another way to try to recover them?

            <p>I found the Windows.old folder, but it is empty.&nbsp; I don't understand how a windows upgrade could totally empty out all of my personal file folders.&nbsp; ????&nbsp;

            <p>I checked out the links you provided -- were no help in my situation.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I did not have all of my old photos, so wish to find where all of my pics went when windows update wiped them out!!&nbsp; I'm still dealing with this issue -- all of the answers and suggestions I've found online have not worked for me.&nbsp; I've literally searched
 everywhere -- even hidden files and folders -- and absolutely every personal file I had was wiped out.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I know that update couldn't have wrote zeros to my hard drive, so my pics have to be somewhere.&nbsp; I'm going to make a call to Microsoft and speak to a real person and see if they have any suggestions.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This had to be some kind of ploy to get us all to buy online storage space, but that won't happen in my case.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I paid a fortune for this new laptop with 1 TB of disk space, but what good is it if a simple windows update wipes it clean???&nbsp; I am angry beyond comprehension.&nbsp; Wife told me to get an iPad......now she's rubbing my face in it.&nbsp; Thanks a lot Microsoft.&nbsp;
 Lesson learned:&nbsp; Disk space on a Windows based machine is worthless.</p>

            I checked that out and wada bing wada boom it says that it is turned off and that it needs an external hard drive... I had video clip and photos from my trip to Japan that I had on my phone little to my surprise I dropped it in the water and it fried and
 got the insurance to send another then I got the other and still have never been able to access that stupid
at@t locker for the photos. I mean I use to have Photos from New York and Europe and a lot of places... I mean those are my special memories and for them not to exist anymore is kind of irritating and makes me very mad... Then Microsoft
 has no explanation but tell you to use third party apps and programs to find your documents and little to no help they tell you that that is up to your decision on the best third party program. I check the old files I check everywhere and the moment I clicked
 shut down and not realizing it I had lost all of my photos and none are on my phone so all of my photos and everything visual and audio vanished. The only thing I could do was access documents that I had recently made... Sometimes Microsoft can just go eat
 an egg lol... Apple is none the better... Microsoft can run mostly anything as the licenses agreements with apple most don't have interest in obtaining... I really do know that they have the best at heart to renew the security certificates after the heart
 bleed incident. Where just to go on a government website you risked being hacked... I mean the whole thing of why the Interpol and FBI cyber division can't do there job effectively on theft protection from the internet and the hacks on our systems...&nbsp;I mean
 it&nbsp;is just appalling and makes me wonder how my tax Is&nbsp;spent. I mean...&nbsp;You guys know that the government will hide things to not let you know of there boo boo and save face... And I will leave it at that. Well got to go... I am going to be back in Japan soon
 anyways so I don't mind not making new memories. I just will regret loosing those to help with reminiscing and remember the good time I had there.... And elsewhere...

<p>I too did something called a "System Restore" to the day before Windows decided to delete all my photos, documents, passwords to my email - EVERYTHING.&nbsp; (BTW, I have to say this is pretty EFFING OUTRAGEOUS that an "update" - which inserted itself in the
 middle of something very important that I was doing, shutting down my computer while it did ITS URGENT WORK, as the updates always do -&nbsp; could just do this.&nbsp; I don't even know what the hell it was updating.&nbsp; Probably nothing so important to me as my photos
 and documents.)</p>
