                    <p>I&nbsp;have set up a Microsoft Outlook account but the system is not allowing me to validate the account or sign in. &nbsp;I have an email from member services asking me to validate the account by signing in - however when I click on "sign in" , all that happens is
 that I am returned to the Inbox page!&nbsp; I should be grateful to receive simple&nbsp;instructions on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;sign in/validate my new account? Lesley Cree.</p>
<p>PS. I would add that my husband set up an account for himself at the same time and was able to validate and use his account simply.</p>

    <title>Runs exe as service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ipxodi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Runs exe as service</h2>
                    <p>Way back in the day, there used to be a program -- sc.exe (?) -- that you could use to turn an exe into a service. &nbsp;I think it was part of the power tools set.</p>
<p>Is there a similar feature in Windows 10?</p>
<p>I have an exe that I would like to launch at startup, but putting it in the startup area, causes it to ask for permission,, I'd like to run it as a service so I can tell it to run as an administrator level service and bypass the permission request.</p>

            You could set up a task in Task Scheduler and tell it to run with highest privileges. &nbsp;That's how I got around the admin privileges to run Core Temp automatically at start up..

    <title>Office360 attachments opening as read-only documents - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kimberleac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office360 attachments opening as read-only documents</h2>
                    <p>I've disabled protected view, I've unclicked the box that would have all attachments opening as read-only documents, and still all my attachments are opening as read-only documents. This is problematic enough. A bigger associated problem is that the "enable
 editing" button doesn't always appear with the read-only document. I can go to view and click "edit" but my file still says read-only. I am an editor, I need to be able to edit almost all of the attachments I open from Outlook, and I need to be able to do
 it consistently without performing half a dozen other steps.</p>
<p>1. How do I make my Outlook attachments stop opening as read-only in Word</p>
<p>2. How do I find or create an "enable editing" button when one does not automatically appear on the file?</p>
<p>Please provide step-by-step instructions.</p>

            Hi Kimberlea,
<br />Protected view is separate from read-only. 
<br />
<br />Are you trying to edit the document and save it back to the email or just make it easier to edit and save the document?

<p>Disabling protected view was one of the remedies I found online to the files opening in read-only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to be able to open the document in an editable format, edit it, save it to my drives, then perform other functions with it. I'm almost never editing then sending back to the original sender, though I do often have to email the document once I've edited
 it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is no way to stop the files from opening in read-only, I need to consistently have the "enable editing" function available to me, which it has not been.</p>

<p>The option to Enable editing is shown when the document opens in Protected view.

<p>

<p>If the option to enable editing appeared every time the document opened in protected view, I would not be asking how to ensure it appears, unfortunately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if protected view is not a factor in my documents opening as read only, what is? How do I make it stop? Will I forever have to create new documents with the content of an attachment in order to be able to edit and save my edits?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Protected view would display a yellow bar with the option to enable editing (see screen shot below). If you turned off the options referring to Protected view (in Trust Center), that view is not the issue here.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/292f9f3a-b0cf-450a-aa62-813d5f7b8769?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/292f9f3a-b0cf-450a-aa62-813d5f7b8769?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>An e-mail attachment will be downloaded to a temporary folder and open as read-only. You can resave it by pressing F12 which brings up the Save As dialog box. (Depending on your keyboard, you may have to press FN+F12 rather than just F12.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that if Word opens e-mail attachments in Read Mode, you can prevent that from happening by clearing the option "Open e-mail attachments and other uneditable files in reading view" at File | Options | General. Read Mode (sometimes referred to as Reading
 Layout view) is different from read-only (see Diane's reply).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read Mode displays a simplified view with only three ribbon tabs:</p>

            The option to open files in reading view is not checked, so the default should be layout. Just in case I was reading that wrong somehow, I checked the box for reading view and the result is the same. And as I've said above at least once,&nbsp;the "enable editing"
 box does not always appear when I open an attachment that is "read-only." Before I came online and asked this question officially I tried a number of the solutions offered, including all of&nbsp;the ones&nbsp;that have&nbsp;been&nbsp;mentioned in this thread and several others.&nbsp;I
 just want to open files so that I can edit them without having to take five extra steps. Is there a way to do this, or has a Microsoft "update" once again simply created work for me?

            OK, so further to my attachments opening from Outlook into Word as "read only," now my own files are opening in "read only," that is, I'm working in Word, I go to a Word file that I've saved, and a completely new Word boots up, and the file is marked "read-only,"
 when I've done nothing to protect it. Now I can't edit my own files without creating a new one - unless the "enable editing" button comes up, as it does only erratically. What is this nonsense and how do I make it stop?

</p><p>In the old days, from outlook I could make Word my e-mail editor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the situation now with Outlook and Word 365?</p>

<p>Hi Lewis, </p>
<p>
</p><p>AutoCorrect feature to correct typos, capitalization errors, and misspelled words, as well as automatically insert symbols and other pieces of text is still available in Office 2016. To know more about it, you may check out this article:<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Choose-AutoCorrect-options-for-capitalization-spelling-and-symbols-e7433b94-f3de-4532-9dc8-b29063a96e1f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Choose

<p>We've checked on the issue further and found out that the <strong>Auto Correct Options</strong> may only be added on the Quick Access Toolbar of the message window and not by clicking on the File tab which we did earlier. The reason for this could be because
 it would only be needed when composing an email. To do so,&nbsp; you may follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Click <strong>New Email</strong> button. The Message window should pop up.</li><li>Right-click anywhere on the Ribbon and click <strong>Customize Quick Access Toolbar</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>All Commands </strong>from the <strong>Choose commands from</strong> dropdown list.</li><li>Add the <strong>AutoCorrect Options</strong> and hit <strong>OK</strong> .</li><li>Once done, you should see a <strong>Circle icon</strong> on your Message window's
<strong>Quick Access Toolbar</strong>. That is the <strong>AutoCorrect Options </strong>
button.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We hope that the same works for you. Let us know if you need further help.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Forwarding versus connected account</h2>
                    <p>The situation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; My wife and I each have Outlook on the desktop.&nbsp; </p>
<p>2.&nbsp; We each have an Outlook.com account that is an Account in Outlook on the desktop.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; We each have a Gmail account with a forward to the Outlook.com account.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; My wife also has the Gmail account as a 'connected account' on her Outlook.com account.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; My email is working fine, but with hers she cannot Send.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Answer Desk for Outlook.com said that he problem is a known issue:&nbsp; the connected account is updating due to a server changeover.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; This updating has been going on for days.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; What would be the problem with making her setup the same as mine, that is, no connected account?</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; It seems that forwarding from Gmail does the same thing as Gmail as a connected account.&nbsp; Is this correct?</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; If #9 is yes, how does one choose between forwarding and a connected account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your patience reading this, and with what is problem a fairly basic question for you (and most people).</p>

            <p>Ted, can you verify if the password changes was automatically made or did you made the changes (added the string of numbers). Also to answer your questions, please check below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong><span>&nbsp; </span><em>What would be the problem with making her setup the same as mine, that is, no connected account?</em></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The set up may be the same as how you have set up your account, however, since you are using a third party email to connect to
<strong>Outlook</strong>, some configuration must be done to properly connect and be able to send some emails. This is due to the limitation with the email provider itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong><span>&nbsp; </span><em>It seems that forwarding from Gmail does the same thing as Gmail as a connected account.</em><span>&nbsp;
</span><em>Is this correct?</em></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Ted <strong>Forwarding </strong><strong>account</strong> is different from
<strong>Connected </strong><strong>account</strong>. <strong>Connected account </strong>
gives you the option to send, receive and access you email using either web base or application based email client such as
<strong>Outlook.com </strong>and <strong>Outlook 2016</strong>. However, <strong>
Forwarding account </strong>only allows you to direct incoming emails or messages to another email address. It does not have an inbox and does not store any emails at all, it will just redirect any emails send to the forwarding account to the selected account
 you have set up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10</strong>.<span>&nbsp; </span><em>If #9 is yes, how does one choose between forwarding and a connected account?</em></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Since the answer to number 9 is <strong>No</strong>, you need to choose first if you would want to set up your Gmail account as a Connected account or just a Forwarding account.</p>

<h3> amitshandilya  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can i stop the insider preview builds on my pc. have left the windows insider programme but still getting builds and updates. Want to stop them completely.  Please help.</h2>
                    <div>I have joined the windows insider programme from this account before downloading win 10 pro prerelease. Then i also linked my Microsoft account to windows insider settings of my pc. Then i started getting updates of windows daily. I got irritated by updating
 it daily. Then i changed the settings from "fast pace to get new builds" to "slow pace". Then updates started coming less frequently. But still they are coming &nbsp;once a week and i don't have that much of internet to update those. So i tried to stop the coming
 of insider preview builds.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Firstly i left the windows insider programme and then i also unlinked my microsoft account from windows insider program settings of my pc. But still the insider preview builds didn't stop.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Secondly i clicked on an option of " stop preview builds". There it shows some options of 1) Pause the builds for a certain peroid of time(usually 1 week). But after 1 week updates will come surely.</div>
<div>2) Roll back to the last windows release (rollback to latest public version of windows)</div>
<div>3) Continue getting builds until next (public) release of windows.</div>
<div>Then i selected the second option and it reinstalled my windows to last public version and deleted all my apps and changed settings.</div>
<div>But after all this effort, the insider previews builds all still coming, they didn't get stop.&nbsp;</div>
<div>And still it is showing the same above 3 options when i click on "stop preview builds".&nbsp;</div>
<div>So what should i do? Please help me. &nbsp;I don't want to update those builds so much frequently because i don't have internet. And when an update come and i connect my pc to internet , it automatically start updating and consumes all my data. I want to stop
 all this **** of insider buils and updates. I want to use my pc normally. &nbsp;Please tell me what should i do? Should i uninstall this Windows 10 pro prerealese version and install a simple windows 10 pro public version? Is it possible to rollback this this version
 of windows to a public version where i stop receiving updates and builds. Please help me. I'ld be very thankful.</div>

<p>You could just restore your disk image of build 15063.xxx (if you made one) and within that, pursue the stop getting new builds option. Whatever software you had installed when you made the image will still be in tact and ready for use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could choose to install windows 10 pro public version, meaning that you would need to reinstall all of your software again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could choose to stay with the preview builds a little longer (probably September), until the build that becomes the next public release, then execute the stop receiving preview option.

<p>Item 2 will only roll back to the previous build, not to the release build unless that was the one previously installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back up all your files. A disc image of the current OS would also be a good insurance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the &nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Media Creation Tool</a>&nbsp; and create installation media a USB flash drive for use on a different PC. Make sure that the version o W10 you
 create is the same one for which you currently have activation (32 bit or 64 bit, Home or Pro).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure you understand all the instructions and install the release version of W10.</p>

<p>Your option 2 will only roll back to the previous insider build, not the last public build.&nbsp; That is not a solution for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Waiting until the Fall Creators Update releases will still get you a few more insider builds (ten to a dozen on Fast Ring, probably three on Slow Ring).&nbsp; If bandwidth usage is of paramount importance then that is not for you either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you download the Creators Update iso, backup all your data, and clean install build 15063.&nbsp; You will have to re-install your apps if you did not make a system image backup while you were still on the Creators Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not possible to "upgrade" to an earlier build so the only option is a clean installation to get back to the current public release.</p>

<h2>            Something positive</h2>
                    <p><span>Looking at the insider forums, sees like Win10 is not very liked (yet) because of some reduced features at and lacking stability a few days before launch.</span></p>
<p><span>However a positive anecdote: My father is one of those diehard Win7 fans, and „he’ll never install this ugly new metro stuff. The new version has no use anyway“.</span></p>
<p><span>I told him that it’s not that bad and gave him my laptop for a little test drive.</span></p>
<p><span>He was astonished how quick it would boot, how fast Edge was and how slick the new start menu. He actually liked it.</span></p>
<p><span>So yes, we power users (I guess most of Insiders are) lament, but Joe Averageuser will probably pretty positive.</span></p>
<p><span>However I told him to give it a few weeks or month after RTM to get stable before he installs. I today still have blue screens in ntoskernel on shutdown and sporadic network problems. ;-)</span></p>

<p>The Microsoft Solitaire collection works great on 10240 for&nbsp; me.</p>
<p>That's no consolation for the insiders who cant get critical security updates to install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The startmenu/screen argument doesn't concern me. Basic functionality,or LACK of it</p>
<p>is what is important less than a week from commercial release !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After 10 months of development, impossible to make excuses for MS anymore.</p>
<p>We have insiders who are quitting because the OS wont install,wont activate,wont update. etc.</p>

            <p>Agree that Win10 is currently still pretty "beta" and not ready for prime time.</p>
<p>However my point was that in a few months&nbsp;(when it becomes stable enough), especially non-techies will probably like it much better than Win 8.x</p>
<p>And I also lament all the features that are gone in Win10, but I guess the average "simple" user will not really care that much.</p>

            My regular desktop computer has Windows 7 and running from ssd which in itself makes it load faster. I have noticed Windows 10 build 10240 which is installed on a physical hard drive on my laptop and an older Pentium 2 hard drive. Both computers load up
 a lot faster and seem to be much snappier. I have no hard numbers. I have installed all builds since October 2014 and each build had some issues. Build 10240 is the best of the lot. All of the builds seem to be faster as they progressed. The only build I had
 real issues was 10130 and a lot of times the start menu would fail to respond. Microsoft has come a long way since the end of September 2014 to current. I have no idea how Windows 10 performance will be from my main computer ssd when I eventually upgrade.
 I think a lot of issues for some insiders are that manufacturers where not providing updated drivers to Microsoft for testing before adding to the build.

            <p>I have now two machines updated from 8.1. One low-power with traditional HDD, and my main fast laptop with SSD.</p>
<p>The HDD is about the same speed as before, but the SSD fast laptop feels a bit snappier.</p>
<p>The biggest step though was from Win7 to Win8.1, which was a lot faster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure many guys updating from Win7 will be delighted with the speed gains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the instabilities on both systems are not the drivers currently, as I analyzed the crash. Plus the sporadic network connectivity problems are the same on both machines. And I also got some Windows Update problems like the other guys in the forums. But
 I guess it will become better the months after RTM.</p>

<h2>            Samsung Omnia W GT-I8350 installation problum on my PC - Windows Phone USB</h2>
                    <p>hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have Samsung Omnia GT-I8350. I have installed Zune software on my PC. When I connect my phone with USB to PC, Zune does not recognise. In device manager, my phone is shown as other devices. When I tried to update driver software online, it show that windows
 have found driver software for your device but encountered error while attempting to install it . Windows Phone USB. The system cannot find the file specified. If you know the manufacturer of your device, you can visit its website and check the support section
 for the driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although my phone battery&nbsp;is getting charged through USB.</p>

            <p>Hi Nitin KumarSingh,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you see any codes listed for the driver when trying to install it in device manager? If you do it will help us narrow down what the issue with the driver is.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find a full list of these codes at <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/zune/player/software-does-not-detect-device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.xbox.com/en-US/zune/player/software-does-not-detect-device</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't receive any of the listed codes you should be able to try manually installing the driver.&nbsp; In the device manager you can right click on the entry for your phone under other devices and select properties. Next, please click the driver tab followed
 by the update driver button. We will then want to select the "browse my computer" option and enter the location C:\Program Files\Zune. The driver should be located in the Zune folder and should update.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know what happens. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards, </p>
<p>Nate W.H. </p>

<h3> pei zhang  say:</h3>
<h2>            can&#39;t open excel 2002 file format on mac office 365 app.</h2>
                    <p>I got a business excel report daily, previously I use windows office 2016 and all working normal, but after I use macbook, and also use office 2016(corporate licensed), the excel file can't be open with a note in the blank sheet "This page uses frames, but
 your browser doesn't support them."</p>
<p>I was noted by the report owner that the file format is excel2002, should be compatible with higher office app than 2003, but that's the problem.</p>
<p>please try to figure out if there any hotfix or update for office365 which can fix this issue for me?</p>

<p>Neither the creator version nor the file type is the issue. The problem is that the file contains
<em>Frames</em> which are <strong>ActiveX Controls</strong>. ActiveX Controls are not supported by
<em>Excel Online </em>[which the "browser" message suggests you're actually trying to use] or by any version of Excel for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It further sounds like the file may be stored on OneDrive or other cloud service. I don't have any way to test, but unless there is other unsupported content I believe the Online app should be able to open the file, but the unsupported content either will
 not be displayed or will not be usable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you download the file to your local HD you should be able to open it with the full desktop version of Excel, but the ActiveX Controls still will not be functional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Verify that your installation of Office is fully updated by going to <strong>Excel&gt; About Excel</strong> in the main menu bar of your locally installed software. The current version is 15.38 or later. If you continue to have a problem please include the
<strong>Version</strong> &amp; License information in your reply along with the exact wording (or screen shots) of any messages as well as any additional specific details you can supply.</p>

            &nbsp;Let me just make sure what you are doing Jatin.&nbsp; When you turn on your device, are you looking at the Touch Flo 3D interface or have you disabled that and are running the typical Today screen?<br />
<br />
You can change the default theme by going into START/SETTINGS/Today icon.&nbsp; However, if you are running Touch Flo, I think the default is the best choice.&nbsp; Of course you can changethe background which can personalize it for you.<br />
<br />
If you have disabled the Touch Flo, then there are lots of themes you can download and use.<br />
<br />
If you need help, just ask.&nbsp; I have the Touch Pro and so if you don't know how to change something we can work it out.<br />

    <title>copy and paste email problem outlook 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arceq  say:</h3>
<h2>            copy and paste email problem outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>having a problem with copy and paste of a single&nbsp;email or batch of emails</p>
<p>
</p><p>not talking about migrating or moving the .pst file, just copy an email to a USB drive or to ONEdrive and then paste it back into inbox on another computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>for example, get an email at work but want to have it at home too.&nbsp; not interested in syncing all, just copying a few emails.&nbsp; have done this in the past easily and successfully&nbsp;from a&nbsp;windows 8.1 desktop with office outlook 2010 to vista laptop with outlook
 2007, but got new laptop with outlook 2010 and now doesn't seem to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>can copy the email to the USB thumb drive and then plug USB into the laptop and select the email of the USB drive and right click and copy it (or CNTL-C) , but when try to paste back into 'inbox' folder on laptop it won't paste.&nbsp; no paste option and if use
 CNTL-V it appears to paste into a completely new email as an attachment or inserted in the email rather than just become another email in the inbox list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>found a work around that if I actually open the email in question (on the laptop, from the USB, using outlook) I can then choose to move and 'copy to folder' and choose inbox and then inserts fine and shows up in the inbox list with all other emails already
 there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>however that's a bit inconvenient if copy 6 or 10 emails at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>copy and paste of an email already on the laptop to another folder or making another copy seems to work fine (CNTL-C, CNTL-V).&nbsp; just seems can't take the copied email from the work desktop and paste it to the home laptop without the above workaround.&nbsp; (again
 used to work before when laptop was vista with office outlook 2007)</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyone have any solutions or experience this same problem??</p>

<p>
</p><p>any ideas why this capability went away?&nbsp; or a better copy and paste option?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can copy and paste within outlook from one folder to another, but if I copy from another computer (even though both running windows 8.1 and office outlook 2010), it pastes in as an attachment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>is this for a reason??</p>
<p>
</p><p>reminder- my workaround which need to do one at a time at least keeps the original date and 'from' when it shows in the inbox list.</p>

            Hi Redsquirrel,<br />
<br />
Sounds like a software bug to me. Have you checked via Nokia Suite on your PC if there is a firmware update available for your device? If there is, please update to the latest version offered. If this does not work, then try re-installing your current firmware
 version, and if this doesn't work either, then Restore your phone to factory settings. Failing this, you will need to take your phone to your local Nokia Care point for them to inspect.<br />

                    <p>I have a range (fn35:fn70) where in each cell in that range I am manually attempting to enter in values where the corresponding cell on the same row in the range (fo35:fo70) is not less than 80%</p>

</p><p>each cell in range (fo35:fo70) is using an erlang vba calc to help predict a service level based on the value the corresponding cell on the same row has in range (fn35:fn70)</p>

<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Whenever I'm trying to save a document using F12 (save as) Onedrive prompts to login again. It shows me the message "we need a little more help" and I need to select my work account.</p>
<p>I'm using the 16.0.6741.2025 version.</p>

<p>Anyone else with this issue or an idea how to solve it to make sure it doesn't prompt frequently?</p>

<p>hi bram,</p>
<p>i think you may add your office 365 account as your microsoft account alias in outlook online, so please check if you have done it by logging into outlook online with your office 365 account. if you can log in, it shows you have done it.</p>
<p>if you have done it, when you log into onedrive for business 2016, it is a normal behavior that the client will make sure which account should be used to log in because your office 365 account plays both the role of a microsoft account and an office 365
 account in fact.</p>
<p>to make the behavior go away, you need to remove your office 365 account alias via
<strong>logging into outlook online&gt;mail settings&gt;options&gt;mail&gt;accounts&gt;connected accounts&gt;manage or choose a primary alias&gt;verify the account&gt;click remove to remove the office 365 account alias</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=fccecfa6-4360-4c3a-820f-9a1557613aab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dfccecfa6-4360-4c3a-820f-9a1557613aab" /></a></p>
<p>after doing that, perform the steps below to verify if the issue goes away.<br />
1. exit all office applications.<br />
2. go to&nbsp;<b>control panel</b>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<b>user accounts</b>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<b>credential manager</b>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<b>windows credentials</b>.<br />
3. remove all credentials there(this will remove your stored passwords.).<br />
4. run regedit as an administrator to open registry editor.<br />
5. from registry editor, browse to:<b>hkey_current_user\software\microsoft\office\16.0\common\identity\identitie</b>.<br />
6. check to see if there are any folders listed under&nbsp;<b>identities</b>. if yes, delete them.<br />
7. download the fix it tool from&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the kb</a>&nbsp;and use it to clean the caches of the onedrive for business client automatically after backing up the files. then, open the onedrive for business client to
 re-sync the files.<br />
note: before running the fix it tool, please read carefully and make sure you understand the sections ”data that you lose when you run this tool” and “back up your data and record any currently synced sites” in the article.<br />
8. restart the computer and go to start-&gt;all programs-&gt;right click onedrive for business 2016-&gt;run as administrator.</p>
<p>please let us know the outcome at your convenience.</p>
<p>thanks,<br />

<p>hi bram,</p>
<p>the issue may be caused by that you configured your work or school account as the account to log into outlook online. after you do that, the work or school account plays both the role of a microsoft account and an office 365 account in fact.
 so when you log into onedrive for business, the client will not make sure which role the work or school account plays and the popup“<b>we need a little more help</b>” will appear.<br />
to clarify if your scenario is this, could you confirm and reply to the following for our troubleshooting?<br />
1. have you checked the page “ <b>manage your account aliases</b>”? what’s the outcome? could you stay on the page like the following and give us a screenshot?</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=09e45bf6-f185-40fd-8bb3-d8a5a166eb6c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d09e45bf6-f185-40fd-8bb3-d8a5a166eb6c" /><br />
</a>2. can you log into outlook online with the work or school account?<br />
3. if you use another account to do a test, what’s the outcome? does the issue happen in all users’ accounts in your organization?<br />
4. if you do a test on another sharepoint site collection, what’s the result? does the issue occur in all the sharepoint site collections?</p>
<p>please let us know the updates at your convenience.</p>

<p>i seem to have the same problem. there is only one difference: i use different accounts for my micrsoft/live account and o365 account. the issue i have is with onedrive business, onedrive personal works fine.</p>
<p>please accept my apologies in advance if this is not the correct thread, but it seemed the best match to my problem i could find.</p>
<ol>
<li>the problem occurs when i try to save each and every office file, every time. regardless of the office file version, too. (tested office 2003, 2013 and 2016 files)
</li><li>as suggested in some other threads, i disabled the option "use office 2016 to sync office files that i open" in the onedrive client. after doing so, i needed to login in
<em>one more time for each office app </em>- but from thereon it worked fine. </li><li>as soon as i (re-)enable "use office to sync", the login prompts come back. on all apps, every file, all the time.
</li><li>it is irrelevant whether i try to save the file locally to "my pc" or straight to onedrive business. the symptoms are exactly the same.
</li><li>i tried clearing the cached credentials as suggested in other threads.&nbsp;when i restarted onedrive, i&nbsp;was prompted for a login (as expected) and onedrive started up normally.&nbsp;but that didn't seem to make any difference, the problem still persists..
</li><li>here is a screenshot of word showing the problem ("anmeldung erforderlich" means "login required"):<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/fud/filedownloadhandler.ashx?fid=fba8e617-1cfb-4d21-9f3f-4e331e3adb74" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2ffud%2ffiledownloadhandler.ashx%3ffid%3dfba8e617-1cfb-4d21-9f3f-4e331e3adb74" /><br />
<br />
</a></li><li>according to word/excel/ppt,&nbsp;my office 2016&nbsp;seems to be&nbsp;correctly connected to&nbsp;my office365 business account. the account is also linked to windows itself.<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/fud/filedownloadhandler.ashx?fid=f10cd4bf-8a40-45a1-b49a-b8db87cbda4d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2ffud%2ffiledownloadhandler.ashx%3ffid%3df10cd4bf-8a40-45a1-b49a-b8db87cbda4d" /><br />
<br />
</a></li><li>really bizarre is that even when i abort the login just by closing the login prompt, all office apps&nbsp;correctly proceed to save the file to onedrive! this, although&nbsp;all office apps insist on there being an error.<br />
so the functionality itself seems fine, but the onedrive client (or is it office itself?) is having trouble understanding that.<br />
<br />
</li><li>onedrive business otherwise syncs fine - for example through files i add/modify through explorer, the web ui or a smartphone. only office 2016 seems affected.
</li></ol>
<p>i&nbsp;use office 2016 current version (updates are enabled, regular release schedule) and windows 10 build 10586.318 (updates are enabled).</p>
<p>one detail that <em>might</em> be relevant:&nbsp;we&nbsp;changed&nbsp;our main internet domain and changed all&nbsp;my accounts (windows + o365) to the new domain.</p>
<p>the workaround (disabled "use office to sync") currently works. but in the not too near future, i will hire two new employees and we will want to collaborate and concurrently work on our projects. how can i make it work again?</p>

<p>It's a typical authentication issue and won't be fixed until Msft overhauls the way authentication works in O365. They're in denial about the issue and continually post workarounds like the above none of which are a reliable fix.</p>

                    <p>I've updated to windows 10 and using Microsoft&nbsp; office 2007. Every since my update I'm not able to print any Microsoft documents, error message in printer&nbsp;&nbsp;status box&nbsp;stays in the "idle mode" and does not print. however I can print from the internet and
 emails with out difficulty. </p>
<p>Does anyone know how to fix it. I've called HP and they uninstalled the printer drivers and trouble shoot for about 3 hours and problem exits. thank you</p>

<h2>            There is a temporary problem with the service.  Please try again later.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp; I tried logging in to my msn.com email account this morning just as I have for over 10 years.&nbsp; I was immediately redirected to change my password.&nbsp; I entered the information to change my password, but still could not log in with my new password.&nbsp;
 I followed the steps to reset my password and entered an alternate email address.&nbsp; I did receive a link from msn to reset my password. However, every time I click the link, I get the message "There's a temporary problem with the service. Please try again.
 If you continue to receive this message, try again later.'&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; I am very concerned my account has been compromised.&nbsp; Is this an issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I have already tried to cut and paste the link to reset the password, and I have tried from an alternate computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am very concerned and need access to this account. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have called MSN numerous times and every time the person I talk to routes me to a message that eventually directs me to this site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had to create a separate email account just to log into this site and post this question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to a quick response,</p>

            <p>Jethro,&nbsp; I have been trying to log in through login.live.com and account.live.com for several days.&nbsp; It asks me to change my password, and then won't accept the password change.&nbsp; I have tried to reset my password multiple times, but when I click on the link
 I am sent, I continue to get the 'there is a temporary problem message.' </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went through the 'I think I have been hacked process' and provided all the necessary information and MSN sent me an email saying 'congratulations, we confirm you are the owner of the account.'&nbsp; They sent me another link to reset my password, and when I
 click on it, I get the same 'temporary problem' message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took my computer to Staples and they cleared the cache. I tried all the same resets and password changes from there.&nbsp; I have also tried with another computer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP!!! I have tried everything.&nbsp; Can I not talk to someone on the phone that can talk me through this??? I am in the process of applying for jobs and mortgages as we are relocating, and there are some very important documents I need to access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I PAY for this account every year.&nbsp; I need support!&nbsp; Please help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you,</p>
<p>Gina</p>

    <title>Excel Formula counting every other column - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dave woloszyk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Formula counting every other column</h2>
                    <p>Trying to find a solution for a formula in excel.</p>
<p>I currently have this formula:</p>
<p>numerator&nbsp;part of the formula works;&nbsp; the counta (denominator)&nbsp;does not work.</p>
<p>I have twenty columns and every other column has a alpa/number drop down box.&nbsp; I.E. 1-effective, 2-Learning/needs improvement, etc.&nbsp; The columns in between alpha-numberic are text fields.</p>
<p>In the numerator, I'm trying to count only the alpha/number columns and the current counta formula is counting ALL columns, any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>=ROUND((COUNTIF(C7:U7,"1 - Ineffective")*1+(COUNTIF(C7:U7,"2 - Learning / Needs Improvement")*2+(COUNTIF(C7:U7,"3 - Effective")*3+(COUNTIF(C7:U7,"4 - Highly Effective")*4+(COUNTIF(C7:U7,"5 - Exceptional")*5)))))/(COUNTA(C7:U7)),0)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using this formula for the denominator but unsure how to get it to place nice with the numerator formula, I think this would work as denominator but get #value error</p>
<p>=SUMPRODUCT(--(MOD(COLUMN(C7:V7),2)=1),--(C7:V7&gt;0))</p>

            <p>Not sure if I am on the same wave length but CountA&nbsp;works with all cells containing data and Count only with cells containing numeric. Therefore the following returns the number of cells with text in the range A2:N2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=COUNTA(A2:N2)-COUNT(A2:N2)</p>
