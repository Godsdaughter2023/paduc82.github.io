<h2>            Build 10586&#58; Each new build resets my wish to ignore Windows Firewall warnings</h2>
                    <p>I do not want to use Windows Firewall, because I have a perfectly good wireless router with SPI, etc. So, I have WF turned off and I turn off all warnings about it. Every time I upgrade to a new build, Windows warns me again. This is not a really big deal
 but more of an annoyance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, in this build, the watermark in the lower right hand corner of the screen is now gone. This is intended, correct ? On edit: Never mind, I see this is correct since this is Threshold 2.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes I have done all that. However, EVERY time I update my build, Windows forces me to IGNORE the warnings all over again. I don't need to be reminded, because I have a perfectly good hardware firewall with SPI. As I said, this is annoying to have to do it
 every single build. </p>

            <p>EDIT: Just made some grammatical changes and added missing words.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just ran into this for a similar issue, and it really irritates all of us when a Microsoft Support person responds, and demonstrates the fact that he or she never actually read the question, but responded with a "template" answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The user, Ecstasy,&nbsp;said that he/she already turned the firewall "off", so they obviously don't need instructions from you on how to do it&nbsp;... but that is all you&nbsp;gave them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The user, Ecstasy, said that Windows 10 then complains about the firewall being off, so they have to go turn off the "alert", to keep it from continually bothering them to turn it back on.&nbsp; You would have thought that you, T Kiran Kishore, in following&nbsp;with
 your&nbsp;previous line of ignorance, would have proceeded to tell&nbsp;the user how to turn off the warnings.&nbsp; However, you neglected to do that, and rightly so, because the user had just specified that they knew how to do that, as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. What the user actually was doing, was complaining about the fact that, after each new Preview Build is installed, Windows turns the firewall back on,&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;the warning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same frustration, with not just the firewall, but most things we users usually tweak.&nbsp; However, I&nbsp;have learned to&nbsp;live with it, rather than wasting my time asking someone like you, who should know better, a serious question, that&nbsp;you don't even
 have&nbsp;the courtesy to read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look, when someone is frustrated enough to submit a question,&nbsp;it is&nbsp;already enough of an excruciating&nbsp;experience, due to the fact that we will have to wait until someone responds before we know if their is a fix or workaround.&nbsp; However, after waiting for
 an answer, for&nbsp;sometimes days or even weeks, it's really frustrating and depressing to find out&nbsp;they've wasted their time, simply&nbsp;because you couldn't take 15 seconds to read the question.&nbsp; The 1st clue you gave was when you started explaining what a firewall
 does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, we know that some things will be set back,&nbsp;and that is what the user was complaining about.&nbsp; Your response paints an awful picture of your entire support structure, indicating&nbsp;that there is no one there that really cares.&nbsp; Is that the message you were
 trying to pass along to us, T Kiran Kishore?&nbsp; Are you getting paid by the number of responses you complete, or do you just not care?&nbsp; Aren't you actually paid&nbsp;for your knowledge?&nbsp; If not, then why are you there ... really?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>The way you handled this&nbsp;IS exactly why the user only tried 1 time to clarify their original query</strong></em></span>.&nbsp; You know, there is no shame is stating you have no clue how to help the person because
 it at least, tells us that we should seek advice elsewhere.&nbsp; Another approach you&nbsp;could take would be to let another moderator handle the question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, let me reiterate what the user&nbsp;<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>WAS</strong></span></em> saying/asking ...&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">There is absolutely no reason for&nbsp;most people&nbsp;to employ the use of a software firewall
 when they are already using a router, especially&nbsp;in very small networks/home offices,&nbsp;because a router already has a "hardware firewall" built in</span>.&nbsp; Even Microsoft acknowledges that having multiple firewalls can cause severe trouble when trying to get
 multiple devices to networked together, and a hardware firewall is much more difficult to get around than a software firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Extrapolating from the user's original statement, you can conclude that&nbsp;they were&nbsp;suggesting, like many of us have been doing for years, that the installation should&nbsp;take into account tweaks and other adjustments that&nbsp;the user may have made previously, rather
 than just overlaying everything with the defaults.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In their defense, and my support of it, those of us who use your Operating Systems more than the rest,&nbsp;spend countless hours trying to adjust it to work the best in our&nbsp;environments.&nbsp; What should happen is, the OS should ask at some point, "Would you like
 me to reset all settings to their defaults (if you respond, "No", then Windows will leave&nbsp;adjustments to various&nbsp;settings alone).&nbsp; Resetting to the default can alleviate some issues that the user may or may not have caused, and that might be what the person
 wants.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;in all other cases, you can pretty much bet they want you to leave their changes alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are killing the spirit of the Windows 10 Insider Preview&nbsp;by undoing many of the things we need or want, and&nbsp;having&nbsp;to redo all of these changes adds more&nbsp;work to our plate, which takes time away from testing,&nbsp;especially when we have multiple systems
 we are testing with.&nbsp; Because of this, we have far less time to test the stuff you want us to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the future, please take the necessary time, not just to&nbsp;read the question, but to understand it, and then respond with some information or suggestions that&nbsp;the user can use.&nbsp; Otherwise, please stay off the board!</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 won&#39;t set default delivery location</h2>
                    <p>Good Day,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have spent the past 2 hours trying to get Outlook 2010 to set the default delivery location to a new .pst. I have set the in the account options the new delivery location closed outlook and rebooted the pc. Opened up Outlook again after logging in and
 the new .pst is at the top of the list, But all mail and sent items still saving to the old pst. Where can i find the regedit location to change this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I did exactly the same. But still nothing happened. That file has made itself as a fake system file and now not even a single anti virus can detect it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Because of that virus i am not able to use my edge browser and neither google chrome plus I am not able to login to any of my accounts like gmail or facebook. A lot of add pages opens by themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Now i am planning to revert to the previo version of my OS</p>

            <p>Hello.<br />
<br />
Did you try to remove the Virus yourself?<br />
<br />
Go to Task Manager and click Startup, there after disable all programs which might be contained with a Virus.<br />
<br />
Try to launch Windows is safe mode and delete the Virus. <br />
<br />
After that try to enable the Anti Virus/Firewall.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Etc, try to&nbsp;download software like Malwarebytes Defender, which that I would recommend to use, if you're having trouble with ad-ware.</p>

<h2>            ActiveSync 4.5 issues</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was running Activesync 4.1 and had no problems with syncing my pda up to two computer systems. One of these systems is a shared system and ActiveSync was removed from the system for some reason. I have since installed version 4.5. Here is my problem, now
 each time I sync up to one of the systems ActiveSync forces me to establish a new partnership. The only changed that was made was upgrading from 4.1 to 4.5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any one has any suggestions on what could be the problem? Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks</p>

            Try deleting the partnerships on your device and restart. Re-connect to establish a&nbsp;new partnership. Disconnect, wait a few minutes and connect once more to see if it asks you to create a new partnership.

<p>Hi grantWilliams2,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office 365 is a subscription service that ensures you always have the most up-to-date modern productivity tools from Microsoft. Office 2019 is sold as a one-time purchase, which means you pay a single, up-front cost to get Office apps
 for one computer. There are many differences between them, for more detailed information, please refer to
<strong>What’s the different between Office 365 and Office 2019</strong> of the article below:

<h2>            Word and Excel files suddenly won&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a client who has a shared folder on their server where the store documents of all types(Word,Excel,PDF,etc.). Each user has there own folder but all are accessible for any user.&nbsp; On Friday 09/06 everyone was able to open .doc,.docx,.xls,.xlsx files
 from the server and work with them.&nbsp; On Monday 09/09 nobody was able to open Word or Excel files without them being prompted to convert the document or that the spreadsheet was not in the format that it was saved in.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Word docs, once you tell
 it to convert it's just garbage on the screen.&nbsp; Excel files will not even open.&nbsp; If I try to open a doc with Wordpad from the server it is the same result.&nbsp; I have been wrestling with this for 4 days now and I have hit a brick wall.&nbsp; Does anybody have any
 ideas before I go completely insane?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; If I try and restore a file from offsite backup it has the same result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            In case anybody is still monitoring this thread, the cause has been identified.&nbsp; This is a result of a ransomware Cryptolock infection.&nbsp; Apparently this was a new strain of virus that was detected sometime over that weekend.&nbsp; The infected machine basically
 locks any file belonging to Microsoft Office with a 512 bit encryption key(which there is no tool available).&nbsp; It attacks any file available including network shares.&nbsp; Delivery method was via email with a .ZIP attachment which had an .EXE file inside.&nbsp; If
 executed the machine became infected.&nbsp; The only solution is restoring from backup but if a machine is still infected it will encrypt the files again.&nbsp; Hope this helps

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From Tools on the Internet Explorer Menu Bar&gt; Compatibility View Settings, add the site to the Compatibility View list. It shouldn't matter whether it is a secure site or not.</p>

<div>For one of website the login fails in IE 10 but works fine in IE 8. So i changed compatibity mode by pressing F12 and then changing it to IE 8.when i checked login,it was working. So i want to set this website to be opened in IE 8 mode always.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you only wish to view a few selected sites in Compatibility View, placing the site in the Compatibility View list will do this automatically. You will not have to use F12&gt; Browser Mode each visit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It appears that Compatibility View in IE10 will emulate IE7, but this may still resolve the login issue on that site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try the Compatibility View list.</p>

            I have set&nbsp;Compatibility&nbsp; view for the website for which login was failing. But it didn't work.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Then i tried the login for the website in a PC with IE 7.In IE 7 login worked fine.&nbsp;</div>
<div>But with IE 10 Compatibility View it is not working(But you have mentioned that "Compatibility View in IE10 will emulate IE7"). So what is going wrong?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also can we change Compatibility View to emulate as IE 8 by default?</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry, I don't know why using&nbsp;IE7 resolves the issue, but Compatibility Mode doesn't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14382636/how-to-force-ie10-to-render-page-in-ie9-document-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14382636/how-to-force-ie10-to-render-page-in-ie9-document-mode</a></p>
<p>This tells how to add code to a webpage to invoke a particular document mode when a user visits the site, so it's not something you do on your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee330730%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#browser_emulation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee330730%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#browser_emulation</a></p>
<p>it appears that if you use either of these registry edits:</p>
<p>8888(0x22B8) or 8000(0x1F40) that all (1st case) or some (2nd case) websites will display in IE8 mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until the website is updated to work with IE10 it may be easier to use F12&gt; Browser Mode on each visit.</p>

<h2>            I cannot receive emails on my account. It says my mailbox is full.</h2>
                    <div>This is hugely unhelpful.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My Outlook.com account is not receiving a huge chunk of emails, because it tells senders my inbox is full, but I have had no notifications from Outlook.com. I assume it relates to my "account is growing too fast", but Outlook have not told me that.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have removed thousands of emails from my inbox to an archive folder, and deleted many, but it has not helped.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've looked at other forum posts and Outlook help, but Outlook's unclear criteria of "account is growing too fast" means no one can diagnose the problem or understand how to remedy it. I'm not even receiving that many emails, around 10 per day.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The idea that Outlook suddenly stops receiving emails without notification is a good reason why people will start to look elsewhere for email.</div>

<p>Thank you for providing us additional information on the issue.&nbsp; I understand that your friend still unable to receive emails with attachments, this is because the available&nbsp;storage space is not enough for larger incoming emails.&nbsp; If your inbox grows too
 fast, you might not be able to send or receive any more messages. Here are some suggestions to help you manage your account so that it doesn't become too large:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create an archive. Set up a folder on your computer's hard disk where you can save large attachments, and then delete them from your inbox.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Empty your Junk and Deleted message folders. To do this, right-click the folder you want to empty, and then select
<span>Empty folder</span> from the menu.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Let us know if you have other concerns.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards!</p>

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon checking the issue you’re having with importing appointments using .CSV file, from Excel to Outlook, it seems that this feature you’re trying to perform is not possible in Outlook.com. However, on an Outlook desktop app it is. I just want to verify
 which Outlook are you using? Is it the Outlook desktop app or Outlook.com? If it is Outlook desktop app what is the
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/About-Office-What-version-of-Office-am-I-using-932788B8-A3CE-44BF-BB09-E334518B8B19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">build and version</a></strong>? Can you tell us the error message, if there is any?
 You can also send a screenshot for us to have a clear idea of the issue is all about. Because you are using .CSV file to import appointment to Outlook, I suggest trying these simple steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Excel, you can create a file and save it as a .CSV file to do that follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>File</strong> and choose <strong>Save As</strong> in the left pane.</li><li>You can change the file name if necessary. Excel won't write over your Excel workbook file; it will create a new .csv file.</li><li>You will see from the File Type drop down, choose the CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv) option.</li><li>Choose <strong>Save</strong>. You can ignore the possible data loss error if shown. Be sure to note the location of the file if there's any chance you won't remember where it is.</li><li>Close the .csv file you just created.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>To import the .CSV file to Outlook follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Click the File tab, choose Open &amp; Export in the left pane, and then click Import/Export from the Open section. Now, run the wizard as follows:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Choose <strong>Import From Another Program Or File</strong> (if necessary) and click
<strong>Next.</strong></li><li>Choose <strong>Comma Separated Values</strong> and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Browse</strong> button and work through the folder structure to select the .csv file you created earlier. Click
<strong>OK</strong> after selecting that file. This pane also lets you determine how Outlook deals with duplicate data. There won't be any in our example, but when applying this to your own work, you'll want to choose appropriately. For now, accept the default
 option, Allow Duplicates to Be Created, and click Next.</li><li>Select <strong>Calendar</strong> and click <strong>Next</strong>. If you have more than one calendar, make sure that you select correct Calendar.</li><li>Click<strong> Map Custom Fields</strong>. If necessary, check Import "<em>yourfilename</em>" to enable the Map Custom Fields option.</li><li>At this point, you must identify the Excel values to import and specify where to put them. The left pane lists the Excel fields. The right pane lists the Calendar items and shows the default mapping .The Task field isn't mapped because there's no Calendar
 field by that name. However, the date and time fields do have matching field names, so Outlook can map them correctly. You can change them if you need to, but in this case, Outlook mapped them correctly. To map the Task field, simply drag it from the left
 pane to the right pane.</li><li>When you've mapped all the desired fields, click <strong>OK</strong> and then Finish to trigger the import.</li></ol>

            <p>Probably (as is often the case!!) there are non-date values in the text [Date of Issue] field. Is there any possibility of fixing the datatype? You can run a query</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT &lt;whatever&gt; FROM [Main Table] WHERE NOT IsDate([Date of Issue]);</p>
<p>
</p><p>to find these. You can also filter out the non-dates in your query:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">SELECT *</span><br />
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The NZ() function that you used will use #12/30/1899# as the Date of Issue for all records where that field is NULL; are you certain that is what you want? You might want to put in an
 explicit text string as the second argument to NZ.</span></p>

<h2>            Bing Desktop messed up Windows Update a bit and won&#39;t change the wallpaper daily until I restart</h2>
                    <p>I installed Bing Desktop on my tablet so I could get the daily wallpaper. I installed it, and was really happy to see that my wallpaper became the Bing daily image. I heard Bing Desktop was part of Microsoft Update, so I checked Windows Update later on to
 see if there were any available updates. And that's when the problems started happening.</p>
<p>Windows Update would either give me the error code 0x800705b4 or it would take really (and I do mean REALLY) long to check for updates and install them or say it's up to date. There was a fix that was said to be permanent, but was only a fix for one day
 for me. It was to turn off Microsoft Update in Advanced Options, restart, check for updates, re-enable Microsoft Update, check for updates, and then everything would work as it should. When I discovered this fix, I was really happy to know that everything
 would be okay. So I did what the instructions told me to do, and everything seemed fine. So the next day, I wanted to see what Bing's daily image was going to be. I logged on to my tablet, but the same image from yesterday was there, and it didn't update.
 I checked Bing's website, and the daily image was changed on the website. I went to Windows Update again to see if Bing Desktop needed an update to fix this problem, and I was greeted by the same Windows Update problems from yesterday. This meant that I had
 to do the fix EVERY DAY. Yeah, I don't want to restart my tablet every day just to fix a bug. And I realized the only way for Bing Desktop to update its image is if I restarted the tablet. Is there any way to fix these problems? I'm running the latest version
 of Windows 10 (not the insider build).</p>

    <title>N86 constantly connected to packet data even when no other apps open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patwa---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N86 constantly connected to packet data even when no other apps open</h2>
                    Hello, I was wondering if anyone can assist with this. I have an N86 running the latest v30.9 firmware. I have set the default connection in Settings &gt; Connections &gt; Destinations to 'Always Ask'. However, I have noticed that my phone is still connecting
 to the internet (3G connected icon showing on the standby screen) even when no other programs are runing (according to a long 'Menu' press). When I receive a call I get a message on screen advising that the packet data connection is on hold. 'Packet data active'
 shown on screen when the call ends. The log also shows the internet connection is being made and maintained often for hours on end, e.g. through the night. Although the amount of data being sent and received is relatively small, this is still a concern for
 the future if I'm ever roaming or on a metered tariff. Any help to resolve this is much appreciated. Thanks for your time and have a pleasant day. Hussein.

<p>I have exactly the same problem. Have had my N86 for 3 months with no problem. It started connecting to data with no applications open a few days ago. I assumed it was MfE, but I have set it to connect manually and that does not solve the problem. Is there
 any chance it may be a virus? I have not updated or installed any applications recently, so it is hard to think what it may be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW - the only 'odd' applications I might suspect are MWS and JoikuSpot - both of which grab the data connection, but neither appear to be running.</p>

            Hi, I have double checked all e-mail accounts and they are all set to ask for a connection for both inbound and outbound mail. I don't have any MFE accounts, or at least none listed under Sync Mail in Messaging &gt; Settings. Likewise, I only have two pieces
 of software installed. Nuance Talks which doesn't use the internet at all, and TweetS60 which has an access point defined but is set to manual use only. Any further tips? It's damned annoying that there doesn't seem to be anything obviously wrong to cause
 the problem.

<p>I still have the problem. I have started running connection manager in background and using that to quickly disconnect the data session&nbsp;any time&nbsp;I see it. It starts up again after a few minutes normally, but can take a few hours. Very little data is transferred
 - about 4kB per hour in each direction. Any ideas anyone on what might be causing it?</p>

            Hi. Well, all user installed apps and e-mail accounts deleted and still I'm having the same problem. I'd say it's paramount this is fixed, if it is a firmware bug, as it has the potential to cost a lot of money in the wrong circumstances. It's not the
 same as say, one of the preloaded apps not working, as at least then you can find a replacement and it's not going to cost anything. At this rate I'm almost gearing up for a firmware reinstall to see if that fixes it. Although as I only did this a few days
 ago it's hard to believe how this can have happened. Can't believe more people aren't having this issue and that there isn't a fix out so far.

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for sharing the information with us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, the problem only happens on you Mac. For the further troubleshooting, I would like confirm more information based on what you have provided.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. You mentioned that the problem happens on you Mac with SharePoint/Office 365 documents Excel and Word. Does this mean the problem only happens when you open documents in Excel/Word Online in browser?
 Or does the problem also happens in Office applications? If the problem only happens when you open Excel/Word Online, I would suggest you try changing to another browser or clean the cache of the browser to check the result.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Does the problem happen when you open PowerPoint presentations or other Office applications?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The problem may also related to the internet connectivity, if it is possible, you can also try changing to another network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tisky</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Any way I can access my old facebook-linked account and transfer everything&#63;</h2>
                    <p>At the very minimum, can an admin or someone send me my contacts file, or let me into my account to GET to my contacts??&nbsp; I was forced to make a new account and I can not for the life of me find ANY of my friends.&nbsp; :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was blind-sided by this, honestly.&nbsp; Had no idea this was happening, and being kicked out of and blocked from logging into your account is a real rude way to figure that out...&nbsp; &gt;:(&nbsp; No alert message, no e-mails, no NOTHING.&nbsp; Absolutely no warning, anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can't get my contacts, chats and so on all back, I might just say piss on it and uninstall the whole thing.</p>

<p>Hi All, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There is no option to sign in to Skype through Facebook, as full deprecation is already rolled out. Even if you do use an old version who had an option to sign with Facebook it still won't work. We will remove those in time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>With regards, to any subscriptions, balance, Skype Number on the account an automatic refund should have been issued on the last week of January.</p>
<p>

<p>When have you ever been able to make a call on a handset on show in a store?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You purchased the phone first, get disapointed that the sound is so poor and your stuck with it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was stupid and paid £550 in Carphone Warehouse for the N96, friends and family also tried my handset and agree the sound on calls is terrible. My partners cheap £80 Nokia has a proper earpiece speaker and not a silly little 1mm slit and has&nbsp;excellent call
 quality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Always been a fan of Nokia, but not to get sold another expensive disapointing handset. I hate people that try talking me into Apple iPhone, but are they right? Plus you get 28 days, if you don't like it you take it back for a full refund!</p>

            When you buy a phone from the UK online store you get a 14 day period in which you can return a product if you are unhappy with it. I believe the distance selling consumer laws grant you this and as long as the product isn't damaged they can't refuse a
 refund.<br />
<br />
The site states:<br />
<br />
What if I want to return my order?<br />
When you buy something at the Nokia UK Online Shop, you have the right to a 14-day cooling off period. This means that if the product does not meet your expectations, you can contact Nokia Customer service by email or call us on 0845 0455555.<br />
Once we have received and validated the returned products you'll receive a refund within 30 days. We're not able to refund your original delivery charges.<br />

<h3> paulo_a  say:</h3>
<h2>            converter for wordperfect 5.1 works on word 2000 but doesn&#39;t work for 2003 or 2010</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I noticed that when I convert a wordperfect file (5x) using MS Word 2000, everything convert correctly; but If I try to do the same with MS Word 2003 or 2010 there are some areas that doesn't work.<br />
Particularly if a pharagraph is indented in wordperfect, MS Word 2003 or 2010 will ignore this setting, but works fine in Word 2000.
<br />
<br />
Anyone had this issue in the past ? anyone knows any patch for this issue ? <br />
<br />
Thanks very much in advance. <br />
<br />
Paulo <br />

            <p>This could be due to compatibility issue. Lot of changes are done since 2000 to 2010 version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this is due to the compatibility. If you are able to do it in 2000 version, better continue with it as the latest version might have more problems when compated to 2010.</p>

            Microsoft may have dropped or "refined" some compatibility features without documenting them.<br />
<br />
One note is converted documents, even if they look fine, are generally very complex and can be difficult to edit or easily corrupted. Best practice when converting documents for re-use is to import as plain text and format in Word using styles.<br />

                    <p>Good morning, all.</p>
<p>I own a Microsoft Lumia 950XL phone which I love so much, but it's giving me a lot of problems.</p>
<p>I live in Nigeria. Where and how much can I get a replacement battery for it, to see if it will solve my problems.</p>
<p>The phone gets hot whether with or without use, the screen flutters, turns green &amp; behaves as if it wants to explode, the battery does not charge at all or fast as usual, and the battery runs down fast, &amp; the phone shuts do anytime, even when plugged to
 power &amp; I am using it.</p>
<p>It cannot play my WhatsApp videos again for a long time now.</p>
<p>I have the latest update &amp; it has not solved any problems I had before the update.</p>
<p>What should I do, please?</p>

            <p>Thanks for your concern.</p>
<p>The suggested solutions did not help.</p>
<p>I have had to do the soft reset severally.</p>
<p>My software check is also up-to-date. </p>
<p>My contact search does not work.</p>
<p>The WhatsApp videos don't play -the phone will say format not supported or file is corrupt.</p>
<p>The phone gets hot, while in use &amp; at times when not in use.</p>
<p>The phone shuts down even when the battery level is at 38%. The battery also may not charge when connected to power but in use. When not in use, the charging is quite slow.</p>
<p>Could it be hardware, software, or battery problem?</p>
<p>Is anyone's Lumia 950XL also behaving like this?</p>
<p>It is quite so expensive to be this frustrating.</p>
<p>Please, help me.</p>
<p>Thanks all.</p>

            We understand, it is frustrating when things do not work as expected. Since the issue is still not resolved after the suggested solution did not help, the next workaround is to back up the phone and perform a
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10666/windows-phone-reset-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
hard reset</a>. To hard reset the phone, just go to <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; under
<strong>System</strong>, tap <strong>About</strong> &gt; and then tap <strong>Reset your phone.</strong><br />
<br />
Note: Please create a backup before performing the hard reset as the phone memory will be wiped out. For creating a backup, here's how:

            PRESS AND HOLD THE BACK ARROW ON THE TASK BAR, UNTIL ALL OF THE RUNNING PROGRAM TILES BECOME MINIATURIZED. THEN, TAP THE "X" IN THE UPPER RIGHT CORNER OF EACH TILE TO CLOSE EACH OF THE TILES. THIS WILL CLOSE ALL OF THE RUNNING PROGRAMS. NOW, THE PHONE
 SHOULD BE RUNNING MUCH COOLER AND USE A LOT LESS POWER. HOPE THIS HELPS.

<p><br />
Assuming that you have Internet Explorer 10 and Windows 7 (since that's the category this forum is in), then Outlook's spell checker is functional due to the fact that IE 10 includes it in the "Managed Add-ons" (You can check this by accessing those and scrolling
 to the bottom of the dropdown arrows in the Managed Add-on screen <strong>&lt;edit: Note
<em>highlight Spell Correction and make certain that the box "Enable spelling correction" is checked.&nbsp;
</em>This box is located at the bottom of the screen when you highlight the&nbsp;add-on called Spell Correction</strong>).&nbsp; The Outlook spell checker will automatically decipher your incorrect spelling.&nbsp; If it finds a mistake, it will underline the word in red (or
 make an automatic correction for you).&nbsp; If the word is underlined, right click and a popup box will offer several choices for your consideration.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We are users of Office 365 and we have our Document libraries synced to Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>Recently, we realised that one of our users' libraries had stopped syncing and hadn't been syncing for several days.</p>
<p>All of the work that they had done in those days hadn't been uploaded to our servers.</p>
<p>The user didn't receive any warnings or notifications that syncing had stopped. Is there any way that SharePoint can warn us when this happens?</p>

<p>yes. if sync fails, there will be an x tick on the document; if sync succeeds, there will be a √ tick on the document; if the document is syncing, there will be a circle tick on the document. see the screenshot below.</p>

    <title>duplicate accounts in Outlook 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> macfreeman7  say:</h3>
<h2>            duplicate accounts in Outlook 2010</h2>
                    
<p>So I recently purchased the new Office 2010 from my school. I am dealing with a particular issue with the new Outlook. Both Outlook 2007 and 2010 have an easy method to set up your gmail (or other email accounts) with office. My gmail is synced with Outlook
 every time I get a new email/send, or whatever. My issue is that now I have an Outlook Data File in addition to a gmail account. This means there are duplicates of inbox, sent folders, etc. Sometimes when I type a new email and save it, the draft goes to the
 Outlook Data File and not the gmail draft folder. Is there a way to merge them? I tried deleting the Outlook Data file but it won't let me. I even tried uninstalling Outlook, but I can't get rid of it. I want my default account to be the gmail account, but
 when I try to change it, the option is grayed out.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help!</p>
