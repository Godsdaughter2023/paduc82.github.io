<h2>            Hi, two intruders were using my pc were caught by my mcafee as &#34;192.168.1.3 unknown device&#34;</h2>
                    Hi, g'day to you all... My mcafee protection caught two intruders, called "192.168.1.3 unknown device"s. I blocked them using my mcafee, but sure still need some explanation on this, how did these people "join my network" as mcafee said, and what does
 it mean "use my pc", did they download any of my files or passwords, etc..., My wifi is switched off, and my modem is connected to my laptop pc by wire...&nbsp;many thanks

            <p><span>Are you sure that wireless access has been turned off in the router?</span></p>
<p><span>To check which computers (computer names) are connected to your router, you can look at the router’s configuration pages or for a simple list, open a</span><span>
 Run window (Windows Logo</span><span> key+R</span><span>), type
</span><span>cmd and press Enter, now type NET VIEW (the capitals are for clarity only) and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>To see more information, using your wired computer access the router’s set up details. This is done in a home network by typing 192.168.x.y into a browser’s
 Address bar. The values of x and y depend upon the make of router. If you don’t know the values, open a Run window (Windows Logo key+R), type cmd /k ipconfig (note the two spaces), press Enter, make a note of the Default Gateway address and type it into the
 browser’s Address bar. <span>When asked for the user name and password, type the default values, often admin and admin
<span>&nbsp;</span>(if they are not known, look in the router’s user manual).</span></span></p>
<p><span>Once you have gained access to the router, look for (usually) an Advanced section named DHCP Table or similar wording. This will show all
 connected (and expired) IP addresses that have been connected, together with their names.</span></p>

            PowerShell exposes parts of the registry as drives (you can run&nbsp;Get-PSDrive to see the drives available on your system). Just like changing to a disk drive, you need to put the colon after the name, so what you need to do is
<div><br />
<div>Set-Location HKLM:</div>
<div><br />
<div>(Or you can use "cd HKLM:" because cd is an alias of Set-Location)</div>

            Try these first to see if they work:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />Also run the System File Checker utility:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations
<br />
<br />Restart your system

 conflicts when a program is installed or an update was done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After performing an a clean boot, you can do a System Restore to to take your PC back in time where the PC was working properly You can follow this

                    So I traced over a picture which I set as current layer accidently but overlapped it with my current paintbrush. I had already made a starry background for it&nbsp;and used that as the background layer. I made the picture I was tracing watercolour because that
 was see-through. I've now finished It but I don't know how to get rid of the picture. Here's the picture which might help.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a606a301-cbfb-4c17-9dc3-3e45e2f15fbd" />&nbsp;

<h2>            Preventing Access to Safe Mode</h2>
                    <p>Problem: K9 Web Protection software is disabled when loading in Safe Mode, allowing unfettered access to the internet in Safe Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried: Installing K9 both normally, and in Safe Mode (appeared that future loading in Safe Mode removed the k9 installation). Manually added K9 to registry, but was able to delete Registry entries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would either like to prevent access to Safe Mode (multiple user accounts would be ok to achieve this), or understand if a different accountability/filter software could be loaded and functional in Safe Mode (was thinking about switching to something like
 Accountable2You or CovenantEyes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, I was wondering if a multi-app kiosk might serve as a solution, but seems like a lot more layers than may be necessary.</p>

<br />
Firstly you should NOT have used the import function at all. You may well find that you will run into problems with your data having done that.<br />
<br />
The default location for pst files in Windows 7 is C:\Users\{Your Account Name}\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook

            I used export/import for emails &amp; contacts in Outlook 2007 and it worked a treat.<br />
<br />
You should be able to find where outlook is storing your by going to Tools-&gt;Accont Settings. For me the location is as Gordon states in his reply.

<p><br />
And you will find you have problems on-going by doing that.<br />
<br />
The import/export function has been broken for a long time.<br />
NO-BODY in all the Outlook groups recommends using import/export at all.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
(Courtesy of Russ Valentine [MVP-Outlook])</p>
<p>Importing an entire PST may well corrupt your profile and may create a ghost <br />
PST that you can't close. Importing PST's will lose:<br />
1.&nbsp; Custom Forms<br />
2.&nbsp; Custom Views<br />
3.&nbsp; Connections between contacts and activities<br />
4.&nbsp; Received dates on mail<br />
5.&nbsp; Birthdays and anniversaries in calendar<br />
6.&nbsp; Journal connections<br />
7.&nbsp; Distribution Lists</p>
<p>Opening a PST file will preserve all of these. That is why we do not advise <br />
people to import a native file into Outlook.</p>

            As a tip: &nbsp;after you open the file natively (the PST), you can then drag and drop items from it to the related folders in your primary folders, and the data will be retained.

<br />
Ah. That's a different story.<br />
What you need to do is to ascertain what format your Webmail can import, then export from Outlook in that format...

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I have a question that is along the lines of this thread.&nbsp;&nbsp; As of this date I still have Win 7 and Office 2003 with Outlook 2003 also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know where in what directory structure the files are supposed to be located as described earlier in this thread, and I have successfully migrated my outlook data PST file to a separate drive partition (where I have all my user files located for backup
 purposes) many years ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many years ago (no correlation to the files being moved) &nbsp;I had an well populated&nbsp;Address Book with many contacts.&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time I did not have the knowledge to locate and backup the PAB file for OUTLOOK (or maybe the whole system) before the system failure
 took everything away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though I can find the PAB file as pointed out, my efforts to prove that the PAB file contains anything useful is becoming confusing to me.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can make changes to the contacts (add and delete too) in OUTLOOK in the Contacts tab, I see no effect on the file date and file size of the PAB file itself.&nbsp; The file size is 265KB and the date is 11/27/2013.&nbsp; I make&nbsp;backups of the individual PAB and PST
 files at the occasional point in time before or after a&nbsp;major event, just in case something bad might happen.&nbsp; This gives me the added benefit to see the progression in the file growth changes.&nbsp; I have seen no changes in date or size of the PAB file for all
 this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, besides all that, OUTLOOK has a place (a menu item)&nbsp;where it looks like I can change the PAB file I'm pointing to while processing the OUTLOOK messages and Contacts.&nbsp;&nbsp;That being&nbsp;in the TOOLS menu and the sub-item ADDRESS BOOK.</p>
<p>At the current time,&nbsp;I've been working on this again to solve the issue, &nbsp;I now am getting an error that is more serious (but it doesn't effect my ability to get to the Contacts that I've had in my OUTLOOK file for a few years).&nbsp; Basically, the message boils
 down to:&nbsp; Either the Contacts folder related to the current address list can not be opened due to non-existence or&nbsp;I have no&nbsp;permissions.&nbsp; If I change the Contacts to another item that is listed in that requestor that I mentioned, the error changes to the
 list of Contacts that I have in OUTLOOK at the time, NOW!</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify more:&nbsp; That requestor that pops up shows three lines of information.&nbsp; The first line contains the text "Outlook Address Book".&nbsp; The second line and the third line both have the word "CONTACTS" in it and it is moved over to the right&nbsp;(indented)
 just a couple of characters.&nbsp; Depending on which line of the three is selected with the cursor, the results change from an error to showing the list of Contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is proving that the Address Book and Contacts are the same thing and those Contacts are contained in the current PST file itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOW, people out there might have the question, as I do, why is it not a separate PAB file so that another application
 can use the same Contacts list that exists.&nbsp; It would make sense for it to be that way.&nbsp;&nbsp;And due to the fact that it is talked about like that in various text's,&nbsp; I had the impression that it was what I was attempting to locate - that separate PAB file!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that I've written all this information (a dissertation about my progression in determining what is obvious to everyone else),&nbsp; what shall I do with this?&nbsp; I'd like to simply have someone that is more sure of the process than me to tell me if that is
 the way it is.&nbsp; In fact: There is NO Separate PAB file for Addresses and the Contacts are kept in the OUTLOOK.PST file.&nbsp; Please be gentle.&nbsp; I don't want to be ridiculed for stating the obvious that everyone else knows.&nbsp; I've taken the time to lay this out
 as directly and plainly and showing my&nbsp;thought process progression to analyze the facts at hand.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I came across this post whilst searching for some information regarding where Outlook 2003 stores contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My query has been solved.</p>
<p>However I would suggest that you may not get many responses to your question as you have posted in a 'dead' thread - I say dead as the thread has not been updated since 2010!</p>

</p><p>You are probably better off starting your own thread...</p>

    <title>How to report someone hacking my GT and steal MS points - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to report someone hacking my GT and steal MS points</h2>
                    
<p>I can't find where to put this so hopefully this will do.</p>
<p>Story short as poss.</p>
<p>31st Dec my GT got hacked while I slept, all my Microsoft points stolen and used in Fifa 12 on&nbsp;Premium gold pack x19 and 1x gold pack.</p>
<p>When I signed in it said GT had been used on another console,went to get my 4yr old the game "Joe Danger" to find my points gone&nbsp;also last game played was FIFA 12 and I had 2 achivements... after checking this out online its a pretty massive problem and
 been going on quitely for almost a year (which is totally unaccptable may I add)</p>
<p>Basically what we have here&nbsp;is digital money laundering and outright theft.</p>
<p>So in a nutshell I've reported it, and now had GT suspended for a month+ while they look into it, no options offered to continue online with temp GT, no sorry but I'll get 1 whole month of FREE gold when I return, Oh wow!! like I'm paid up now and losing
 a month, so I don't feel bad I rung The Sun national paper&nbsp;and spoke to reporter and contacted BBC Watchdog as this to be frank is being taken way to lightly.</p>
<p>Anyway my REAL point of post lol!!</p>
<p>8 hours after I noticed I'd been robbed I got a message out of no where from a random Gamertag asking if I'd been hacked!!!! kinda taken back I said "eh yeah!" I've just reported it online, to which he was like "Oh really what are they going to do etc" so
 at this point I was like this is weird, then I get a freinds request from him, I then check his Gamer profile and he's playing FIFA 12 !!!!! HARDLY COINCIDENCE surely?</p>
<p>So I know we can't name names and we must protect the bad eggs??? how do I go about reporting this so he's at least looked into?? I know about via Xbox console, but I've yet to see that ever work over the years and figure its just some kind of punch bag
 that actually does nothing until countless reports are filed.</p>
<p>Can anyone advise?</p>

<p>@DonGirl, Xbox Customer Support will absolutely assist in compromised account scenarios, as they have in the past. &nbsp;Microsoft has also been going to great lengths to improve security measures to help prevent abusers from locking legitimate account owners
 out of their own profiles. &nbsp;If you have a situation with which you need assistance, I would recommend starting up a new thread of your own, and the community here will do their best to assist. &nbsp;Also, this thread is old.</p>

<p>I was playing with someone in a custom game (<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>) then he said oh did i tell that i'm getting mods tomorrow? And I responded, Why? Then he showed me them (this is all on mw3 Xbox360 btw) they were invisible,lag switch and boot
 you off, and turn your xbox off in game. He said he could only use custom games right now because his friend has not made them "ban proof" yet. I said this because i want something done about them. P.S i was in his game so i have evidence but no footage, and
 im pretty sure you guys can look at his past gameplay. Thanks if you read this and do something about it.</p>

<p>I have only played an elf as a Mage. &nbsp;So you get the Circle of Magi Origin. &nbsp;You will get different conversations when you go back to your place of origin, that's all I am aware of. &nbsp;Have you or are you getting any dlc? &nbsp;If you are going to play the Witch
 Hunt dlc, I think it could be interesting if you play through that with an imported Dalish Elf character, for reasons I wont spoil.</p>

<p>The City elf origin is way better than the Dalish Elf origin. The city elf origin story feels more personal and It shows you why the elf hate the humans. In my opinion the best origin stories are in this order:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Dwarf Noble </li><li>City Elf </li><li>Human Noble </li><li>Mage </li><li>Dwarf Commoner </li><li>Dalish Elf </li></ol>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Sorry about quoting you from a few months back. Just wanted to give my impressions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Human Noble: I feel most connected to the setting with this background. All kinds of conversations take place throughout the game about a place called Highever and it's utterly meaningless without the context of this background. It also makes Arl Renden
 Howe suddenly significant in the context of the greater plot, where as otherwise he feels like an afterthought. In my opinion, it also gives the character more motivation to do something about the Blight, and more reason to care about what happens to Ferelden
 in general.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; City Elf: This is the origin that makes the most sense for someone who <em>
wants</em> to be a Grey Warden and doesn't simply find themselves recruited with little choice, particularly if you're playing a female elf. Anger, righteous fury, and the desperate desire to escape a life that is desolate in nearly every conceivable way can
 be found here, especially once the horrible things that happen in the middle of it make it impossible for you to say at home. By the end of the City Elf origin, I not only had no choice to be a Grey Warden, I&nbsp;wanted to be one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Mage Origin: A very involved and entertaining start to the game. It gives significance to Irving and more importantly to Jowan, and is a great place to start if you like having Wynne in your party. I also felt this origin, though it might be my own impressions
 coloring it, gives you more in common with Morrigan and makes her easier to relate to. My major complaint about it is how Irving handles&nbsp;your involvement if you agreed to assist him, for someone who is supposedly the First Enchanter of the Circle, his handling
 of the situation would have landed you in nearly as much trouble as you would have been if you had&nbsp;assisted Jowan upfront.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Dwarf Commoner: Like the City Elf, this&nbsp;is a good place to start&nbsp;for a character who would&nbsp;find escape in the life of a Grey Warden compared to their home life. I don't like how it&nbsp;plays out:&nbsp;guards exist at all entrances of the Proving Grounds to prevent
 someone from interfering with the&nbsp;Provings themselves, so it seems utterly ludicrous that some drunk, stumbling moron can somehow make it&nbsp;past them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, its somewhat unremarkable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) Dalish Elf: I hate to upset any fans of the Dalish, but I find the Dalish very boring. The idea that elves are impoverished and destitute as opposed to being these majestic, otherworldly beings is interesting, but the Dalish themselves seem to be a substitute
 for any noble, primitive culture that was eradicated by a technologically superior invader. They've elevated the stories and lore of their long buried past into, in their opinion, immutable fact which cannot be conclusively proven or disproven and yet they
 are quite quick to point out just how right their forebearers were and just how wrong everyone else is. The fact that when you finally get to play out the Brecilian Forest chapter it is almost indistinguishable from if you were any other origin-Warden just
 makes it that much more boring to start as one. It's just not interesting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6) Dwarf Noble: It might be surprising that I'm putting this here given my reasons for the Human Noble having the top spot. Fact is, this is an excellent place to understand Dwarven politics and it makes the Orzammar section of the game more interesting
 than it would have been as a different origin. I don't mind that you are manipulated in it, and I don't mind what happens as a result of it. What I mind is that you have no way of doing anything about it, even if your efforts would be proven futile in the
 end. Once Bhelen has given you his warning, you just...go to bed...even though this a celebration in your honor and you've just been warned of a possible threat on your life. You can't speak with Endrin, or Trian, or do any investigating on your own. For better
 or for worse, the fact you aren't even allowed that little bit of conceit before the net is drawn tight around you is infuriating from an RPG standpoint: I want the option of doing something about it even if the end I'm unable to make a difference. I don't
 want to simply have it told to me, go to bed, and then ooops, look what happened while you were sleeping. I also find that if you decide that Bhelen betrayed you, once you return to Orzammar there really isn't any conflict in choosing between Harrowmont and
 Bhelen for the crown; the avenue of approaching that conflict that another origin might have had is somewhat closed off if you play the character's rage out accurately. It's railroading of the story in the worst possible way. As I said, I don't mind the outcome,
 but I would have liked the sense that I had done more about it than just having gone to bed and waited for the inevitable without trying to do anything about it.</p>

<h2>            Questions about Windows 8.1. Need your assistance in purchasing a new computer</h2>
                    <p>HI There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately after only 4 years, my computer has gone to heaven.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in the process of researching the purchase of a new computer, not sure if this is the correct forum, but I am hoping for some help please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I understand that I must NOT purchase Windows 8, as it really was a flawed system so Windows 8.1 is the way to go. If that is the case, does it have to be touch screen, I find that it will be uncomfortable to keep on leaving forward from my chair to navigate.</p>
<p>2. What is the best Intel to purchase and how can I check that I am buying a good computer
</p>
<p>3. What is Windows RT - is that a better operating system than windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance in terms of a new computer if that is indeed possible would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Original title: Windows 8.1</em></p>

            If you want to use devices like Bluetooth speaker it will make a difference. You can always buy a Bluetooth USB dongle if you later want it, and they aren't that expensive.

            <p>1 - 8 doesn't have any significant flaws - what people are calling flaws are just a matter of personal preference (and Microsoft not doing enough to make the transition to the new design smoother for people.) It's stable, reliable and quick in my experience.
 You can easily update to 8.1 if you pick up a copy of 8, but it would be more efficient to start off with 8.1.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>8 does not require a touchscreen. It works very well with a mouse and keyboard - I have a tower and laptop that I use 8.1 on all the time. Neither has a touchscreen. It's a nice additional input method, but is not essential in any way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2 - I agree with JimWynne - what processor is best depends on what you're going to do with the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 - RT is Windows 8 remade for tablets and systems using the ARM processor. It's kind of the Microsoft equivalent of iOS and Android - a tablet OS. It looks like regular Windows, but only runs apps from the Windows Store. Regular 8.x can run traditional
 desktop programs and the apps as well. </p>

<h2>            Random Hardware Addresses for WiFi in Windows 10 Pro Doesn&#39;t Work and Kills the OS boot and networking when implemented</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Build 10586 of Windows 10 Professional for personal use.&nbsp; Everything is current across the board whether implemented automatically by the OS or manually (e.g., also manually searching online for updated signed WHQL drivers via the Device Manager
 or simply checking the driver and update sites for the various programs and applications I use).&nbsp; Or Build 1511 as it's called in the Update module.&nbsp; Everything is current to this point in time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Iolo System Mechanic Professional version 15.0.1.4 (current) for AV and anti-spyware protection.&nbsp; I also use a VPN, but it hasn't been installed yet to get it out of the troubleshooting loop.&nbsp; Normally, I use proprietary encryption on the drives,
 including my USBs, and try to keep things as leak free as possible, but...&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, right now I haven't installed any of that yet since I just restored from a complete image of the OS RAID disk (4th cycle/attempt at the WiFi bug), and again, I don't want it coloring my perceptions of what might be going on.&nbsp; The reason I stopped the
 build there was to leave the Windows installation as "normal" as possible without added layers of security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hardware is a laptop.&nbsp; MSI Titan GT80 2QE SLI, Intel i7 5950HQ @ 2.9GHz, Nvidia 980M SLI, 32GB DRAM, 1TB RAID0 SSD (Samsung EVO 850 x 2), 238GB RAID0 SSD (Toshiba's x 2), and 1TB Seagate SSHD rotating disk.&nbsp; Fast, yes, but a finicky race horse it is.&nbsp;
 Win10Pro almost makes it&nbsp;a gaming platform with pluses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, so that's my baseline at the moment and for the last 4 tries to get a fix on the WiFi issue.&nbsp; The internal WiFi installed is&nbsp;a Killer Network Manager with the Double Shot Pro capability, i.e. I can also plug in additional Ethernet bandwidth and it
 will balance it out for greater bandwidth.&nbsp; But, again, it's running vanilla at the moment (just the WiFi) and from everything I can see Windows is calling the shots on the WiFi connection and parameters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go into Settings, Network &amp; Internet, WiFi, Advanced Options, and Random Hardware Addresses I want to select "Change Daily" but every time I log off or restart I lose all WiFi connectivity.&nbsp; Going into Safe Mode with Networking doesn't work either.&nbsp;
 The selections in Settings for WiFi disappear whenever there is no connectivity in either Safe Mode.&nbsp; So far my only recourse has been to restore from a recent image since nothing else seems&nbsp; to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ditto for when I go into Settings, Network &amp; Internet, WiFi, Manage WiFi Settings, and I want to turn on the Random Hardware Addresses.&nbsp; Same result as described above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I do both, which I've done twice, I've had to delete the OS RAID and start from scratch for an image restoral which can take hours, so lately I only try one or the other since that's only a 6 minute restoral.&nbsp; And when I say it results in a total lockout&nbsp;no
 amount of clearing the BIOS, EC, etc. or even a prolonged shutdown will help.&nbsp; None of the Windows tools helps, none of my utilities is doing much good except my recovery software and offline backups containers to get me back up and running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I shouldn't have to resort to this, now should I just to get the system to utilize random hardware addresses?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For rescue USB's (using WinPE) I've tried to boot my Killer Network drivers, but its not working so far.&nbsp; Same negative results for the USB keys I created for Windows 10 Home and Pro from the MS Store to see if I could "fix" the issue.&nbsp; I didn't use the
 ADK/WAK 4 and don't care to at the moment since I'm no developer.&nbsp; It would be nice to simply be able to "undo" my selections and things roll back to functionality in a simple Safe Mode environment after a reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One last thing.&nbsp; I don't use Cortana and have most everything shut down as far as background processes go unless I am using it at the time and then it goes off when I am done.&nbsp; I didn't think it would matter much, but does anybody think it's worth a try
 to let Windows run default with everything running amok?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I can add is that my WiFi router is the Linksys WRT 1900 ACS Dual-band router and I am running the 5GHz channel for the signal here.&nbsp; It's up to date and the firmware is bug free (no vigilante bug) and all the security settings work well with the Windows
 firewall and other Pro features.&nbsp; I can go Ethernet mode but that's an easy fix most times.&nbsp; It's just the Windows 10 Pro WiFi controls disappearing whenever I select "random hardware addresses" via either settings location as described above that's become
 an annoyance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what to do?&nbsp; I've gone through all my notes and logs and removed everything else from the troubleshooting and isolation process and it falls right back into the Windows lap (so to speak).&nbsp; So here I am since UEFI won't let me install OpenBSD or anything
 else like that to sidestep the issues so I guess I'll keep working with Win 10 Pro since I do like it a lot when it works.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>

<h2>            &#34;You are running out of disk space on RECOVERY &#40;D&#58;&#41;&#34; message.   </h2>
                    
<p><b>From: Robert Judge 
</b></p>
&nbsp;
<p>On my new VISTA PC, I tried to use the built-in Backup program.&nbsp; The back-up apparently failed because there was not enough room on the "RECOVERY (D:) disk.</p>
<p>Now, when I re-start my new VISTA PC, I get this message:</p>
<p>"Low Disk Space You are running out of disk space on RECOVERY (D:). To free space on this drive by deleting old or unnecessary files, click here..."</p>
<p>When I "Click here," I am then offered "Disk Cleanup for RECOVERY (D:)."&nbsp; The Disk Cleanup offers "Office Setup Files" and "Recycle Bin," but both have "0 bytes" so I can't free up space that way.</p>
<p>When I open the Backup and Restore center and try to backup files, the program starts by "Creating a shadow copy."&nbsp; However, I then get a message:</p>
<p>"An error occurred...There is not enough space to save the backup files.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Free up disk space or change yur backup settings. (0x81000005)."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have limited space on "RECOVERY D," I only need to backup Documents.&nbsp; But even when I only check "Documents," I get the same error message.</p>
<p>I am thinking that I should delete the contents of RECOERY D and try to start over again.&nbsp; However, there appears to be some files that came already installed on RECOVERY D.&nbsp; However, I see a folder called
 "Backup Set 2008-06-08 193208," which I assume is the failed backup that I tried on June 6.&nbsp; Should I just delete that folder and try again?&nbsp; Or is there some other way I should try to use the "Backup and Restore" program?&nbsp; I will appreciate advice.</p>

<p>Mickie,</p>
<p>As Ryan pointed to, the Recovery D drive should not be used for storage, did you install anything to it directly?</p>
<p>If you were attempting to backup and then canceled or failed, then follow these directions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
Windows</span> <span style="font-weight: bold">
Logo (Start) -&gt; </span><span>In
</span><span style="font-style: italic">Start Search</span><span> type
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Backup Status and Configuration</span>
</li><li><span>Next to "Automatic backup is currently turned on"
</span><span style="font-style: italic">Click</span>
</li><li><span>Close the window.</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next we will need to remove the incomplete files that were saved on your D drive.</p>
<p>To do this you will need to click
Computer</span>, then double-click <span style="font-weight: bold">Local Disk (D:)</span></p>
<p>Here you will find two things, a MediaID.bin file&nbsp; and a folder with the same name as your computer (you can confirm this by finding a Backup Set folder inside this one), you will need to delete both
 to get rid of the message. Let us know if you require help figuring out the name of this Folder.</p>

<h2>            Ease of Access&#47; Use - dictation, narrator, autocorrect, and define questions.</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to figure out if four features are possible in Windows 10, that I've become reliant on with my cell phone (different OS), before I return my new Windows 10 laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. If reading a webpage, and there is a word I don't know, can I highlight it, click define somewhere, to get a quick definition?&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I now over rely on autocorrect but is autocorrect possible at the operating system level of Windows 10 (like with my cell OS) so if I am typing in any program, like wordpad or chrome browser, and I don't capitalize "i" it will change it to "I" and do
 other auto corrections?&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. If reading a web page, can I highlight the text and select to have just that highlighted text read to me aloud? Is this possible at the OS level, so it could be done in other web browsers? I saw the narrator of Windows 10, but I don't want every action
 narrated, just the text I highlight narrated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. On my mobile device I can click a microphone on the on screen keyboard and dictate text into any app/ program because this is integrated into the OS. Is dictation of text possible at the OS level of Windows 10 so I can dictate into any program like wordpad
 or chrome browser?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for any guidance on these questions. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Speech Recognition makes using a keyboard and mouse optional. You can control your PC with your voice and dictate text instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Setup Speech Recognition</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a few steps you need to take before you can start using Speech Recognition. First, you’ll need to set up a microphone. Then, you can train your PC to recognize your voice.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To set up a microphone:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Enter <span>Set up a microphone</span> in the search box, and then tap or click
<span>Set up a microphone</span>.</p>
<p>b. Follow the instructions on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If possible, use a headset microphone; it's less likely to pick up background noise.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To train your PC to recognize your speech</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Speech Recognition uses a special voice profile to recognize your voice and spoken commands. The more you use Speech Recognition, the more detailed your voice profile becomes—and that should improve your PC's ability to understand you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Enter <span>Speech Recognition</span> in the search box, and then tap or click
<span>Speech Recognition</span>.</p>
<p>b. Say "start listening," or tap or click the microphone button to start the listening mode.</p>
<p>c. Open the app you want to use, or select the text box you want to dictate text into.</p>
<p>d. Say the text you want to dictate.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To correct mistakes: You can correct mistakes in three different ways:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>a. To correct the last thing you said, say "correct that."</p>
<p>b. To correct a single word, say "correct" followed by the word that you want to correct. If the word appears more than once, all instances will be highlighted, and you can choose the one you want to correct.</p>
<p>c. In the <span>Alternates panel</span> dialog box, say the number next to the item you want, and then say "OK."</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To add or change words in the Speech Dictionary</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the Speech Dictionary, you can add your own words, stop a specific word from being dictated, or correct or delete a word in the dictionary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Enter <span>speech recognition</span> in the search box, and then tap or click
<span>Windows Speech Recognition</span>.</p>
<p>b. Say "start listening," or tap or click the microphone button to start the listening mode.</p>
<p>c. Say "open Speech Dictionary" and do any of the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>To add a word to the dictionary, say "Add a new word," and then follow the instructions.</li><li>To prevent a specific word from being dictated, say "Prevent a word from being dictated," and then follow the instructions.</li></ul>
<p>Also, refer to the article below and refer to sections provided for more information.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            I see your response about setting up dictation, but my question was can the dictation be done for ANY program? I am not looking to control my PC, but to dictate text into things like my chrome browser.&nbsp;

<p>Using Windows 7 Home primum.&nbsp; For reasons unknown to me my user profile got currupted.&nbsp; I tried a system restore but it did not help.&nbsp; Most of the stuff that got messed-up was minor... backgroound and it's control , gadgets etc.&nbsp; I also lost my mapped network
 drive. When I tried to re-map it it asked for my password (it never had before).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I created an other user (also as administrator) and&nbsp;brought over my data files.&nbsp; All the issues resolved
<strong>except the the drive mapping issue</strong>.&nbsp; BTW we have a secound Windows 7 PC on the same network and it has been able tp stay connected to our network drive.</p>
<p>Details: netwok drive -Seagate Freeagent 500MB hosted on a linksys/Cisco WRT610N router via a USB port.&nbsp; PC - HP Pavilion I7 @ 3 Ghz &amp; 12 GB RAM.</p>

<h2>            Redo win10 upgrade after rolled back to win7</h2>
                    <p>I did an online upgrade to win10 on Nov 19, 2017 and had zoom in problem; the screen zoomed in down to 10% randomly in web bowers as well as MS word. I rolled it back to win7. Now, I want to give it a try one more time.
</p>
<p>Do I have to do it using the online link again, it took me 3.5 hours last time? Is any other quick way to do it?</p>
<p>The upgrade roll back time limited was 10 days. If I do the upgrade again, would the clock counts from the last upgrade or it would start another 10 days?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Hiya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best and safest way to upgrade is to use the media creation tool. You can download it here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, it will not reset the timer, a few days already, the timer will start where you left off.</p>

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>If I upgrade the Windows 7 again (it was upgraded to Windows 10 before), and I don't want a clean install, just upgrade. Do I have that choice?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just to answer your question about upgrading, you will have that option if you are going to use the Media Creation Tool. It will ask you to keep your files or not, but, we strongly suggest that you back-up your files before performing the upgrade to avoid
 problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can refer to this <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></span> to download and for more information regarding Media Creation
 Tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further queries, feel free to post back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Hard drive and Console Issues.</h2>
                    
<p>Every time I play a game my console (Xbox Elite) freezes and there's nothing I can do about it except turn it off. Then shortly after a small break, when I turn my console back on it freezes during the startup. If I get past that all my data on my 120 GB
 Hard drive appears missing. Anyone with tips or help?</p>

<p>A) Make sure it's properly vented. If it's near heat, vents blocked by boxed in area or carpeting, has things stacked on it, etc... this can happen. &nbsp;</p>
<p>B) Clear your system cache</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Press the Guide button on your controller.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Go to Settings, and then select System Settings.</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select Storage or Memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Highlight any storage device, and then press Y on your controller.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Important Do not press the A button.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;(It doesn't matter which storage device you select; the cache will be cleared for all storage devices.)</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select Clear System Cache.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select Yes when prompted to confirm storage device maintenance.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Repeat the action that previously caused your screen to freeze.</p>
<p>C) Remove the hard drive</p>
<p>D) Request repair</p>
