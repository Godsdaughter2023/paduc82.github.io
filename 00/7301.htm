<h2>            Can&#39;t sign out of OneNote to sign in with a different account</h2>
                    I just got a new laptop at work and I am trying to set up OneNote. Currently, it has me logged in under my work Office account but I want to log in with my personal Office account. However, when I go to ACCOUNT, the only option is SIGN OUT. When I click
 SIGN OUT it says "We can't remove Windows accounts". There is no option to ADD an account.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Stacie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, does it show the Switch account option when clicking your name in the upper right corner? If yes, what will happen if you click that? Does it show the same error message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We look forward to your reply.</p>

            When I click my name on the upper right corner, the only option it has is ACCOUNT SETTINGS. That brings me to a screen where SIGN OUT shows up below USER INFORMATION but if I click that I get the "We can't remove Windows account" message.

<h2>            Missing Distribution List Members after O365 Migration</h2>
                    
<p>After migration, when sending emails, some of the DL members are missing (supposedly&nbsp;there are 10627 members inside the DL, but after migration there are 1982 members) since some of the DL members contains hidden members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Is this is a common migration issue?</p>
<p>2. We want to know is there a way to resolve this other than "remigration"</p>

<p>Hi Jafp,</p>
<p>Distribution Groups (DG) don’t need to be migrated to Office 365 since DGs have no real data like mailboxes. They’re synchronized to Office 365.</p>
<p>1.Could you please let us know which sync tool you used? AAD connect or DirSync or other 3<sup>rd</sup> party solutions?</p>
<p>2.Which migration method did you use?</p>
<p>3.What do you mean “some of the DL members contains hidden members”?&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.Are these missing members random users or specific ones?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We also face the same above issues in DL ; once after syncing from Exch onprem to O365 . We found lot of members missing in O365. We use AAD connect tool to sync DL's.<br />
</p>
<p>What would be the main cause for this issue ?<br />
Is there any way to fix this issue and make sure members in DL match the same of Onprem to O365.<br />

            <p>Hi Shanmugam,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, the AAD connect will sync the members of the DL if the members are already synced to Office 365.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, please confirm if the members of the DL are synced as single users correctly in Office 365.</p>
<p>If all the members are synced to Office 365, but not syncing in a DL, I<span>’</span>d like to confirm the following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there any error message in ADD connect?</li><li>Could you reproduce the situation, if you create a new DL in on-premises?</li><li>Are you in a staged migration or hybrid?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Franky&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>As we tested, we created new DL in on-premises and added few members and it was successfully synced to O365.</p>
<p>we are in hybrid migration. The issue was in existing DL in that some of the members are not synced to O365.</p>

            Hi Shanmugam,<br />
<br />
Since new DLs works fine and it may need some time to troubleshot the sync issues, the best practice is to create new DLs, and you can copy the members from the old DLs to the new DLs via the following cmdlets.<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Get-DistributionGroupMember -Identity OldDL | % {Add-DistributionGroupMember -Identity NewDL -Member $_.Name}</strong></em><br />
<br />
If you still need to troubleshoot the sync issues for the old DLs, please let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Franky

            <p>Hi Shanmugam,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can check the sync filtering to mark sure that the groups and members are not filtered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If they are not filtered and still cannot be synced to Office 365, I need some detailed information troubleshoot the issue:</p>
<p>1. Is there any error message or error log when you run AAD Connect?</p>
<p>2. Can the users be synced to Office 365? Please go to Office 365 Portal &gt; Users &gt; Active user.</p>
<p>3. The detailed attributes of the groups and missing members. Some screenshots will be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, below is some common causes of problems with directory synchronization in Office 365 for your reference:</p>

            <p>Shanmugam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>DL sync to O365 is a 3 step process:</p>
<p>1. Sync from local AD to SQL database in AAD Connect</p>
<p>2. Sync from AAD Connect database to Azure</p>
<p>3. Sync from Azure to Exchange Online</p>
<p>(Not mentioning the OAB sync here)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I generally start investigation from the last sync, as I've often seen there to be the failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How?</p>
<p>1. From O365 powershell, run: "Get-DistributionGroupMember &lt;DL name/email address&gt;" and confirm that you don't see all the members as you see when you run the same cmdlet from on-premise (this confirms there indeed is an issue; but if you see all DL members
 here then issue is between GAL to OAB update)</p>
<p>2. From O365 pwershell, run: "Get-DistributionGroup &lt;DL name/email address&gt; |select ExternalDirectoryObjectId" to get the ObjectId of the DL</p>
<p>3. From Azure powershell (Connect-MsolService), run: Get-MsolGroupMember -GroupObjectId &lt;ObjectId value received from step-2&gt;" and verify if the DL members are showing accurate in this output</p>
<p>
</p><p>If step-3 shows accurate DL members, issue is between Azure to EXO sync. This will require Office 365 support team to submit a SOP for RecipFullSync (this basically forces an Azure-EXO sync). Alternatively, making a modification to the DL property from local
 AD (like Fax, Notes, etc.) will force a new sync process and thus forcing Azure to re-sync with EXO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If step-3 also shows inaccurate DL members, then the issue is local: Either AAD Connect did not import the DL members correctly from local AD, or did not export correctly to Azure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

    <title>Problem with Microsoft Word for Mac, Version 15.18 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> canmathprof  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Microsoft Word for Mac, Version 15.18 &#40;160109&#41;&#58; It removes embedded images from large file when saving.</h2>
                    <p><span>We have a file with an Microsoft Word document (.docx) having size 67,047,806 bytes (67.1 MB on disk).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It was generated using “</span><span>Microsoft Office Home and Student 2010”, Version:</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">14.0.7165000 (32</span><span>-bit),
 apparently under MS Windows 10. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We have no problem processing this file with a MacBook Air using MS Word for Mac 2011, version 14.3.0 (121105), latest installed Update 14.3.0, under OS X El Capitan (Version 10.11.2). However, we have problems
 processing the same file on an iMac (late 2013) using Microsoft Word for Mac, Version 15.18 (160109), under OS X El Capitan (Version 10.11.2).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The problem on the iMac is as follows:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>I download the file from e-mail</span></li><li><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>I open the file</span></li><li><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>
</span></span></span><span>I save the file with a modified name so that I can preserve the original and make changes to my own copy</span><br />
</li><li><span>&nbsp; The file with the new name is smaller than the original file and many plots have disappeared.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>The original file (67.1 MB) contains many figures with plots. They are jpg or png. Text and images are properly formatted. If after step (3) I open the file and save it again, without doing anything, the saved
 file is even smaller and few more plots have vanished. Opening again and saving without doing anything results in a saved file that is even smaller and where few more plots have vanished. The MS Word on the iMac is current with the most recent updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We also have another MacBook Air under Yosemite and an older MS Word where there is no problem for this file.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Questions:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>1) What should we do to make the iMac and the MS Word work properly?
</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>2) What could the problem be?
</span></p>
<p>3)&nbsp; 3)&nbsp; Has <span>
anybody experienced something like this? If “YES”, what has been done to make it work properly?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Since you are downloading it from the email, I doubt if it has any anything to do with compatibility. Make sure the format of the file&nbsp; is of the latest format. If you are either opening or saving a file to old format it does lose a lot of formatting.
 So, make sure the file format you are opening is of .docx and also when saving the file to choose .docx.

            Instead of opening the file from within your mail application, use your mail application to save the file to your Documents folder. Open the presentation file from your documents folder. Don't change any file extensions along the way.

            <p>Thank you for your answer, Arshad Khan. I actually did all the things that you suggest prior to writing my question. I also asked a colleague to double check what I was doing. The file is downloaded as received. The format of the file is the latest format.
 I open the file and save it to the same format. The file is docx and is saved to docx. I would like to add that the same process works perfectly for other, smaller files. Thank you again for your answer, Arshad Khan. Unfortunately the question is still unanswered.</p>

<p>Thank you for your answer, Jim Gordon. No, I did not open the file from within my mail client. As you suggest, I saved the file to the Documents folder, I opened the file from MS Word, I saved the file with a different name from within MS Word. I checked
 that both files are docx. Indeed docx is the default type on this MS Word. I would like to add that the same process works perfectly on the same computer for other, smaller files. Thank you again for your answer, Jim Gordon. Unfortunately the question is still
 unanswered.<br />

            <p>Jim's answer is likely to be on the right track. The latest versions of Microsoft and Apple software do weird things to files they think have come "from the internet" to try to save us from ourselves. &nbsp;This can be very infuriating!! You could test this scenario
 by using a thumb drive to transfer the document instead of sending it via email (or DropBox or some other cloud drive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there is one other scenario that may be hurting you: if the original images were inserted as "Linked" or "Linked + embedded" then Word will remove them if it cannot open the link (because the source images are on the other computer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In which case, the fix is to go back to the source computer and break the links, to change all those images to "Embedded" only. &nbsp;Then when you open on the iMac, it will not attempt to refresh the embedded pictures, be unable to find them, and remove them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

<h3> smiler  say:</h3>
<h2>            You cannot close Microsoft Office Word until the Send Mail command is finished. Switch to the New Message first, and either send or close the message</h2>
                    
<p>If I try to email a word document from MS Word and Outlook is not running, I get this message. I am then unable to open Outlook. I am unable to close word and have to force word to close via Task Manager.</p>
<p>This also happens if I try to email a photo or weblink without Outlook running: Outlook can't open until I terminate IE or photo gallery.</p>
<p>This&nbsp;same thing&nbsp;happened&nbsp;prior to upgrading&nbsp;my desktop from Vista ultimate 32 bit&nbsp;with Office 2007 to my current setup &amp; 64 bit with Office 2007 (clean install)</p>
<p>Any ideas (except for remembering to always have outllok open first!)</p>

<p>Hi Elisjada,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Facebook and Messenger apps, these two apps has been retired by Facebook itself, since the end of March last year 2017 with Lumia phones with OS version of 8.1. That's why these apps may play a bit strange, thou accessing it from the browser still work's.
 Check if your phone can be upgraded to Windows 10, upgrade it , and just download the app from the Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Email keeps going to Junk Folder</h2>
                    <p>Can anyone help me figure why my emails from Fidelity keep going into my Junk Folder? I have set up rules and added them to my contact list and done everything I can think of to stop their emails from going to Junk, but 90% of them still do. The same issue
 with emails from seekingalpha.com. Both of these sites are reputable sites and they never use to go to junk, and still some don't, and then about 4 months ago they started&nbsp;going into my junk&nbsp;folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <blockquote>It is 2010. I have been saving them to the desk top.<br />
When i try and reopen it I get<b> C:\Users\Tom\desktop\Rochester parent education.pub.pub is not valid Win32 application.</b><br />
<br />
This is a recent development. I have used publisher hundreds of times without indecent.<br />
<br />
When I receive an email I normal click on the attachment and it opens in publisher automatically.<br />
There is no choice to open it in a specific program. I get the same error ending in
<b>pub is not valid Win32 application.</b><br />
<br />
<br />
</blockquote>
<p><br />
I am going to assume that the file is '...education.pub' not '...education.pub.pub' or that might suggest the obvious error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You didn't answer whether you could open Publisher, File, Open and browse to where the file is and open it that way. I am going to assume you can, and that what is not working is double clicking .pub files on your desktop and opening directly from an attachment...which
 I never recommend. Save it to your desktop first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given these assumptions I think you need to reassociate your .pub file with Publisher.&nbsp;R<span>ight click&nbsp;a .pub file &gt; Open with and this will bring you to the Open With dialog. If Publisher is not listed as 'recommended' or 'other' programs then you need
 to click the browse button and drill down to where the mspub.exe file is located on your computer. It will vary with your installation but you can look:</span></p>
<span>
<div><span>C:/program files (x86)/microsoftoffice/office14/mspub.exe</span></div>
<div><span>or</span></div>
<div><span>C:/Program Files/Microsoft Office 2010/Office14/mspub.exe</span></div>
<div><span>If you are using Publisher 2007 you might find the file under Office12.</span></div>

    <title>changing email primary alias and then deleting original email primary - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meyouknowwho  say:</h3>
<h2>            changing email primary alias and then deleting original email primary -- MODERATORS PLEASE DO NOT LOCK THIS THREAD BEFORE I GET ANSWER</h2>
                    <p>PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY BEFORE REPLYING, AND PLEASE REPLY ONLY TO MY QUESTION. PLEASE DO NOT VOLUNTEER OPINIONS OR INFORMATION THAT IS NOT DIRECTLY RELATED. Too many moderators are replying and not answering my question. I NOW DOUBT THE ABILITY OF MS
 MODERATORS TO READ AND COMPREHEND THE QUESTIONS BEING POSTED. I read other users' posts and I see the same problem with their posts. Moderators are not reading closely, not comprehending what is actually being asked. When many moderators reply with wrong or
 unrelated information, it makes Microsoft and its employees/moderators seem&nbsp;unintelligent (which I doubt is the case); but they should read and THINK before replying.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EVERYTIME I POST THIS QUESTION, THE MODERATORS LOCK THE THREAD BEFORE MY QUESTION CAN GET ANSWERED. Note to Moderators: Please Do NOT lock this thread. If you do not know the answer, then please leave this alone, and allow somebody who does know to answer
 here. I do NOT have a technical problem. I AM ASKING A QUESTION. It does not require a private communication with moderators. ANYBODY WHO WISHES TO REPLY, PLEASE *READ* THE QUESTION FIRST, AND ANSWER ONLY WHAT I AM ASKING. I have read the help pages. PLEASE
 DO NOT GIVE ME ADVICE ON THE PROCEDURES. I want to know what is supposed to happen if I attempt the following. (Here is a repeat of my other post, which the MS moderators have locked without allowing anyone to answer.) And Please do NOT ask me to fill out
 the tech support submission form. I do NOT (yet) have a tech problem. I am asking a question....</p>
<p>email change primary alias - what happens to old primary?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is simple. I want to change my primary alias (which is the email address I used to originally create the account several years ago, before aliases were possible). After that, I want to delete the former primary alias (the original email address), but
 keep the same account, using the new alias as the new primary address. If I do this, does my former primary alias (the original email address) get totally disassociated from my account? That is what I want to happen, because too many people have my original
 address (currently my primary alias), and I want to totally discard it, which will stop most or all the junk mail. AND, YES, I ALREADY UNDERSTAND HOW THE JUNK MAIL FOLDER AND SETTINGS WORK, AND HOW TO MAKE FOLDERS FOR ALIASES. So PLEASE DO NOT tell me about
 that. But if the former primary address will somehow remain associated with the account, then I will create an entirely new account. NOTE: This is not (yet) a tech problem; I am asking in advance what is supposed to happen. PLEASE DO NOT GIVE ME ADVICE, AND
 PLEASE DO NOT REPEAT HELP PAGES INFO. And MODERATORS, please&nbsp;DO NOT lock this thread and tell me to&nbsp;fill out a tech support form. (I did fill out a tech support form once, but nobody every replied, so a few days later, I reposted my question/issue, and moderators
 locked the thread before anyone could answer my question. NOTE: REPLYING TO A POST IS NOT THE SAME THING AS ACTUALLY *ANSWERING* A QUESTION.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>I posted this issue a few days ago. I got some replies, but they did not directly answer my question/issue. Then a site moderator locked the discussion and stated s/he would email me directly the answer within 24 hours. That did not happen. So I am asking
 again. I have read the help pages. So please do not merely repeat info from help pages. I have a Hotmail address (which MS has now converted to an Outlook account, although I still sign-in with my Hotmail address). Several months ago, I wanted to make a new
 primary alias and delete my original primary alias (the log-in, sign-in, email address I made when I created the account, back in the years before aliases were available). A few months ago, it was not possible to delete the primary alias (or at least not the
 original email address that was used to create the account). Now the help pages seem to imply that we can change the primary alias and then even delete the former primary alias. Does that include being able to delete a former primary alias that was the address
 used to originally create the account? (That is what I wish to do, but I am asking in advance, so in case it is not possible, I will not go through the procedure and possibly mess up my account, which other Hotmail/Outlook users stated happened to their accounts
 when they tried changing the primary alias.) If we can delete a former primary alias (even the address originally used to create the account, does that totally disassociate the deleted former primary alias (original email address used to create the account)
 from the account, so that all emails sent to that former primary (once deleted) never reach the account? Someone replied and asked why I want to delete my former primary alias, after I change the primary. That really isn't relevant to anyone else. I have my
 reasons. I want a direct answer from someone who knows about this issue, perhaps from someone who has been around for at least a year. When I first inquired a few months ago, an MS tech suggested I should just create a new email account, because at that time
 it was not possible to delete the original email address/alias that I used to originally create the current account. Is it really possible to do this now? (If so, apparently the email account is based on name and personal information and password, and not
 based mainly on the original email address that created the account.) Thanks in advance to anyone who can directly answer my questions.

            <p>Hi Larry,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand your frustration with regard to changing your primary alias and it's my pleasure on helping you to answer your inquiry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to change your primary alias then delete your former primary alias as a new email address, you can delete your former primary alias and wait for 30 days then re-create it again as a new email account. Your current emails on your former primary
 alias should go to your new primary alias. The former primary alias will be totally disassociated with your account and it will be a new Microsoft account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello, <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/a9d516ab-d969-4f15-9876-2be383b39b55" title="NeishaAbdulla">

<p>
</p><p>I have never tried to delete my former primary address. I now use it as an alias for general communications, especially with persons/parties from which I might receive junk mail. I've noticed (by using the "view message source" technique) that most of the
 spam I receive is being sent to my former primary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long ago, I successfully changed my primary to another alias. I've done this a couple times now. I have found (and a MS telephone tech person agreed with me) that since we can log into our account with any address on the account -- whether the currently
 designated "primary" address or one of the "aliases" -- the meaning of designating a "primary" address does not carry much significance any longer. Also, we can make up to 5 new aliases each year (within a 12-month calendar period, I suppose) and maintain
 up to 10 at a time. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It is easy to make a new primary, then direct the important contacts to use that primary for communicating with us, and then relegate the old primary to general use. I now use my former primary address as a general address I give to people, to screen them,
 in case I want to block them later. Or I use it for consumer surveys, contests, contacting businesses, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't need 10 different email aliases on one account, and you are unable to delete a former primary address (after you've made or designated a new primary), then consider using your former primary for general purposes, similar to what I've described.&nbsp;We
 are going to receive junk email. It is a natural aspect of using email. So, we are going to need one or two aliases for that purpose, communicating with entities who might trade, sell, or otherwise spam us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One final comment... If you haven't noticed, be sure to watch when you reply to an email sent to one of your aliases. Sometimes Hotmail/outlook will automatically put your primary address in the "From" box as the address you're replying from. You will want
 to use the dropdown menu and select the alias that the message was sent to, for the address you are going to reply from. I've gotten frustrated with this a couple times. I replied to messages sent to an alias and I clicked "send" before I realized that Hotmail/Outlook
 had put my primary in the "from" box instead of the alias.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck to you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I recently added a new primary alias to my Outlook account and then "removed" - not "deleted" (if there is a distinction) my former primary alias. Unfortunately, I am now unable to access any of my former email data. Your reply above seems to imply that
 these emails should somehow be merged into the new alias inbox/sentbox. In particular, it states that "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Your current emails on your former primary alias should go to your new primary alias." Is there a particular

<h2>            I have two skype accounts, can&#39;t get into the real one, only the second one I accidentally set up</h2>
                    I have two skype accounts with the same name, same email, same username, same phone number. I can only get into the second one I accidentally set up in my effort to get to the first one. Whenever I try to get into my real account, the password reset and
 all that comes up for the second useless duplicate account. How do I get rid of this so I can have just one account and get into that?

            I also have the same problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;I cannot even recall why there were two accounts but I had only used one,&nbsp; which was fine,&nbsp; until I got a new laptop and tried to sign into skype with my email address.&nbsp; The website login showed there were two accounts but
 I could only go into the one I never used for some reason,&nbsp; please can it be possible to find my really account ?&nbsp; &nbsp;Each time I tried to log in,&nbsp; it asked me to change the password.&nbsp; I do not know why.&nbsp; Now I cannot see the account I have used, for years.&nbsp;
 Is it possible to find this ?&nbsp; Every tip I tried so far has not worked.

That sounds normal, especially if you are only Hibernating instead of doing a full shutdown and also depending on your undisclosed site and your cache checking setting for your undisclosed version of IE on your undisclosed OS.&nbsp;&nbsp; (W7 does not support IE7 or
 earlier so you clearly didn't use those selection boxes correctly when you posted your problem.)&nbsp; You could clear your TIF before turning off your computer as an alternate procedure.</div>

<h2>            OneDrive for Business won&#39;t sync newly created folders and files from new laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hello folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am facing an unusual issue with OneDrive. </p>
<p>After I have changed my laptop and login to OneDrive for Business I noticed it won't sync the newly created files and folders.</p>
<p>Moreover, when I open Settings and want to select which folders to sync, I don't see those new folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what is going on here and how to resolve it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi tocy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing your experience with us. Based on your description, OneDrive sync client doesn’t sync the newly created files and folders. We will help you do troubleshooting for the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(You may firstly backup your new files/folders)</p>
<p>We suggest you stop sync OneDrive for business files, unlink this PC and close OneDrive sync client. Restart laptop and launch OneDrive sync client again, sign in your OneDrive for business account,
 see if you can sync the new files/Folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, you can try resetting OneDrive sync client:</p>
<p>1.Press the Win key + R.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.In the <span style="font-weight: bold">
Run</span> window, enter:<span style="font-weight: bold"><span>&nbsp; </span>%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset<span>&nbsp;
</span></span>Click OK</p>
<p>3.Restart your computer, open OneDrive sync client and start to sync your OneDrive for business files again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If issue persists, please let us know following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.What is the version of your OneDrive sync client? You can check it from OneDrive Settings&gt;About</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.From your description, it seems when you add new files and folders to the local OneDrive sync folder, they won't sync to OneDrive online. Do you get any error message? Could you share a screenshot
 for the new files/folders in your sync folder?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.If you add a new file in OneDrive for business on the web, will the it sync to local computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<h2>            Screen freezing problem 17133.73</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edition : Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p>Version : 1803</p>
<p>Installed On : 2018/04/10</p>
<p>OS Build : 17133.73</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP Envy 13 model ab009na with Intel Graphics</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since the new build I have a strange screen freezing problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screen will freeze up, but the mouse cursor is still responsive. It's not a runaway process, I've left it and my laptop just idles, not like when the CPU usage is high and the fan turns on. It is completely unresponsive to keyboard input, Alt-Tab, Ctrl-Alt-Del,
 does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution for now is to press my power button to lock/power off my screen (not reboot) , then press it again and enter my password and it returns to a normal functioning desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue occurs mainly when I am using a browser, either opening the browser, or opening a new tab in the browser, although it is not consistent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried reinstalling both the Intel Network and Graphics Drivers, but the problem persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone having the same problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

mddean8</a>. This may only be a temporary service disruption. You may wait a little while and try again. Make sure that the phone has a stable internet connection when installing apps. You may check it by visiting any website using the phone's browser. Let
 us know if you have other queries.

            <p>Let's start working on this by checking the sound notification settings. To check, just go to
<strong>Settings&gt; System&gt; Notifications and actions&gt;</strong> under the <strong>Notifications</strong>, toggle on the
<strong>Show and sound alarms and reminders when my phone is locked</strong>. Another thing to check is the
<strong>Sounds</strong> settings, just go to <strong>Settings&gt; Personalization&gt; Sounds</strong>, make sure that the
<strong>System alerts</strong> is ticked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is still not resolved after checking the sound settings, the next workaround is to perform a soft reset. To soft reset the phone, just press and hold the power and volume down buttons at the same time until the phone restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results. </p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply. All settings were where they should be and I'd already done multiple soft resets to no avail.&nbsp; I didn't know how long I would take to get a reply, so I bit the bullet an did a hard reset.&nbsp; Now I'm faced with reinstalling my apps.&nbsp;
 That said however, the phone now rings.&nbsp; I do not know if it's a permanent fix as I have read that it worked for some for a while then it quit working, so I'm keeping everything crossed that it doesn't go out again.</p>

 that I'd be able to sync things from my windows 10 laptop without issues.&nbsp; However, having a phone that doesn't ring is relatively useless.</p>

    <title>How to hide the new Archive button in Ribbon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mccz  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to hide the new Archive button in Ribbon</h2>
                    <p>A recent update added several buttons to Home tab of Outlook, including an Archive button in the Delete group. As the Archive feature is something I am not going to use, its position just next to the frequently used Delete button as well as its size (one
 of the most important thing on the tab) makes it very easy to accidentally click on the new Archive button instead of the intended Delete button. As such, I would like to hide the Archive button (or make it significantly smaller or move it to less risky location).
 Is there an elegant way to remove the Archive button (for example, a group policy setting like for the&nbsp;Store button)? The Customize Ribbon settings tool does not allow to remove individual buttons.</p>

            <p>There is nothing you can do about that button/command.&nbsp; That is one of the 'features' of the ribbon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your only possible work around is to go into customize the ribbon, disable the default group, and recreate it, skipping that button.&nbsp; BUT, when you create the custom group the buttons will NOT be organized in any recognizable way.&nbsp; Customized ribbons are
 totally different. </p>

<p>You can disable it via GPO. It's still there but you can't click it.&nbsp;</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Nick P_164 you are the bomb! The GPO direction solves our problem nicely - would have been better to remove the button, but graying it out also works!</p>
<p>Just a little more info for others:</p>
<p>Download templates from here:&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49030&nbsp;</p>
<p>Extract and the admx files, and you will need to copy the two outlook ones (get the one from the en-us folder as well) to your DC's policy definitions folder (default location is:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">C:\Windows\SYSVOL\sysvol\{Domain
 Name}\Policies\ )</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then set that policy to the number as mentioned in the Group Policy Management tool.</p>
<p>And there you have it - Archive button will be grayed out after a user gets the latest policy + restarts outlook.</p>

            Yes John, thanks for your reply. Almost exactly my experience, I could get Task Manager&nbsp; but could not see anything obvious that be causing the problem. Tried shutting things down but could not get past the cycling screen. I believe there is a new ISO
 available so I suppose I'll have to reload from that. Damn!

            Hi Jack
<br />
<br />Yes, everything will also be deleted when you delete a Skype account because its connected to your Microsoft Account. If you cancel within 60 days, everything should still be there.

    <title>What is reasonable expectations of Windows Mobile Standards - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> biggzie  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is reasonable expectations of Windows Mobile Standards</h2>
                    I have been a Windows CE to Windows Mobile user for 8 years.<br />
I have just purchased a new phone as my old phone is dead.<br />
My question is what is reasonable to expectations of the Windows Mobile Standard I can expect.<br />
The reason I ask is that Ive just purchased a HTC Touch 3G phone which doesnt seem to comply to Windows Standards but HTC say tough luck.<br />
When I run an application on this phone. I as a user would expect that applications would have full use of the Menu Bar at the bottom of the screen, &amp; if I was a programmer I would expect that the I could program Menu &amp; Icons to fit in that screen.<br />
However HTC have decided that when the Input Selector icon (to select onscreen keyboard or text input)&nbsp;is over on the right side of the Menu Bar while running applications, the sensitive area to select the Input Icon is twice as big as the size of the Icon
 so any Program Icons or Menu Items or the Menu Bar cannot be used if they are to close.<br />
Clearly this is a problem with how HTC has set the Touch Sensitive areas compared to the image displayed, but as it only effects software not supplied with the phone so HTC are not interested at all.<br />
If I bought other models in their range there is no problem, but HTC say that Microsoft has certified this phone as compatable so they are not responsible. There is not indication that this is a problem before I bought the phone or anything to say that there
 models run differently than each other or to what I would expect as a consumer. <br />
My thoughts is that if the sensitive area is larger than the icon on the screen then it should be up to them to fix it or refund me.
<br />
My other thought is that if they think its ok because Microsoft say it complies to Windows Mobiles Standards then how well are these standards checked, &amp; do I just give up on Windows&nbsp; Mobile &amp; look to other Operating Systems for my Phone/PDA<br />
I dont see it as my fault, or the programers fault. I have 3 programs Ive purchased that are useless at the moment.<br />
What are other peoples thoughts?<br />

<p>I use the HTC Touch Pro and do not experience that issue.&nbsp; Can you&nbsp;give a link to&nbsp;a screenshot?<br />
If you just purchased the phone maybe the vendor will let you return it for a different device if it does not render correctly.</p>

<p>This Model is a HTC Touch 3G</p>
<p>HTC Support has stated that they have a cert from Microsoft tthe this device will run Windows Mobile, &amp; say that running other programs are not there problem.<br />
The Dealer is basically now saying the same thing even though he agreed with me that this device isnt running how&nbsp;both I &amp; he&nbsp; would expect. Even though I I said to his sale staff I had programs I wanted to run, non of them informed me of any problems, &amp; HTC
 have nowhere that says this device handle the Input Selector in a non standard way that effects the Menu Bar. HTC downloaded &amp; tried some software &amp; they said it works on other models, Touch HD was 1 they mentioned. My brother has a HTC Touch Dual 850 &amp; that
 works fine too. Its just the Touch 3G that seems to be effected.<br />
<br />
The phone is currently boxed up as Im trying to get my money back or replacement &amp; Ive Hard reset it.<br />
<br />
I dont have any screen capures of the phone but I searched the net &amp; cut the bottom right corner out of a picture I found.<br />
(I dont know how to insert a photo on here) Ive linked to my Flickr page.<br />
On this photo, the sensitive area to bring up the keyboard extends down the menu bar and would cover the end of the greyed out arrow. So when I try &amp; use any program that has anything placed in this area of the Menu Bar, all I get is the Keyboard or what ever
 text input method is selected.<br />
I cant see how this device got a Microsoft Cert. to say it is Windows Mobile compatable.<br />

            Actually the other thing I just thought of is the HTC Support line kept calling this a Jade.<br />
Its obviously marketed overseas as the Jade, but in Australia its called a Touch 3G<br />

    <title>Can&#39;t connect Outlook 2016 to Office 365 Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simondh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t connect Outlook 2016 to Office 365 Mail</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm looking for some help trying to connect to my office 365 Email and Calender from Outlook 2016 as its causing me no end of frustration! I'm a student teacher and have just been given two new Office 365 accounts (one from my school and one from
 the University).&nbsp; Both institutions use Office 365 to provide emails and therefore I now have two new email addresses.&nbsp; I want to be able to read my emails and calendars etc in Outlook 2016, which is installed and working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the University this was an easy task, the auto complete took the email, address, password etc and configured the whole account and has made a perfect connection as if I was connected to Exchange Server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the school I just can't get it to work.&nbsp; I have been able to set up IMAP and SMTP access on my phone and even configure Thunderbird with the same mailbox settings but I just can't get a full Outlook.com or Exchange Server type connection.&nbsp; (Interestingly
 the IMAP and SMTP server settings that work are not the same as those given under settings in My Account) However, it will not auto configure and when I try to manually configure it,&nbsp; I get error messages ranging from Mailbox not found to user name/ password
 incorrect.&nbsp; I know I have an Office 365 account and the correct log in details as I can log into the web based version.&nbsp; I can't understand how it is so difficuly to get Outlook 2016 to talk to Microsofts Online Office software.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For information I have done a lot of digginig and I've tried the mail servers outlook.office365.com; outlook.com and various permutations and not been successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions or help greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simon</p>

<p>Do you mean that you have two separate email accounts as you cannot install two versions of Office 365 on the same PC</p>
<p>For outlook.com mail account you simply add it to MS Outlook using the auto setup page where only the mail address and password is used to connect the account</p>
<p>There are steps to jump though if in the outlook.com web settings you have set two step authentication</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; To clarify, I have two Office 365 accounts (business accounts not Outlook.com accounts).&nbsp; One of them works perfectly and I have no issues with it, it connected immediately and configured automatically.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the&nbsp;second one I want
 to connect&nbsp;to it from&nbsp;Outlook 2016 so that I can read my emails and calendar on my PC.&nbsp; I prefer to do this rather than to log in through a web browser each time.&nbsp; However, for this account it will not auto-configure and eventually asks me to do it manually.&nbsp;
 I enter the email address and password but it asks for a server.&nbsp; No matter what I put in here I can not get this to connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As its an Office account rather than an Outlook.com account I can't log into the Live website, only the Office website to get mails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this makes things clearer</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            It looks as though you are tring to use the addressblock field - don'! Instead use the fields directly from the data source that you actually require e.g.<br />
<br />
{If {Mergefield LastName} &lt;&gt; "" "{Mergefield Company}" "{Mergefield FirstName} {Mergefield LastName}"}<br />

            Each portion of Graham's syntax that is surrounded by braces must be inserted using Ctrl+F9. This inserts the braces, and you then type the text between them. Or you can type the text, select it, and press Ctrl+F9 to convert it to a field. In the case
 of the IF field, you can start with that as the "outside" field to contain the rest, then use the Insert Merge Fields button/dialog to insert the merge fields.

<p>I am a little lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried Inserting the code and then Ctrl+F9 but it still does not give any results when merged and shows
<span><em>LastName} when the fields are toggled</em></span></p>
<p>Also, I tried starting one from scratch, Ctrl+F9 then If but when I use the Insert Merge Fields, it does work?&nbsp; I am obviously doing something wrong, but can't figure it out.&nbsp; I find this very counter intuitive!</p>

            Nested {IF} Fields
<blockquote>
<p>One <b>{</b>IF<b>}</b> can be used inside of another one to give logical branches and twists.
</p>

<p><b>{</b>IF <b>{</b>PAGE<b>}</b> = 1
"This is the first page."
"<b>{</b>IF <b>{</b>PAGE<b>}</b> &lt;

<p>This is called "nesting." The nested IF field is used if the first expression is false.
<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can also use the merge field selector inside your IF field. To do this you need to turn field display on (Alt-F9) and not simply toggle field codes. Toggling field codes usually shows field results rather than codes for fields inside other
 fields.<br />
