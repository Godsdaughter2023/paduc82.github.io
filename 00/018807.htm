<h2>            Update on Nokia Belle for Israel</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I quickly wanted to share with you the following statement that I got from our local team about the Nokia Belle availability for Israel:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>The roll-out of Nokia Belle for existing Nokia Symbian^3 phones started globally on February 7, 2012. Testing and approval of Nokia Belle as per the Israeli operators’ requirements is still in process. Subject to successful completion of such
 tests and approvals, we will announce the launch in Israel and the process for updating via Nokia Discussions Forum as soon as the software is available.</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Want to get rid of status bar in word 2010</h2>
                    
<p>How do I completely eliminate the status bar in Word 2010 (not just make it empty - want to recapture the space it takes up so more of the doc displays)</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>As Hans says, you can only temporarily disable the status bar. An alternative is to minimize the ribbon to show just the tab names. There are three equivalent ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <strong>Ctrl+F1</strong></li><li>Double-click any of the tab labels</li><li>Right-click the ribbon and choose <strong>Minimize</strong></li></ul>
<p>The ribbon will appear when you single-click any tab label, and disappear as soon as you use one of its controls. Repeat any of the three ways to restore the ribbon to its original state.</p>

            hi mate,<br />
<br />
have you checked via Nokia Suite on your PC if there are any firmware updates availabnle for your device ? if there are any, pleas update to the latest version offered. failing that, you can try re-installing the current firmware thru Nokia Suite. if that doesn't
 work, then try restoring your phone to factory settings.<br />
<br />
If they still don't solve your issue, you will most likely need to take your phone to Nokia Care for inspection:

    <title>Microsoft word 2016 missing publishing layout - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marnicohen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft word 2016 missing publishing layout</h2>
                    <p>I have not purchased the new word yet but my colleague has and needs assistance.</p>
<p>Now that the new word 2016 does not have publisher view - &nbsp;can the print layout page allow for</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- kerning of letters (publisher used to allow you to click the number up or down until you liked how it looks).&nbsp;</p>
<p>2- shifting text boxes by measurements smaller than 1/8''( publisher allowed for smaller variables than 1/8")</p>
<p><br />
I think if I can fix these two problems, she may be okay. If not, what is the most novice option other than downgrading to 2011? &nbsp;If she downgrades, can she return 2016 and get her money back?<br />

<p>What the contextual Ribbon for Publishing Layout View in prior versions does provide is a check box tool for turning kerning&nbsp; On/Off, but there is no manual kerning in any version of Word... perhaps you're thinking of the
<em>Character Spacing</em> tool which does provide incremental spinner buttons as well as editable value boxes.?</p>
<p>
</p><p>At any rate, neither is included on the Ribbon in Office 2016. However, both are available as they always have been in their home location:
<strong>Format&gt; Font - Advanced</strong>. I see no option to add either to the QAT but I'm not certain whether they can be added to the Ribbon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Word 2016, objects can be nudged in 1/100" increments by holding <strong>Command+Control</strong> while tapping an
<strong>Arrow</strong> key. Also, the Grid which controls the standard nudging increment can be modified [<strong>Word&gt; Preferences - Edit - Grid Options</strong>].</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word 2011 is at the end of its life cycle. I have no idea what type of projects are involved, but based on your use of the term novice it may be worth looking at page layout programs. They are object-oriented, whereas Word is not.</p>

<p>I've noticed that on our tenancy not only are the users site collection administrators for the their own OneDrive for Business site, so are a couple of other SharePoint admins. Is that normal because I don't remember setting that up? By default are SharePoint
 administrators also Site Collection owners for OneDrive for Business sites? I know you can add people but is it alright to delete them?</p>

<p>Hi SBL,</p>
<p>If you refer to the owners of your My-site collection (in SharePoint Admin center-&gt; Site collections-&gt;
<a href="https://domain-my.sharepoint.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://domain-my.sharepoint.com</a> -&gt; Owners), it should shows Company Administrator. You can delete the additional users there.</p>
<p>If you refer to a user's own OneDrive for Business site, the answer is no. By default it only shows the user's name in SharePoint Admin center-&gt; User Profiles-&gt; Manage User Profiles-&gt; Manage site collection owners.</p>
<p>You can check the two pages and let us know your situation for further discussion.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Jim</p>

<p>Thanks Jim,</p>
<p>Its the later; under 'Manage Site Collection Owners' I can see not only the user of the OneDrive for Business site but also two SharePoint admins. Its an Office 365 tenancy so remove them from all the OneDrive for Business sites will be difficult. Any way
 to apply the change to all of them? </p>

<h2>            Lumia 920 Power button not responding</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
So, last hour, I'm trying to get my button fully working. But my power button is not responding.<br />
Ik cannot unlock the phone when the screen is blacked out. Though when a notification comes through, the screen lights up and then of coruse I CÁN unlock it (or use the camera button).<br />
<br />
I've tried the volume down + power button reset, and this DOES work. But using the power button seperately, does not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
At this point there is nothing much I can do, any help is appreciated!!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance...<br />
<br />

.After taking a backup of all you images &amp; videos (i'm assuming you've turned the sync on with skydrive for settings &amp; other data) &amp; keeping a list of all your apps, Reset he phone. If this does not work then only solution will be Nokia Care Centre.

<p>Hey<br />
<br />
Thanks for the quick reaction.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I cannot shutdown the phone and perform the reset because of the power button not responding. Or at least, I cannot perform the reset function using the power cable (and the combination of volume down and power button). I can though, very weird,
 hold the volume down- and power button for 15 seconds. The phone reboots and resets date as far I can tell.<br />
<br />
I'm am going to contact Nokia Care, thanks</p>

            You can reset using the settings - system - about - reset.

<p>Okay so I've tried that factory reset, it's downloading the backup now but it still does not work!<br />
I've already contacted Nokia Care, I hope they respond soon.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Extra info: after pressing volume up button a couple of times, I get prompted with the "Slide to shut down" message. It seems as though the buttons on the side of the phone are messed up somehow.</p>

<p>I had this problem that the phone was unresponsive to both the power button and the volume down/power button reset.&nbsp; All I could get was the glance screen by moving the phone around or sliding my hand over the screen.&nbsp; Could not turn it off or get any response
 except the glance screen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had to just let the phone sit until the battery was COMPLETELY dead (nothing - no glance screen), then plug it in to charge and it rebooted itself completely normal.</p>

            <p>my power button went on the fritz today.</p>
<p>i hit the volume down once, then the power and get the "slide down to power off screen" (not vol + power).</p>
<p>power button boots the phone up just fine (a qi or usb charge will do the same), just no shutdown.</p>
<p>double tap and glance are enabled (mitigates pain and inconvenience)</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this happen to my phone just this morning. It was plugged to a laptop and Project My Screen was running on the laptop but the phone was screen-locked. The laptop was docked and the dock has a very badly placed power button which you can easily press
 by accident when just moving it a bit. So the laptop powered down and after that the power button on my phone stopped responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What helped, was that I unplugged the phone, rebooted (vol down + pb) without the usb cable attached. Then I plugged the phone to the charger for a while, since I wasn't sure what the battery level was. Power button still wasn't responsing. Then I rebooted
 again and slid the screen open. After that the power button works just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems to me that this issue might be a software problem on the WP os. (I'm running Lumia Denim, build feb 6th 2015) Maybe it's somehow connected to usb? The phone is rather old now and this is the only time this has happened to me.</p>

            <p>Thanks! I am about to try this! Mine started acting up last night! I had it on the charger and then no power button. I could not get my phone to turn on this morning to turn my alarm off. The only way I could get to the home screen was to plug it in the
 charger so my home screen would show up then turn off my alarm. I have looked through every setting and nothing is changed. The volume and camera buttons work. I can also still take a screen shot with the volume up + power button.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have rebooted twice with the volume down+power button and I can now power off the phone but can't hit the button for my lock screen. So it's better. I will keep trying.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<h2>            Sum of all possible combinations</h2>
                    <br />
<div>Dear all,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Hoping you can help with a question I have that I can't seem to find the answer online. I'm hoping to see if somebody can advise which formula would be best for my situation and I can look into how to use the formula.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm trying to make an excel list of the different products customer purchased, and give a total sum of the different products purchased.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For example, I have 3 products, with 3 different colors, and 3 different sizes.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Products: A, B, C</div>
<div>Colors: Black, Blue, Gray</div>
<div>Sizes: S, M, L</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>I will have a sheet of what the customer ordered.&nbsp;</p>
<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Customer</td>
<td>Product</td>
<td>Color</td>
<td>Size</td>
<td>Qty</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>John</td>
<td>A</td>
<td>Black</td>
<td>L</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tom</td>
<td>A</td>
<td>Gray</td>
<td>L</td>
<td>7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lewis</td>
<td>B</td>
<td>Gray</td>
<td>M</td>
<td>8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Becky</td>
<td>A</td>
<td>Black</td>
<td>M</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tom</td>
<td>A</td>
<td>Black</td>
<td>L</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lewis</td>
<td>A</td>
<td>Blue</td>
<td>M</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Scott</td>
<td>A</td>
<td>Blue</td>
<td>M</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tom</td>
<td>B</td>
<td>Red</td>
<td>L</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lewis</td>
<td>C</td>
<td>Red</td>
<td>S</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>On the other sheet, I'm hoping to breakdown all the combinations of the product. For example, if I select product A, it will tell me all the combinations, and sum of the combination. Example below. Wondering what formula should I use for this?</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Product</td>
<td>A</td>
<td>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td><td>
</td><td>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Color</strong></td>
<td><strong>Size</strong></td>
<td><strong>Total Qty</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Black</td>
<td>L</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gray</td>
<td>L</td>
<td>7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Black</td>
<td>M</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Blue</td>
<td>M</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Thanks a lot!<br />

<h2>            Navigation pane &#47; sidebar restricted in newer OneNote version</h2>
                    Previously we used to have the option to selectively show the Page list and/or the Section list in the navigation pane / sidebar. Now, we can no longer control this. If I want to keep the page list open, the section list shows up along with it. Thus the
 sidebar ends up taking half the screen. It is reasonable to expect that people would work on multiple pages at the same time so would want to keep the page list open in front of them so there should be some option to keep this visible while hiding away the
 section list. I don't understand why you guys would remove existing functionality rather than add something useful.

<h2>            Problems with Bing in Internet Explorer 10</h2>
                    <p>I had intermittent difficulty with the Bing page, where the page would be a blank grey.&nbsp; I found out this was occurring when the Bing page was not a static image, but had some dynamic feature to it, such as moving clouds. (I found this out by going to another
 computer that did not have&nbsp;the issue.) </p>
<p>I also noticed that other features of the Bing page did not function when the page was blank ("feedback" didn't work an there was no "Popular Now" section, for instance).&nbsp; I communicated with Bing help and&nbsp;they
<em>never </em>were able to help correct the problem.&nbsp; Then I had an unrelated issue with&nbsp;Windows 7, so I communicated&nbsp;about this issue&nbsp;with IT from Microcenter, where I had bought my new computer.&nbsp; He told me it was a known issue of corruption of a Windows
 program by Internet Explorer 10 and downgraded me to Internet Explorer 9.&nbsp; Not only did this correct the issue I was having with&nbsp;the Windows 7 application, but&nbsp;it also appears to have solved
<em><strong>two</strong></em> other issues, including the problem with Bing and yet another problem with accessing Pandora!!!!&nbsp; So.....there must&nbsp; be something funky about Internet Explorer 10, I would think.......&nbsp; I guess I have to stay with Internet Explorer
 9, for now, at least on my new desktop computer.&nbsp; Has anyone else had issues with Internet Explorer 10????&nbsp; Now, what's weird is that my office laptop has Internet Explorer 10 and Windows 7, also, but I have not had problems with the Bing page on it.&nbsp; On the

<p>I posted this in a non-question area and was advised to repost here.&nbsp; Since posting it, I now noticed a problem with a Bing page on the new desktop computer where I have Internet Explorer 9 installed (because there was a problem with 10 on that computer).&nbsp;
 Recently, there was a dynamic, animated page on Bing.&nbsp; (One where you can use up and down arrows and other means to&nbsp;change&nbsp;the "direction" from which you appear to be viewing a particular location.)&nbsp; On the new desktop with IE 9, it was just a plain picture.&nbsp;
 On&nbsp;my new laptop with IE 10, it worked fine.&nbsp;Both run on Windows 7. For my new desktop, I am afraid to go back to using IE 10, because with it I could not access Pandora radio and I got plain blank pages on the animated Bing page days.&nbsp; Why do IE 10 and Bing
 work together fine on my laptop, but not my desktop?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

    <title>How do I create an Outlook rule that looks for a whole word&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ewoods  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I create an Outlook rule that looks for a whole word&#63;</h2>
                    <div>Short version: How do I set up a rule to filter out a very short word like OT without also filtering words that
<i>contain</i> the word OT, like "not"?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Long version:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I just started working at a place that sends out massive amounts of overtime requests via email. &nbsp;These requests can come from anyone and the subject is usually something like, "OT available in building 10" or "Anyone want some OT on Friday?" &nbsp;I can get anywhere
 from ten to fifty of these a day. &nbsp;So obviously I want to set up a rule to filter them out, but since there's no set list of people who send them out, and no specific subject line, the only constant in all of them is the word "OT". &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In my ignorance, I set up a rule to move any email with the word "OT" in the subject line to the Overtime folder. &nbsp;I realized a few days later that it was also filtering email with words like "Note" and "Remote." &nbsp;So I then set up a rule to filter the
 word " OT ". &nbsp;Notice the space before and after. &nbsp;Well that worked for the emails where OT is in the middle of the subject somewhere, but not for the emails that start with the word OT. &nbsp;I added the word "OT " with a space after, but that captured words like
 "Hot" and "Not." &nbsp;I tried adding OT with quotes around it, but that didn't work at all. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So how can I create a rule that filters out all subject lines with the <i>whole word</i> "OT" and not words that contain
<i>the letters</i> "OT"?</div>
                </div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Rule searches search for substrings.&nbsp; It doesn't matter where in the string the substring is.&nbsp; However, if you put a delimiter of some kind in front and behind "OT" you can find it if it's in the middle of a string of words, like your second example.&nbsp;&nbsp;Use
 " OT " (i.e., space, oh, tee, space) and it will match "Anyone want some OT on Friday?"&nbsp;&nbsp;It will miss your first string "OT available in building 10, however, or "Anyone want some OT" without a question mark on the end.

            I had this exact problem with the Outlook app opening attachments on an iPad. I contacted Microsoft support and the solution (for me) was to "reset" the account. Specifically, within the Outlook app, choose Settings the bottom, pick the account for which
 you're having issues, and hit "Reset Account" (just above the Delete Account link so make sure you're careful). &nbsp;This immediately solved the problem. Hope it works for you.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Some rules in the Outlook client require the client to be open. I would like to confirm whether you keep the Outlook client open or not.</span></p>
<p><span>If yes, to look into the issue, can you please confirm the following information?</span></p>
<p><span>1. Is it an Exchange Online account that you have configured in the Outlook client?</span></p>
<p><span>2. What rule have you set? Please send us the detailed steps and a screenshot for it.</span></p>
<p><span>3. If you delete the rule and re-create it, does it work properly?</span></p>
<p><span>4. How many accounts have you configured in the Outlook client?</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your time and efforts.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Robert</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is from the outlook 2016 client.</p>
<p>We have a business premium office 365 license where you can download the clients to the desktop.</p>
<p>1. Yes</p>
<p>2. Its from previous rules, they were working and then they stopped.</p>
<p>Steps are - right click an email coming in, go to rules, then always move this item to a folder under my inbox.</p>
<p>Run the rule and it doesn't work.</p>
<p>3. Nope</p>
<p>4. just 1 account.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Shayan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my experience, there might be some other rules (server side/client side) interrupting some rule in the Outlook client. So, to narrow down the root cause, we suggest you clear all the other rules and just keep this one rule (which has stopped working)
 under a new Outlook profile. Or, double check whether “stop processing more rule” box has been checked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />

After some searching, I found that this certificate was assigned by MS Lync to my sip. Then why would this signature invalid and why would lync issue me an invalid digital certificate? How to make it valid?

    <title>Outlook 2016 disconnected - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> buzz lightyear  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 disconnected</h2>
                    <p>As of 8-16-16, I am not able to send or receive email via outlook with any reliability. The lack of connection is noted by the yellow triangle with exclamation mark super imposed on&nbsp;the Outlook symbol.&nbsp; At the bottom of the page is says disconnected 99%
 of the time.&nbsp; My internet connection is fine.&nbsp; I have exited Outlook and restarted. I have restarted my computer.&nbsp; I noted that 2 other things happened on this day.&nbsp; I got an email from Microsoft saying "Welcome to your new Outlook.com mobile experience" even
 though I've had the account for years.&nbsp; I did get a new iPhone 10 days earlier which distracted me into thinking that it had something to do with the problem.&nbsp; Today I noticed in my Control Panel that my MS Office 2016 suite was updated on that same day of
 8-16-16 when I started having the problem.&nbsp; There was another update available today which I have installed, but the problem persists.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook is part of my Office 2016 suite running on my Windows 10 desktop. The email account in question is an MSN account (same as hotmail) setup as an Exchange ActiveSync. I use Outlook Connector version 14.0.6132.5001.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            The Connector version is 4 years old.&nbsp; I suspected it wasn't being used anyway.&nbsp; I found another post about removing and then adding the email account back into Outlook.&nbsp; I performed this action and the account is staying reliably connected to the MSN
 server now.&nbsp; I was quite apprehensive about doing this as I was afraid of what other things it might impact.&nbsp; So far, so good.

            Dear Victoria 
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />If you are using Outlook.com, you can recover deleted items using tips in this article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/restore-deleted-email-messages-in-outlook-com-cf06ab1b-ae0b-418c-a4d9-4e895f83ed50" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/restor...</a>

<h2>            How to hide&#47;unhide certain worksheets and protect the workbook while sharing it&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a workbook that has 77 worksheets. I want to share it then send it to 8 Regional Sales Managers (RSM).&nbsp;They will either fill out the worksheets for their Account Managers'&nbsp;(AM) (there are 74 total AMs)&nbsp;and send back to me&nbsp;-OR-&nbsp;send it to their AMs
 to fill out their worksheets and&nbsp;send&nbsp;back to me. There are 2 things I'd like to do:</p>
<p>1. For each RSM,&nbsp;I'd like to hide the tabs that don't apply to them and protect the workbook so they can't unhide them. (Is it possible to do this while the workbook is shared? Keep in mind I would need to create 8 different workbooks for each RSM.)</p>
<p>2. I'd like to restrict who can enter information into each worksheet. For example: For worksheet named "Joe Schmoe", I'd like only Joe Shmoe and his RSM to be able to add information. Is that possible?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Also note:</span> I am creating this workbook in Excel 2007 and most of the people that are entering the info have Excel 2003. I have been saving my version as Excel 93-2003 Workbook to attempt to avoid issues.&nbsp;I believe

<p>What you ask is not so easy. And you can not strongly protect the Excel file and source code. We can hide all the sheets (except one) when we close the file. When you will open file, will be requested a password.</p>
<p>Try this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a new file with 7 sheets. </li><li>Try to copy/paste this code in ThisWorkbook module </li></ul>

    <title>Blackjack sync worked on XP and Outlook, now can&#39;t figure out how - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> isuzudavid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blackjack sync worked on XP and Outlook, now can&#39;t figure out how to do with Vista and new PC &#40;Windows Mail&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I downloaded all the new mobile device center pages and hooked up the bj - but it won't let me sync with "computer 2", and only lets me look like I am syncing with "Computer" - which was my old XP version using Activesync. Where can I force it to sync with
 "computer 2"?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From there I will need to instruct it where to put all the names and tasks - as I am not running Outlook with this vista machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone have a work-around?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Dave</p>

            Had same problem, have Blackjack, and AT&amp;T Tilt (HTC Kaiser), when upgraded to AS 4.5, couldn't sync anything.&nbsp; Check some of the other threads, search on my user name if you want to see some details.&nbsp; I just posted a partial solution and will hopefully
 have the rest soon.

            Dave, delete the partnerships from the device and on your PC.&nbsp; Soft reset the device, reboot the PC and try a new sync.

<p>My wife has just bought a C1-01 phone (PAYG) and every time she sends a text, the incoming message alert tone plays ,</p>
<p>It shows you the balance of how much is left on her account and then plays her incoming text alert tone.</p>
<p>We have tried turning off the delivery report but it still plays and it's really annoying, anyone know how to stop it please ??&nbsp;</p>

            I'm not sure how to stop it, but it sounds very much like an operator feature which is enabled.<br />
<br />
Call your operator, I'm sure they can tell you what it is. Probably possible to turn off within message settings -&gt; service messages or operator messages if your phone holds that feature, but also likely that your operator can turn it off for you. Anyway, have
 a call.

            This would be an operator issue they can only turn of the balance and you can also try turn off warning tones in profiles
