            <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>I just wanted to say I was having the same issue. I went through all of the above in regards to going through device manager to update drivers and such. Device manager told me that the most current and correct drivers were installed but it also told me that
 there were issues with the registry entry. I went to Toshiba for any software updates pertaining to my particular laptop. I got nothing there or at Microsoft that I could find. In fact I found where my model of laptop wasn't compatible with Windows 10. Then
 I did what I should have done in the first place. I uninstalled the cd/DVD player and restarted the computer. Windows reinstalled the cd drive and it works great. My suggestion to anyone with this same problem is to try this first. Uninstall your device and
 let Windows reinstall the device and see if that doesn't &nbsp;fix you right up.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Send signal from computer to projector - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael lawrance  say:</h3>
<h2>            Send signal from computer to projector</h2>
                    I use my computer to teach bible lessons. I have been using a projector in my classes, which receives a mirror image of what is on my computer screen. Last Sunday the projector indicated that it does not recognize the signal from my computer. I&nbsp;am using
 a Toshiba Satellite laptop. I was using the&nbsp;FN and F5 keys to toggle from computer only to having the same image on both&nbsp;my computer and the projector. Now, when I press the FN and F5 buttons, it only indicates LCD operation. If I plug in the cord from my
 computer to my projector, my computer screen goes blank and I&nbsp;briefly get a message on my projector screen saying that it does not recognize the signal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;I ran the troubleshooter but it did not solve my problem. Not only have I used my projector in my classes, but I have also used my TV. I connected to my TV, which&nbsp;uses the same connection cable that I use for my projector, and I was able to use my TV without
 any problem. At this point I am thinking that there is something wrong with my projector. My computer model is Satellite A505-S6005.</p>

<h2>            Space Channel 5 Kinect</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I was playing Space Channel 5 the other day with some friends and one of my firends thought hey, since there's kinect out, why don't they have a kinect version of the game? It would be really fun, even in the cut scenes especially when the crowd of civilians
 are dancing beside you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So here's a poll, who would like to have Space channel 5 Part 1 and Part 2 in a kinect version? I certainly would buy it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's so different it's great.&nbsp; Would love to have an updated version to play for both controller and Kinect as well.</p>

<p>I have talked about the same thing with my fiance. We both think they should make a new space channel 5 for the kinect. It would be a lot of fun. I absolutely adore this game. I have the sega collection with part 2 and I hate both parts for the ps2.</p>

<p>It would make a good Kinect title and a first day buy from me. I still remember when the lead singer of Dee Lite tried to sue Sega over this game..........groove is in the heart!</p>

<h2>            Unable to log into xbox.com or use Microsoft account on Xbox Live &#40;Win10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>My son's account is not able to utilize Xbox Live on some Win 10 games (Halo Spartan Strike, for example) nor is he able to log into xbox.com. &nbsp; His account started out as a local child account attached to my Microsoft account on Win 8. &nbsp;When we updated
 to Win 10, it had me move his account over to a full online account. &nbsp;He can log into the regular Microsoft sites just fine. &nbsp;It's just Xbox that is broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The games just tell him that he does not have an Xbox account and he has to play as a guest and is not able to save his progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When logging into the xbox.com site, he reports a server error on their end. &nbsp;The app behind xbox.com breaks.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a004a4a7-4ae6-48a0-9dde-512423e2608f" /></p>
<p>It doesn't matter which browser or computer I use. &nbsp;I've tried it on Chrome, FF, IE, and Edge on 3 PCs at home and one at work. &nbsp;It's just broken, period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've contacted support via the online chat thing and they were just about useless. &nbsp;They tell me his account looks fine and I should wait a few days to see if it resolves. &nbsp;When I try and tell them that
<em><strong>their </strong></em>site is breaking, they dismiss it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I go about getting this resolved? &nbsp;I am hoping somebody with more clout than the first-tier chat zombie can help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of your device?</p>
<p>Will this happens after reaching desktop screen or at Startup screen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that the issue might be with the Graphics card drivers. Try the below mentioned troubleshooting steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></span></p>

<strong>How do you want to search driver, </strong>then go with <strong>Search automatically for updated driver software.
</strong>If you have a driver available on your PC, then select <strong>Browse my computer for driver software,
</strong>then select the appropriate location, where the driver located on your PC for updating it. (<strong>Ensure that PC is connected to Internet while performing this step</strong>)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d). Once this is done, restart the computer to check the problem fixed. If it doesn't fix the issue, then Right click on the same driver and select “<strong>Uninstall</strong>” then restart the system and let the system install
 the driver automatically on Start. Check and see if it resolve the issue. (<strong>Recommended step</strong>)</span></p>

<p><span>Hi zproxy,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is a possibility that some third party programs installed on the computer is causing the issue in the normal mode. I would
 suggest that you perform clean boot and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers
 and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the below link to know more about clean boot procedure.</span></p>

<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Reset the computer to start as usual</span></strong></p>
<p><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></p>
<p><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or
 click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps!</span></p>

<p>Thank you for your reply but I do not have Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>I have Windows 10 Home which does not have the file gpedit.msc</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution is a free program called NoDefender.exe.&nbsp; This program will also allow Defender to be activated again if needed.</p>

<h2>            How to remove Slimcleaner Plus and DriverUpdate by Slimware</h2>
                    <p>This is not a question but my experience with Slimcleaner Plus and the DriverUpdate programs. &nbsp;After stupidly downloading, my Windows 7 system was unable to uninstall these programs. &nbsp;I was also unable to update Windows and the Windows Malware Removal tool
 did not find these programs. &nbsp;I was unable to restore my system to a prior date, and could not boot in safe mode by the F8 method. &nbsp;There were other administrative functions disabled. &nbsp;In my opinion these programs are malware. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to fix this by holding the power button down for a shut down. &nbsp;On a cold start I was asked if I wanted Safe Mode which I selected. &nbsp;In Safe Mode I was able to restore to a date prior to SlimCleaner and I was back in business. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I installed the paid-for SlimClean Plus on my W10 system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed to go ok -&nbsp;although I wouldn't know if it was really doing any good in any case - until it tried to get me to pay for their driver update feature.&nbsp;&nbsp; I uninstalled the separate routine
 that was asking for payment using windows uninstall.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then soon after, SlimClean started acting up, showing "analysing" and using up to 30% processor power continuously for over 24 hours, and I had to end it using task manager.</p>
<p>SlimClean helpdesk&nbsp;suggested two things to try: restore my PC back to a previous state; or uninstall and reinstall SlimClean.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried the latter. No difference, as soon as it loaded, it showed "analysing" which continued overnight.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I uninstalled,
 closed down, restarted&nbsp;and reinstalled.&nbsp;&nbsp; Still the same, still had to use task manager to close it down.</p>
<p>As for their first suggestion, if SlimClean can't cope with automatic updates of W10, then it is no use&nbsp;to me, I don't have the time, the inclination, nor indeed the knowledge to keep fiddling with restores etc because their software is not fit for purpose.</p>
<p>Cleverly, the software did not start to malfunction until after the 60 days refund period had expired.</p>
<p>Speaking with friends and colleagues, and looking at various websites, it looks as if these paid for "booster" or "cleaner" packages are a waste of money in any case, if you really want one, chose one of the freebies.</p>

<h2>            Windows update made my GPU stop working.</h2>
                    <p>After the last windows update (version 1709, OS 16299.125) whenever I try to launch a game it will crash, Overwatch gives the error "no compatible graphics hardware found" It worked perfectly fine before this update, I have updated all drivers, I have reinstalled
 games, installed new games, disabled the integrated graphics, and the same thing still happens. Dxdiag recognises the GPU I have (AMD Radeon 7900 series), and some games will boot into the title screen but crash if I try to actually play the game.<br />
<br />
Short of just trying to do a complete reinstall of everything (really trying to avoid this) I'm at a loss of what to do.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Aaron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A incompatibility between the graphics card driver and the Windows 10 update might have resulted to a GPU issue. We recommend that you reinstall the driver directly from the manufacturer's website. If the issue persists, kindly uninstall the driver, then
 reinstall the driver that you have downloaded. </p>

            I did unistall the drivers using DDU and reinstalled 309.77 Drivers from Nvidia's website icluding rolling back to 309.65. Phone support from Microsoft also doing the same and doing an OS repair. So far nothing has worked and I was told that my GPU is
 incompatible with the current build of Windows.

                    <p>I don't know about the Microsoft management ;-) but is anyone else "active" for more than 12 hours per day...I know I certainly am and there is nothing more frustrating than when you computer decides to reboot just as you pick it up in the morning or for
 that final check of emails at night!&nbsp; I really wish I could set the hours "I" require rather than being forced to pick either morning or evening!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else share this frustration...if so pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeese Microsoft remove the active hours "12" maximum!</p>

            <p>So I started having an issue with my computer screen going blank and freezing up - the cursor just sitting there on the screen sometimes and others just doing nothing at all. I'm assuming&nbsp;AT THIS POINT&nbsp;it was doing this automatic update outside of "active
 hours" garbage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had no idea about this "update". </p>
<p>
</p><p>I work at night. So not log after taking my computer out of hibernation it was happening to me whenever there were&nbsp; updates since it is outside of the 8 AM to 4 PM set window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I completely wiped my hard drive and reinstalled up from Windows 8 because of this garbage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I found this stupid setting yesterday and changed it to 7 PM to 7 AM, but I was going to send some e-mail to people at work after 7 AM AND I was in the middle of writing an e-mail ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just after 7 AM ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no message on the screen to say anything. My screen just goes blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was blank&nbsp; until after 12 Noon at least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, yes, I use my computer more than 12 hours a day. I tried to set this setting so that my computer was set up to be FUNCTIONAL around 20 hours per day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When was this added?! Why is there no warning on screen what is going on and when I will regain access to my computer?!</p>

 since as long as I've been on XBL. When Battleborn came out in May, however, my reputation plummetted. Most notably, the breakdown mentioned 23 reports of cheating, which is blatantly false. I perform very well and for others to avoid me, they have falsely
 accused me of cheating or even blocked me, which has caused me to be effectively banned from most Xbox Live online play simply for performing well. I know this is because of my presence in Battleborn; I never trash talk, and my mess

<p>A change in an account’s reputation score is not considered an enforcement action and is not indicative of a suspension; it’s possible to have a low reputation score without violating the Microsoft Services Agreement or Code of Conduct. Instead, reputation
 reflects how the Xbox Live community views a player’s behavior over time. The reputation system emphasizes a player’s sportsmanship and overall attitude and is intended to help ensure a level playing field for all Xbox Live members.</p>

<p>I understand how reputation works; Xbox can see for itself that a massive influx of reports beginning in May-&gt;June are the reason my reputation has dropped. I also understand that it is supposed to be resilient to multiple baseless reports, but the issue
 is that I am being reported over the span of several days/weeks for performing disproportionately well in Battleborn, which draws several reports/blocks, all of which have led to my reputation taking a tremendous spike into the red from May-&gt;June (my detailed
 reputation report affirms this). </p>
<p>While I know you or any of the moderators are not directly capable of "fixing" reputation, I have noticed that this is not an isolated incident and that throughout all of the threads detailing similar scenarios, no clear justification has been provided as
 to why the reputation system allows for this to happen in the first place. 23 reports of cheating from May-&gt;June. Shouldn't SOMEBODY have investigated by now and found the reports to be baseless and as such, irrelevant when taking my reputation into consideration?</p>
<p>This is not an issue about simply being a better member of the XBL community; labelling it as such is too reductive and vague, especially given my nearly spotless record in the years prior. I should not have to play games I don't want to because of a system
 that is not fully functioning as intended (like any feature, it has aspects which leave much to be desired, the reputation system being no exception). This is simply a tremendously bad look for the Xbox team, because these incidents are not even recognized
 as being legitimate concerns for those capable of fixing it.</p>
<p>Rather than provide a generic response, I would like my concerns to be specifically addressed.</p>

<p>You realize that blatantly ignoring everything I just mentioned is also a bad look for Xbox, as well as poor communication and customer service as well, right? I'm raising awareness about this issue, as it is directy impacting mine and several other gamers'
 experience with XBL, and giving us the exact same runaround isn't productive on either end.
</p>
<p>I've also noticed threads being locked without actually directly addressing the situation-specific issues posed in them. Again, as a service to you and your team members, the community views this sort of behavior to be in very poor taste, and does nothing
 but irk the consumer (see: most of us do at least SOME research before creating threads.) Now, I'll ask again: can we expect a legitimate response from Xbox regarding the rampant false reports that lower reputations into levels where we cannot even enjoy the
 games and subscription we pay for? As you can tell, there are some very unsatisfied customers at your doors - simply sweeping these issues under the rug is the worst thing the Xbox team can do, so for our sake, the consumers, give us what we ask for: address,
 assess, and evaluate solutions for this issue, don't idle and leave your customers unsatisfied.</p>

<p>Again, this isn't an issue that should be reduced to "because the community thinks you're a bad sport, it must be you, so tough luck."
</p>
<p>I don't disagree with you when you say bragging/acting as if everybody is sad at losing reeks of bad sportsmanship; while this is true, that's simply NOT what's occurring in my case. As I've mentioned, I'm in a party with friends 100% of the time, and Xbox
 can even review my messages to see that I don't parade around as the bad sport you have already labelled me as (even though I've outlined this information already). You aren't in a position to do so, regardless, if you aren't willing to dive deeper into this
 case.</p>
<p>Whether or not you think so, the system isn't perfect; if it were, we wouldn't have an issue to begin with (see again: May-&gt;June possesses a big influx of reports - do you really believe that in one month, I turned into a horrible member of the community).
</p>
<p>If this forums cannot do anything but pin the blame exclusively on its consumers without even reviewing the facts of each scenario case-by-case, then what are WE (the other members also in the same position, who I'm sure aren't nearly the bad sport you would
 have them labelled as) to do? It's clear that the enforcement team isn't reviewing these cases, because after 23 reports of cheating, you'd think some action would be taken. And if that action is to simply lower my reputation until I can't play because it's
 easier, then what exactly is the benefit of even having an enforcement team?</p>
<p>To stay on topic, the community needs a way to combat this issue - in many cases, it exists as a result of performing too well (this has been happening more prevalently in Overwatch, where skilled players are being blocked/reported so one doesn't match them
 again). We know that being a bad sport is bad, focus on the issue at hand: there are cases of false/excessive reporting caused by a player's competence in a game that lead to that very player serving an unwarranted matchmaking ban. Again, sweeping this under
 the rug is simply not productive on either end. </p>

<p>Are you reading what I'm posting? My attitude/belief about why I'm being reported (23 reports of CHEATING) has no bearing on why I'm in "Avoid Me." Why? Because, as I've mentioned several times, I don't voice communicate with those I beat (I'm in a party
 with friends). I also don't send messages bragging. </p>
<p>I've been playing competitively enough to know ways people dodge those who beat them - and in this case, it's the report/reputation system being used dishonestly in order to prevent being matched with a player. Where this becomes problematic is in the fact
 that if enough people pursue this avenue, one's account can be tanked into "Avoid Me," where we're unable to fully enjoy any of the games or subscription we pay for.
</p>
<p>If I don't harrass/brag to those I beat, what else do I do to be a "good" sport (even though the 23 reports of cheating haven't even been acknowledged besides in lowering my rep)? Sandbag and not try my hardest? That's simply not an option for some competitive
 people like me.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth mouse frequently disconnects from Surface Book 2</h2>
                    I am using a Logitech MX Ergo with my Surface Book 2.&nbsp; After several weeks of problem free use, my mouse started disconnecting from the computer several times a day - sometimes several times within one hour.&nbsp; I have searched everywhere, and the only solution
 I'm finding is to uncheck "allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" under power management for the bluetooth radio adapter.&nbsp; Unfortunately, that has not worked for me.&nbsp; Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

<h2>            Surface Book Overheating warning and restart</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi, I have a new SurfaceBook, I7, 16GB, 500SSD.</span></p>

<p><span>I have had it a few weeks now and on occasion I have returned to my desk to find that it had restarted.</span></p>

<p><span><span>Yesterday I was in two long meeting with it, just on battery power and I noticed that it suddenly showed a white temperature image on a black screen and then restarted itself. The machine
 was running on battery only and I felt the surface and the keyboard but it did not feel at all hot.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>This then happen again a couple of hours later. At neither point was I actually using the machine nor was it running and intensive processes.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Is this a known issue or fault? How can I diagnose this further?</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>T</span><span>hanks in advance for your help.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi Amanda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>There are several factors that can contribute to the you're facing with pairing a Bluetooth device to your laptop. This could be caused by a recent update or missing update components. For us to resolve your concern, kindly answer the questions below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which Windows version are you using? You may check this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> on how to figure it out.</li><li><span>Is there a PIN provided on the said Bluetooth device? Have you tried asking or checking it from the manufacturer?</span><br />
</li><li>H<span>ave you tried to connect other Bluetooth devices to your computer and see if the same issue will occur?</span></li><li><span>Did you try to pair the Bluetooth headphone to another computer if it will also ask for the PIN?</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to the requested information.</p>
<br />

<p>Try 0000. That's often the default pin on Bluetooth devices.</p>
