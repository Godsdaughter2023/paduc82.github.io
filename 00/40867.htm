<h2>            in game keyboard input lag</h2>
                    <p>Hi (not sure I am in the correct category but) my name is Zakaria El Aiassi;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem that every time I play a game (like Roblox, Minecraft, fortnite, etc.) when I press WASD it lags to, either receive or stop 'pressing' when I'm not pressing any button. My game (except for fortnite) doesn't lag so that's not the problem.</p>
<p>Also I've tried to update the driver but that didn't seem to do the trick</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you guys find a solution because I have tried for DAYS to find a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(Specs; Lenovo Yoga 520, Windows 10 Home, 360 degree turn able (could be the cause of lag), latest Bios( I think))</p>

            Hello my name is Bradford, and I'm an Independent Advisor for the Microsoft Community, and I will try to resolve your problem with keyboard lagging during Games. 
<br />Have you optimized your system for the best performance possible during games? 
<br />Due to the amount of data that must flow in between different components the same games are more taxing on system resources than others. 
<br />To resolve your issue, please follow the tutorial at the link below.

<br />Please let me know afterward if the problem exists or there is anything else I can answer.

<p><em>"360 degree turn able (could be the cause of lag)"</em></p>
<p>- What is this ?</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I hope you guys find a solution because I have tried for DAYS to find a solution.</em></p>
<p>- I those days what are all the fixes or tweaks, other than updating the graphics driver you have tried that did not help ?</p>
<p>Are you using graphics drivers supplied by Lenovo (best option), and have you checked for more recent drivers for your</p>
<p>machine ?</p>
<p>Is the machine successfully switching from the Intel HD graphics to the Nvidia graphics processor when you launch the game ?</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"My game (except for fortnite) doesn't lag so that's not the problem."</em></p>
<p>- I'm not clear on what you are saying here, but if Fortnite is the only game that is lagging you may be using too high in
</p>
<p>game graphics settings, or have V-sync enabled when it is not necessary. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Judging by&nbsp; <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-GeForce-940MX.156033.0.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
- this review and benchmarks&nbsp; -</a>&nbsp; your machine (if I have the correct graphics processor) will run Fortnite at around 40fps
</p>
<p>using the medium preset. </p>
<p>On line performance could be less if there when there is a lot of activity. If&nbsp; the frame rated drop below 25fps there is good</p>
<p>chance of lag. </p>
<p>- What brand and model does your particular Lenovo sub-model use ? Are you using an external monitor ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regarding the 'optimising' in the linked article above....</p>
<p>- You cannot Update or Install DirectX 12. There is no stand alone DX12 installer.</p>
<p>DX 12 is installed with Windows, and when MS do release any new DX files they will be installed by Windows Updates, or</p>
<p>by using the&nbsp; -&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=35" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> DirectX Web Installer</a>&nbsp; - . MS should also release a stand alone installer at that&nbsp; time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Enabling Game Mode may help add a couple more frame rates if you are using a machine with a low end graphics processor,
</p>
<p>but it can also cause issues with some games. Game Mode does nothing the User cannot do themselves, and is no real benefit</p>
<p>to high end machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The important <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>DirectX Diagnostic Tool</em></span>&nbsp; ( dxdiag) information in reference to gaming is in the
<p>This is the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>Feature Levels</em></span> section in the Drivers column.</p>
<p>The System tab only shows what level DX Win10 is capable of using, not what the graphics processor is capable of using.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Ultimate Word Games not syncing with Xbox.</h2>
                    Microsoft Ultimate Word Game not syncing with Xbox since mid-August. All achievements are shown on Xbox stats but won't sync to my game. All prior history is gone. It allows me to sign in without issue. My other Microsoft games do sync as normal. I have
 tried resetting the game app on my computer w/o success. I am playing the games on my Windows 10 PC with all current updates installed.

<h2>            Virgin Media Super Hub and 2 Xboxes - Possible&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I've been trying to set up my Virgin Media Super Hub so that I can use 2 Xboxes online with it. So far i've read a million posts all over the internet from a while back (most seem to be from about February) and it seems there's a lot of problems.</p>
<p>Basically I would like to know if anything has been fixed and if it is actually possible to connect two xboxes to the super hub without any problems. I've already tried a bunch of things that people suggested and nothing has worked. I'm currently using the
 super hub as a modem with my own linksys router to try and get it to work but no luck so far.</p>
<p>My router should work fine because it is what I used until recently (when I upgraded to the Super Hub) and there was no previous problems connecting to both xboxes (the old modem was taken by virgin and I was told to use the Hub as my router).</p>
<p>So is it even possible or should I just give up? Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

<p>So I did some looking on the internet about Virgin Media Super Hub. It looks like the hub is not strong enough for two Xbox 360's running Xbox Live. I would first try and see if you can contact Virgin Media and see if they can some how upgrade the speed,
 then see if they can open up these ports</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Port 88 (UDP)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Port 3074 (UDP and TCP)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Port 53 (UDP and TCP)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Port 80 (TCP)</p>
<p>Have them open these ports and you might be able to run two Xbox 360's connected to live.</p>

<p>Ok, thanks for the advice, I will try this. What if I use the hub as just a modem though? Surely it won't really be doing much so therefore should allow me to use multiple xbox's if my router can?</p>

Microsoft Level 2 support keeping calling me back (which is great), however they never call at the agreed time...in fact the first time they called it was middle of the night, second time I was at work.....<br />

How can I get someone to call me when I am available? Or engage by email?<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
I understand the inconvenience caused. I will try my best to help you resolve this issue.<br />
<br />
<div>To assist you better, please answer the following questions:<br />
1.&nbsp;Have you tried logging in with the previous operating system's password?<br />
2. Do you have other administrator using which you can login to the computer?</div>
<div>3. Is the "UpdatusUser" account a Microsoft account or a local account?<br />
<br />
<div>If it is a Microsoft account, I would suggest you to reset the password by clicking
<a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here.</a><br />
<br />
<div>If&nbsp;you have other administrator user account, I would suggest you to&nbsp;try these steps from that.</div>
<div>1. Press <strong>Windows Key </strong>+ <strong>R</strong>.</div>
<div>2. Type <strong>Netplwiz </strong>and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</div>
<div>3. <strong>Select </strong>the Unknow user account and click on <strong>Remove</strong>.</div>
<div>4. Click on <strong>Apply </strong>and <strong>Ok</strong>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Restart the computer and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Do let us know if this helps. We will be glad to help if you need further assistance.

<span>Hi Vashi: &nbsp;Thank you for your reply.</span></div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
<span>1. &nbsp;Yes - I tried using my old Win 8.1 Password and it does not work either.</span></div>
<div>
<span>2. &nbsp;I have another Administrator account but the "UpdatusUser" &nbsp;will not allow me to use it.</span></div>
<div>
<span>3. &nbsp;I believe that it is a Microsoft Account. &nbsp;I never was there until I upgraded to Win 10.</span></div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
<span>I tried the 4 steps below and again, the UpdatusUser pops up and asks for a Password. &nbsp;I do not know what this Password may be.</span></div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
If&nbsp;you have other administrator user account, I would suggest you to&nbsp;try these steps from that.</div>
<div>
1. Press&nbsp;<span>Windows Key&nbsp;</span>+&nbsp;<span>R</span>.</div>
<div>
2. Type&nbsp;<span>Netplwiz&nbsp;</span>and hit&nbsp;<span>Enter</span>.</div>
<div>
3.&nbsp;<span>Select&nbsp;</span>the Unknow user account and click on&nbsp;<span>Remove</span>.</div>
<div>
4. Click on&nbsp;<span>Apply&nbsp;</span>and&nbsp;<span>Ok</span>.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
<div>
I would like to reload Win 10 but again, I cannot because this "UpdatusUser" blocks everything.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Thank you kindly for your help and I hope we can find a solution.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            NO storage on HP Tools &#39;F&#39;</h2>
                    I have an almsot new HP laptop. For the past week I have been receiving a constant pop-up telling me that no storae left on HP Tools 'F'. I went into 'My Computer' and the HP Tools bar is completely red, i.e. no memory left. Why is this and how can I free
 it up again? Thanks for any help.

            <p>When you purchase from a big brand maker that maker installs various paritions/tools on the system by default.</p>
<p>Generally nothing should be saved to these partitions,eg Recovery/HP Tools.</p>
<p>The msg you are seeing maybe just the default msg the win7 shows, when any partition is full, and it may not be due to you explicitly saveing anything to that partition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are able to view that partition in Explorer you should be able to see if any files/folders have inadvertantly been saved to that partition by checking file names/dates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also Under System Properties &gt;System Protection, under available drives, if HP Tools Partition is visible, select it, then Configure Btn, ensure Turn Off system protection is selected.</p>
<p>And if that doesnt resolve the issue, try HP support or their user groups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW Have you created the recovery disk set, by following HP instructions?</p>

<p>Canadian subsidizes are way less then the USA. We finally got rid of the CWB so farmer are now able to sell there product legally through private marketing instead of being told when and for how much by the government.</p>

<p>As for excitement, it's a RPG, just instead of guns and weapons you operate equipment....&nbsp;&nbsp; looking forward to this.</p>

<p>When criticizing someone, or a group of people, it is often a good idea to make sure you do so in the most intelligent fashion possible. &nbsp;On a forum, this means using proper English conventions.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Remember kiddies, the only judge of intelligence we have on this forum to go by are what and how you write. &nbsp;</p>
<p>[/quote] Actually,being an informal place, the emphasis on grammar and spelling are only subjective. Unless I'm writing an academic paper or decide to be serious, I usually make sure what I have is legible enough because frankly, I don't care. A public,
 internet forum hardly needs such strict prose.</p>

<h2>            Audio Service Not Starting, Need Help</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">I have tried multiple things from many tutorials and forum threads, but to no avail. First, I tried to run the troubleshooter multiple times, which stops for different error reasons. Second, I deleted/re-installed drivers. This
 did not help. I then went into Services and started the RPC. I tried to start the Windows Audio Endpoint Builder, but I am unable to. I need this to start so I can run the actual audio service. The different errors I have gotten from the audio endpoint builder
 are 1067(when I tried to run it on Local System), 1079(when I run it with Local Service), and&nbsp;1057(when I run it with "NT AUTHORITY..."). I have tried opening Command Prompt and PowerShell multiple times as an administrator, but I only get error 0xc0000142.
 I don't have a copy of Windows 10 or any other version of Windows(this PC already had Win 7 when I got it, and I used the free upgrade). Does anyone know what else I can try?</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentHeader2">UPDATE 1-</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I have found out that, if I use advanced startup, I CAN run Command Prompt. I tried this with the command sfc /scannow, but this is what I got:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">X:\windows\system32&gt;sfc /scannow</p>

<h2>            RemoteApp session is closing right after it open - Windows Server 2008 r2</h2>
                    <p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This thursday (11 december 2014)&nbsp;one of my clients cannot start any remoteapp to his Terminal server.</p>
<p>When he start a remoteapp from any computer&nbsp;with any user (admin or not) the termial server open the session and then close it immediatly.</p>
<p>I dont have found any errors in the eventviewer...&nbsp;The server successfully open the session, apply GPO and everything else and then close the session like if the user want it !</p>
<p>But when a user open a normal session, he can use the terminal server without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After hours of investigation I finally found that updates was installed in the night before the problem appears.</p>
<p>When I have removed these updates for a test my remoteapps start to work normaly just&nbsp;like before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, I let these updates uninstalled and mask it so the problem doesn't appears anymore.</p>
<p>I can't do more test to know exactly wich one of these updates was the problem because this is a production server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The updates are :</p>
<p>KB3008923</p>
<p>KB3013126</p>
<p>KB3006625</p>
<p>KB3013410</p>
<p>KB3014406</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably one of the first two is the cause because they both are security updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;hope it can help someone if you encounter the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry if my English isn't perfect, I tried to learn everyday ;)</p>
<p>

    <title>How to really uninstall a Lenovo ACPI-compliant Driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vincelixl  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to really uninstall a Lenovo ACPI-compliant Driver</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lenovo Y40, and ever since I upgraded to Win10, my PC cannot read the battery gauge correctly. After doing some research, I realized Lenovo Energy Manager and the Lenovo acpi-compliant virtual power controller driver are the problems. (I hate junkware)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted Lenovo Energy Manager with no problem, but I can't get rid of the Lenovo acpi-compliant virtual power controller driver. Here are the steps I'm stuck with:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If I go into device manager and uninstall the driver, the driver will disappear, and upon restart, it will show up again as an unknown driver.</p>
<p>- If I uninstall/disable this unknown driver, upon restart/hibernation, it will come back again under 'system devices' as 'Lenovo acpi-compliant virtual power controller driver', as if I didn't do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this driver is listed as unknown driver or temporarily disabled, my battery gauge issues are immediately resolved. &nbsp;Does anyone have any idea how to get rid of annoying drivers like this one once and for all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Microsoft security proofs Error code 80151006 cant log into xbox live</h2>
                    
<p>Looks like I cant log on xbox live anymore because of this new security feature.&nbsp; I signed on xbox live 2 days ago and the microsoft security proof message came up saying&nbsp;I needed to give my email and password information so that my profile can be more secure,
 unfortunataly it had stuck with my old email that does not exist anymore even though I have already updated to my new email through my windows live id.&nbsp; I somehow managed to log on live the first time after giving the new email and password no problem, but
 the next day I tryed to log on my xbox live account it came up with the same message telling me I needed to give the email and password again so I did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happened next was another message screen came up saying somthing about an error code 80251006 and signed me out of my profile and xbox live.&nbsp; I decided to log on my account through the xbox website and clicked on the microsoft security proofs tab on
 the bottom of the page.&nbsp;I saw that my email that was linked to my microsoft account was the old one so I decided to change it to my new one so I could get passed the error code hopefully, it turns out that it takes a month for the changes to be made through
 the microsoft account which in my opinion is really dumb.</p>
<p>Anyone else have this problem? If you know how to fix this or already tryed my solution which I have to wait till May 10 to find out, please let me know.</p>
<p>Also I hope some of the support people can help me out of well and leave me a solution to this problem thanks.</p>

<p>This whole "security proofs" thing is bs. &nbsp;I have four kids. &nbsp;When they have been logging on to XBOX Live, they were just skipping the security proofs question. &nbsp;Now that my nine year old has done is so many times, he is now locked out. &nbsp;Tried to resolve
 the problem with a support person today, waste of time. &nbsp;You have to be able to remember all these email addresses, passwords, last four digits of credit card used to pay for account, addresses when acount was set up--I;ve moved four times in last six years
 when account was originally set up. &nbsp;Unbelieveable--I'm ready to sell my two XBOX's on Craigslist and go to Sony Playstation. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Sad to hear but the thing is you only had this account for a year not 6 so im not sure, but it is your responsibility to be aware of your Xbox account and as a parent/guardian, As well as you have the option to disable it which you could have done on the
 website or the console which can take the security proofs off.</p>

<p>Hey there to everyone in the thread!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The security proofs are there to protect you, but if have problems logging in, try this.... &nbsp;Make sure you know your MLID and password first...</p>
<p>Please let us know if you were successful...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Check <a href="https://account.live.com/Proofs/Manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
account.live.com/.../Manage</a> to see if at least two security proofs are setup and verified</p>
<p>2. Delete your profile from the console, be sure to select Delete profile only, to do so check this link:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../profile-move-delete</a></p>
<p>3. Clear the console cache, see this link for the how to: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../clear-system-cache</a></p>
<p>4. Turn the console off.</p>
<p>5. Turn the console on.</p>
<p>6. Clear the console cache one more time like in step 3</p>
<p>7. Redownload your profile.(See the same link as 2.) you might have enter the security verification afterwards and all should be fine again.</p>

 out. &nbsp;WHATEVER!</p>

<p>Well, I'm sure the steps above will work but I'll have to wait a month later for the security proofs to be updated which is very unusual, why does the microsoft proofs take that long to update anyway?</p>

<p>When you opt to have all your security info removed, messages are sent to every phone and email proof on your account. For your protection, this process will take 30 days to resolve. You will not be locked out of the Xbox LIVE service during this time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>•The process of resetting your security proofs is designed to make sure that your account isn’t being accessed by an unauthorized user and to safeguard your account information (including any credit card information associated with your account).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>•Xbox Support cannot expedite this process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>•You have the option of creating a new account at any time. However, once your existing account has been recovered, the two accounts cannot be merged (for instance, any achievements earned or gamerscore points accumulated through your new account cannot
 be added to your old account).</p>

<p>Unremote control : Finally, somebody told the true, These problem are created by mother microsoft, ok ok, i'm happy then control my account for security, but man, they must &nbsp;notice the Users in other way, they can't block my profile acces in that way...
 &nbsp;we are not China, it's Europe.</p>
<p>Anyway, the solution to fix it for me was Delete only profile (no elements), delete Cache system 3 times, and RE-download my profile, now it work thanks to GOd...</p>

<h3> nani4net  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not able to connect Bluetooth headset to Wndows 7 Enterprise &#40;64-bit&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I tried to connect a new Bluetooth headset to my Lenovo T420 laptop.</p>
<p>The laptop is running on Windows 7 Enterprise SP1 (64 bit OS).</p>
<p>The laptop has the inbuilt Bluetooth adapter and I switched it ON.</p>
<p>I also switched ON my headset and kept it in discovery mode.</p>
<p>After that, I added the headset using 'Add a device' button from Control Panel -&gt;Devices and Printers.</p>
<p>Windows 7 installed the required drivers and the headset is added successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I tried to connect the headset using Bluetooth configuration dialog window.</p>
<p>I did a right click on the headset icon from Control Panel -&gt;Devices and Printers.</p>
<p>The right click didn't display the 'Control' option for the headset.</p>
<p>It showed only other options - 'Create shortcut', 'Troubleshoot', 'Remove device', 'Properties' .</p>
<p>So, I won't be able to connect my Bluetooth headset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the same headset on my friend's laptop.</p>
<p>His laptop is running on Windows 7 Home Edition (32 bit OS).</p>
<p>The Bluetooth headset connected properly and the 'control' option is also available on right click.</p>
<p>The 'control' option provided the Bluetooth configuration dialog window where I can use the 'connect' button to connect the headset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly let me know the resolution for the issue.</p>

<h2>            Windows update KB2991936 error 80073712</h2>
                    <p>Just some positive feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ten days ago I installed some updates including KB2991963, which failed with error 80073712. Tried installing again that day and again it failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried again today along with 4 other updates being offered. It immediately failed again but the other 4 continued to download and install, although the final one took about 45 minutes before completing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turned out the last update was KB947821 'System Update Readiness Tool For Windows 7' which automatically fixed whatever was causing the error and allowed me to re download&nbsp; and successfully install KB2991963.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a side note: During this period I started having problems with using remote desktop, but the above process also fixed this (don't know if just coincidental).</p>

            Hi dipdas
<br />
<br />Diagnostic data sent back to Microsoft does not contain any personal data, a screenshot is also not sent with that data.
<br />
<br />Ink data is stored as a set of points in xml format and is basically not human readable
<br />
<br />All diagnostic data is analyzed by server farms, not human beings
<br />
<br />Rest assured, you do not need to worry about personal data in those diagnostic uploads . ..

<h2>            Windows Update 8.1.1 on Surface Pro</h2>
                    I recently was told that I needed to update and restart my Windows 8.1 on Surface Pro 128GB.&nbsp; When the update is done, it then tries to restart and at that point it says that the update did not complete and removes it.&nbsp; Is anyone else having this problem
 and how did you fix it?&nbsp; I have tried eight times to do this update and each time it is the same result.&nbsp; I took the tablet back to the Microsoft store and they encountered the same trouble.&nbsp; Their suggestion was to wait for the next update to fix the problem.&nbsp;
 What do you do?

    <title>Disable Windows 10 updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable Windows 10 updates</h2>
                    <p>I have 4 computers which display a single webpage which keeps our customers up to date. Each was purchased with a small 32GB drive due to their meager requirements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frequently through the day I must access these computers to get rid of the notification for the update which covers most of the screen making the computers useless. The problem is there's no longer enough room to accommodate the updates. There's less than
 4GB of disk space remaining and the update is requiring 8GB. We only have installed ScreenConnect to access the screens remotely access the computers. The ScreenConnect client is just over 2MB which means Windows is using everything else. There's nothing left
 to remove. There are no restore points, there's a small pagefile. There is no way to complete the update. At best, I can achieve just under 4GB of free disk space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't care about security updates on these computers since they only display one trusted web site. I don't care about new features. These computers could stay the way they are now forever. I find it absolutely ridiculous I've added&nbsp;just over 2MB of software
 and there's not enough room.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've disabled the&nbsp;Windows update process, Windows simply resets it back to on.&nbsp;I've tried various "fixes" found on the net and none seem to eliminate the problem. I've even&nbsp;changed the setting for Ethernet to&nbsp;a metered connection, that just changes the message
 to let me know there are updates and tells me they're important. They're not important to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Microsoft has no business forcing these updates on customers if the customer doesn't want them. There has to be a solution.</p>

<br />Option 3: 
<br />
<br />Use Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update:

<p>Mark,</p>
<p>I, too, have tried various things found on the internet. I also did notice that disabling the service was no longer a viable solution as it somehow ended up turning back on.&nbsp; What I did come across, however, is a folder in task scheduler called WindowsUpdates.&nbsp;
 There seem to be a different number of tasks depending on which computer you look at (I look after quite a few computers here and I've noticed anywhere from 3 to 11 tasks in that folder).&nbsp; I have disabled them all, and so far, 3 weeks later, none of those
 computers had any windows updates done on them.&nbsp; You might want to give that a try and see if it will help you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks, I'll add that to my list of things to try. It's gotten better, now only a couple of times a day. Every solution seems to bring another problem. I could accept Microsoft turning the updates back on if it could be done accidentally. But, turning them
 back on after going through several screens to disable them is arrogant. I too tried just disabling the update service only to find it back to the default setting the next day.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I've disabled anything related to defender or updates in the scheduler on one unit, so far no issues for four days. I've did the other three this morning and hoping for the best. Seems a lot of work to not get something you don't want.</p>

<p>Active hours and metered is a <strong>bandaid to the problem</strong> and does not fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today for example:</p>
<p>I started up our most used computer and it went directly into applying Windows updates, during active hours and when I really need access to it.
</p>
<p>I ended up going to another computer, started it up and got the information I needed.
</p>
<p>That computer is the 1st MAC we recently added to the system. The other PC's are being replaced with MAC's thanks to Windows 10 and Microsoft's move to CONTROL of PC's in favor of them making more money and enabling business's to do to the internet what
 TV networks have done to the television. As much as I have always disliked MACS in the past, I am looking forward to it.</p>
<p>In the past we have always set updates in motion at the close of business going into the weekend when it did not interfere with use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC was finally able to be used 35 min later and long after the MAC gave me the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hotmail is slow, freezes and it is interconnected with Skype, Calendar etc...junk for those who use neither so we have all switched to GMail, Bing is terrible so Google is the search engine of choice, Edge is terrible and Firefox has been installed on all
 computers. Not to mention, kiddie games and Xbox added to all computers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>All the above benefit Microsoft while they will claim it is all being done for US. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems the only department that is doing a good job is Microsoft's Marketing Department who are dangling carrots so we don't notice they now OWN your computer and all your data.</p>

<p>Mark,</p>
<p>I, too, have tried various things found on the internet. I also did notice that disabling the service was no longer a viable solution as it somehow ended up turning back on.&nbsp; What I did come across, however, is a folder in task scheduler called WindowsUpdates.&nbsp;
 There seem to be a different number of tasks depending on which computer you look at (I look after quite a few computers here and I've noticed anywhere from 3 to 11 tasks in that folder).&nbsp; I have disabled them all, and so far, 3 weeks later, none of those
 computers had any windows updates done on them.&nbsp; You might want to give that a try and see if it will help you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I've disabled anything related to defender or updates in the scheduler on one unit, so far no issues for four days. I've did the other three this morning and hoping for the best. Seems a lot of work to not get something you don't want.</p>

<p>It is terrible that we must do whatever we can to stop Microsoft from treating
<strong>OUR</strong> computers like <strong>THEY</strong> own them. Bad enough that although they cannot own the internet, they are creating a situation whereas
<strong>THEY</strong>&nbsp; will eventually control it's ability to use.</p>

<p>thank you so much for your post. It really explains a lot! I am older than dirt...so I cannot start contrasting and comparing systems, etc. and will have to stay FRUSTRATED with WINDOWS! These unwanted updates are impossible to stop and makes me angry, but
 I guess I'll have to stay mad!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am surprised that Apple hasn't bombarded the media with ads showing the discontent PC users have with Microsoft. Not that I am a big fan of Apple either and Google isn't even in the running as an O.S. in my mind.</p>
<p>I know a local computer repair store has hired his 1st MAC technician due to an increase in MAC buyers since Windows 10 and he has been</p>
<p>kept busy butchering Windows 10 for customers trying to eliminate all the junk added to it.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Firewall. Disable and file sharing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> desmos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Firewall. Disable and file sharing</h2>
                    
<p>I have a program that is unable to work while windows 7 firewall is enabled. I have tried restoring the firewall to default and then repeatably allowing the program access. I have tried the more advanced options and they still do not work. I have resorted
 to installing a third party software firewall and behold I have found out I cannot disable windows 7 firewall AND disable network sharing and file sharing.</p>
This is super poor design. I do not want networking sharing or file sharing on at all. What am I supposed to do in this situation?

<p>When i turn off the firewall it turns those options back on. I can still disable them, but ever time i enable then disable it resets these settings. Is there a way to permanently disable this stuff through gpedit.msc e.g.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

I know its virus related, the only thing I've herd to do is, first removal the rootkit and virus, do a dirty reinstall...(dirty meaning keep your files/programs from the previous install)&nbsp;so far I havent found any fixes that work. I spend 8 hours reading post
 after post and you are the first one I've come across that has the EXACT same issue...
