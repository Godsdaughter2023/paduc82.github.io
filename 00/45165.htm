            <p>Hi, late reply here so apologies if this has already been solved. Despite being directed to the xbox site for help the problem has nothing to do with consoles; you can try following these steps to reset you PC clock which is a common problem with a few apps
 that require media to be streamed, probably a sync issue. </p>

            <p>Hi Richard, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Let’s start with some questions.<br />
1. What is the make and model number of the computer?<br />
2. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?<br />
3. Which drivers have you updated?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
You can also follow this link.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
I want you to try the following methods to resolve the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Method 1: Try running the troubleshooter.<br />
Follow the link and instructions mentioned in the link.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Method 2: <br />
Try using different USB ports and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
As all the hardware devices have drivers associated similarly USB devices also have it. Sometimes proper drivers do not get detected after the initial installation so reinstallation of the drivers helps resolve the issues.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may check after uninstalling and reinstalling the USB drivers if you are able to connect. You may disconnect all USB devices and then perform the following steps:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Click Start, and then click Control Panel.</div>
<div><br />
b. Click System and Maintenance, click System, and then click Device Manager.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Note: If Control Panel is in Classic View, double-click System, and then click Device Manager.</strong></div>
<strong>
<div><br />
</strong>
<div>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</div>
<div><br />
c. In Device Manager, double click to expand "Universal Serial Bus controllers", right click on the Host Controller, click "Uninstall" and click "OK".</div>
<div><br />
Check if at all there is an exclamation mark along the driver, it suggests issues with the driver installed.</div>
<div><br />
d. Repeat the step 2 to uninstall all items under "Universal Serial Bus controllers".</div>
<div><br />
Then, restart your computer and Windows 7 will reinstall all USB controllers automatically.</div>
<div><br />
If you still face the same issue then you may check for the updated USB device drivers using windows update. Refer to the below link for assistance–<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a></div>
<div><br />
If the issue sill persists I would request you to check for chipset driver updates which you can get at the manufacturer website. The chipset drivers normally incorporate USB controller drivers as well.</div>
<div>The following articles explains the error code number, since this article is published under Windows XP however the device manager error codes remain same for Windows 7.<br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725873(v=ws.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725873(v=ws.10).aspx</a></div>
<div><br />
Hope the information helps.</div>
<div><br />
Do get back to us and let me know the status of the issue or if you need further information regarding Windows.</div>

    <title>w10 - file&#58;&#92;boot&#92;BCD error 0xc0000098--worked for weeks, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iamlincolng  say:</h3>
<h2>            w10 -  file&#58;&#92;boot&#92;BCD error 0xc0000098--worked for weeks, then froze.  Reset worked, but it continually froze after login, afterward.  Repairs, resets, failed.  Now, blue screen</h2>
                    So, I held off hoping kinks of W10 would get worked out. Updated, and it worked fine for weeks. &nbsp;Suddenly it froze up.<br />
<br />
Restart = repair = stuck at 0%&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Reset = worked first time, started reloading programs, it froze.<br />
<br />
10 minutes or so after I logged into w10 it would freeze - no matter what.<br />
<br />
Tried resetting and it would stop at 95%, so it would revert back to the first reset status, and try to repair itself on restart (which would get stuck at 0%)<br />
<br />
Finally, after numerous attempts at reset, instead of loading an operating system, I get a blue screen and the following error:<br />
&nbsp;file:\boot\BCD error 0xc0000098<br />
<br />
I can't even seem to access my boot menu when I restart the system.<br />
<br />
I downloaded the media creation tool, ran it onto a flashdrive, and it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Sometimes you get what you pay for.... seem w10 came free and turned my pc into the "paper-weight of lost user data".<br />
<br />
And just TRY to get help from windows.<br />
<br />
Thus...my forum rant, because google doesn't want to help..... &nbsp;anyone?

<p>If you've forgotten your Windows password, there are several ways to retrieve or reset it:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your PC is on a domain, your system administrator must reset your password.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you're using a Microsoft account, you can reset your password online. For more info, go to the

</li><li>
<p>If you're using a local account, use your password hint as a reminder.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If you've tried these suggestions and still can't sign in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span>, you'll need to reinstall Windows. </p>
</li><li>
<p>If you have <span>Windows&nbsp;RT&nbsp;8.1</span>, you'll need to contact your PC manufacturer.

<p><span><span>Hi TacoMonster, </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for that information. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Based on the screenshot you have given, it shows that you are using the classic version of Skype. With that being said, option to change the theme is not possible.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Changing theme is applicable for OS version 6 and 7 and with the Skype version 8.5.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you have you further questions, kindly let us know. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you! </span></span></p>

    <title>Real Name Permanently Banned &#91;Enforcement Team&#93; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Real Name Permanently Banned &#91;Enforcement Team&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, my real name has been permanently suspended after my nephew was on my account and messing around. This is the first time that my name has been suspended. I would never try to offend anyone within the gaming community, just like I wouldn't want anyone offending me. I do understand that it&nbsp;was my account my nephew did this on. However, I don't believe my real name should have been <strong>permanently</strong> suspended over something that was not my doing. I've even submitted a case review explaining this to the enforcement team. However, they decided to uphold the decision, which I just see as unfair. It's like they didn't even take my view into consideration.</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Hey there,&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Probably what has happened is the Xbox Enforcement team have restricted the Original Posters ability to create a new name, where it can be displayed alongside the Gamertag. Some people may feel like it is a suspension, however it isn't as such. Juat a restriction in a service.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Directed to Original Poster ~ Unfortunately though, even know it wasnt you, it does state "Your Account, your responsibility". Thus meaning, if you do let people use your account on your Xbox. Watch them and make sure yoh know what they are doing. Alternatively, get them to sign into their own account or use Guest.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>If the Enforcement team have choosen to uphold their decision, then there is nothing much you can do about that.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Regards,</p>

<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center 
<br />
<br />Go to Virus &amp; threat protection - Virus &amp; threat protection settings 
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Controlled folder access 
<br />
<br />Temporarily turn off Controlled Folder Access and check to see if you can install and use ClipGrab 
<br />
<br />If so, from there, you can add ClipGrab to the list of safe or allowed apps to prevent them from being blocked 
<br />
<br />Please do not leave Controlled Folder Access turned off permanently

<h2>            Adobe reader error - Faulty module&#58;  Comctl32.dll</h2>
                    Running Windows 7 Home Premium, SP 1.<br />
Computer is ACER Aspire -4830TG laptop, with 8GB RAM, i5-2430M intel processor.<br />
<br />
Not sure when this happened, but am unable to open Adobe Reader 10.&nbsp; Error indicates the fault module to be Comctl32.dll, specifically,
<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\WinSxS\x86_microsoft.windows.common-controls_6595b64144ccf1df_6.0.7601.17514_none_41e6975e2bd6f2b2\Comctl32.dll<br />
<br />
Size is 619KB<br />
<br />
Reader will initialize, but blank out and freeze as soon as it attempts to do anything, including displaying a menu bar.&nbsp; I have reinstalled Reader several times and have removed it first.&nbsp; It appears that the issue is really the Comctl32.dll file.&nbsp; There are
 so many versions on my system can't figure out how to tell if it is corrupt.&nbsp; <br />
Virus scan shows no risks.<br />
Unable to rollback far enough to make a difference.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have a problem like this?<br />

            Hi Peter,
<br />
<br />The drive you are installing Windows onto will automatically be formatted, the only thing to watch out for when installing Windows 10 is, if you have a secondary hard drive in your PC, don't have that connected while installing Windows onto the primary drive, otherwise, the boot configuration can end up on the wrong drive, it is little documented, but does happen . . .

<h2>            Skype To Go</h2>
                    have been visiting the east coast for the past couple of months&nbsp; and was expecting to use skype to go to contact friends and family in western canada..... so far it has been a disaster.... either calls won't go thru or the audio starts out fine and becomes
 so broken that its impossible to have a conversation... I have read more online help files than I ever thought I would and cleaned caches, reinstalled software following the instructions of the help files , have tried several different wifi connections nothing
 seems to help, etc .... but haven't been able to find a solution.... either for my tablet or laptop.... have used skype for years and never had this issue.... the time I have spent trying to find a solution has been ridiculous... to be honest I am seriously
 considering leaving skype and finding another solution.... have tried to contact support but all I seem to get is recursive links...&nbsp; to no where ... basically chasing my tail .... where to go from here is the quest

    <title>Update KB3194798 causing sporadic freezing on Windows 10 Anniversary - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasonhurst  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update KB3194798 causing sporadic freezing on Windows 10 Anniversary Edition</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently updated my PC and it now continues to freeze at somewhat irregular intervals. Even at the sign in screen, I find I must wait around 10 seconds before I can enter my password. Upon login, I find further freezing whenever I attempt to perform various
 tasks such as open apps or browse through files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I run the PC reset option and have the update uninstalled, my PC operates without issue. Upon updating again and resetting to allow the update to take effect, the freezing begins once more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should point out that I do have my OS saved to an SSD (C:) and have had data and applications saved to an internal mechanical drive (E:). I have read that this can cause trouble, especially so since I recently attempted to install Gears of War 4 to drive
 (E:). After being unable to do so (the Microsoft Store refused to install the App to (E:) even after changing the App install locating through the settings menu) I resulted to clearing room on my SDD and installing Gears there. This was not without difficulty
 as I learned that my PC had Blue-screened during downloading and installing Gears of War 4. Sadly I was not present for this but I returned to see the PC on a black screen, asking for a boot disk to be inserted. Resetting the PC resolved this issue, Gears
 of War 4 was installed and playable, but the periodic freezing begun. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Which leads to my current predicament. I have reset my PC multiple times and I only experience these issues when the update is installed. What can I do to prevent or fix the freezing or must I simply prevent the update from occurring till a fix is released?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For reference I do not know what the blue-screen report stated. Furthermore I do not believe the App Gears of War 4 was the source of my disruptions as before last Monday I had no issues playing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any advice or tips. If you require clarification on anything let me know.<br />
</p>
<p>

            <p>I have the same issue. Since KB 3194798, I have locked up 3 times today and need to force reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frustrating part is, I had no issues with freezing in anniversary update before 3194798, while I heard lots of other machines&nbsp;did.</p>

            Exact same problem here. It also seems to be happening more frequently now. It has happened 8 times in the last 24 hours, and a total of 12 times since I got the update 3 days ago.

<p>
</p><p>Reinstalled the update, still utterly broken. Avoid until Microsoft fixes it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update even installed with the Defer Option enabled.</p>
<p>

            <p>Alright another possible fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Double checked to ensure .NET was installed via Regedit. It was and on the latest version</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installed Visual C++ packages 2005, 2008, 2012, 2013 and 2015</p>
<p>
</p><p>Formatted mechanical drive and deleted the partition on it, leaving it uninitialised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon doing these things and reinstalling the update, it seems to be working without any freezing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Performed a System File Check which returned no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should state however that I have not attempted to open the Windows Store App or reinstall Gears of War 4.&nbsp;<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>This will be my final update. I have spent far too long attempting to fix these issues Microsoft have presented.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, the freezing on my device has subsided somewhat and I say somewhat as if I attempt to open the Store or Edge, the freezing restarts though no where near as bad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still cannot download Gears of War 4 after the update and the Store in fact refuses to show me the Gears of War 4 Page where you may select the manage option. All work arounds to install Gears of War 4 have been met with the same error, 0x80240024. Resetting
 the store does not fix this, deleting the files were gears would be stored does not fix this, changing location in settings does not fix this, selecting WindowsStores Apps only from the settings menu does not fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems the only progress to make some progress was to install the latest update when no other drives aside from (C:) are initialised.</p>

<h2>            Movie Maker 10 Saving Video Problem</h2>
                    Movie Maker 10. The only saving option, since it's the free version, is to download the 720p version. After waiting for the download, the video can't be played. Properties say it's got 0 bytes. When I try to play it, the pop-up says "This file isn’t playable.
 That might be because the file type is unsupported, the file extension is incorrect, or the file is corrupt". I can't save the project either because it's the free version. How do I save the video?

    <title>USB Adapter failing &#40;Windows 10&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> medievalman  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Adapter failing &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had a peculiar problem the last few months since upgrading to WIndows 10. The internet will occasionally drop out, especially during large downloads and uploads. I am on a desktop and using a WNA3100 Netgear adapter. I have tried to solve this for
 months and can't come up with a solution - drivers, sfc scan, etc. What's even more peculiar is that when this happens, sometimes (and only sometimes), the entire USB port the adapter was in will not recognize anything plugged into it until I do a reboot.
 So, I'm not sure if the root cause is the USB port, the adapter itself, or some kind of software issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue has been plaguing me for months, thanks to anyone who can help.</p>

            <p>Hello Medieval,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regret the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find the root cause of the issue, test the NETGEAR adapter with some other PC. This will confirm where exactly the problem lies. Also suggest you to try uninstalling the existing Network adapter software and then re-install the software to see if it helps.
 I found that the is a latest Firmware/Software update for <a href="http://support.netgear.com/product/WNA3100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
WNA3100&nbsp;N300 Wireless USB Adapter </a>that support on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem still appears, then try install Firmware/Software in compatibility mode.
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow these steps to install the software in compatibility mode and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Download the </span>Firmware/Software update for your device

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b. Uninstall the existing&nbsp;one from your PC through Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c. Right-click on the setup file and click on <strong>

I have tested the adapter on another PC and have confirmed that the adapter itself works normally.<br />
<br />
I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the software, and tried to use compatibility mode with various versions of drivers. My problem persists. Please let me know if you have any other ideas.

            Make sure you have the WNA3100 plugged into a USB 2.0 port and not a 3.0. I had a similar problem. Worked fine when plugged into 3.0 in Windows 7 but would intermittently drop out in Windows 10. Moved it to a 2.0 port and it works fine.

            To answer your first part, the machine I tested the adapter on was is running Windows 8.1 and is update to date (as is the one I'm having trouble with).<br />
<br />
I am running version 1511 (OS Build 10586.36) (this is the PC that is having trouble).<br />
<br />
I created another user and have confirmed that the problem persists on that account as well.

            Hey, just a quick update. I did a more thorough test and it turns out I'm having the same issue on another PC. Thus, it must be a problem with the adapter itself. Is there anything I can do to fix it, or do I just need to buy a new one?

<h2>            Surface pen Scrolling instead of drawing</h2>
                    When drawing in photoshop my pen scrolls the page instead.<br />
I have tried some of the fixes online such as uninstalling the last update and typing<br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Pen /v LegacyPenInteractionModel /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f 3<br />
into cmd prompt but this hasn't worked.<br />
<br />
Anyone having this issue too? any fixes as of yet?</span><br />

            Sorry for the inconvenience but many users reporting issues with their Photoshop.
<br />Seeing as the registry fix did not work for you I would suggest uninstalling KB4089848 and hiding it.

    <title>Vista hangs waiting for &#63;network connection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adamgillett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista hangs waiting for &#63;network connection</h2>
                    
<p>I hope you guys can help. I have a newish install of Vista on a 2.4GHz quad with 4GB RAM. I connect through a SMC broadband router. Other computers connect through this fine. A few months ago I noticed intermitently when Vista booted it seemed to be waiting
 for the network (meaning the network symbol bottom right remained with a cross). This can take 3-4mins to clear and then works fine. Sometimes it works straight off.</p>
<p>It doesn't affect the rest of the computer, other programs open fine except IE8 and Outlook 2003. Skype seems OK.</p>
<p>I've tried restarting having turned off all services and startup programs through MSCONFIG. The problem remains.</p>
<p>I use AVG Free and windows firewall. I've removed AVG and the problem remains.</p>
<p>I can start in Safe mode with networking and all is fine.</p>
<p>I don't have a lot of knowledge at resolving problems at this level. I can usually root out rogue programs but this seems at a different level.</p>
<p>Task manager doesn't seem to be indicating high CPU use, but there seems to be something that IE8 etc are waiting for.</p>
<p>All windows updates have been applied and AVG runs daily.<br />
<br />
I have repaired WINSOCK.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Did you use the AVG removal tool to eliminate it - AVG 8.x and 9.x have been causing strange<br />
issues.<br />
<br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible solution? And
<br />
I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers. How far are you positioned from the router?<br />
Are there obstructions in the way? (A little added extra required activity when the router is getting<br />
a marginal signal can cause what you are seeing.)<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver and clearing the network logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click on it - driver's tab -
<br />
write down version - click Update Driver (may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers).
<br />
Then Right Click on Wifi Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />

<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even newer versions.
<br />
(The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated drivers as Vista
<br />
loves updated drivers.<br />
<br />
I would also disable auto-updates for drivers. If Windows Updates suggests one just HIDE it as
<br />
they are almost alway old and you can look for drivers manually as needed.<br />

<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Make sure you know the login details for your wireless router - SSID and Password.<br />
<br />
You will lose connection when doing this and have to redo your logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network &amp; Sharing Center - on Right Side click Customize - Set Network Locations
<br />
page - on lower left click Merge or delete networks&nbsp;locations&nbsp;- DELETE ALL instances of your network&nbsp;<br />
(and any&nbsp;others you no longer use) - REBOOT.&nbsp;Start - Connect To to logon on to Network.<br />

            I have tried all of the first post suggestion. My drivers seem up to date. <br />
<br />
(Previously when I've wasted days figuring out "odd" problems it turned out to be my firewall, firstly Zone Alarm and then unknowingly my router firewall conflicting with Windows firewall. Now I only use Windows firewall, and the router firewall is off.)<br />
<br />
Diskcleanup didn't turn up anything. <br />
<br />
I haven't tried the Broadcast fix, as I assume this relates to wireless and not LAN.<br />
<br />
I've installed process explorer but must admit I don't understand what it is telling me. Can I export something to this posting?<br />
<br />
What would be really useful is some tool which will run from startup and give a list of processes that seem to be "waiting" for a reponse or are indicating an error.<br />
<br />
This may seem a long shot, but I was considering updating to Windows7. Do you think that would solve it!!<br />

            Did you uninstall ZoneAlarm using the maker's removal method? It will leave trouble causing<br />
remnants if left on the machine. Did you check manually for NIC drivers as indicated above<br />
at both System maker and Device maker's sites? No other method will correctly find them in<br />
many cases.<br />
<br />
You might try updating your router firmware and reseting it. The hardware firewall built into<br />
if should not conflict with the Windows Firewall unless you specify some unusual settings but<br />
you should check with the SMC Support as this could be a known issue.<br />

            Sorry, Zonealarm was on the machine before I did a clean install of Vista sometime ago.

Yes I manually Checked NVIDIA site for NIC drivers. However I'm a bit confused by their choices. I have NVIDIA nForce 10/100/1000 Mbps Ethernet Card. If I use NVIDIA scan it offers only
<strong>HDMI Audio Driver 1.00.0.59 </strong>for<strong> </strong>nForce 650i SLI.
<br />
<br />
Motherboard Chipset:&nbsp;nVidia nForce 650i/750i SLI + MCP51<br />
<br />
Motherboard Model:&nbsp;MSI MS-7346<br />
<br />
<br />
Router firmware is up to date and integral router firewall is off. <br />
