    <title>How do I schedule a recurring event to be 1 week before another - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I schedule a recurring event to be 1 week before another recurring event in outlook 2003&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
I would like to set reminders for myself for the full year, simply using the recurring reminders. &nbsp;I have already set myself a reminder for deadlines that I will have the first day of every month. &nbsp;This deadline requires me to have compiled some contributions
 from other people, and I would like to set this deadline for one week before my first of the month deadline. &nbsp;So there's two ways I can see to accomplish this, and I'd appreciate any advice people have on how to do this.</p>
<p>
First, would be an option to recur 1 week before another event is scheduled. &nbsp;Is there a way to do this?</p>
<p>
The other option would be that 1 week before the end of the month I have an event scheduled (well, technically 1 week before the first business day of the upcoming month).</p>
<p>
We may be upgrading our Outlook to a newer version in the near(ish) future as well, so if there's a way to do this in another version of outlook I'd appreciate knowing that as well (even if I can't do it in 2003).</p>
<p>
Another note: I do know that I can set the reminder to start 1 week before the event, and that this might be able to evolve into a workaround, but I'd really like them to be separate events.</p>
<p>
Thanks for your help!</p>

            <p>Sanwin is right - and due to the variability of months it's not going to be perfect. Some months the 1st reminder will occur 8 days before, some months 6 and so forth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*I* would do it by creating a recurring task for the 1st of the month with a reminder 1 week ahead - but that's just me. :)</p>

            If you are still interested in an answer to this problem,
<div>&nbsp;a. With more complicated numbering tasks, it can be easier to use VBA to create the number values you want and place them in sequence-numbered Document Variables. You then use a SEQ field nested inside a DOCVARIABLE field to insert the actual value.</div>
<div>So for example if you have variables like this</div>
<div>Name<span> </span>Value</div>
<div>S5_1<span> </span>a</div>
<div>S5_2<span> </span>b</div>
<div>S5_3<span> </span>c</div>
<div>S5_4<span> </span>d</div>
<div>S5_5<span> </span>e</div>
<div>S5_6<span> </span>ab</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then you can do the numbering using</div>
<div><br />
<div>{ DOCVARIABLE "S5_{ SEQ S5 }" }</div>
<div><br />
<div>b. However, for that to work, you need to set up all the document variables you need (i.e. there either need to be a finite number that is small enough for Word to cope with, or you need to impose a limit). Word can store thousands of Document variables
 (hundreds of thousands at least), and SEQ can count to quite large numbers, but Variables do occupy space and there may be practical difficulties after a certain point.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;c. Obviously, you need to be able to construct the correct sequence using VBA. However, like Doug, I am not sure what comes next in the sequence (although I think I can guess), and so on.</div>

    <title>personal folders access - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kennethduncan  say:</h3>
<h2>            personal folders access</h2>
                    <p>Being in the real estate business, I receive many e-mails that I want to retain in personal folders. Unfortunately, the new Outlook installed in Office 365 requires that when I move an e-mail from Inbox or Sent file to a personal folder, I almost always
 (depends on how much time lapses between these actions) have to click on Archives, then Personal folders, then Inbox before my list of folders will appear. In some cases, the folder I'm looking for is a sub folder, so I have another two clicks. The tech staff
 says there are no defaults that would allow the list of folders to remain displayed, so you suffer thru the repetitious search for the personal folder you want. in my case a half dozen times a day or more.&nbsp;Why can't there be default settings to allow personal
 folders to&nbsp;remain&nbsp;displayed when you want to move an &nbsp;item there? &nbsp;In addition, sometimes the Inbox will show several items, but when I &nbsp;click on Inbox to access them , a message appears that the items were&nbsp; not found. For my part, old Outlook was better.
 My list of personal files would remain displayed and the last file I visited would pop up highlighted &nbsp;the next time I searched for a file, making it much easier and faster. For my part, Microsoft balled up Outlook. I'm sorry I signed up for Office 365 due
 these problems, as well as long sessions on the phone with Tech Support to fix various problems (including duplicate&nbsp;e-mails). Ken</p>

<p>Hello E4Sanz,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to our forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the message header, the SCL value is -1 which means this email doesn't be marked as spam. For better understand it, may I know this issue occurs on Outlook desktop client side or
 OWA side? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, can you confirm if this user set any inbox rule to cause this issue? And if the sender is internal or external user?</p>

<h2>            OFFICE 365 questions</h2>
                    I have 3 W10 PCs, a kindle fire, and a smart phone. I currently use Office 2010 and onedrive, which is fine except 3 versions of Outlook is becoming too much to bear. I would like to be able to access docs and mail and contacts from a single source (cloud).
 Contacts is the biggest issue- different on each computer. There is only one user account, but multiple devices. Which license do I need? Does Office 365 need to be installed ion multiple machines? How are contacts transferred from Outlook 2010 machines to
 the cloud? Thanks for help!

Thanks for the advice. I'm trying to understand how Off365 works. Is there software to install on each device to access files? Are documents stored locally as well as in the cloud? So, one user has to put sw on each input device: so multiple licenses are needed?

<br />Does Office 365 need to be installed ion multiple machines? How are contacts transferred from Outlook 2010 machines to the cloud? 
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />The ability to access contact data on multiple devices depends on the &lt;email account&gt; and not the &lt;email client&gt; or to say this another way, doesn't matter if the question is related to OL'2010 or Outlook '365.
<br />
<br />More specifically, if the contacts in '2010 (or any Outlook version) are associated with a POP3 or IMAP account, that data doesn't sync with any server. To make contact/calendar data accessible to multiple devices requires an Outlook.com/Exchange account.
<br />
<br />Assuming that this currently involves a POP or IMAP account, a quick solution would be to create a free Outlook.com account (if you already don't have one) and add it to Outlook '2010 (where your contacts are currently located). Once that's done, copy the contact data to the contact folder in the Outlook.com account folder tree in Outlook '2010. When that's done, just add the Outlook.com account to your other computers/devices.
<br />
<br />*** the only unknown in my response is related to your Kindle Fire since am not familiar with the email configuration process on that device. If it configures the Outlook.com as an Exchange ActiveSync account then the contact/calendar data will be accessible.

            Hi Jayne Hood,<br />
<br />
OneDrive is a two-ways syncing tool, that means that a synced folder is stored both online and on your PC. Synced files go in both online side and local side.<br />
Besides, to better understand the issue, can you provide more details with us?<br />
1.How you work on the file and provide the screenshot about the issue if it is convenient.<br />
2.The version of the OneDrive.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Vinson<br />

<p>
</p><p>do you guys have SharePoint?</p>
<p>
</p><p>the best thing you can do is design your access database and your tables and stuf, and then you can sync that file to SharePoint. Then anyone that has access to SharePoint can login to the site and enter the data on the SharePoint page and it will write
 that to the access database&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will provide instructions later today when I get to a computer&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Jayne Hood,<br />
<br />
Sorry for ignoring something important. The access file is special for OneDrive, because it can’t be opened directly via browser. When you try to open the file online, it will be downloaded as the copy of the original. The copy one is not associated with OneDrive.
 And if you edit the access file in local synced, something you do will be associated with OneDrive online page.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Vinson<br />

<p>
</p><p>So, there it turned out to be printing support that was the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice that I was using WindowsUpdate.log for some clues.&nbsp; It looks like 14267 has regressed whatever fix 14257 had in it for that.&nbsp; E.g. now WindowsUpdate.log is just junk.</p>

    <title>close button &#40;red x&#41; only closes one file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bttrflii h  say:</h3>
<h2>            close button &#40;red x&#41; only closes one file</h2>
                    
<p>i used to be able to close the entire excel application by clicking excel's close button (red x), but now only one file closes.&nbsp; i can get that behavior already by clicking the file's close button; i need that red x to close the whole doggon thing.&nbsp; i searched
 online to see if anyone else is running into this frustration and saw that i would have to choose between having my files as individual tasks on the task bar (which for me is a must) or being able to close the whole application by the red x (also a must).&nbsp;
 i should not have to choose between these two things.&nbsp; what setting do i need to change or what can i do to be able to have both the red x close excel completely and still have individual workbooks show up on the task bar?</p>
<p>thanks!&nbsp; :)</p>

<p>The default setting for a newly installed version of Excel is to show all workbook windows in the taskbar. The red X then only works for the active workbook, which is in its own main window (well, not really, but it works that way for this purpose).</p>
<p>If you change so that all windows are not shown in the taskbar, but only the main Excel application window, then the red X works for the main Excel window.</p>

<p>You can get around this problem by using a keyboard shortcut to close Excel - Alt+F4.</p>
<p>A second option is to open the Office Button and Right-Click the Exit Excel command and choose Add to Quick Access Toolbar.&nbsp; That way you will have an Exit command one click away.</p>

<p>I never noticed that Alt-F4 works properly despite the Windows in Taskbar setting. (Personally I prefer not to clutter up my taskbar with document windows, because I usually have an excess of application windows open. Windows 7 does a better job of managing
 the taskbar than previous versions.)</p>

<div>It does that in Excel, but it doesn't in Word. I think the reason is that </div>
<div>Excel is an MDI application (that can mimic SDI) and Word is an SDI </div>

<p>hi jon, thanks for replying.&nbsp; i've tried both ways for excel now and neither of them fits.&nbsp; i want individual task bar items for each window and i want that x to close everything, both of which it used to do by default.</p>
<p>are there any other settings that will fix this?&nbsp; it's getting very frustrating and i can't get used to either of the new bs ways of doing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@shane - hi shane!&nbsp; i'm a very mouse-oriented person and would definitely prefer not to have to use alt+f4 to close excel.&nbsp; is there any way to make the close button (iow the red x) close excel?&nbsp; i'll admit my habit is the red x (just as it is for almost
 every other program in existence), not some other button somewhere else.</p>

            <p>I had a similar problem, seemed to stem from getting a 'save personal' message, which i didn't want to do, but excel wouldn't let me do anything else.</p>
<p>BTW, I'm working in 2010, if you have an older version, this may not work.</p>
<p>Started about a week ago, when I click on the X, the workbook closes, but the Excel program (without a workbook) remains open, I must click again to close the program.</p>
<p>Here's what I did:&nbsp; click on the start button, scroll to Microsoft Excel, when the Recent window opens, see if there's a file called PERSONAL or PERSONAL (Autosaved). I had both.</p>
<p>Hover the cursor over the PERSONAL file, that will give you the file path.</p>
<p>Follow that until you find the actual file(s). Delete them. </p>
<p>I have just done this, so don't yet know if my 'puter will implode...&nbsp; :-{&nbsp;&nbsp;, but at least now i can close an excel book on 1 click (of the white&nbsp;X in the red field...I don't have a red X).</p>

            <p>More proof that Microsoft engineers don't know how to use their own goddamned software!&nbsp;&nbsp; (I wonder what software they use around the office?!)&nbsp; It's worse than described above:&nbsp; if you carefully set up an Excel file to have two or more windows, with specific
 magnifications, certain tabs open, certain rows locket at the top, etc., etc., and you learned (from 2003 ) not to EVER touch the "X" box for the individual window, now if you hit the red "X" box, which every piece of software for the past 20 years has taught
 us will close the program, you lose the open window and all of the settings you've constructed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have more than one web page open, I always get a dialogue box that asks me if I want to close the whole session or just that tab (also NOT an improvement over the old way, IMHO).&nbsp; Why don't we get a similar warning in Excel?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is it that every few years I am required to pony up for new versions of software that I already had working just fine, with no perceivable improvements and a lot of annoying changes?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; Yet another edition of Excel has been released without a feet-inches number format.&nbsp; I have a calculator that solved this problem in 1985.&nbsp; Why is it too difficult for Microsoft to address?</p>

<p>Are you telling us that you have to call a person *BEFORE* you are allowed to add them as a contact?&nbsp;&nbsp;That's nuts!! Then what about doing a conference call with someone who isn't a contact yet? I will often have a staff member on skype then I need to use
 skypeout to call a client phone number. How do you do that now?</p>

<p>
</p><p>The new Skype is 100% non-intuitive, in specific not allowing customers to save non Skype contacts.</p>

            I agree and I have been a paying customer since 2005 also. Skype keeps removing features, dumbing it down for some reason. I have a bunch of contacts that I want to add but I can't figure out how without calling each and everyone of them first. This is
 just plain stupid.

            This doesn't work because there is not option made available to "Save to local address book."&nbsp; I have been very frustrated by these changes to Skype - also a paying customer for over ten years who has helped many other customers start using Skype when
 it was user friendly.&nbsp; Please get this fixed ASAP.

<p>As a paying customer since 2013, I concur with the other comments that the desktop Skype GUI is terrible.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The MS standard for the rest of the Office suite is that there are generally multiple intuitive ways for a user to accomplish a goal whereas with Skype there seems to be NO intuitive way for a user to enter in a new contact.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if I use the phone number of a past call, I find it difficult to modify the contact parameters.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The model for the Skype desktop contacts interface should be the interface on a modern smartphone, and given the integration of the MS Office suite it should definitely be possible to drag-and drop an Outlook contact into Skype.</p>

    <title>Problems with Refresh &#47; Deleting Tracks and Album Art from Music - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems with Refresh &#47; Deleting Tracks and Album Art from Music Library</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Intermediate
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br />
<br /><b>Details</b><br />
<p>There are times when refreshing the Music Player library either won't complete (eg: after you've dropped the phone popping out the battery in the middle of a refresh .. or is that just me?) or deleted tracks and album art won't disappear from the Music library
 after a refresh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These problems are often down to corruption of the library and&nbsp; the only thing to do is to delete the library files and start over.&nbsp; Even a hard reset of the phone won't fix this as the files are stored on the card / mass memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To delete the library files:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Ensure you can see hidden files in Windows Explorer:<br />
<br />
Windows Explorer .. Tools .. Folder Options .. View<br />
<br />
Select "Show hidden files and folders"<br />
<br />
- Connect the phone to your PC using the USB cable in "Data transfer" mode<br />
<br />
- Find and rename (or delete if you're really brave) files with names like: </p>
<p><br />
E:\private\101FFC31\mpxv1.mpd<br />
E:\private\101FFC31\pcv5.mpd <br />
E:\private\101ffca9\harvesterdb.dat</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(assuming the phone's mass memory / card has been connected as E:)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that the folder names may be different and the files may have prefixes - eg: mpxv1.mpd could be called abcmpxv1.mpd.&nbsp; Basically, you need to search under the Private folder for any files that look similar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you rename files - eg: by adding a ".o" to the end of the name - instead of deleting them, you can always just change the name back if you find you need those files back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Refresh the Music Player library</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will take longer than normal as it's a complete refresh, but it should now work.

    <title>Outlook Web site is not loading after changing idiom settings - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook Web site is not loading after changing idiom settings</h2>
                    <p>I was changing idiom configuration in my outlook account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First I was having a message about a folder conflict "Organizaciones" Spanish for Schedules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I was having the Schedule folder but I was not able to delete o rename.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, I changed the idiom to french. Which kind of solved the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But no so fast, I was returning to English and then pun!&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was an error about a "Companies" Folder conflict.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I thought it was an issue with the idiom again. So I changed to Spanish, the problem persists. I changed again to Italian, still same issue.</p>
<p>Finally, I changed to another language and Shazam!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not enter my outlook mail account, there is always an error message.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Care to explain yourself a bit more?<br />
What is this file supposed to contain?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the extension really is the name of your company, then it is quite likely that it is a file for a custom application of your company. In that case, contact your corporate administrator for further instructions on how to open it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the extension is actually a pst-file or an ost-file, then it is an Outlook file. Have you installed that already?</p>
<p>Pst-files can be opened via: File-&gt; Open-&gt; Open Outlook Data File</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is an ost-file, then it is merely an offline cache file for your account (Exchange or Hotmail/Outlook.com) on the server. In that case, there is no need to restore it as a new cache file will be created automatically once you've reconfigured your account
 in Outlook.</p>

            <p>In xxx.yyy@xyz, the xxx.yyy is my email address before the @ sign, and xyz is the name of my company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It does not have any extension, but I think it is an ost file, because this got created after we moved to Office 365. It cannot be only a cache file as it has steadily grown to 3.5 GB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried opening it in Outlook, but it is giving an error saying that "the file cannot be opened, please contact software provider."</p>

<p>I will contact the email administrator.</p>

<p><br />
Then it is the cache file for your mailbox and apparently your have a reasonably large mailbox ;-)<br />
</p>
<p>When you are in File Explorer in Windows 8, then you can select the View tab and enable the option to show extensions. You can then verify that it is indeed an ost-file.</p>

    <title>Windows phone v7.8 - can&#39;t restore to 7.5 - Nokia Lumia 800 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robgee1964  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows phone v7.8 - can&#39;t restore to 7.5 - Nokia Lumia 800</h2>
                    I recently updated to WP7.8 via Zune. I have to say I didn't actually expect it to do this, the actual update I *thought* I'd selected was one prior to 7.8.<br />
<br />
Anyway, cutting to the chase, I'm very disappointed with it<br />
1) Home screen kinda looks ugly, the small icons are pretty useless really as any text disappears (meaning for example, you can't distinguish between different mailboxes), should you shrink their icons<br />
2) Its noticely slower. One of the things I liked about the Windows phone was its fluid UI. Now it feels slower, more sluggish.<br />
3) Battery life is significantly worse. Its barely managing 12 hours with light use - before I was easily getting 24 hours.<br />
<br />
No problem, I simply go to Zune and select Phone-&gt;Update-&gt;Restore<br />
<br />
A restore point does appear at the date of the update. But upon clicking restore, but then the process fails with error code 801812E0 "Restoration Error". I've tried a couple of times now, having restarted the phone manually.<br />
<br />
It looks suspicously like WP7.8 can't be rolled back to 7.5. I hope I am wrong in that supposition, otherwise my nice, slick, quick responding Windows Phone has just been spoiled. Worse still, I can't run with 12 hours battery life. All settings are the same
 as they were previously.<br />
<br />
So, if there is a way to do this then please let me know. I realise there is an application called "Nokia Care Suite", which I'm reluctant to use as it undoubtedly carries a fair risk of just bricking the phone. Once again I am reminded why I *always* turn
 off automatic updates on my PC .....<br />
<br />
If it can't be done, then sadly I'll be selling this phone on ebay. <br />

<h2>            Windows 10 update fail</h2>
                    <p>I tried to update to the new Windows 10 and have been caught in a loop with no visible desktop. When I press control/alt/delete there is nothing running on the processors. We could eventually poke around to find that the documents and files are intact but
 there is no desktop. The only error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Location not available</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS\system32\config\systemprofile\Desktop is unavailable........may have been moved or deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not tech savvy so don't understand some of the other comments on other forum questions that seem to be similar. Also other forum questions seem to be old and not relevant to today. My computer has never had anything but Windows 10 (no other versions)</p>

    <title>MS Access 2013 switches to Chinese &#40;Mandarin&#41; when I don&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> euro888  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Access 2013 switches to Chinese &#40;Mandarin&#41; when I don&#39;t ask it to.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running MS Access 2013 on a Win 8.1 laptop. My database does contain some Chinese characters in some of the fields, but I do not want to switch to the Chinese keyboard option (which I do have installed as an alternative language) unless I specifically
 request it (by selecting that language from the list of languages I have enabled on my machine.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But MS Access seems to have a mind of its own. Without warning it switches to "M" (Chinese language) as soon as I click on any field of any table in the database, regardless if that field contains Chinese characters or not. It's very annoying when the "predictive
 text" box opens. (This predictive text box is how Chinese characters are "summoned up" on a Chinese keyboard.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make it worse, the language never switches back to English, even when I exit out of MS Access... I must manually switch back to English every time. If I'm still in MS Access (after switching back to English) and click in any field, the language immediately
 switches to Mandarin again... Very irritating! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked my language setting on my laptop and have made English both the main language and the "override language"... But Access still insists on switching keyboards uncalled for. I also tried telling MS Office NOT to detect the language "near where
 I'm typing"... but it does it anyway. Ahhhhhhh!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can tell, Access 2013 is the only program doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my questions are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Has anyone else run into this problem?</p>
<p>2. If so, have you found a solution to it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many thanks</p>

            <p><strong>Hi Bill...</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Ya, the Access 2013 menus are a little different... but I think I found the item you mentioned. The "New database sort order" is set to "General - Legacy" (see screen shot below):</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/937f29df-64c3-4fc3-80f0-5f3a08191dcd" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Also from the next screenshot, you can see I have "English" selected for the default language in Access 2013:</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a5fd187-55ee-4d58-86ca-88f978bf4eec" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>I'm thinking Bill, however, that the root cause might be at the Window's system level, rather than just at the Access 2013 level. That's because when the mysterious "language jump" happens, the jump happens outside of Access or Office as well. (That
 is, my general keyboard jumps to Chinese for other running applications as well.)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Looking at this possibility, I took a look at the languages at the system level I have installed. I noticed that other than English, I've also installed the language pack for Chinese Mandarin. Although I have German and Russian keyboards installed
 as well, I have only Mandarin (other than English) "available for a Window's display language". See next screenshot for what I mean:</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e765c445-6288-4051-9e56-7552dceeb9a3" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>It seems to be a little too much of a coincidence that only Chinese is causing a problem. The other two foreign languages (German and Russian" which are not yet "Available" as a display language are not causing any "unwanted language shifting" problems.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So I think my course of action will be to uninstall the Chinese language pack, thus putting it back into the status of "Available for download", rather than "Available.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>All I really need is to be able to occasionally write in Chinese. I don't think I need the entire language pack installed. As verification of this theory, I can still type just fine using a German or Russian keyboard without their respective language
 packs installed... So if I can still type with the Chinese keyboard with the language pack uninstalled, I think that will be good enough... And may eliminate this "mysterious language jumping" happening in Access 2013.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If the uninstall of the Chinese language pack solves the problem, I'll update this thread with that information. Wish me luck!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Thanks for your reply, by the way, Bill. Yours was the only one I received.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Stay tuned for my update after I uninstall the Chinese language pack.</strong></p>

</p><p>Unfortunately the unwanted language switching is still there. The behaviour is unchanged.</p>

            <p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, "it's happening" only within MS Access 2013, with the effects trickling over to "outside of Access" after the event takes place. That is, it's only in Access that the event is triggered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your point is well taken, however. I might as well post it in a Windows forum to get other eyes on it. Perhaps I'm being overly pessimistic, but I get a feeling they will reply, "Since it's happening in Access, post it there." Ha! ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If ever a cause/solution is found, I'll update this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Thanks for your post. We use all the default settings but Chinese could not show up properly in our Access 2013 Table. We installed both Simplified and BIG5 Chinese language pack still no luck.
</p>
<p>Although Chinese input with free Google Chinese input. Table could not show Simplified Chinese.</p>
<p>Your screen dumps are very good hints for me. Thanks!</p>

    <title>Access 2013 bug with User Level Security - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dan shipley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2013 bug with User Level Security</h2>
                    <p>I used Access 2013 to edit an older .MDB database that is used by a few people. &nbsp;It is a small database with a few linked tables and one form having a couple subforms. &nbsp;Nothing fancy. &nbsp;The users asked me to lock down the database so only "Admins" could edit
 it, and I was investigating my options. &nbsp;I created a copy of the database, and opened the User Level Security Wizard (only available when editing an older .MDB database). &nbsp;I ran through the wizard steps, which completed successfully. &nbsp;However, once the wizard
 was finished (which seemed to take longer than I expected, perhaps more than a minute on a fast machine), there seemed to be two issues:</p>
<p>1) I could not log in to the database using any credentials (username/password combos) that I had defined in the wizard.</p>
<p>2) The User Level Security now seemed to be applied to my Access 2013 installation itself, rather than to the database. &nbsp;If I try to open another database, or create a new database, I am still prompted to Log In. &nbsp;No matter what credentials I try to use,
 I cannot log in, receiving the dialog stating, "<strong>Not a valid account name or&nbsp;password.</strong>". &nbsp;So, I click "Cancel" and am presented with an error: "<strong>A problem occurred while Microsoft Access was communicating with the OLE server or ActiveX
 control.</strong>" &nbsp;Additional error message text includes, "Close the OLE server and restart it outside of Access. &nbsp;Then try the original operation again in Microsoft Access." &nbsp;After clicking "OK" on the error, I am left in a locked-down state within Access,
 and cannot create or really do anything in Access except quit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is: <strong>How can I remove the User Level Security issues that are now plaguing my installation of Access?</strong> &nbsp;I would prefer not to have to uninstall/reinstall if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, <strong>Is this a bug?</strong> &nbsp;It sure seems like it is, and should be reported. &nbsp;I would like to know if others can recreate this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dan</p>

            One of the steps is to create a new workgroup file and use it for the ULS. What you did is a very common problem. So common, in fact, that it shows up all over the Internet in articles and posts including my site (<a href="http://www.thatlldoit.com/Pages/howtosarticles.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thatlldoit.com/Pages/howtosarticles.aspx</a>&nbsp;"User

            <p>To me, this sounds like you accidentally applied the uls to the system (system.mdw) rather than your specific database, thus it impacts all the db run on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To remove uls, see: <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-ca/access-help/remove-user-level-security-mdb-HP005188240.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Using VBA to allow a checkbox to hide&#47;show content in Microsoft Word</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">I've gone through a number of tutorials and instructional videos trying to achieve my intended result of simply allowing a checkbox in my form to hide content when selected, or re-show it when being de-selected,
 but nothing seems to be working.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">Currently, I've created a bookmark for the content I want hidden, and try to call his this in VBA with the following statement - which a number of resources indicated as the solution:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
</p><pre><p><code><span style="color: rgba(16, 16, 148, 1)">Private</span><span style="color: rgba(48, 51, 54, 1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(16, 16, 148, 1)">Sub</span><span style="color: rgba(48, 51, 54, 1)"> CheckBox1_Click</span><span style="color: rgba(48, 51, 54, 1)">()</span><span style="color: rgba(48, 51, 54, 1)">

<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">I'm not entirely sure if I've even linked it to the checkbox properly, because all of the working resources i find suggest right clicking the check-box and selecting view code, but such an option doesn't exist.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">The following example is the exact test case I've setup, where I simply want the checkbox (when checked) to hide the text following it, and when un-checked, show the text again</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
</p><pre><p><span style="color: rgba(16, 16, 148, 1)">(x) checkbox</span></p><p /><p><span style="color: rgba(16, 16, 148, 1)">This text should dissapear</span></p></pre>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">But despite doing this, selecting the checkbox has no affect on the content.</p>

<p>In that case, it is a lot simpler to use ActiveX Radio Buttons as when you assign the two buttons to the one Group in the Properties dialog, they act mutually exclusively without having to emulate that behaviour with code and all that you need in the ThisDocument
 object is</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Private Sub optNotApproved_Click()<br />
If optNotApproved.Value = True Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Bookmarks("Bookmark").Range.Font.Hidden = True<br />

Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Bookmarks("Bookmark").Range.Font.Hidden = True<br />
End If<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>For the above, I had assigned the names optApproved and optNotApproved to the radio buttons and I had assigned the GroupName Approval to them both</p>

<p>There are three types of checkboxes</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b55a3871-2e72-4421-8e05-7be41e4bbad8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b55a3871-2e72-4421-8e05-7be41e4bbad8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>The upper one is a Content Control check box; the one under the Legacy Forms label is a FormField checkbox for which the document must be protected for filling in forms; and that under ActiveX Controls is an ActiveX checkbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To create the code for the ActiveX checkbox, in Design mode, you can right click on it and then select View Code, which will open the Visual Basic Editor with</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub CheckBox1_Click()<br />
</p>
<p>End Sub&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>in the ThisDocument object, and inside the Private Sub\End Sub, you would need to insert the code as shown below</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub CheckBox1_Click()<br />
<span>ActiveDocument.Bookmarks("Bookmark").Range.Font.Hidden = </span>CheckBox1.Value<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>which is a shorthand form of:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Private Sub CheckBox1_Click()</span><br />
<span>If CheckBox1.Value = True Then</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Bookmarks("Bookmark").Range.Font.Hidden = True</span><br />
<span>Else</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Bookmarks("Bookmark").Range.Font.Hidden = False</span><br />
<span>End If</span><br />
<span>End Sub</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using a Legacy Forms, FormField Checkbox, you would need to set a macro containing the following code to be run on exit from the checkbox, which by default would have a bookmark name of Check1&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub Hide()</p>
<p>WIth ActiveDocument</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If .FormFields("Check1").Checkbox.Value = True then</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>.Bookmarks("Bookmark").Range.Font.Hidden = True</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>.Bookmarks("Bookmark").Range.Font.Hidden = False</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
End With</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>End Sub</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As mentioned, with that type of checkbox, the document must be protected for filling forms, which imposes a number of restrictions on the features of Word that the user will be able to use.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If using a Content Control checkbox, you would need to assign a title to it in the Properties dialog</span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/432081bc-1d10-49e2-8879-c4113ec01232?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/432081bc-1d10-49e2-8879-c4113ec01232?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>and then in the ThisDocument object of the Visual Basic Editor, you would need to insert the following code</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub Document_ContentControlOnExit(ByVal ContentControl As ContentControl, Cancel As Boolean)<br />
If ContentControl.Title = "Check1" And ContentControl.Checked = True Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Bookmarks("Bookmark").Range.Font.Hidden = True<br />
Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Bookmarks("Bookmark").Range.Font.Hidden = False<br />
End If<br />
End Sub</p>
<p><span><span>Neither the ActiveX nor the Content Control Checkbox require that the document be protected, but in both cases, you must exit from the Design mode, and in all cases, for the text to not be visible, the display of hidden text must be turned off.</span></span></p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We don’t want to give everyone in the company a DDI but rather have extension numbers so what I would like to do is have 1 main office number and all my users will have extension numbers off that. So all my users out going calls will
 be presented as my main office number, for incoming calls and external person will need to dial the main office number and then once answered they can dial the extension number.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this possible? </p>

<p>Then display that signature in a web browser. Highlight the signature and copy-n-paste it into the Signature box in Outlook.com.</p>

<h2>            emails that can&#39;t be deleted from Outlook Mac 2011 inbox</h2>
                    i have the same problem with some emails that I cannot delete from my inbox (Outlook 2011, MacBook Pro, Lion). They have been deleted from the Gmail web server.&nbsp; When I try to delete,I get an on-screen message (sometimes) saying "Message number is outside
 of range" or some such. <br />
More (but not all) emails are arriving that&nbsp; cannot be deleted. I have tried all but the last step of running the script, which sounds daunting.&nbsp; Does this "out of range" message mean anything (useful)?

<h3> lindsey mcmillen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Frequent notifications of scheduled restarts for installation of phantom update</h2>
                    <p>Starting with Build 9926 I have been receiving frequent notifications informing me that a restart is scheduled for 12:00 midnight to complete the installation of an unspecified update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The list of installed updates is no longer being displayed in Windows Update area of the Settings -&gt; Windows Update and Recovery area so I can't see what update is pending.&nbsp; I've restarted, and shutdown/started my system many times since the display of this
 notification started, but the notification continues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The notification continues to appear as greyed out in the list of notifications, despite my having cleared that list repeatedly.&nbsp; The full notification can not be opened and read.&nbsp; Only the first few words, "Don't forget, a restart is scheduled at", can
 be viewed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I stop this notification from being displayed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I determine what update might be involved?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I restore or create the display of the list of installed updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any and all helpful responses.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for your suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to resolve the issue on my own before posting my question by deleting both of the referenced&nbsp;updates.&nbsp; Doing so had no affect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I tried entering the command you suggested, but that did no resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As there were no additional responses to my question, I resolved the issue by wiping and reformatting my system's primary drive, and performing a fresh install of Windows 10 Build 9926.&nbsp; I've spent most of my computer time since then&nbsp;working on another computer,
 running&nbsp;Windows 7, while waiting for the next build of Windows 10, hoping that the problem won't occur with the next build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, for me, and unless the problem crops up with the next build, there is no need to pursue this matter any further.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTHING HAS BEEN FIXED!!!&nbsp; Outlook.com is still unbelievabley, painfully, slow - making it virtually unusable. There were over 100 complaints on that thread,&nbsp;and this person Ryniel P thinks that if you just make a baseless claim and close a thread&nbsp;so that
 people cannot continue to comment that people will&nbsp;just walk away and accept this, or they won't raise a stink about this anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or that if you limit the complaints on one thread, the&nbsp;issue might not look as severe as it&nbsp;really is.&nbsp; What, did you just take
 this out of a PR handbook?&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope there is a senior supervisor of this forum, because I would like to escalate this case and this person to them for such incompetance!&nbsp; The thread should be re-opened so that people can continue to complain, and maybe when there are&nbsp;enough complaints,
 someone&nbsp;from Microsoft might actually open their eyes and recognize that there is a real problem with Outlook.com, and someone&nbsp;needs to look at it.&nbsp;

Count me in-This seems to be the standard "resolution" when there are too many complaints-about all issues with Outlook, Win 8, and IE 10 crashing repeatedly and often. If they close the threads, guess MS thinks all the problems will go away. I still have not
 received ANY&nbsp; resolution/answer to my problems-which, by the way, are the same as the thousands of others who have posted on these forums. I am totally disgusted and furious at those who put this defective product on the market. Mac-here I come with my checkbook.</p>

            <p>Hi Abdu_78 and palmetto60,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We apologize for the frustration that this has caused you. Let me assist you with the latency that you are experiencing with Outlook.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Microsoft accounts have been upgraded to Outlook.com as well and we are not encountering any latency issue using the new interface on our end. Since your post is a continuation from a previous thread, have you tried the possible resolution provided on
 that thread like optimizing your browser or trying to use a diffferent browser or computer so we can check if it is a browser issue that you are experiencing? If you have also tried other things to fix the issue, we would like to hear it so we can further
 isolate the issue that you are encountering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Johan</p>

            This has nothing to do with anyone's browser or anything that us as users are doing or not....it is purely down to the new Outlook. It is extremely slow and often can't connect to Outlook. It freezes which then slows up the whole computer. It is quite
 difficult to navigate around, although I can get used to that...however the speed (lack of) and freezing may force me to go elsewhere if issues can not be resolved.&nbsp;

            I totally agree since the change to wonderful NEW Outlook I can now enjoy a coffee between asking for an action and it being completed. As usual Microsoft has taken a leap backwards and ignored what many USERS!! have said in the past..if it aint broke
 dont fix it! Yes re-open the thread and dont expect users to be sheep. This is not a good customer approach as my OUTLOOK is bleak!!!!

Better sign up with gmail-MS hasn't even tried to fix these problems; this defective&nbsp;product-Win8,the new Outlook, and IE10-&nbsp;has been out for more than&nbsp;6 months now and the only suggestions have been to "optimize your browser and/or reset the IE ". Neither
 works, btw. When any thread gets so many complaints, they merely close it.

            I agree. &nbsp;Was very surprised to see that the thread had been closed without an answer.

<div>Well, it's 10th April 2013 &amp; Outlook Hotmail is still really slow.</div>
<div>You click on "Inbox" &amp; sometimes have to wait 30secs or more for it to open &amp; just have 5 little dots running across under the banner to keep me occupied. &nbsp;My fan also comes on which usually means that my poor pc is struggling to get something. &nbsp; Sometimes,
 if I've replied to a mail, it has frozen for nearly a minute ~ just stopped altogether ~ apart from the dots of course.</div>
<div>On two or three occasions, after waiting for over a minute, it couldn't even connect.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sometimes, though, it's just fine. </div>
<div><br />
<div>I've got a nice new laptop, Windows 8 &amp; everything else works ok.</div>
<div>It's nothing to do with my browser or anything I am, or am not, doing.</div>
<div>The old Hotmail, although dated in appearance, was immediate. &nbsp; &nbsp;This one is driving me nuts.</div>

My new Outlook is ridiculously slow and often freezes! A billion times worse than before! I would love to hear when it is going to be fixed..<br />

            We're all having the same issue with so called "latency" on different computers, in different areas, with different browsers yet microsoft still just say to update your browser and clear your cache etc! People have been making these complaints since hotmail
 first started the changeover and if you can't find a solution microsoft, it's looking like you'll be losing a lot of your customers!&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Personally, I will be closing my accounts with you very soon if this is not resolved as I'm sick of wasting my time waiting ages after every single mouse click before it actually loads through!<br />

            Well, today, I was halfway through a reply to an email &amp; it just froze. &nbsp;Nothing wrong with my internet, I could open another tab &amp; access other sites. &nbsp;Was just Outlook that froze.
<div><br />
<div>Nothing happened til I got a response saying that Outlook was "unresponsive" &amp; did I want to "kill the pages". &nbsp; &nbsp;I did. &nbsp; &nbsp;But then it took over FOUR minutes to log on again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just saying.</div>
