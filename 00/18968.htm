<h3> allisonpc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Show only labels in the first column, and data in the rest of the columns&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I need to build a&nbsp;4 column report, with the data labels shown in the first column, and the records shown in the next&nbsp;3 columns.&nbsp; Right now the page is set up to have 4 columns, and it is&nbsp;set up with code in the&nbsp;"Event" property in the detail section that
 makes the labels visible only in the first column, and then the labels are invisible in the other 3 columns.&nbsp; Is it possible to have the columns set up so that the labels don't even exist "invisibly" in it?&nbsp; I would like to shrink the columns to as small as
 possible, and I can't do that even when the labels are "invisible".&nbsp; Also, my code isn't allowing the labels in the first column to be seen.&nbsp; Here is my code:</p>
<p>Private Sub Detail_Format(Cancel As Integer, FormatCount As Integer)<br />
If Me.Left &lt; (0.5 * 1440) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Me![Time Label].Visible = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me![Date Label].Visible = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Me![Name Label].Visible = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me![Time].Visible = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Me![Date].Visible = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Me![Name].Visible = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.NextRecord = False<br />
Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me![Time Label].Visible = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Me![Date Label].Visible = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Me![Name Label].Visible = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Me![Time].Visible = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Me![Date].Visible = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Me![Name].Visible = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me![Iron].Visible = True<br />
End If</p>
<p>End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>I can see the data just fine in the last 3 columns, but the labels don't show up in the first column like they should, and also I can't shrink the columns due to the space that the "invisible" labels are taking up.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            My usual approach to this sort of thing would be to put the bound controls in a multi-column subreport and the labels in the parent report immediately to the left of the subreport.&nbsp; Then you don't need any code to hide or show the controls.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Are you saying that the subreport returns 6 records in total, i.e. there is just one set of 6 columns of data?&nbsp; If so that differs from my demo, which returns 12 records, i.e. 3 sets of 4 columns of data with the labels on the left repeating 3 times.&nbsp;
 With only one set of 6 records in 6 columns then it makes it very much easier to do as the parent report does not need to be bound to anything.&nbsp; From your description it sounds like both the parent report and subreport are bound to a table or query which returns
 the 6 records, so the parent report is printing 6 details, with a separate identical instance of the subreport in each.<br />
<br />
If this is the situation then leave the parent report's RecordSource property blank.&nbsp; Put the labels in the left side of the detail section and the subreport to their right.&nbsp; You should then find that it prints the subreport only once.&nbsp; This does mean of course
 that it will only handle up to 6 records as, if there are more records than the number of columns in the subreport, it will continue below with additional columns, but without any labels to the left.&nbsp; My demo caters for any number of records by repeating the
 labels as many times as are necessary if the number of records exceeds the number of columns, 4 in my case, and restricting each set of 4 to different records by means of the computed GroupCounter column, which provides the link to the parent report to do
 this..<br />

<p>Rather than invite them via their Outlook/Gmail accounts. I think your first plan would be the best practice in this scenario, it will enhance your management on the intern users.

<p>And that doesn't offend the using license because they will only have limited access to the SharePoint Online service.

    <title>My Microsoft Edge Rant - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donamerex  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Microsoft Edge Rant</h2>
                    <p>Hello and welcome,</p>
<p>This is a my rant on the new Microsoft Edge browser. First off, killing Internet Explorer&nbsp;was a big mistake. It has been around for 20 years (1995) so it's familiar to everyone. Second off, half of the world uses IE so we are all going to soon be unprotected
 when Microsoft decides end support for IE (And they will as they end support for everything) So all of the IE users will be left unprotected or have to move to a non MS&nbsp;browser (Since Edge is only compatible with Windows 10) Another brilliant move Microsoft.
 If they wanted to fully replace IE with Edge they should have made it compatible with all platforms, not just 10. Edge's UI is horrid. And by horrid I mean bland, ugly and confusing. In IE we had three simple controls. A house icon (Home) a star (Favorites)
 and a gear (Settings) Edge's controls are dots, stacks, lines&nbsp;and other **** you have to decode them&nbsp;before you start using it. And it is all thrown together with a boring grey and white color scheme. I don't care if it's fast, if its ugly I'm not using it.
 I understand not everyone is going to agree with me, but we&nbsp;all have our own opinions, so no one&nbsp;needs to get rude.&nbsp;So there is my rant, I'm not using Edge and I know a lot of other people who aren't also.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>As you said: <em>'opinion of opinions'...</em></p>
<p>Yes, Microsoft Edge is the default browser experience on Windows 10, but it's not true that MS has killed IE already, and I'm sure you know you can still use it on Win10.</p>
<p>IE is still there but hidden in Windows Accesories. You can <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/pin-internet-explorer-start-taskbar#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
pin it up</a> to the Start screen or Taskbar if you like.</p>

            <p>Don, I think you've stated opinions that a <strong>LOT</strong> of folks will agree with, including me.&nbsp; It's as if the
<strong>artists have taken over MS</strong>, and the arty types want everything to be 100% artsy-fartsy and 0% helpy-selfy.&nbsp; Unfortunately, form does NOT follow function when it comes to Edge and MS's webpages (another major PITA topic for discussion).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that MS wants everything all neat and clean and artsy and calm and serene.&nbsp; Seriously, how OCD is that?&nbsp; These programs aren't the least bit user friendly.&nbsp; Trying to use them is incredibly frustrating because nothing is obvious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't even get a drop-down menu to show up in Edge.&nbsp; How am I supposed to do anything without a menu?&nbsp; How do I even do something as simple as Print in Edge?&nbsp; I don't see any little printer icon anywhere, and there isn't a drop-down menu, so what do I
 have to do... snip screen images, paste them in Word, and then print <em>that</em>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too wonder how to uninstall Windows 10.&nbsp; We were told we'd have a month to try Win 10, and then we could go back to our old Windows if we didn't like Win 10.&nbsp; How can anyone uninstall Win 10 without being able to access Control Panel for the&nbsp;<em>Programs
 and Features </em>button?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned in another thread I started, I've been pro-MS since proverbial Day One.&nbsp; My friends and co-workers were engage me in arguments when they bashed MS and its programs.&nbsp; But my pro-MS stance is seriously waning after the utter frustration of the
 a poorly-thought-out Win 10 Upgrade system (it took me several days to get it to work); Win 10 itself (I lost all my files in Pictures until I finally found them by dumb luck); and the IE 11 &amp; Win 10 incompatibility (IE 11 has gone from fast in Win 7 to beyond-slow
 in Win 10).&nbsp; Oh, and don't forget Edge, one of the worst MS programs I've ever seen with respect to a complete&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;user-friendliness and ease-of-use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I admit that I've let my tech/PC skills wane after finding that MS Windows and Office required little effort with which to&nbsp;become proficient.&nbsp; I don't have any electrical engineering or IT education (my background is mechanical engineering).&nbsp; I haven't written
 any programs since DOS was replaced by Windows 30-some years ago.&nbsp; So, maybe my frustration is my fault because my tech skills are so outdated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I have to wonder "what about."&nbsp; That is, <strong>what about people with nearly zero tech skills?</strong>&nbsp; How does MS expect such people (who may be the majority for all I know) to work with these Win 10 and IE 11 issues, and so many other issues?&nbsp;
 Sure, some of those people have in-house techies (i.e., teenagers and 20-somethings).&nbsp; But I know a lot of people who just might&nbsp;stop using their PC's because of these new programs being so problematic.&nbsp; Does MS even consider such people when it does development?&nbsp;
 It seems like the answer to that is a resounding NO!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to add such a long rant to this thread.&nbsp; I'll gladly delete it if it's too negative, or has stolen the basic premise of the thread.&nbsp; Thank you to anyone out there who took the time to read this post.&nbsp; And thank you in advance for anyone in power
 at MS who has read this thread, and who wants to send the thread link to senior directors at MS.&nbsp; Finally, thank you in advance for any senior director at MS who decides to
<strong>end the MS Period Of Artsiness </strong>once and for all, and help <strong>
initiate a new era of MS User-Friendliness And Sanity</strong>.</p>

            <p>liamone... thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually started trying stuff in Edge after using it for several days after the utter frustration with IE-11 freezing up in Win-10.&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that small little mini-menu off of the Triple-Dot icon.&nbsp; There ya go, three dots,&nbsp;now
<em>that</em> is intuitive.&nbsp; It's sort of like snake eyes, plus one.&nbsp; Or it's the number of uh, male, uh,
<em>somethings</em> on Dr. Evil.&nbsp; A whole lot of other menu-bar items are missing, but at least I can now print, maybe.&nbsp; But the window does look all neat and clean and uncluttered and, most important of all, very artsy-fartsy.&nbsp; Who cares if users over 50 get
 totally frustrated with using their PC's, the most important things is that the windows look neat and clean and uncluttered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if Adobe Reader just integrated with Edge, that'd be nice.&nbsp; The normal mini-menu seen at the bottom-middle of on-line PDF's is missing, and so I just stare at the screen wondering how to perform simple tasks with PDF's.&nbsp; I did find how to save those
 PDF's&nbsp;(right click, but it's the only command available there).&nbsp; Pushing some buttons and rolling the mouse wheel sometimes changes the zoom size.&nbsp; Why they'd delete that little menu is beyond me.&nbsp; Oh, right, to keep it all neat and clean and uncluttered and
 artsy-fartsy!&nbsp; Why else would anyone make things less intuitive and <em>even more
</em>difficult?&nbsp; [heavy sign]</p>

            <p>I am posting this from a throwaway test account I am using to test Edge and Cortana. The problem with Edge is not cosmetics, it is functionality. I have no problem with the change in icons. Why they need to reposition&nbsp;the entry point only to move it back
 to the 'normal'&nbsp;location after an entry is mystery. However, the real problem&nbsp;is its lack of&nbsp;functionality. There are a significant number of sites that&nbsp;won't load in edge (any site that&nbsp;expects&nbsp;Silverlight)&nbsp;as one example.&nbsp;There is a rather large number of
 functional issues with Edge. I went through MS's site for suggested improvements (Windows.UserVoice.com) in Edge (Windows., and in the first 3 of 43 pages of suggestions I found 10&nbsp;very useful items&nbsp;(and at least one critical) that&nbsp;were available in IE, but
 missing in Edge. I did not even get the item that drove me to that page. You will find my&nbsp;comments there signed by real name (Duncan Fletcher). Just a&nbsp;few of them here: Can't print selected text; can't direct downloads to specific folder (and name); can't
 translate a web page. And one that I have not experienced it the ability to kill the automatic reload of webpages that are killed with force close of the program with Control-Alt-Del. There are websites that will put you in an infinite loop and not let you
 leave&nbsp; the website and apparently Edge cooperates by reloading the websites if the are killed. The we get into what appears to be more of Win 10 issues. I like to set up my computer with separate system partition; user partition, data partition and temporary
 files (including temp internet files). With the exception of some program files that widows (since the IE is a integral part of windows and can't be separated baloney), I have been able to keep that structure. Now I&nbsp;favorites is in the Users can not be moved:
 an attempt to use a junction to point to another folder causes Edge to fail to load. (I could probably junction the IE favorites to the one for Edge - that would at least keep them in sync, but they would still be in the wrong partition. That is a result of
 MS hard coding the expected location without going through the standard I/O routines. I also notice a lot of new temp files and IE cache files in my user partition.</p>

<p>Sorry about my confusion. I reside accross the pond in the Green Isle.&nbsp; The reference's were to my own age group (just after WW2) .The only thing available to compute with were ones own brain,fingers eyesight and hearing&nbsp;. unfortunatley my personal first
 is in a state of decline.&nbsp;I thought you were writing us off ,after my gaff you may be correct.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find that to use windows !0 with required financial security I am left with no choice but to use IE 11 as administrator which I dislike. Creating a tile or taskbar short cut does not allow this. Hence when I require it I have to carry out the following
 ritual</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Start button&nbsp; &gt; (meaning next move) All APPS &gt; Windows Acessories &gt; right click &gt; Run as Administrator.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I just like the ease of personalised shourt cuts and desktop which aid&nbsp;ease of use for old Duffers (Dudes).
</p>
<p>May be it suits a tablet better?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am useing A dell inspiron 6400 Laptop (With modified SDD drive and Ram) which would nor recognise a charger in Windows 7 "even its own Dell original". Was quoated for a jack repair so decided to install windows 10. Walla recognised charger ever since.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;PS 1.30am GMT&nbsp; 28/8/2015</p>
<p>&nbsp;just after installing updates tonight IE then appeared in my most used list which gave me the option to run as admin. ithen created a &nbsp;tile which enabled the same privilage.&nbsp; Someone out there must have a good ear. Would be yourself begora?</p>

            <p>Hi Brian - </p>
<p>Thanks so much for your "rant".&nbsp; I am not a senior director...just a senior (65 yo), and, wonder no more, not anywhere near "tech savvy".&nbsp; I'm glad to know I'm not the only one who thinks this new improved version is a pain in the patooty.</p>
<p>I live in the boonies, and have been forced to use Hughes Net, which was bad enough.&nbsp; With all the promises, I was anxious to upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp; (No wonder it was free of charge.)&nbsp; Now, I'm saving up for a hair transplant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My HP came with 8.1, but I'm hearing that 7 was the best.&nbsp; I'm wondering if I should (or even can) replace 10 with 7.</p>
<p>I've grown weary of web pages that won't load and videos that don't play, and using up valuable "life time" looking for basic tools that were once at my fingertips, just as you said.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phew...I'm worn out!&nbsp; I guess you could say that I've worked up a pant in response to your rant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Kate,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve the issue with your Microsoft Phone Lumia 950, we suggest checking article about

<h2>            When creating an XML Map it only maps horizontally, can I create it vertically</h2>
                    &nbsp;When creating an XML Map (mapping the entire xml document), it only maps horizontally. I tried to enter a vertical range but that does not change where the map is put in to the spreadsheet. Is this possible? Or do I have to manually drag each element?

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>Not really sure if this really requires a redirect. I would imagine someone on these forums has some info on this. I could not find anything definitive about a vertical map. These links I will post are more informational and most likely stuff you already
 know. Consider this&nbsp;a free bump and maybe someone will pick up on your question:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd819387(v=office.12).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd819387(v=office.12).aspx</a></p>
<p>The following is about 2003 ver., but may contain some info:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa203737(v=office.11).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa203737(v=office.11).aspx</a></p>
<p>And I really could not find anything that specified horizontal vs. vertical mapping. So maybe it is a manual process as you mention.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway...hopefully someone will pop in and offer some suggestions. If you post in Technet (link in first reply), please post back if you get an answer here as well.</p>

<p>PowerPoint has improved a lot in the 20 years since Office 97 and there are few hard limits anymore. Microsoft doesn't publish any. The real limit is set by the amount of memory and storage your computer has.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I have to point out that a 1000 slide presentation at 10 seconds per slide would take over 3 hours to play. I'm not aware of too many pieces of music that long (or audiences that would sit for that duration), so I'm not sure what problem you're facing.</p>

            I have been taking pictures at major auto races for many years. Well over 200,000 photos. I made a Powerpoint Slideshow for myself&nbsp; of some of my favorite photos. Right now it has about 1200 and probably stop at around 1500 photos.&nbsp; I run the slides at
 5 seconds each.&nbsp; I made a wav music file of about 10 songs and play the file that loops over the length of the presentation. The music stops after slide # 999, which is the limit set in the dropdown menue for the audio in Powerpoint 97. What I was trying to
 find out is what Powerpoint version eliminated the 999 slide limit for the sound. I would upgrade to a newer version of Powerpoint but want to make sure it is backward compatible to the slide file that I created.

<p>Thanks for the more detailed explanation. The 999 slide limit for playing across slides is in all versions of PowerPoint including the current version. You can work around this by inserting another copy of the music track on slide 1000 to play for the next
 999 slides.</p>

            Assuming you have the sound as a wav file try adding it as a Transition sound. I have never tried with 999 slides but it might work.

            Not sure how that's a reply to the point about Transition Sounds. To the best of my knowledge there's no 999 slide limit there. (But I haven't tested!)

This is a blindingly obvious scam.<br />
<br />
+20 is the international dialling code for Egypt, not the UK (+44). Why would Nokia UK be texting you from an Egyptian number?<br />
<br />
Secondly, does anyone with half a brain really think that Nokia UK is going to use a Yahoo! address for official business?<br />
<br />
C'mon people. Wise up. This is a classic Nigerian 419 (advance fee fraud) of the kind that's been in circulation for literally decades, originally by snail-mail but now by e-mail and text message and any other means these slimy criminals can use. You've won
 a prize but you have to stump up cash in advance for legal fees etc. Yeah, right...<br />

            I agree totaly it is very obvious to us, but there must be plenty of idiots out there who do fall for them otherwise they would get fed up and move on to another scam, it's like the scratch cards you get in the weekend papers, I must be the luckiest man
 on earth as I always win, but guess what, it will cost you £1.50 + a min to find out what you have won and take 10 mins to tell you that you have won a timeshare deal!<br />
Again people must still ring.

How does the expression go? <i>"There's a sucker born every minute"</i>, or words to that effect.<br />

If one really won a lottery or any sorts, one will not be inform to untraceble address such as email, p.o. box, unregistered mobile phone number etc. One will get it by telegram with legal address, where one can verify.

            The tip off is the email address. Like the bloke ask, why would Nokia use Yahoo for a business address? Too bad, I'd love to get hold of 84 big ones.

Hi<br />
<br />
This should help:<br />
Why are my PowerPoint files so big? What can I do about it?<br />

Probably the first thing to do is make sure you have Fast Saves turned off. Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Save.<br />

<h2>            Can I upgrade my HTC 7 Mozart to windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    I heared a news on April 17, 2012 that microsoft evangelist confirms all windows phone 7 handsets will be upgraded to windows 8. The question that arises here is whether you intend to put this upgrade in zune or not.

            <p>All Windows Phone 7 devices supports the 7.8 update. Not all carriers&nbsp;have&nbsp;ok'ed it though.&nbsp;The hardware does not support Windows Phone 8 though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the answer to your question is: No, you will not be able to upgrade your Mozart&nbsp;to WP8.</p>

    <title>Query to Append Data to a Separate Table in Another Database Works - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reidfeatherstone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Query to Append Data to a Separate Table in Another Database Works With One Set of Data, Not With Another</h2>
                    <p>I have a query that takes one existing table in my database, collapses the data to make it more manageable and then populates it in another table in a separate database. I've run it with one set of data and it&nbsp;worked fine, populating the rows into the separate&nbsp;table
 in the other database, but when I ran it with another set of data it populated 0 rows. The data columns and structure of the data fields in those columns are identical between the two sets of data, yet one works and one doesn't. The only major difference between
 the data seems to be that one set of data is from calender year 2011 and another set of data is from calender year 2012.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any clue what this could be? Thanks!</p>

            Do you have any unique indexes (including the primary key) in the target table which could be causing the second set of rows to be rejected due to an index violation?

            <p>Hi Ken,</p>
<p>So basically I have two separate types of&nbsp;databases that I use. One type of database begins as a template that contains almost all of the tables, queries, reports and forms that I use in my work, which I save as a new version each time&nbsp;I import&nbsp;a new set
 of data. Therefore, for the two sets of data I have (one from 2011, one from 2012) I have two separate, almost identical&nbsp;databases, each with all of the same tables and queries. The only difference between the two&nbsp;is the data itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then have a second database that begins blank. When I run a specific query in one of the databases mentioned above, the query pulls all of the data from one of the tables in that database (usually over 1 million records), collapses it into more manageable
 records and then populates a table in the second (blank) database. The only thing that is ever in this database is the table once it's been populated. I then use the table in other parts of my work to make the work more manageable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I run the queries from the initial databases&nbsp;for the 2011 data&nbsp;and 2012 data everything seems to work fine initially. I uploaded the data into&nbsp;the separate databases&nbsp;in identical fashion, and&nbsp;the way the data appears, both as a raw record and in the
 table once it is&nbsp;uploaded, is identical between the two years. The SQL code and display view of the query in each year's database is identical.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, once I run the query for 2011 it populates the table in the otherwise blank database fine with the records I need. When I run the query for 2012 it populates the table in&nbsp;the&nbsp;second type of database&nbsp;(after erasing the 2011 information from the table
 first) with 0 rows (there should be around 20,000). I have a feeling it's something to do with the data since it seems to be the only real variable I can come up with. Still, I'm wondering if maybe you have another idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I checked the table that the query creates for both 2011 (with 25,000 rows) and 2012 (with 0) and the headers in the tables (the path destination I guess you could call it) seems to be identical, which makes sense because the make up of each query
 is identical. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any further help/advice you could give would be much appreciated. Thanks!</p>
        </p>

            I can't offer any explanation, I'm afraid.&nbsp; if all the rows are being deleted from the target table before inserting the new ones there should be no question of any index violation.&nbsp; You don't say exactly how you are undertaking the insertion of the rows.&nbsp;
 The simplest way to my mind would be to create a link in the source database to the table in the target database.&nbsp; You can then execute a DELETE query to empty the target table of the 2011 rows, followed by an INSERT INTO (append) query to insert the 2012
 rows. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you execute the queries via the interface you'll get the usual confirmation messages, including one with the reason for any failures; if you do it in code by calling the Execute method of the database object, provided you include the dbFailOnError option,
 you'll get an error message if it can't insert any rows.&nbsp; Either way the message should give some clue as to why it's not inserting the second set of rows.<br />
<br />
It might help if you posted the SQL of the queries you are using.<br />

<h3> muckey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook mail is timing out, while I&#39;m writing letters</h2>
                    <p>While I am typing a letter, maybe taking 5 minutes or so, I'll get the timed-out message and have to restart outlook mail.</p>
<p>What can I do to either get it to stop or increase the time that it lets me type?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did you first encounter this issue?</li></ul>
<p>It started with the new update of Outlook.com/Hotmail.com.&nbsp; So it has been at least a couple of months.&nbsp; I did not follow all of their directions on signing up for new things, just continued to my regular mail.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you having issues with Outlook.com or Windows 10 Outlook mail app?</li></ul>
<p>I'm using an iMac, OS X El Capitan, Version 10.11.6&nbsp; Firefox Version 51.01 with Outlook.com</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Can we have the exact timed-out error message that you are getting?</li></ul>
<p>I did not copy the message to be able to paste, But it said, approximately, Your session has timed out.&nbsp; Please sign out of Outlook and restart to continue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Which Outlook version are you using?</li></ul>
<p>Outlook.com/Hotmail.com version</p>
<p>
</p><p>The program quit on me, after I had submitted by question to you, in almost exactly 25 minutes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>When I'm writing letters and editing them, adding pictures, etc, it can take longer than 25 min to complete.&nbsp; I used to lose pictures, once a message was put in the Draft folder, but so far that has not happened, when I've been kicked off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything that can be done to quit getting this message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another subject, the program hates my Firefox ad blocker and takes a while to boot then gives me the message,"It looks like you are using an ad blocker...Sign up for Ad-free Outlook"&nbsp; Of course, that is not a free service..</p>
<p>It was never a problem loading until this latest version of Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>I see no difference between justified and distributed.</p>
<p>If I use 'distribute all lines' to format a paragraph or all the text within a text box,&nbsp;the last line of each paragraph&nbsp;is spread across the width of the&nbsp;text box with equal spacing between the characters. This happens even if it is a single word. It also
 happens with any line of text that does not automatically wrap to the next line. If I do a soft return and leave a single word within a paragraph, it is distributed across the text box. I do have to select all the text (ctrl+A) in the text box or it will apply
 to only the line where my cursor is resting.</p>
<p>Why in the world would you want to use the 'distribute all lines' anyway? It looks bizzare.</p>

 to 'distribute all lines'. I see no difference in the lines of text&nbsp;that wrap, but the last line distributes across the text box with spaces between all the characters.</p>

            <p>"Distributed" alignment, available via Publisher's "Paragraph" dialog box, worked in previous versions. In fact, if you set the text to "Distributed" in Publisher 2010, save the file, then open that file with Publisher 2007,&nbsp;the text&nbsp;is correctly aligned
 - with space added both within and between words.&nbsp; I could find no mention of this bug in notes of service pack one. Microsoft need to put out a fix ASAP, as this bug significantly undermines the attractiveness of a newsletter using narrow columns (say, 3
 columns for the width of a portrait&nbsp;A5 page).&nbsp; For people currently using Publisher 2007, or previous, for newsletter-like publications, I suggest you DON'T upgrade to 2010 until this is resolved.</p>

<p>"Distributed" alignment, available via Publisher's "Paragraph" dialog box, worked in previous versions. In fact, if you set the text to "Distributed" in Publisher 2010, save the file, then open that file with Publisher 2007,&nbsp;the text&nbsp;is correctly aligned
 - with space added both within and between words.&nbsp; I could find no mention of this bug in notes of service pack one. Microsoft need to put out a fix ASAP, as this bug significantly undermines the attractiveness of a newsletter using narrow columns (say, 3
 columns for the width of a portrait&nbsp;A5 page).&nbsp; For people currently using Publisher 2007, or previous, for newsletter-like publications, I suggest you DON'T upgrade to 2010 until this is resolved.</p>

I see no difference in how Pub 2007 and 2010 works, but&nbsp;I do see a number of other reasons to not change to Pub 2010.

            I isolated this to a Fonts issue. Some fonts will allow Distributed paragraph formatting as intended, while other Fonts will fall-back to a Justified paragraph formatting. I am seeing this in both Publisher 2010 and 2013.
<div><br />
<div>The strange thing is the Distributed formatting is working as intended in Powerpoint 2010 and 2013.</div>

            <p>Well spotted! Example: In Publisher 2010 Comic Sans will work&nbsp;with Distributed alignment, but Arial will not. In PowerPoint 2010 both fonts work as Distributed.&nbsp; If the failed Publisher 2010&nbsp;Arial "distributed" file is saved and then opened with Publisher
 2007 (on a different machine), the distributed alignment immediately works.&nbsp; So there IS a fonts issue, but Publisher versions up to 2007 could cope with this; The bug in Publisher 2010 (and apparently 2013 also) is that it can no longer cope with the fonts
 issue.&nbsp; I think the fact that Microsoft have apparently&nbsp;not fixed this obvious&nbsp;bug even in the next version will be interpreted by many&nbsp;to say something about their level of&nbsp;commitment to desktop publishing within Microsoft Office.</p>

<p>Hi Eunice,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check if there is any update available for the app from Windows Store and update it. You might as well try looking at the following:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Soft reset the phone by going to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Storage sense</strong> &gt;
<strong>Phone &gt; Temporary files &gt; delete &gt; Internet Explorer settings &gt; delete history</strong>. Once you are done with that, press and hold the down volume button plus the power button until the phone vibrates and reboots. Try&nbsp;accessing this address one more
 time from your calendar.</li><li>Try&nbsp;launching Bing Maps and doing a search&nbsp;for an address in your calendar. If that address is found, please close maps and then launch your calendar. See if the address is found after you do this.</li><li>Finally, review the address in your calendar and see if&nbsp;editing the address helps. Remove the city and state if included, add the&nbsp;city and state if not included, and include commas or remove commas. We would also suggest creating a test entry on your calendar
 of a public place and see if this works.</li></ul>

<h3> blacksheep---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N97 and Macs come on nokia&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I have had my n97 for a few days and so far despite a few issues I am reasonably happy with the phone. However I am still stuck with the buggy firmware that it shipped with thanks to the fact that I can't upgrade it as I am one of those those people who
 nokia deem not worth bothering with supporting, you guessed it an apple user!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Correct me if I am wrong but apple's market share in computers is now up to around 10% which would account for some nigh on 70 to 100 million units worldwide so are we still ignored by nokia? I specifically got an unbranded phone this time so that I would
 not be held back in terms of firmeway upgrades <em>(my previous n95 1st gen was branded T mobile and subsequently was smashed on the floor one night in a rage over its browser constantly crashing, try explaining that to your insurance!)
</em>and yet because I have a mac and ota upgrades are not possible with this upgrade im stuck once again!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While i'm at it Nokia multimedia transfer, the only piece of software that is on the mac system is a joke, a half hearted effort to appease us. Its slow, crashes both itself and the computer (both my brand new macbook pro and ppc mac mini, and its itunes
 transfer mode seems to me a remarkably round about way of performing a simple task. To make matters worse it doesn't even fully support the N97 yet! What have the software engineers been doing, had they not been sent the memo there was a new phone coming out!?
 Likewise no isync support out the box this is unacceptable on a mid range phone never mind a £500 device!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems nokia are blissfully unaware that the reason so many people opt for iphones is because they do everything they can do extremely well and that includes playing nice with windows computers! Its the elegance of the software that is the driving force
 behind them not hardware issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even nokias md is in on the act saying&nbsp;<font> ‘The new iPhone is an evolution rather than a revolution and for people trying to decide whether to get a Nokia N97 or an iPhone, it comes down to a decision on performance and value for money.’
 On my experiences so far this quote sounds a bit like he is trying to get people to buy the iphone not the n97!</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lack of support seems suicidal in that they are alienating the people who are probably most likely to buy an iphone, existing apple users. By having proper support they might at least win over a few users, after all isn't that what apple did when they
 lauched the iphone, they went after everyone as a customer!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also as many will be aware nokia music store is not compatible with macs, again they are shooting themselves in the the foot big time! Itunes brings in huge revenue for apple some of which they plow back into the development cycles, as it stands at the moment
 I would rather go down to HMV than use the nokia music store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Im not even going to begin to talk about ovi, shame on you nokia!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry got a bit carried away there but it pains me that nokia cannot see the problem, if in doubt just copy the way that apple go about things. I dont mean launch n-tunes or anything like that, just release products that work for everyone and work well straight
 out the box, this after all is the reason my windows machine went in the bin and a nice shiny apple tok its place!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So nokia please if you are out there, support apple users as well we are people as well! After all I wouldn't want to see another one of your phones smashed all over my floor because it doesn't work as it should do!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an afterthought realised I am working near regents street tomorrow think I will take my phone into the retail store and demand they upgrade the firmware for me or ill walk accross the road and buy an iphone instead!</p>

<p>We could, but that is a seriously EXTRA requirement which should only be required for LEGACY junk-ware. &nbsp;not modern sleek stuff. &nbsp;Nokia supports ( a little) the N95 and E71, but the N97 sync software (which they say is apple's responsibility??) &nbsp;is not available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, Nokia needs to support mac users. &nbsp;my guess is that they are afraid of the iPhone, and want to compete against apple in every way possible, including not supporting the mac computer system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, I have to say that my E71 is better in almost every "power user" way than than the N97. &nbsp;I just got it for the quick access to a great camera and video.&nbsp;</p>

            It's a disgrace that Nokia offer little in the way of support for the Sinclair ZX80 - cmon Nokia.

<p>LOL! The bloke does have a point but I think Linux support should have top priority with the large number of Ubuntu netbooks coming onto the market. Mac have never had much support with anything so its not just Nokia.</p>

<p>I will have to resort to using boot camp in the end, especially after the nokia store in london told me they would have to send my phone away for two days to get the firmware done despite all the windows machines in the shop! (Seemingly they are not allowed
 to use these in case someone brings down the internet or installs skynet or something, to be honest I tuned out after the two days part!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The point is that I should not have to resort to that it is not the 90's anymore plenty of people have macs, plenty of people have linux so why no support still?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are in competition with apple in the smart phone market why not have a phone that is supported for the maximum number of users i.e. all computer users, it cant possibly be that hard! Surely this will increase your potential market share by going after
 the very users who are likely to use your competition</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Put it this way if your bought a car, which I might add you could do for £500, and it would not go into bp petrol stations only shell you would be kinda annoyed about it. I know this is not quite the same sort of issue but I think the anology stands!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also agree the lack of zx spectrum support is awful that and the amiga 500 and sega mega cd are really in the cold they don't even have multimedia transfer!!!!</p>

<p>Well, the inelegant option of using Boot Camp is not open to non-Intel Mac users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the latest version of Nokia Multimedia Transfer (1.4.1) and it simply crashes whenever I launch it so I have no idea if it is supposed to be compatible with the N97.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm really unimpressed with the roll out of this phone - pretty half baked and not really ready for market, in my very humble opinion.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Since the latest Windows 10 update I have been unable to "find album info" using windows media player- all I get is an error saying the webpage cannot be found?</p>
<p>Anyone else have this or know how to fix it? I don't seem to be able to manually update anything either....</p>

            Hi - yes, the database has been changed and doesn't seem to be functioning properly. I have found where I am that using
<strong>'Update album info'</strong> works with CDs, but there may be regional variations. As WMP and Groove work in conjunction I'd make sure you have the 'add missing info' option in Groove turned on then you may be able to get it that way. Let's hope the
 bug gets fixed but with MS winding down WMP to core functions that may not be a priority! - Cheers, Ric.
