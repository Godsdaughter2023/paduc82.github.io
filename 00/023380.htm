<p>The earlier means of communication between your Phone and the PC is the PC Suite. Then came the OVI Suite which was later renamed as Nokia Suite. Though cont. improvements are in process, many users still think the PC Suite to be more stable, more user friendly
 and more feature filled...</p>

<br />No, if the subscription attached to your Microsoft account is renewed, you would not reinstall the software.

    <title>Teams and RDS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alc313  say:</h3>
<h2>            Teams and RDS</h2>
                    I have an issue on my RDS servers since the Teams install is located in the user appdata folder and not program files. I have refused to push the Teams client to my RDS servers as it will add a bunch of disk space to user profiles and also trigger an update
 each time users open teams. So my users have gotten used to using the web version of Teams. However, they really want to be able to schedule a Teams meeting from regular outlook 2016 installed on the RDS servers. So my issue is I can not find any way to get
 the Teams outlook plugin for my users without installing teams for each user. Is there any way around this?

<p><span>Hello ALC313,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you know, the Teams add-in is only available when you have Office 2013 or Office 2016 and Microsoft Teams client installed on your computer. For more details about Teams Meeting add-in, you can refer to:</span>
<span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-add-in-for-outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use the Teams Meeting add-in in Outlook.</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I did a lot of research and haven’t found a workaround which can creating Teams meeting from Outlook without installing Teams client. To help you get a richer user experience, I would still recommend you install
 Teams client on your computer as Teams client will give you full functionality in Teams. If you have any difficult to install Teams client on your RDS server, you can always share some detailed steps and error messages here, and we will try our best to help
 your further.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Your understanding is highly appreciated.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Best Regards,</span></p>

            Well if they would make Teams install to program files vs app data like skype did this would be much easier. I don't like the fact the everyones teams client updates individually and takes up storage\resources. So we have been trying to avoid installing
 the full client as it requires a lot more overhead in RDS then skype did. Does that make sense? I believe this is a valid concern for others too.

    <title>Warranty terms for replacement of a brand new phone. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nikhildamle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Warranty terms for replacement of a brand new phone.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted to check what Nokia's official policy for replacements under warranty is. I bought a brand new Lumia 800 from a Nokia priority dealer at Pune, India and it went DAP(dead after purchase) within about 20 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To my horror, the customer care guys are giving me a phone which is not in a sealed new box and are saying that this is their policy. I am horrified by this because how do I know how old this phone is and whether its defective or a refurbished one. All over
 the world, warranty means a replacement by a brand new sealed box. So why the difference in India?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could someone please clarify. This is shocking since im being made to use a second hand unit (obviously!) just after 20 days of purchase and after spending a lot of money&nbsp;on this phone. How can Nokia expect a customer to use some random phone after he has
 bought a&nbsp;brand new device just 20 days back? Service request no: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>

            Why should everything be compared with apple, i dont understand that logic. Every company has their policies and warranty information is one such policy which everyone needs to read before you purchase a product, no point complaining later.

<p>Being in a sealed box does not exclude being refurbished. Then with iPhone you basically pay for an extra phone anyway so since the hardware hardly justifies the price. Also you do not 'just'get a replacement phone, that generally includes having to buy
 the addon apple'care' insurance, so even more money.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Hi Alicia, I had the exact same issue with my HP laptop, Panda Global Security&nbsp;caused my problem even though it is their Windows 10 compatible version,&nbsp;try doing this it fixed it for me.</p>
<p>1) Reboot your machine, you can do this by holding its power button down until its light&nbsp;goes off.
</p>
<p>2) Now power it up and at the same time hold down your ESC key.</p>
<p>3) From the menu select F11</p>
<p>4) Click the Troubleshoot icon, next click the Advanced options icon.</p>
<p>5) Now click on System Restore.</p>
<p>6) When prompted always click on OK or Continue, pick a restore point prior to the Windows 10 Cumulative Update.</p>
<p>7) When the process has finished, your machine should restart and boot into life.
</p>
<p>8) This is the most important bit, if you have any third party Anti Spam software like Panda or Norton, uninstall it.</p>
<p>9) When uninstalled, reboot your machine, at this point you may consider creating a new System Restore point.</p>
<p>10) Now go to Settings, Update &amp; Security and check for Updates.</p>
<p>11) Cumulative Update for Windows 10 (KB3081424) should now install.</p>
<p>12) At the prompt click on Restart now, your machine should now boot up OK.</p>

<p>unfortunately as I don't have a Hp getting into that menu is not the same hot key and pressing ESC does nothing for me also I don't not have any anti-virius programs or any other programs that are from 3-parties that would need to be unistalled. as I said
 I am able to get into the boot setup so I can boot from my windows 8.1 disk but am reluctant to do this as i will lose all my files as this will wipe the computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was however able to get into alien-wares automatic repair screen which then took me to a windows screen where i was able to get into a system restore selection but unfortunately I never made any restore points as i didn't realise that this was not an automatic
 procedure as I am use to working with a apple mac which time machine is a automatic save.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did have an option to reset the computer which go rid of everything but my personal files but this did not work either as it came up saying "we cannot reset you PC and keep your personal files You can try Advanced Options for other ways to troubleshoot
 problems with your PC,or you can bakc up your personal files and completely restore you PC."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried starting it up in safe mode but this gives me the black screen also. I am able to get into command prompt if that is of any help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you anyway for your help&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Ok so nevermind I've fixed it. I didn't realise that my computer had an integrated hdmi output. So I just plug my monitor into that one and it now has picture.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently during the install windows swaps your integrated and dedicated graphics so that your dedicated no longer is enabled so can't display. So now that I have picture I need to now swap my graphics back the right way. But I'm not sure how to do this?
 Do I use the bios or the device settings or something ??&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi again Alicia, I believe by default Windows creates an automatic Restore Point before any major upgrades, I found&nbsp;three I never made by clicking on search or look for more restore points. Assuming you have another computer, you must have if you can post
 in here, then if push comes to shove you can always create a Windows 10 Installation Boot&nbsp;disk. This will let you keep all your files, programs/Apps, you lose nothing, but you will need your Product Key.&nbsp;You can find out how to do that here:-</p>

<p>OK and I am pleased you fixed this issue. Not sure about BIOS stuff, but you might try right-clicking your Start Icon, select Device Manager, then select Display Adapters, and check yours&nbsp;for Hardware Changes, Driver details and Properties or updates even
 by right-clicking on it and try out each option.</p>

            <p>Hi Alicia,&nbsp; I also have the X51, and I had the same problem as you have described.&nbsp; I ended up taking mine to a computer repair shop, and the problem was fixed very quickly.&nbsp; Apparently we have two graphics cards (Nvidia and Intel), and the fix was disabling
 the Intel graphics.&nbsp; My understanding was that after the upgrade, the system was trying to use the Intel card and not the Nvidia, thus I couldn't see anything.&nbsp; It seems like something that should have been discovered prior to Microsoft's July 29 rollout,
 but apparently not.&nbsp; Hope you have your situation straightened out now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and then I realized that the Alienware Command Center was gone after the upgrade.&nbsp; Tried to fix that through&nbsp; a download from the Microsoft driver section, and now I have another black screen situation where it is booting directly to a "F:" prompt, which
 I have no idea how to remedy.&nbsp; So my X51 is going back to the shop.&nbsp; Cheers!</p>

<h2>            OneNote Notebook missing after update</h2>
                    I've been taking notes in a specific notebook for a few months. I opened OneNote today and I cannot access it. I attempted to find it on my computer and it wasn't there. I attempted to open the notebook, and it had 2 copies of it, then somehow one of them
 wouldn't open, and ended up disappearing.&nbsp; Now I just have an empty notebook with the same name. I really need this back because it has my notes for all of my classes, and I have midterms this and next week. How can I fix this?

<p>Hi, I've recently become the owner of a 5800 and have set the phone to receive&nbsp;emails from my broadband ISP (Virgin media) via our home WiFi. I can download messages, read and send messages without any problems, but when I disconnect and then later reconnect
 to retrieve other message the ones on my phone disappear. The deletd email messages are available on the server as I can access them when I log on to my email account online. How can I stop this from happening?</p>

<p>hi mika,</p>
<p>if you aren’t a site administrator, you will not have the full control permission in the site collection. if you haven’t the full control permission, the move button may disappear in
<b>content and structure</b>. please make sure if you have the full control permission in the site, check your site permission and provide us with a screenshot showing your site permission for our analyzing.<br />
note: the <b>content and structure</b> feature can only move files between libraries in one site collection.</p>
<p>alternatively, if you want to move all files in one library to another library across different site collections, you may try running the script below.<br />

            Perhaps the page has been taken down by now. I was mostly supplying the info rather than the links themselves :-) You should still be able to access the info through the 2nd link or the one Diane provided.<br />
<br />
What is the exact response you get when you attempt to send a message?<br />
<br />
Does it make any difference what domain the message is addressed to?<br />
<br />
I tried to send a message to Verizon's own Abuse email address - it sat in the Drafts folder with the spinner going for more than 24 hrs. I had to log out before it would stop. Tried a week later - no problem.<br />
<br />
FWIW, port 25 is what works for me.<br />

            Bob, thanks for the response. &nbsp;I actually don't get any sort of response, the message just does not go through. &nbsp;i am just trying to test by sending from Outlook for Mac to MSN. &nbsp;Interesting port 25 works for you since verizon FIOS says they are blocking
 that outgoing port. &nbsp;I'll try that again. &nbsp;So far no results. &nbsp;

            It was in the EULA you agreed to when you set your phone up. Since the devices only sync with cloud data, it is the only way for consumer data to be saved in the even the phone is lost, destroyed or wiped. All devices do that - iOS, Android and Windows
 Phone.

<p>Docx is the native format for Word 2007 and 2010. You can set the default format by clicking the Office button in Word, Word Options, Save tab. Files do not change from .doc to docx by themselves. If they're changing, you must be doing it, even if inadvertently.</p>
<p>I would disagree, however, with the statement that "docx" has less functionality. Once you become more familiar with Word 2007 and the docx format, I think you will find that docx has more functionality than the older .doc format.</p>
<p>What functionality do you think .doc files have that .docx files does not?</p>

    <title>Toshiba Satellite E105-S1402 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sidlee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Toshiba Satellite E105-S1402</h2>
                    <p>This was a clean install as the system initially came with Vista which was subsequently upgraded to Windows 7, Windows 8.0, Windows 8.1 and finally 8.1 Update 1 and is mainly used as a test platform. Installation was smooth with no evident issues. Upon completion
 of the install, sound quality/levels were poor and there was one unknown device in Device Manager. The audio drivers were generic Microsoft High Definition Audio and there was no indication that the FM Radio was detected. Resolved the issue by installing the
 Toshiba Window’s 7 drivers and rebooting. The Win 7 drivers can be found at <a href="http://support.toshiba.com/support/modelHome?freeText=2140524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.toshiba.com/support/modelHome?freeText=2140524</a>. After the reboot, audio is consistent with previous Windows installs and the “unknown device” is correctly identified as FM Radio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only devices connected to the laptop are a Maxtor OneTouch4 Mini (150GB) and a Microsoft 5000 Bluetooth mouse and both working as expected. A wireless connection is made through a Netgear AC1900-Nighthawk. Two WD NAS drives are on the network and were
 successfully mapped. Two printers (Brother HL2170W and HP C410) are on the wired network and were automatically installed and am able to print on both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently have installed Navicat Lite v9.0.12, XAMPP V3.2.1, Firefox v32.0.3, IrvanView v4.38, Expression Web v4.0.1460.0, iTunes v11.4.0.18, Zune, Belarc Advisor, and Malwarebytes plus a few apps from the Store. Program installation was uneventful; however,
 programs haven’t been fully tested. After the installs there is still 274GB free out of the available 296GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I’m impressed with the ease of installation, stability, and program compatibility. Still a lot of playing/testing to do, but this is significantly better than early betas of previous versions of Windows. Overall performance appears to be at
 least as good as it was on Win 8.1.</p>

            MID() will always return a text representation of a number, not an actual number. It is like the difference between ="2" and =2. The two are not the same. If you want to compare them, change them to be both numbers or both text, not a mix.
<div><br />
<div>=VALUE(MID(G1,1,1)</div>
<div>
<div>... or,</div>
<div>=--MID(G1,1,1)</div>
<div>
<div>... or,</div>
<div>=MID(G1,1,1)*1</div>
<div><br />
<div>... will be the number <i>2</i>, not text that looks like <i>2</i>. For best results, wrap it in an IFERROR() for cases where the text cannot be converted to a number.</div>
<div><br />
<div>=IFERROR(VALUE(MID(G1,1,1), "&lt;not a number&gt;")</div>
<div><br />
<div><i>Addendum:</i>&nbsp;btw, text defaults to a left alignment and true numbers to a right alignment. If you have not changed the default cell alignment, then this is a good indication that the TYPE() is different. You can also use the TYPE() function to return
 which is which.</div>

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>In my own interpretation, the LEFT, MID and RIGHT functions convert all results into TEXT format. Means the 2 became a text, as you can see, it goes into the left part of the cell unlike the other numbers...</div>
<div><br />
<div>By achieving this, convert first the 2 (result of MID) into a real number, use VALUE function:</div>
<div><br />
<div>=VALUE(MID(G1,1,1))</div>
<div><br />
<div>Try it, and hope my explanation is clear enough...</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Thank you and have a nice day!</div>

            You need to force Excel to convert the text character "2" to the actual number 2. Your MID function returns a text character "2" rather than a number 2. Try something like<br />
<br />
=IF(--G2=A5,"yes","no")<br />
<br />
The double negation (--) before G2 forces Excel to convert the character "2" (in G2) to a numeric value 2, and then multiplies the numeric value 2 by -1 twice, returning a numeric value 2.
<br />
<br />
The problem is that you are comparing the actual number value 2 with a text string containing the text character "2".&nbsp; Behind the scenes, Excel is comparing a numeric value of 2 with the the numeric value 50, which is the ASCII code number use to represent
 the text character "2". When Excel performs arithmetic on text representations of numeric values, it normally converts the text to its numeric value before calculation. For example, ="2"+1 will cause Excel to convert the text character "2" to a numeric value
 of 2, and return a numeric result of 3. The formula =2+1 seems at first glance to do the same thing, but in this formula, the 2 is not enclosed in quotes so Excel treats it as a numeric value, not a text character, and no conversion from text to number is
 required.<br />
<br />
If you attempt to perform arithmetic on a text character that is not numeric, you'll get a #VALUE error. For example,&nbsp; ="A"+1 . Here, Excel cannot convert "A" to a number and returns a #VALUE error.
<br />
<br />
When doing a simple comparison operation, Excel does not convert a numeric text character to its numeric value. For example, =IF("2"=2,"yes","no") will return "no" because Excel is not converting the text character "2" to the numeric value 2. The formula ="2"=CHAR(50)
 will return TRUE because the CHAR function takes the ASCII code number (50 in this example) of a character and returns the character represented by that number. Since the text character "2" is represented internally by the number 50, the formula returns TRUE
 since "2"="2".&nbsp; The formula ="2"=2 returns FALSE because the text character "2" is not the same as the number 2.&nbsp; The formula ="A"=CHAR(65) return TRUE because internally, the upper case character "A" is represented by the number 65, and the formula is then
 comparing "A" to "A", which are equal. <br />
<br />
You can use double negation to force Excel to convert the text character to a real number. The double negation does two things. First, it causes Excel to convert the text character "2" to a numeric 2 and then multiplies this by -1, giving a numeric value of
 -2. The second negation multiplies the number -2 by -1 again, which returns the positive number 2.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The differences between an actual number and a textual representation of a number can be confusing at first because on the screen a text character "2" appears exactly the same as a numeric 2.&nbsp; If you don't realize the difference, you will get confusing results,
 as you have found.<br />

                    <p style="color: rgba(122, 122, 122, 1)">
Using Excel's conditional formatting (or some other function), can I add text to a cell based on the value of that cell (or another cell)?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(122, 122, 122, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(122, 122, 122, 1)">
I have a spreadsheet that I would like Column D to have a single space in it if the cell is empty (i.e., every cell in Column D would be populated with no cells left blank).&nbsp; The simplest solution would seem to be that I should type in a space to each cell
 that is empty since I really only need the first 100 rows populated (and that wouldn't take long); however, the moment I insert a new row (which is very often; I am constantly deleting and inserting new rows), the new row does not have Column D populated with
 text.&nbsp; I want Column D to be automatically populated with a space, even to new rows added.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(122, 122, 122, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(122, 122, 122, 1)">
I tried using the formula [=IF($D1=""," ") and applying it to Column D, but that does not work.&nbsp; I am thinking conditional formatting can only be used for formatting (:P) and not text input. &nbsp;So I was wondering if there was another way to achieve this?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(122, 122, 122, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(122, 122, 122, 1)">
It may help to know WHY I want to do this.&nbsp; I have a list of ongoing files in the first 50 rows.&nbsp; As they are completed, I delete the row.&nbsp; If a new file comes in, I insert a new row. Column D identifies the task that must be completed.&nbsp; I've written the most
 common tasks in rows 90-100ish.&nbsp; I've done this so when I start typing a task in rows 1-50, it will auto populate to what is in the bottom rows (since it is connected to rows 90-100).&nbsp; This only works if the connecting rows are populated with text.&nbsp; I don't
 want to use a drop down list because it's usually a variation of the text in rows 90-100.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(122, 122, 122, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(122, 122, 122, 1)">
I hope that makes sense.&nbsp; Please let me know if I need to clarify anything.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(122, 122, 122, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(122, 122, 122, 1)">
Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Excel 2013 is very slow on certain spreadsheets</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem with excel 2013 on certain spreadsheets.&nbsp; the spreadsheet opens ok and responds until I add a simple formula.&nbsp; The sheet then responds very slowly taking 10's of seconds to move from one cell to another.&nbsp; The resource monitor shows that
 excel hogs the cpu at a very high usage rate between 50-80% of maximum.&nbsp;The phenomena is on several computers,&nbsp; some running windows 8.1 and some windows 10.&nbsp; The spreadsheet responds fine in excel 2007.&nbsp; based suggestions from the internet including this
 forumn I have tried the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Saving file to local disk instead of network file.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Changing default printer to Microsoft XPS</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Disabled Hardware acceleration</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Disabled calculation with multiple processors</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Disabled addins</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; run office analyzer which showed no problems</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; copied the data to a new spreadsheet as values, saved to my desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the above solutions resolved the problem.&nbsp; Disabling hardware acceleration alleviated it somewhat but the spreadsheet still worked slowly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The only thing that work was to install office 2007 in parallel to 2013, and the problem went away.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else can I do to try to solve the problem.</p>

            <p>(I am assuming that you are not using VBA with protect/unprotect as Excel 2013 is very slow if you use this because of security features implemented in Excel 2013. There is no bypass for this. If not, Read on...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below are general troubleshooting steps to solve various problems in Excel. Try them one by one and check the result after each step (1 and 2 should ideally solve your problems) -<br />
<br />
1. Please try to perform a quick repair of your Office.<br />
http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/excel-help/repair-office-programs-HA010357402.aspx<br />
<br />
2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\") and see if is contains
 few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.<br />
<br />
3. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.&nbsp;<br />
Also upgrade all your Printer Drivers to latest from the internet.<br />
<br />
4. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
5. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start Excel in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. If yes, then start Excel normally and disable add-ins one by one and start Excel again every time you disable an add-in
 to determine the culprit add-in.<br />
<br />
To start Excel in Safe Mode -<br />
<br />
Hold CTRL key and click on Excel icon<br />
OR<br />
In the Search Box above Windows icon, type "Excel /s" without quotes and enter.<br />
<br />
6. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15, look for EXCEL.EXE<br />
Right Click on this, Properties, In Compatibility tab, check ""Run this Program as an Administrator""<br />
Start the Excel. You might again get the error. Close Excel and uncheck "Run this Program as an Administrator" and start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore.<br />
(If folder path is not correct, you will have to find EXCEL.EXE manually, like Program Files (x86) may be Program Files. Or you can even search for EXCEL.EXE in your C: drive<br />
<br />
7. File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced - In General section (go very much down in Advanced), check "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)". Close and re-start the Excel. Uncheck "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)".
 Close and re-start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore. (Basically, DDE should remain unchecked)<br />
<br />
8. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Open Excel.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click on file, Options.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the Advanced tab.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click ok and restart Excel.<br />
<br />
9. Login to Windows with a new user profile and see if problem is resolved.<br />
<br />
10. File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; File Block Settings &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
<br />
11. Review the KB articles - https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2758592 and https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2779852<br />
<br />
12. If none of above works, please uninstall the current installed Office, and reinstall it again. Before resorting to uninstall, make sure that you have the license keys.<br />
<br />
To uninstall the Office, follow the instructions in the following support article: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 &amp; http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971179/en-us<br />
<br />
Note: Ensure to save the Fix it on the desktop and then run the file.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the response.&nbsp; I neglected in my original post that I did an uninstall and fresh install of excel which did not solve the problem.&nbsp; All addins and vba are disabled.&nbsp;I also updated the drivers for the graphic interface and bios of the computer.&nbsp;
 &nbsp;As I stated I opened the spreadsheet on another computer and had the same problem.&nbsp; I think I may have found the issue and have reproduced it on two machines.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>the problem appears to be with adding Hebrew text.&nbsp; Here's how I reproduced the problem.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; open a blank spreadsheet</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; created 10 rows and columns of random numbers from row 2 </p>
<p>3.&nbsp; copied them and pasted them back as text.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; added formulas to the sheet (no problems exhibited)</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; added Hebrew headings to row 1.&nbsp; The latency dramatically increased between keystrokes and mouse clicks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Erasing the Hebrew alone did not solve the problem.&nbsp; Even working on other spreadsheets which had no Hebrew also exhibited the latency.&nbsp; (as I stated in the original post the cpu usage shot up over 50% and remained there.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To eliminate the problem I had to erase the Hebrew, save the sheet and reopen it without the Hebrew.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>From the control panel programs and features I am working with office version 15.0.4569.1506</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I finally solved the problem with no help from Microsoft.&nbsp; I removed all office updates that start with KB311, which were installed around Feb 10.&nbsp; The problem immediately disappeared.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I would like to see someone from Microsoft relate to this problem and to test their updates.&nbsp; I know I am not the only one with this problem.</p>

            No, the video card is Radeon 6670.&nbsp;&nbsp; That might cause problems on it's own, but the salient fact here is that the current install seems to be hosed up, given the conflicting messages.&nbsp; (And the MS install page for IE11 is hosed up in lacking a good link
 to the required update - though I"m doubtful the install would work even if it were there.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing I can think of to do&nbsp; is back up the registry,&nbsp; assuming that's where it's looking for the currently installed version, and try&nbsp; deleting/modifying
 it, or try to find all the .dlls associated with IE and reregister them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or just switch to Chrome or Firefox and quit wasting my time.<br />

            Thanks Manasa.&nbsp; <br />
I had tried option 2 before and that's what gave the uninstall error.<br />
I tried again, and nothing has changed.&nbsp; No surprise.<br />
Option 1 doesn't work either.&nbsp; Chose the let the system decide option, then unstinstall.&nbsp; No IE in the list that I could see.&nbsp; Selected not found and was asked for the program PID. Not sure what that would be for IE as it's 'part of the OS'.&nbsp; Tried install,
 and IE was also not in the list. Selected the not found option and the program decided I don't have a problem.&nbsp; Unfortunately, IE still doesn't work, so I'd have to disagree.<br />

</span>Not all of the updates were successfully uninstalled".</span><br />

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Looks like you are going to have to do some diagnosis and find out what that "error has occurred" message means.&nbsp; Sounds like interference from a security package, so may be best to try doing it in a safe mode boot.&nbsp; However, I'm not sure if all the necessary
 services would be running then.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then to get more details about your symptom you could try looking in the Reliability Monitor, or the Event Viewer.&nbsp; Or you could try doing a find of all files which were changed by that update attempt.&nbsp; E.g. press Win-E Ctrl-e and do a DateModified:Today&nbsp;
 search of &nbsp;Computer.&nbsp; Make sure that your options are set to find <u>all</u> files but you don't need to search for content, in case that helps optimize the process.&nbsp; In fact, I find the UX with WS so confusing and unreliable that I usually just use a cmd
 window and cd \ &amp; dir/a/s | find "2013-09-27&nbsp; 14:" | sort&nbsp; (for example).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Alternatively, even better, run ProcMon to capture your next attempt, and filter its trace with Operation Is WriteFile&nbsp; to find out where diagnostic stuff is going; then go there with Ctrl-j.&nbsp; Etc.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Of course, all this is just to avoid using bigger hammers.&nbsp; E.g. you can probably fix your problem by doing a repair of Windows but that means you need to be prepared for the consequences of doing that.</p>
<p><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

LOL, well said. Even in the community here (no offence) just provide references to microsoft knowledge base that is easily found when you google for stuff. I personally cannot update my windows 7 (updates failed) and tried all resorts posted here. Last resort
 was to upgrade from the original ISO image, but then again I HAVE TO uninstall SP1 from windows 7 before installing the original ISO that doesn't have SP1. Guess what, when uninstalling SP1 ended in the same error you are getting, "an error has occured". WOW
 how helpful for troubleshooting.
<div><br />
<div>If you are going to dump IE for Chrome or FF, I highly recommend dumping Windows to Linux.</div>

<h2>            Opening .ptm files with MapPoint North America 2009 &#47; MapPoint Europe 2009</h2>
                    <p>I support two users&nbsp;who both have&nbsp;HyperV installs of MapPoint North America 2009 and MapPoint Europe 2009.&nbsp; Every time they try to open a link to a MapPoint North America 2009 file, they receive an error message advising that they are trying to open a North
 America file with the European verson.&nbsp; Both the North American and European versions use the same file extension, .ptm.&nbsp; Since North American files are opened more frequently than the European files, is there a way to make the North American version the default
 application?&nbsp; Or is there a better solution?</p>

            Hello ITcrew,
<div><br />
<div>Without testing and having your windows setup I'm not 100% sure what's going to work, but I can make a couple of suggestions.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The easiest solution might be to right-click on the file, go to Open With.. &nbsp;and select MapPoint NA and click the box to always open with this application.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Another solution might to open a command tool (depending on your version of windows it might be best to right-click and Open As Administrator!) and go to the
<a href="http://www.mapforums.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MapPoint</a> program files folder and type:</div>
<div><br />
<div>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft MapPoint 2013\mappoint.exe /regserver</div>
<div><br />
<div>Finally, whichever one you install last will probably be the default, so it might help to re-install MapPoint NA.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let us know which one of the above solutions (if any!) works for you!</div>
<div><br />
