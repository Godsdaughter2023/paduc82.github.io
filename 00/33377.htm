<h2>            Hijacked GamerTag</h2>
                    
<p><span>Here is my dilemma: </span></p>
<p>July 11,2011 I receive an email stating that my attached credit card had made a purchase of 4000 Microsoft Points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I certainly didn't make the purchase and no one else in my house did. &nbsp;I turn my XBox 360 on to attempt to see what is going on. &nbsp;I was unable to log into my GamerTag. &nbsp;I immediately called support services and opened up a ticket and locked down my account.
 &nbsp;They opened a ticket to recover my GamerTag as the hijacker had "traded" it with a randomly generated GamerTag to my LIVE account. &nbsp;I was informed that the ticket will be resolved in 25 business days. &nbsp;Ticket was resolved and an email was dispatched to an
 alternate email address (one that is not your LIVE account) that the support representative will input into the ticket; the email address was "fat fingered" and was COMPLETELY off. &nbsp;But I was refunded the money to my bank account for the Microsoft Points.</p>
<p>I called back once not receiving the email and was informed that nothing could be done since the ticket had already been resolved and the email had been dispatched. &nbsp;The representative on the line suggested that we open another ticket with the CORRECT email
 address; I verified with the representative 3 times to make sure it was correct this time. &nbsp;This was in early August, it would take another 25 business days.</p>
<p>September 7, 2011: Once again, not receiving an email I call the support line to check the status of the SECOND ticket that had been opened. &nbsp;I was informed that the ticket was CLOSED because it was a "duplicate" ticket. &nbsp;I was also informed that anymore
 information other than "we can re-escalate the ticket" could be disclosed because of account security is their priority. &nbsp;By "re-escalating" the ticket means, I get a new ticket number and I have to wait 25 more business days for a resolution.</p>

<p>So I created this dummy account for the time being to post on the forums because my GamerTag had been hijacked and is no longer accessible to me and has been locked. &nbsp;My question is this: is there some kind of disconnect somewhere? &nbsp;The first ticket had
 been resolved favoring that the account IS mine and the GamerTag IS mine. &nbsp;There have been logs with XBox serial numbers, IP addresses, LIVE accounts, purchases, ect. &nbsp;What exactly takes 3 months to resolve something that had been already resolved? &nbsp;I'm confused
 as why every time I call XBox Live Support I always get a robot sounding representative who seems to be reading a script. &nbsp;Why doesn't anyone have their own brain and stop following SOP?</p>

<h2>            Scheduling the DOWNLOAD of updates on Win 10, NOT the install</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been plenty of discussions found about this, but no clear answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a network of many Windows 10 pcs.</p>
<p>We connect to servers off-site so don't have the option of WSUS.</p>
<p>Every time there are update released the PCs download them.</p>
<p>This slows down our connection to terminal servers</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not post how to schedule the install - that is not useful.</p>
<p>If you actually know the Task Schedule to change for sure and have tested it - please do give detail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>There are 4&nbsp;tasks in here, two look interesting:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am changing both to 23:59:00 Daily and&nbsp;unticking&nbsp;the repeat.</p>
<p>Also ticked Wake in the conditions tab</p>
<p>

            <p>Sorry Tryx that doesn't work - we are not Wi-Fi and tried it - but thanks for letting the post :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p>Join to a domain - off-site</p>
<p>VPN tunnel controlled by the router/firewall</p>
<p>Servers are Windows servers - 4&nbsp; of them - Exchange, Database and 2 Terminal Servers</p>
<p>Having WSUS on these would still smack my band width when Pcs turn on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the interest</p>
<p>
</p><p>Leaving&nbsp;PCs on all night would occasionally help but because the downloads are check every 20 hours it would still hit through the day.</p>
<p>Had all the PCs getting downloads from Lan pcs too,&nbsp;but that made little difference for some reason.</p>
<p>Wonder if downloading it form a pc on the same lan messes with the network too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regards to the Task Schedules - Pretty sure it not the Automatic App update now...
</p>
<p>Updates appear to download when pc turned on even when not logged in. The Task only runs when logged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So - I am focusing on the SIH task&nbsp;at the moment.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am curious about exactly what "doesn't work" as I regularly update that Wiki article with new guidance.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setting Ethernet connections is provided for in the article [para 1.6 &amp;&nbsp;Appendix C].&nbsp;
<em>I have been using the Wiki article procedure to control Windows update for over a year and have had no unwanted updates over either WiFi or Ethernet connections.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you get anywhere with using Task scheduler to control Windows updates then please do post back with the information.&nbsp; Many people have tried this but I have not found any descriptions of a successful scheme.&nbsp; I think lots of us would be interested in
 using such a method as it could potentially be so readily customised &amp; automated.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Denis</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically - you cant make an Ethernet connection metered without registry changes (trying to avoid at the moment - checking with tasks first), therefore the Windows updates&nbsp;downloads&nbsp;whenever they are found by Microsoft. this appears to happen every 20 hours.</p>
<p>The other items are almost incidental to me - it all about having no way to change download0000.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SO far so good - I have changed those two schedule trigger values (and wake), and the initial results in history tab of the even show it happening at night regularly.</p>
<p>The real test on this one PC will be the next update cycle.</p>
<p>Then I will have to change a few Pcs. </p>
<p>The biggest issue is then I having to leave PCs on&nbsp;else the next time they are turned on they will do the download anyway... although I could force the task not to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am just trying to avoid making the downloads manual at the end of the day because I know a lot of people will just forget. It maybe I go to the registry at the end an do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hmmmm is it best to stick to Task Manager or play with a Registry setting.</p>

            <p>I am trying not to make all the Ethernet connections "Metered" because this will then rely on users starting off the updates - as we all leave the office at different times this would effect people working later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I would like to do is leave the PCs on overnight once a week and know that the downloading will be completed then.</p>
<p>If not left on then it does not try to download during the day, once it is turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously not as simple as that, but would be nice and dare I say it: simple!</p>
<p>Another alternative would be WSUS but not on a server - A PC or two acting as the update server would be even better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway - hoping my Task Scheduler thing works, but from research people have advised that there may be other triggers&nbsp;that may start&nbsp;the update process... will continue to keep you up to date with my test</p>

<h2>            Surface RT won&#39;t turn on after being in storage.</h2>
                    <p>So we recently moved, and most of our stuff went to storage. Including a pretty beat up Surface RT. I take it out, and knowing it is already a piece of **** having been dropped many times and having had the screen replaced by me, I didn't really think it
 would turn on (but I hoped!). It has probably been in pretty hot weather, but I really have no idea.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Anyway</em>, I have tried forcing a restart, doing the hold the switch then doing off/on off/on really quick, normally turning it on, and even the big no no for RTs method which actually worked for some people as I have heard. Nothing will turn it on.
 I know it isn't dead because the charger lights up when I plug it in. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions, or will I have to throw it away?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Too many things that I can&#39;t download&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Well hello my future helpers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After living in England for three years I moved back to Israel. I bought my Xbox in England, I buy my games from England and my Gamertag was made in England. Now. I have a bit of a problem. My problem is my location. Israel, as most of you probably don't
 know, isn't a supported country so I can't change my region. But that was an old problem that I had when I purchased 1500 points for myself to get the Call of Duty: Black Ops map pack. Sadly I couldn't and after a while I chose to buy another 500 points and
 get Hitman: Blood Money. Sadly Hitman isn't available to download in my location.</p>
<p>Now please don't look at this in a wrong way. Yes, I admit I have a problem but I am looking to solve it as soon as possible. This isn't the only time I got this message. I also got it when I tried to download the demo for H.A.W.K.S 2 which I also couldn't
 do. My question is, why? Why is it like this? That I can't download those games? Is there any way around this? If there is I would happily listen to the suggestions.</p>
<p>All help appreciated,</p>
<p>Shahar.</p>

<p>Some content is region locked and since you're in a country that is not support by Live, it restricts you from being able to download that content. It's like this because of the laws in different countries. Microsoft has to follow each country's laws and
 that means they can't release everything everywhere.</p>

<h2>            A problem has been detected and Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer</h2>
                    Hi there. Let's break down to the specs first.<br />
<br />
HP Compaq Presario CQ61 Notebook PC
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Intel celeron @ 2.2ghz</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2gb of ram</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Usually a Fujitsu HP hard disk - sparecoe 517846-001</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So i received this laptop off a friend and said i'd look into the problems they were having. Originally this laptop was in full running order til it was sent to HP for a minor repair and came back with a software issue that the owners were not covered
 for (HP always seem to laugh in the face of their customers). So i load it up and i get the message from Windows Boot Manager. Status is 0xc000000f and saying the boot selection failed because the required device is inacessable. I have the options to run memory
 tests so i do that and it checks the RAM with no issues. Running on the hard disk it crashes. Common sense tells me it's most likely to be an issue with the hard drive. I remove the hard drive and come up with the idea of loading windows onto a memory stick.
 Before doing this i ran RAM tests again through another diagnostics program. I found there to be no issue.<br />
<br />
So i remove the hard drive, put in a formatted blank bytestor 16gb memory stick. "setup is loading files" billy sits and waits. When it gets to "Setup is starting windows", i get the blue screen telling me that "A problem has been detected and windows has been
 shut down to prevent damage to your computer" with error code 0x0000007B (0xF7ABE524, 0xC0000034, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)<br />
<br />
</div>
<div>Any help? I cant get setup to start at-all without it crashing. Tried harddrive in, out, memory stick in, out etc.&nbsp;</div>

chuck yourself, I was hoping to find SATA controller drivers for XP. They don't have them so follow omniplex's 2nd link and see if you can switch to IDE mode in the BIOS.<br />
<br />
You are using XP, correct?<br />

            Hey DE.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Where did you buy the key?  Can we see a link?
<br />
<br />The safest place to buy the key is from Microsoft here:  <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-10-Home/productID.319937100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US...</a>
<br />
<br />The only other safe places to buy the key are major retailers who back their purchases.  Amazon is OK but not 3rd party sellers.  Ebay is never OK.  
<br />
<br />If the price is discounted it is likely fraud, often a Volume Key used ony for businesses that will not stay activated because it doesn't have a server to check in with.  
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />
<br />Where did you purchase your Windows 10 pro licence from, was it from the Microsoft Store or a 3rd party website or vendor?

<p><em>"A youtuber said it was trustworthy. "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Right! Yes, you can probably trust them to send a key.</p>
<p>Judging by the prices on their games, I would have thought they would be legit too, but the problem with Win10 is</p>
<p>the price is too good to be true. Possibly a bit below MS's wholesale price, which kind of blows the cover on the games too.</p>
<p>I don't think MS has started producing 'Region free' versions of Win10 either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never know though. Maybe MS sell Windows cheap in <em>Kinguin</em>'s location - Hong Kong ?
<br />
There is less chance of being caught out with a pirated game than Windows (but Windows will still function almost 100% without activation),
</p>
<p>so if the games are not legit they are making a huge bundle of dosh from the games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Greg pointed out, the common scam here with Windows is, people buy corporate/volume license bundles and then oversell the keys.
</p>
<p>The keys will usually activate initially (unless you are at the end of a line of heavily oversold keys), but overtime the system
</p>
<p>catches up with them and Windows is no longer activated.</p>
<p>This can also happen with disc versions. China pumps out heaps of illegitimate copies of Windows. Short term e-bay accounts are a</p>
<p>a favourite hit and run dumping ground.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- btw.&nbsp; In addition to buying directly from MS, on line PC hardware retailers (with a warehouse or shop front you can pick up from)</p>
<p>also sell legit keys. You may be able to get Windows a few dollars cheaper at times, but nothing big.</p>
<p>
</p><p>eg - <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Store/Computer.aspx?name=Computer-Hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also - If the games on this site are not legit Steam keys you would want to be very careful installing them on your legit Steam Account</p>
<p>or risk loosing everything you have on Steam.</p>

            Any key that is sold at that kind of discount is an immediate giveaway that it's not valid.  I would challenge it with your credit card company as fraud.  
<br />
<br />You should buy Windows software from Microsoft directly or a major retailer that backs their sales.  Amazon OK but not 3rd party.  <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-10-Home/productID.319937100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US...</a>

    <title>Windows 10 Update version 1803 issue with Edge browser - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amarhp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update version 1803 issue with Edge browser</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my own application which opens pdf files in Edge browser in Windows 10. While opening pdf file it creates a temporary folder (with random name) in %temp% directory. In that temporary directory my application keeps the copy of pdf file and renames
 it to random name (with no extension). Example as below,</p>
<p>Pdf file: abc.pdf</p>
<p>Random name directory: '%temp%\RandomDir'</p>
<p>Copy of abc.pdf with name change: '%temp%\RandomDir\RandomFile'</p>
<p>So '%temp%\RandomDir\RandomFile' is actual copy of abc.pdf without extension.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This random name directory and the file gets deleted once actual pdf (abc.pdf) gets loaded and visible into Edge browser. This was working smoothly till Windows 10 version 1703.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However after updating Windows 10 to version 1803, the temporary directory and file into it are not getting deleted. Even after closing Edge browser the directory and the file remains present in %temp%. ('%temp%\RandomDir\RandomFile'). I debugged my application
 and found that after update 1803, I am getting 'Access is denied' error when my application tries to delete&nbsp;RandomFile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know is this something related to Windows 10 update 1803?</p>
<p>Has something changed with Edge browser in update 1803 which is not allowing to delete the directory and the file present in %temp%?</p>
<p>Is there any workaround to resolve this issue. (I mean random directory and file should be deleted once the actual pdf gets opened in Edge browser)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>With Regards,</p>
<p>Amar Patil</p>
<p />

    <title>How to prevent Windows from changing the UEFI boot sequence&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> everwishersong  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to prevent Windows from changing the UEFI boot sequence&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My desktop PC has two OSes, a copy of Windows 10 as well as a copy of MacOS Mojave installed via CloverEFI Bootloader for purposes like syncing the works with my MacBook Pro and iMac. Booting into UEFI Shell, I created a boot entry of CloverEFI and deleted
 the rest because Clover is able to scan the ESP for all existent boot entries. I simply need Clover to take over management of booting. But every time I boot into Windows 10, it always adds Windows Boot Manager to UEFI and sets it primary in the boot sequence,
 which is done <span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">WITHOUT ANY PERMISSION</span>. This is quite unacceptable!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to prevent Windows from doing this shame? Btw, for my case Windows 10 was installed in a VHDX drive and is used via a differencing drive from it. So it is not possible to simply place bootmgfw.efi with CloverX64.efi which is incapable of loading
 a VHDX drive to start from.</p>

<h3> jobellina  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 0x80070424</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 7 64 bit home premium with avg free 2012 antivirus.</p>
<p>I can't turn on Windows Firewall, tells me to use recommended settings, when I try, message "Windows Firewall can't change some of your settings. Error&nbsp;Code 0x80070424"</p>
<p>Also, Windows Defender is turned off, I click to turn on and message " The specified service does not exist as an installed serice. Error Code 0x80070424&nbsp;"</p>
<p>Try to run Windows Defender scan, and get same message.</p>
<p>Windows Security Center Service is turned off, click to turn on , message " Windows Security Center Service cannot be started"</p>
<p>First noticed problem after downloading firewall by Zonealarm. I just forgot to turn off Windows Firewall (I know!) and after download couldn't access internet, so uninstalled it.&nbsp; So then of course I go to turn on Windows Firewall and hey presto.</p>
<p>Also around same time avg had detected some infections which it said it had (supposedly?) healed. So am well aware this all may be as a result of some infection.</p>
<p>Have looked at several similar threads and have tried some things.</p>
<p>I tried to use the microsoft Fixit/troubleshooters....malware scanner/performance and safety/IE performance/windows security diagnostic/windows firewall diagnostic/windows update fixit....but all failed. Got message&nbsp; "Troubleshooting cannot continue because
 an error has occurred. We're sorry but programme encountered an error and cannot continue. Try again later."</p>
<p>Trying again later failed too!</p>
<p>Ran Microsoft Safety Scanner, Quick then Full Scan, but it found nothing.</p>
<p>I had tried backing up computer to external HDD (several times) but this failed due to an error.</p>
<p>Also cannot restore computer to earlier restore points, tho as yet have not tried restore to factory defaults.</p>
<p>When I go to Control Panel-Admin Tools-Services&nbsp;&nbsp; neither Windows Defender or Firewall are listed.</p>
<p>On Admin Tools page, if I double click on Windows Firewall Advanced Security, I get message " There was an error opening WIndows Firewall Advanced Security Snap in. The W F ADv Sec Snap in failed to load.&nbsp; Restart the Firewall Service on the computer you
 are managing. Error code 0x6D9"</p>
<p>Ran System File Checker and "did not find any integrity violations"</p>
<p>Base Filtering Engine not present on services page in services.msc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Checked Windows Firewall Authorisation Driver in Computer Management, and tho' said running properly was "stopped". So started it. But after I shut down computer each time is stopped again.</p>
<p>Also did avg anti rootkit scan, but nothing found.</p>
<p>So, if there is anyone&nbsp; who can help me in any way,&nbsp;I would be SO grateful.&nbsp; I just don't know enough about these infernal machines to do anymore without you clever people out there.
</p>
<p>Look forward to hearing from anyone, and thankyou very much for your time</p>

            <p>Hi Nithyananda J Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I haven't knowingly made any changes to the computer, other than the firewall download already mentioned.
</p>
<p>Re Method 1...Tried the fixit (again) and still won't run...as will none of the others as listed in first post.</p>
<p>Re Method 2....found it a little confusing...all about windows update which seems to be running normally. There was was no "Fix It&nbsp;" button for an auto fix.&nbsp; Download of Windows Update Agent, well it seemed to suggest I had it already.Also all the services
 it suggested checking were all set to "started".</p>
<p>Should i be doing the stuff there concerning Notepad?&nbsp; Where it says select the commands in step 3, I just have a blank box. Do I type the commands?</p>
<p>Sorry to be so dense!</p>
<p>So, no further on as yet. Anymore thoughts gratefully received.</p>

    <title>Non-working link in windows 10 start menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> impopeye45  say:</h3>
<h2>            Non-working link in windows 10 start menu</h2>
                    <p>I have a link in the Start Menu that, when clicked, results in an error saying the file cannot be found. When I left click on it, I am given two options: the first is to open the app, the second to open the ass's properties. The first works, the second doesn't.
 I get "[file name]&nbsp; Windows cannot find...". A File Manager search on both my HDs does not find the file. The app was recently updated. I am assuming the file was removed from app but the Start Menu is still showing the link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I right click on this link the options are: Pin to Start and More/Pin to Taskbar, More/Open file location. There is no option offered when the file is not found to remove the link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I remove this from Start Menu?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I chose as "Windows topics/Files, folders &amp; storage" because nothing else seems to fit.)</p>

<p>Hi Lenka,</p>
<p>By saying “START A SKYPE CALL upon clicking”, do you mean to add an audio or video call link of Skype for Business to the Outlook signature?</p>
<p>If yes, please note that currently it is not feasible to do that in Office 365. We can just add Instant Messaging link to the Outlook signature by specifying the link as sip:(email address).</p>
<p>I understand it would be nice if we have this feature in Skype for Business Online. Therefore, I suggest you submit feedback about the feature via the link below:</p>

I did, and it says all services are operating normally. I performed power cycles on the console without any improvement. When I launch the Xbox app on my phone and tablet, they also unable to connect to the services. My Microsoft account is fine, since I was able to check my emails and sign in here to write this post. I &nbsp;checked the forums and&nbsp;no one reported a similar problem recently.</p><p>I appreciate any assistance. Thank you.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
We have various bug checks:<br />

<br />
Overall, this is very interesting. It appears that this is not likely being caused by a driver causing memory corruption, but more likely a hardware fault (RAM possibly). Let's first go ahead and enable Driver Verifier first to be sure we are not dealing with
 a driver causing corruption:<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>What is Driver Verifier?</b><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
3. Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
4. Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
5. Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
6. Check EVERY box that is [B]NOT[/B] provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
7. Click on Finish.<br />
8. Restart.<br />
<br />
<b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause /
 force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <b>not</b> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
If your OS became corrupt or you cannot boot into Windows after disabling verifier via Safe Mode:
<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier. <br />
<br />
<b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b><br />
<br />
It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
<b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />
<br />
Any other questions can most likely be answered by this article:<br />

            <p>Alright!&nbsp; I restarted right after doing the Driver Verifier and my system did BSOD, with a Kernel Security Check Error.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I am unable to refresh my computer and I read somewhere that it might be because of something having to do with .NET files, so I am not surprised that the name came up here as well.</p>
<p>Here are the new .dmps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=55A089856625D95B!111&amp;authkey=!AB5BI0sBkX1YPv8&amp;ithint=file%2c.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=55A089856625D95B!111&amp;authkey=!AB5BI0sBkX1YPv8&amp;ithint=file%2c.zip</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it alright that they are all shortcuts?&nbsp; When I tried to move them normally, it told me 'no permission granted'.&nbsp; When I sent them to my desktop it worked, but it only created shortcuts.</p>
<p>It seems that a lot of small tasks aren't working.&nbsp; I am also having trouble putting things into the Trash Bin, it's almost like it's ignoring/not registering the command.</p>

            Unfortunately, as they are shortcuts, I cannot analyze them and need the actual .DMP's. From what you're describing, it sounds as if you have a severe amount of file system corruption. Do you have the installation media to perform a clean install of Windows
 that was as opposed to a Refresh?<br />

            <p>No, my computer came with Windows 8 so I don't have a DVD.&nbsp; I was actually trying to do that earlier.&nbsp; My product key is not on my laptop so I used Belarc Advisor to find it, but it told me that the key was wrong.&nbsp; The last 4 digits of it is correct, though.</p>
<p>Do you think I could try again in Safe Mode?</p>

            It seems like it's doing... &nbsp;something. &nbsp;It taking a very long time. &nbsp;I chose the thorough options, where it completely cleans all files etc. &nbsp;It is at about 15% right now so I will just run it overnight. &nbsp;My only concern is that a BSOD will occur somewhere
 through it (I'm guessing it's possible since it seems like they pop up everywhere else).
<div>Since I'm running it overnight I will update here in the morning. &nbsp;Thanks for the help!</div>

            There was a problem and my computer could not reset. &nbsp;Automatic Repair opened the next time I turned on my laptop, and it said that it cannot repair. &nbsp;The log file is C:\windows\System32\Logfiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt

<h2>            Mouse arrow moving on its own and programs minimizing.</h2>
                    
<p>My mouse arrow randomly moves across the screen. Most of the time it will select something. For example it will start highlighting text in a document or it will open a link. On several occassions it will check and uncheck items in a bank rec I was working
 on.&nbsp; It will do this whether I am using the mouse or if the mouse is idle.&nbsp; I can also be in the middle of typing something and my cursor will move to another location.</p>
<p>My programs will also randomly mininize or move.</p>
<p>I have disabled the snap feature. I have dual monitors. I do not use AVG virus protector. I am on a network. I am the only one in the company that uses Windows 7. I use a microsoft wireless mouse and keyboard. I'm not sure what other details may be important.</p>
<p>Please Help!!!!!</p>

<div>Hi Rachel Johnson,</div>
<div><br />
a) Does the issue occur when you are using a browser or on other programs like Microsoft Word, Excel, or both?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>b) What is the model number of your Microsoft Wireless mouse?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'd suggest you to first run a scan for spyware form your security software. Or download, install and run Microsoft Security essentials if your mouse lets you do download and install it by using the link given below.</div>

    <title>Old MSN contacts keep re-appearing from 10&#43; years ago - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Old MSN contacts keep re-appearing from 10&#43; years ago</h2>
                    <p>I have two Hotmail accounts that were both MSN Messenger accounts back in the old days. They were both automatically aligned with Skype when the buyout happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, whenever I try and use them on desktop or android, I keep getting dozens of previously deleted old contacts and blocked spambots (as in 2003-2009 period) that keep randomly re-appearing in my contacts/people, conversations and blocked users lists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter how many times I delete these old names and email addresses, they always seem to return somewhere within the desktop or mobile program in a matter or days or weeks - sometimes up to 50 at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to "reset" an account? I assume I can't delete these weird MSN-to-Skype transfer accounts without deleting my entire Microsoft account, but it would be nice for all the residual data/contacts that has accumulated over the last 15 years to
 be removed so I can start anew.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers, Simon W</p>

<h2>            OEM Product Key</h2>

            Hello mckoy1925 ,
<br />
<br />My name is Patricia and I am an Independent Advisor. I am here to help you today.
<br />
<br />So your first computer is now activated with 10 Pro ?
<br />Was your W10 Fam key linked to your Microsoft account ?
<br />Is is necessary so that you can reuse it on another computer as normally an OEM key is linked to a pc.
<br />
<br />It is called path exception, described in this article
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10738/windows-10-get-help-with-activation-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10738/...</a>
<br />Additionally, Microsoft provides an exception path for transferring a Windows License after a hardware change. You’ll need to be signed in to the same Microsoft account before making the hardware change and to use the exception path. 
<br />
<br />For that, you need 
<br />- to perform a clean install on the new PC 
<br />- to install exactly the same edition of Windows as on the old PC 
<br />- to connect on the new PC with your Microsoft account and Windows 10 will be automatically activated via the digital licence linked to your Microsoft account. 
<br />
<br />For more info, see the article <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530</a>
<br />
<br />Keep me informed.

            Hi McKoy.  I"m Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />As long as the underlying license you upgraded or that came with WIndows 10 is retail and not factory preinstalled or builder's OEM, then it can transfer since Upgrade inherits the rights and restrictions.  
<br />
<br />But did you buy the key from Microsoft or a major retailer who backs their sales so you know it's genuine?  Any discount key is most likely bogus.  See here How to Tell:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/defau...</a>
<br />
<br />The procedure is here:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>
<br />
<br />It is possible to do yourself if you'd previously signed in with your Microsoft account and it linked to the Digital License as shown in Status at top of the Activation Settings page.  Then when you change motherboard, you'd sign in again and run the Troubleshooter.  We recently learned it will even make exceptions for OEM if all else is proper.  So that's your best bet.  
<br />
<br />If not contact Microsoft Support:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
