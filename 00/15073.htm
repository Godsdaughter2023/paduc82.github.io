<h2>            Where does a header come from when inserting a &#34;Text from File&#34; object&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Word document that was last saved in Word 2010 but was created something like 7-8 years ago and it is all formatted correctly with correct details in the headers and footers. (Document is saved as a Word97-2003 version)</p>

<p>When I insert another Word document (Word97-2003) object into this one I get a new header where the data is at least 8 years old but is not visible in either of the two original documents.</p>

<p>These are the steps I follow:</p>
<p>1. Open Document 1 which has correct headers and footers</p>
<p>2. Go to the last page and "page Layout"&gt;"Breaks"&gt;"Next Page - Section Break"</p>
<p>3. Insert the new document which has current, correct details in the header and footer by clicking on: "insert"&gt;"Object"&gt;"Text from File"&gt; select Word document to be inserted.</p>
<p>4. The additional document is inserted as required...BUT</p>

<p>The header on the first page of the inserted document has details from about 8 years ago that are not visible in the original document. The following pages show the correct details.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me where the document could be picking up this information?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Alan</p>

            <p>In my experience, such elusive text is often saved in a header that is not currently in use. Enable both "Different First Page" and "Different Odd and Even." You may need to add pages to a given section in order to see all three headers. You'll likely find
 the text in either the First Page Header or the Even Page Header.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I looked at&nbsp;your document, and there is text in the First Page Header. The primary Header (which becomes the Odd Page Header) has an empty table; the Even Page Header is empty.</p>

<h2>            IE10 Web pages abnormally slow to display&#59; pics and thumbnails also very slow to display</h2>
                    <p>I have a 1Mbps DSL connection on a rebuilt i7-2700 machine (motherboard had to be replaced; Win7 x64 OEM replaced with retail), but the speed at which Web pages (including Microsoft's Web pages) load is quite slow (sometimes with the graphics lost), even
 with my connection, to the point where the speed at which pictures and thumbnails load is&nbsp;almost as slow as&nbsp;they would load&nbsp;on a&nbsp;<em>dial-up</em> connection&nbsp;(depending on the complexity of the page).&nbsp; On a typical page full of thumbnails, perhaps 1 out of
 every 10 thumbnails do not display.&nbsp; In some cases, a high-res picture might not load.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What kind of interference could I be having with IE10 that I didn't have&nbsp;with IE9?&nbsp; My connection couldn't have become too slow for IE10 to handle, could it?</p>

            That is what I <i>always</i> do.<br />
<br />
Here is my sequence:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Install Windows.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Install drivers for motherboard, video card and monitor from CDs and DVDs supplied with each hardware item.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Activate DSL modem and install all Windows Updates, followed by Microsoft Updates.<br />
<br />
In most cases, IE9 is made ready to download and install before IE10.&nbsp; Should I go to my IE8 options and hit
<b>Reset</b> before I activate Windows Update to acquire IE9?&nbsp; And should I hit <b>
Reset</b> again in my IE9 options before I acquire IE10?&nbsp; Should I activate IE8 the sooner I activate my DSL modem to acquire the first set of Windows Updates, and activate IE9 and IE10 the sooner I acquire them?<br />
<br />
Should I abandon installation of my drivers on CD/DVD until <i>after</i> I'm done with all of the Win7/MS Updates?&nbsp; There are some programs on my motherboard driver DVD that are almost certainly required, and I haven't done a raw hardware driver update from
 the Web in a very long time.&nbsp; Needless to say, I'd have to check which programs installed from the Web and which did not, before I go back to my CDs and DVDs to get the remaining programs, or go to the site to get newer versions.<br />
<br />
Looking at the Windows 7 Themes page as an example, of the 300 or more themes available, as many as a half-dozen thumbnails fail to display.&nbsp; When I try to refresh, more than a dozen fail to display, because after I hit 'Refresh', the Web page appears to take
 even longer to reload, thumbnails and all.<br />
<br />
I certainly hope the interference isn't coming from Kaspersky Internet Security 2014.<br />

            <p>I suggest install all updates and IE10 and then reset your browser in IE10 , you don't need to do it in IE8, IE9 and IE10, you just need to do it in IE10. Some drivers will install through Windows Update but some not, you could visit your PC manufacturer's
 website and install latest driver from there or install drivers from DVD.</p>

<h2>            Technical Preview Build 10122 Restarting, Booting takes 2 hours</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'm using Windows 10 Technical Preview Build 10122. I've never really had any issues with any of the builds, but for the past day I've been having an issue when booting my PC. Whenever I boot my PC, everything seems to run smoothly, until after the Windows
 logo appears. After the logo appears, I get a message saying Please wait. Then, when waiting for it to finish, it takes almost two hours before I can actually login to Windows or before the login screen appears.&nbsp;I'm thought that there might be a driver issue,
 maybe a recent update to a driver might have been the cause to this problem. Though I seem that have checked for any issues pertaining to any drivers, and nothing seems to be out of place and everything else seems to be working fine.<br />
<br />
So, I was wondering if anyone else had this issue or if anyone might have some insight on a solution for this problem?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other information that might be helpful is that, I am currently using an Acer Aspire 5742 Laptop with Intel Core I3 (Two cores @ 2.53Ghz), 4Gbs Ram (1067Mhz)</p>

            <p>Out of curiosity, how many times did you reboot in succession where it took over an hour to be able to login?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to look at your control panel/administrative tools/event viewer to see what activities, warnings, errors, are logged coinciding with your ultra-long boot times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also look at your task scheduler library to see if there are entries in there that are potentially causing issues.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a similar problem with my Desktop with a&nbsp;Intel HD4000 plus AMD Radeon HD7770.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The machine is running off of the HD7770... After installing build 10122, I eventually noticed that some of the graphics settings were wrong... Resolution and Refresh Rate mostly...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After resetting them to the correct settings the problem was resolved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... I also had really long waits for a Restart... It was intermittent. Any type of setting change seemed to trigger it... If no changes were made, the Restart was normal...</p>
<p>
</p><p>That seems to be resolved, but I'm not sure how...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may not apply to your machine, but is something to check.&nbsp;</p>

            Yea I noticed that, I also think that my graphics card settings could be in play here, I went through driver checks but to no luck. I'm gonna check and see if the graphics card settings could be affected but from a few days ago, there didn't seem to be
 an issue. It was perfectly fine .&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just finished doing another installation... this one didn't install the AMD graphics driver, but I still had to do a Safe Boot through Taskmanager to change the display settings...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't had any more 2 hr. Restarts, but have had a bunch of 3-10 minute ones. I have determined that any type of Windows setting change, or the installation\modification of programs, will trigger this...</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the Restarts\Boots when no changes have been made are normal, and take about 20 seconds.</p>

<h2>            email is all messed up</h2>
                    my original email address( one I've had for over ten years) disappeared when converted to Outlook and now all the msn ,outlook &nbsp;accounts I have , have nothing to sync to, so I get no mail. I also get notifications that my email settings are outdated and
 when I try to resolve the issues the only fix is to delete the account and add another. I'm at the point where I think I should let all this go and start a new account with Gmail and spend the next few months changing all my subscriptions over to the Gmail
 account. Here's how bad this is: if you respond to this question , I won't know because these email accounts associated to my Microsoft account are not valid accounts , so I'll never know there was a response.&nbsp; Way to go Microsoft!

<div>Hi BeckyFreund,</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>According to your description, you can log into Office 365 online with the same account and password, given this situation, please kindly try following steps to clear the password caches in the KeyChain to see if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Exit Outlook and other Office applications.</p>
<p>2. Open Applications/Keychain Access, select the Login Keychain &gt; Passwords category.</p>
<p>3. Delete the entries with the following names:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exchange</li><li>Microsoft Office Identities (any)</li><li>MSOpenTech (any)</li><li>MSProtection (any)</li><li>ADAL (any)</li></ul>
<p>4. Close Outlook and re-start your Mac to check the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While, if the issue persists, since this issue only happens in the Outlook for Mac client, to help you better, please contact our in-app support for further assistance. Please click
<strong>Help </strong>&gt; <strong>Contact support</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your understanding and cooperation will be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi BeckyFreund,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Office Credentials refers to the Office 365 account you are using, including your username and password.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook 2011 for Mac, profiles were called Microsoft Office Identities, it is associated with and stores a set of e-mail messages, contacts, tasks, calendars, account settings, Scrapbook clips, and more.</p>
<p>

            <p>I have the exact same problem. Bought an Office 365 Personal account but only got the 30GB. I tried to 'get on the list', which is ridiculous to start with since it says on the box you get the 1GB as it is with the office account; I shouldn't have to sign
 up for it on some list to only get it in 'a few months'. And then it says that my emailaddress isn't linked to any kind of Office 365 account whereas I'm 250% sure I used that emailaddress to sign up for my Office account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. My patience is running out.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 TrendNet TEW-726EC Wireless Adapter Driver Issue</h2>
                    Hello, I just installed Windows 10 Technical Preview onto my Windows&nbsp;7 Professional PC and deleted the Windows 7 OS in order to make my PC only boot&nbsp;Windows 10.&nbsp;I had my update reserved, but my computer suffered data loss due to a blue screen and I figured
 why not just install Windows 10 via iso instead of reinstalling Windows 7 and waiting for the reservation to actually download Windows 10 (I was so excited XD). Anyways,&nbsp;I realized when Windows 10 finished installing that the wireless adapter drivers were
 deleted because I chose the option to&nbsp;wipe my computer and I&nbsp;can only connect to the internet using an Ethernet cable that is bridging off internet&nbsp;from my laptop running Windows 8.1.&nbsp;I went to the TrendNet website and downloaded the official drivers for my&nbsp;EXACT
 model of my&nbsp;Wireless&nbsp;Adapter,&nbsp;which installs all drivers necessary from&nbsp;Windows 2000-Windows 8.1, it says it installs and the TrendNet Wireless application ins

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you receive an error when you try to run the troubleshooter. We will help you to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue may arise when, some of the Windows components gets corrupted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It would be great if you could answer which build of Windows 10 Insider Preview did you install?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to follow the methods provided below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Run the program in Compatibility mode</span></strong><span>, please follow the below steps:</span></p>
<ol>
</ol>
<p><span>1. Right click on the Program</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click on&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Properties</span></strong></p>
<p><span>3. Click on&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Compatibility tab</span></strong></p>
<p><span>4. Select&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Run this program in compatibility mode</span></strong><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>select the operating system accordingly from the drop down list</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Let us perform SFC scan and check if it resolves the issue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>System File Checker (SFC)</strong> is a utility in Microsoft Windows that allows users to scan for and restore corruptions in Windows system files. Perform System File Check (SFC), and then check if this fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1.&nbsp;Press the <strong><span>Windows button + X</span></strong> on your keyboard, a mini dialogue box will appear.<br />
2.&nbsp;Choose Command Prompt (Admin). You must run the command prompt in Administrator level.<br />
3.&nbsp;On the command prompt type <strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong> and hit enter.<br />
4.&nbsp;If everything went okay and no errors were found, restart your computer and see if the issue re-occurs.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After running SFC scan, I suggest you to run the troubleshooter and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are not using the latest build of Windows, I suggest you to install the latest build 10162 from the link provided below and check if it helps.</span></p>

            Hi, I have had the same issue with the Netgear drivers.&nbsp; They worked fine on windows 7, and yes I have the drivers that are supposed and I do mean supposed to work with windows 8.1 as windows 10 detects in setup.&nbsp; It is hit or miss, sometimes they stay
 working sometimes they go out continuously.&nbsp; I don't know if really this a problem with the driver or windows 10 as I never tested them with windows 8.1.&nbsp; Lets hope that soon the wifi connectivity issue will be cleared up.&nbsp; At this point I am successfully
 connected for 2.5hrs without a hiccup.&nbsp; Best of luck.

NETGEAR AC600 Dual Band Wi-Fi USB Mini Adapter (A6100) and I finally got through to someone at Microsoft who said they were going to "shim" the driver. I found instability with other Netgear wireless NICs.

            Thank you for the reply. I got my troubleshooter to work, but since the 8.1&nbsp;drivers I install onto Windows 10 don't work, the trouble shooter can't detect the Network adapter and therefore cant figure out what is wrong with it. I'm sorry my question was
 unclear, but my question was what can I do to get the 8.1 TrendNet&nbsp;driver to install onto windows 10 properly? Thanks.

            <p>I had a similar issue, turned out my mobo didn't have issue under win7, but under 8 and 8.1 it did</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggest you check that your bios version is up to date as well as any mobo drivers, in my case there was new bios version as well as a hotfix to apply before driver installed.</p>

            hi mate,<br />
<br />
you willl have to take up this issue with the developer of the website / app that you are trying to access. Windows Phone does not have a file manager as such, therefore your only option of attaching is to use SkyDrive and provide a link to the file for other
 users to download.

    <title>Outlook 2010 Issues - - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> armstrong698  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 Issues -</h2>
                    <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/400c9a59-a315-4d82-8d12-7e8ab16b9f35" />Hey there,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Just a quick question to see if anyone can give me any direction in or solve the the following problem:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Within the office there are a minority who use Outlook client using IMAP and the rest use Thunderbird on Linux. The people who are using Outlook 2010 are repeated (almost daily) reporting outages of emailing services for hours at a time forcing them to
 sign in and out etc but the people using Thunderbird do not have any issues what so ever which I assume will rule out an issue with the old mail server we are currently using.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help in the matter would be hugely appreciated and of course if I can provide any further information to articulate understanding of the issue then please just ask.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
                </div>

            1. Link of Outage? What exactly does that mean?
<div>2. Error Message: 'Cannot display folder - Cannot connect to server' and a message near the bottom of the screen that says 'disconnected'.</div>
<div>3. The synchronisation of Outlook takes quite a significant amount of time although the folder sizes are not that big.&nbsp;</div>

            Unfortunately, there is no way to download older versions of Skype for iPad. Also, you need to be running iOS 10 or later in order to download newer supported versions of Skype from app store.
<br />
<br />Please note, I am just being a messenger here. There restrictions that might b in place why Microsoft no longer supports iOS 9 or earlier with Skype, such as hardware limitations, App store policies.

<p>So one day she had a method that worked, and the next day she had something that didn't work and no recourse and no idea why.

<p>In his posts on similar questions he has a workaround for older iPads that allows you to install an old version of Skype for iPhone on your iPad . I've tried it and it works .</p>

<h2>            PPT word art or text box distortion</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>in an old version of PPT there was an option, dragging the sides of it I could distort the text (was useful to make the text longer). In the 2016 edition I don't find anything that makes this possible.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<h2>            Outlook not &#39;seeing&#39; text in email subject line</h2>
                    <p>Lately, for some strange reason, Outlook is not recognizing the subject line for emails that I am sending out. I clearly have text in the subject line, but when I hit send a window pops up asking if I want to send the email without a subject line. If I hit
 "send anyway" it sends the email without the subject line I typed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My solution is to save the email as a draft. Then, I go to that draft and re-type the subject line (because now it's blank) and it is recognized at that point.</p>

            Everything seems to indicate as if the profile was corrupt or the Outlook application.
<br />Validate that Outlook is updated and what type of version you are using.
<br />About Office: What version of Office am I using?
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/about-office-what-version-of-office-am-i-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19?ui=en-US&amp;rs=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/about-...</a> en-US &amp; ad = US
<br />
<br />Then I suggest making a repair on the Office Line, following the article.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair...</a>
<br />
<br />If the error continues before making the profile repair it would be advisable to validate if you reconfigure your account profile on another computer if possible, to validate if the error persists.
<br />Otherwise, you do it on your computer, you create a new profile.
<br />
<br />Let me know

    <title>using N95 as a Compass - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> habiba111  say:</h3>
<h2>            using N95 as a Compass</h2>
                    I recently got an N95-3 and i was told that the GPS can work like a compass i.e it can tell North South East West directions. And i was told that this will work without having Data service on the phone.<br />
I got some help from the Nokia team but still haven't been able to figure this out.<br />
Since my phone came w/ Maps 2.0, i was asked to download Map Loader on my PC which i did and i followed the instructions to install it on my phone.<br />
When i try to load the maps application, it has a 0.0b on the bottom left corner and the satellite symbol with the three moving dots (traffic light?) The Nokia rep kept asking me if the globe is moving/rotating and well, that it is not. There are the 4 picture
 frame corner in the middle of the globe graphic and the orange dots are moving but nothing else happens.<br />
<br />
Can someone please help me with this?<br />
Is this function even a possibility?<br />
<br />
I know that the Nokia Navigator can do it based on the description but that phone is out of stock and i am in a dire need or a phone ASAP!.<br />
<br />
Please HELP!!<br />

            Thank you.<br />
I have returned the N95 and now waiting on the 5800 Xpress Music.<br />
Or maybe just get the 6210 if the price is too steep.<br />
<br />
Thanks again

            ms. habiba you can use n95 as a compass without any datay packages enabled,<br />
<br />
you dont have to use, nokia maps, just look for gps data in your in the phone, and when there let it conect to the satellite. open the slide and make sure your in an open place,not in house or a mall,..... it takes normally5-10 mins not using a-gps.when connected
 it gives you direction ..the compass itself.!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
n95 is one of the kewlest nokia phones... NO complains here.!!

<h2>            SharePoint Documentation of Backups</h2>
                    
<p>I am currently working on a documentation plan for my company as we prepare to apply for ISO 17025 accreditation. We currently use SharePoint Online for our documents. I hesitate to simply use the phrase "The SharePoint documents are backed up every 12 hours
 by Microsoft or its partners". I think I need to be more specific. Like, "The SharePoint files are backed up every 12 hours by Microsoft or its partners per ISO#######". Is there a documented standard or specification (it may or may not be an ISO standard)
 that is followed in the backup of SharePoint files that I can reference in my document?</p>

            I think I may have fixed my problem. Do you use a samsung mobile &nbsp;for viewing and sending email? After a quick search I found there seems to be a problem with samsung's email app. My memory was full, in my sent box. For some reason samsung had duplicated
 4 of my sent emails, a whopping 4000 times. I'm not sure why. I compketely wiped the sent folder and deleted my outlook account from the samsung app. I then downloaded the outlook app and synced my email through there. This seems to have worked for me.
<div>I guess this is a bug with samsung? Im not too tech savvy where this is concerned so not sure what caused this problem.</div>

<h3> mirandawei  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2016 for Mac&#58; windows do not appear</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I seem to have a rather unique problem that has been unsolvable for many weeks now. I have even stumped two different universities' IT departments...</p>
<p>One day, my MS Word application stopped working - I don't recall doing any updates at that time. Windows would no longer appear (like the startup menu, any new documents, etc), despite Activity Monitor showing that the application was running. It also appeared
 normally on my dock (e.g. with a few documents open) but no windows would appear. From this point, I would have to force quit the application; regular quit did not seem to have any effect.</p>
<p>A few things I have noticed while trying to solve this problem:&nbsp;</p>
<p>- If I logout and then login again, MS Word seems to work.</p>
<p>- Word boots in Safe Mode, but I followed a guide to check the login items for my account - none of those were the problem.</p>
<p>- This problem only affects Word - all other MS applications are fine. Interestingly, this problem started with MS 2011. I tried to update to MS 2016, but the problem still persists.</p>
<p>Other things I have done to try to remedy the problem:</p>
<p>- update and verify disk permissions</p>
<p>- upgrade to MS 2016</p>
<p>- uninstall/reinstall MS 2016 (twice), by deleting the applications and all the preferences in my library folder</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated... I am absolutely out of ideas.</p>

<p>Hi MirandaWei,</p>
<p>From your description, the issue also happens to Word 2011 for Mac, and it seems that the root cause exists between the Word for Mac client and the Mac device.</p>
<p>The best practice to get help with this issue is to involve a dedicated support engineer. As a result, for this Office client usage issue, I recommend you post it to the TechNet forum as below: &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Reset PC, did I lose Office 2016&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> van2017  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reset PC, did I lose Office 2016&#63;</h2>
                    I just reset my Windows 10 laptop which had Office 2016 installed on it, and I (obviously) lost all of my programs, files, and settings including Office. I used the same Microsoft account to activate Windows, but it is not the account associated with the
 Office purchase. I don't know how many installations I can use it on, but I had it on this laptop and a Surface Pro, so it must be at least 2. Is there a way to not lose any installations, and get my Office back? Does it remember my hardware or Microsoft account?
 Please help!

    <title>MSE Virus Definition Update Schedule &#38; Frequency - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rfthomas.zzzz  say:</h3>
<h2>            MSE Virus Definition Update Schedule &#38; Frequency</h2>
                    I've notice that MSE always seems to be at least one day behind in obtaining virus definition updates. For example, it is currently 01/03/2010, 6:14 am. According to MSE, the installed virus definition file is dated 01/01/2010, 7:52 pm. You would think
 that there would be at lease one new update per day. I have noticed in situations like this, a manual update will result in newer virus definitions even though MSE says it's up to date prior to taking this action. Why doesn't MSE auto update? How often is
 it suppose to check for updates.<br />
<br />
I am running Windows 7 64-bit. I am running MSE, version 1.0.1611.0, with virus and spyware definition version 1.71.1625.0. I use the Windows 7 firewall and have Windows Defender "TURNED OFF". I do not, nor have I ever had, another AntiVirus application on
 my machine. For other reasons, I did a complete Factory Restore, prior to installing MSE. The factory did have Nortion Security 2009 available for activation on my machine, but I never activated it. I also used the Norton Removal Tool to get NIS off my system.<br />
<br />
One last question, how do I know if there are "program updates" to MSE. Will these be detected and installed as part of the MSE update or will they appear as part of Windows update?
<hr />
Thanks, Richard

<blockquote>Steve,<br />
<br />
Well I've been on my new daily scan with update, prior to scan, for 5 days now. MSE does in fact update prior to the daily 9:00 am scan.<br />
<br />
However, MSE does not check for virus definition updates between scan. Based on the article you reference in your link, paragraph 4 or 5 seems to indicate that it should. I quote:<br />
<br />
"The Microsoft Antimalware group deploys updates for MSE (also Forefront and Windows Live OneCare) typically a few times daily. It is not critical for you to check for updates throughout the day because when MSE checks for updates, the offered updates will
 be downloaded and added to the database."<br />
<br />
I may be misreading the above, because I'm a little confused with its statements versus the once every 24 hours statement also mentioned in your referenced article.<br />
<br />
MSE does not update when I boot each morning but that seems consistent with the indications that it won't if my definitions are less than 24 hours old. Obviously they are if I update at scan at 9:00 am and than boot my system prior to 9:00 am the next morning.<br />
<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
Actually, the fact that it does not check for updates in between a daily scan makes sense as the signatures have been updated within 24 hours. The same for no check after a reboot.<br />
Change the daily scan/update setting to be a weekly scan or uncheck the update check before scan option and it will likely check for updates after a reboot when signatures are about a day or two old.<br />

<h2>            HTC Diamond to HTC Hero my phone</h2>
                    
<p>I have had the HTC diamond for a while....it was not a good phone....went thru 7 of them. In the process of this 7 phones someone told my about my phone because I was constantly loosing my info because I dont' have time to sync to my computer. Worked great
 until now when I decided to go to an HTC Hero because I was told it is more stable but now I find I cannot get my contacts etc from my phone because it is not windows based UG!!! I was just wondering if there was anyway to transfer the information to google
 or something. Maybe anyone else who has a hero can help?</p>

            There are four ways you might be able get your data over to the HTC Hero, which runs the Android OS:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Copy all your contacts to your SIM card, then insert the SIM card into your new device (assumes you can use the same SIM card in both devices) - of course this will only copy your contact information and you still won't have tasks, or appointments there.
</li><li>Sync the Windows Phone to Outlook, then upload this data to google, using software like
<a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/outlook_sync.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Google Apps Sync</a> , then
<a href="http://www.google.com/sync/android.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">sync the data to your android phone</a> .&nbsp;
</li><li>Sync the Windows Phone to Outlook, then using software like <a href="http://www.companionlink.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Companion Link</a> sync that data to your android phone. </li><li>Sync the Windows Phone to Google, using software like <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/products/sync.html#p=winmo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Google Sync</a> .&nbsp; Once the data is on Google, you should be able to <a href="http://www.google.com/sync/android.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
sync this data to your android phone </a></li></ol>
