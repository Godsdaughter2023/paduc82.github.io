<p>Well if any game had a chance to turn out well as a movie this is it considering how many actors and writers are involved with the project but hold those pants for a thong full of painful tears if it flops.</p>
<p>It still&nbsp; has a 50/50 chance of being a major flop like most game to movie adaptations but if done smart, I can see it having being the new star wars with a cult following of younger generations.</p>

<p>Yeah I agree it does look like it is in good hands but history tells us that does not mean much. Besides if they do not stay true to the game story line it will just sh!t me anyway. I think that is what they need to be careful of, it is an established story

<p>Yeah, I especially like the two scenes from Revenge of the Sith, where General Grievous has 4 lightsabers and Obi-wan takes out two within 15 seconds of each other or the other scene where 4 Jedi are going to arrest the Sith and then the Sith takes out two
 of the Jedi within 10 seconds of each other.&nbsp; Why have totally badass action scenes when you can have totally badass characters that take care of *** quickly so they can spend more money on CGI effects instead of choreographing awesome lightsaber duels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Top notch indeed.</p>

<p><strong>Hi,</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I am trying to install Windows 7 Professional 64-bit to a clean hard drive using the provided DVD. I would like to use the GPT formatting option instead of MBR due to its increased abilities over MBR.</span></strong></p>
<p>I understand that I need a motherboard that supports UEFI and I have made the necessary modifications to boot in UEFI from my motherboard.</p>
<p>How do I specify, when booting from the DVD, that I want to have a GPT partitioned hard drive?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Update Assistant - download restarted after reaching - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terri jo baker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update Assistant - download restarted after reaching 100&#37;</h2>
                    <p>The Windows 10 Update Assistant download reached 100% and then started all over, downloading the update again&nbsp;from the beginning.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many hours was spent babysitting the download due to error messages and/or the assistant hanging up at certain points. I spent the better part of the evening in the command prompt, starting/stopping services, disabled anti-virus,&nbsp;running windows update diagnostics,
 downloading the windows 10&nbsp;media installation tool,&nbsp;and reading a ton of how to's and tips to help the update move along.&nbsp; I also posted a question about a particular error with corrupt component configuration that was fixed with the windows update diagnostics
 on more than 10 runs of the app. The gentleman that&nbsp;assisted was able to help me change a few things to speed up the download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, as stated above, after reaching 100%, the update started downloading again from the beginning. I attempted to utilize the windows 10 media installation tool but noticed it was just as slow as the windows update assistant. I just closed it because
 it was 2:30 am and I couldn't stay up much longer. Ok, I know I am venting, but believe me, I have not listed absolutely everything that I had to do just to get to the 100%.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So on to the question, is it absolutely necessary to have this update? If so, is there anything else that I can do other than what I mentioned above to get a successful update? Or do I just need to roll up my sleeves and just try again with the assistant?
 Please help, thanks, Terri Jo</p>

            Hi Andre, thanks for the response. The only issue so far with using the Media Creation Tool was slow download just like the Windows Update Assistant. I just didn't have another 12 to 15&nbsp;hours to babysit the download so I just stopped the download. And
 I'm good with blocking the update but before I go there, is there any other download solution with successful results available?

<h2>            Microsoft Sculpt Keyboard Keys not functioning</h2>
                    <p>I have a Microsoft Sculpt keyboard &nbsp;+ mouse combo and I'm currently having an issue with my Tab key not working. &nbsp;All other keys are working on the keyboard, separate keypad and the mouse functions accordingly. &nbsp;I have replaced all the batteries (except
 the keypad but this is currently working) and this did not correct the problem. &nbsp; &nbsp;I have the latest drivers for the hardware. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone through the standard troubleshooting process, provided by Microsoft &nbsp;and this also did not resolve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone experienced this or a similar issue? &nbsp;Do you have a fix for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am operating on windows 7 pro 64 bit, but have noticed this problem with Windows 8.1 pro and windows 10 pro</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try the following methods and check the status. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Run the hardware and devices troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter by clicking the <span><strong>Start</strong></span> button
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%25207%2fmain%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33_818.jpg" />, and then clicking
<strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong>. In the search box, type <span><strong>troubleshooter</strong></span>, and then click
<span><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></span>. Under <strong><span>Hardware and Sound</span></strong>, click
<span><strong>Configure a device</strong></span>.</span>‌ <span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%25207%2fmain%2f18abb370-ac1e-4b6b-b663-e028a75bf05b_48.jpg" />&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation,
 type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Place the computer in clean boot state and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:

            You may want to try reinstalling the driver. If you recently installed Windows on the computer, it is possible that the many Windows updates it downloaded may have affected the driver.

<h2>            Surface Pro4 w&#47; MDP to HDMI adapter will not recognize Dell 2415Q 3840 x 2160 display.</h2>
                    <p>Max resolution available on the second screen pull-down is 1920 x 1080.</p>
<p>If I use the MS MDP to DP cable, the monitor is discovered properly and works at UHD resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use the same MDP to HDMI adapter and HDMI cable on the Surface Pro 4 dock, it works fine.</p>
<p>This same adapter and cable work when plugged into my associate's Surface Pro3</p>
<p>I spent over 2 hours with MS support as they remoted into the SP 4 and loaded new updates and did a hard reset all to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use my Surface Pro 4 to demonstrate a 4K over IP product that uses only HDMI connectivity otherwise I would just use the DP cable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, to do presentations, I have to carry the dock and power supply which weigh three times as much as the Surface. Hardly a benefit to a light tablet PC.</p>
<p>I ordered several other MDP to DP active adapters that are advertised to support 4K. &nbsp;I'll update if they solve the problem since I'm sure I'm not the only one with this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or insight on this issue would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi Sorev.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A troubleshooting step you can try is a 2-button shutdown.</p>
<p>This step will start a process which searches your Surface for problems, and tries to resolve them aswell.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> As your Surface is powered on, press and<br />
hold the Power-button for 30 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Press and hold the volume up-button and the power-button at the<br />
same time for atleast 15 seconds, then release both.</p>
<p>The Surface logotype might flash on the screen while performing this step, but<br />
just keep both buttons pressed for the 15 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Wait for about 10 seconds after you released the buttons.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Start your Surface again by pressing and releasing the<br />
Power-button.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know how this works out for you.&nbsp;</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hello Dero16,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>I did in fact try the 2-button shutdown while on a session with MS support. &nbsp;This was done after they installed the latest drivers and updates. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will update the thread if and when I find the solution.</p>

            <p>I purchased and received several MDP to HDMI adapters that are stated to be active and support 4K/UHD resolutions.</p>
<p>When tested with my Surface Pro 4, all worked as advertised.</p>
<p>I selected the B*LKIN for it's size and mid range price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's hard to understand how MS can market an accessory that doesn't work with it's own product... and charge $40. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's also hard to understand how the MS techs can troubleshoot an issue without actually trying the setup with alternate adapters. &nbsp;The interface would have been a glaring fault if they followed a fault diagnosis logical signal flow chart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll continue to use the MS adapter on the dock and carry the BELK*N with me for remote applications.</p>

    <title>Flawed Reputation system - stuck in avoid me and good player - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Flawed Reputation system - stuck in avoid me and good player simultaneously</h2>
                    
<p>It's been a good 2.5 months now since I last had good rep. Two and a half months ago marks the first account infraction for reputation in my 7+ years of xbox live with this account. After playing only Overwatch and getting into the top .01% of players, I
 was consistently blocked due to other players not wanting to play against me. I only ever played with my own friends so there was no reason to receive reports from anyone on my team, but I do recall playing against the same people over and over again when
 I had achieved high playtime and ranking. I started seeing these players less and less and that's when it hit me that my reputation started to decline due to players blocking me. This reputation system is completely flawed in that other players can seemingly
 punish good players just so they don't have to play against them again. There is so much possible abuse in this system. Halo devs even came to the realization that this was so flawed and turned off any reputation system tuning they had in their matchmakin.
 Blizzard claims to have removed the reputation from in game, but that patch note was just another copy paste from PC patch notes. Having an avoid me reputation still does not allow you to match with anyone in quick play or competitive or brawls. I honestly
 would have preferred getting an account suspension for a month or something so at least I knew when I would be able to play again. But this is just cruel purgatory. There is no appeal system and there is no way to refute any false reports/blocks on your account.
 Make sure to never be too good at any games, or else you might not be able to play any of them anymore!</p>

<p>As the reputation system currently stands, yes, it is indeed flawed. Top-ranking players tend to get blocked by sore losers, and blocking puts a negative hit on your reputation. Popular first person shooters are absolutely the prime place for many salty
 players to falsely report and block you.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, <em><strong>I'm actually avoiding buying Overwatch for this very reason</strong></em>. I've seen plenty enough posts of players getting their rep hit hard by players in this game, and I don't want my matchmaking to get affected by the
 salt. I'm pretty okay at FPS games, but the wanton reporting I hear about can possibly affect anybody who's even decent. "Yikes" to it all.</p>
<p>Blizzard can't do anything about reputation reports -- that's purely an Xbox/Gamertag thing that's handled outside of the game.</p>
<p>There are various outlets of discussion (such as
<a href="http://avoidmexboxone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/3ixriu/got_issues_with_the_reputation_system_stuck_in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>) about fixing the "avoid me" status.</p>
<p>Summarily, just know these two facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>XBLPET and other Microsoft staff <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">are unwilling</span> to reverse any reputation and enforcement action put on your account no matter how much you attempt to appeal over the forums, chat, or the phone.<br />
<br />
</li><li>The only way to fix your reputation is to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
just keep playing</span> no matter what, and hope people don't report/block you. How long it will take, nobody really knows.
</li></ol>
<p>That's all just my two cents. Good luck on your future gaming.</p>

<p>It does seem that game developers can actually avoid any dependencies on the xbox reputation system as show by halo mcc here:
<a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/halo-community-update-8-21-15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.halowaypoint.com/.../halo-community-update-8-21-15</a> (look under the cheating category). Blizzard should at least remove the penalty for bad reputation for competitive. I haven't even been able to play my placement matches due to getting bad rep prior
 to competitive releasing for overwatch.</p>

<p>No then you would break the system</p>
<p>The only way to fix your rep is to fix your behavjour</p>
<p>Evening if you do 100 good matches while you are under bad rep it takes time to fix your rep</p>
<p>Just be nice </p>
<p>It is that simple</p>
<p>FYI the enforcement rep status doesn't move that's why it always looks good your true rep is on your profile
</p>
<p>You will just have to keep playing nife</p>
<p>And play with either players that have bad rep or non party games like elders rolls or never winter</p>
<p>You guys don't understand the system doesnt mean it's broken</p>
<p>Every player has the right to avoid bad players that's why they give feedback that's what you guys don't understand</p>
<p>Then they avoidnyou however this doesn't affect your rep</p>
<p>That's where you are misunderstanding the system</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I think we all get false reports against us, like I have received cheater reports and messages saying I cheat etc. especially on GTA online.</p>
<p>The report system is being abused by players but it also good to make the real cheaters etc. not play and ruin it for the real players.</p>

<p>I agree that there does need to be repercussions against players or are actually being toxic or cheating. Reporting someone for that should be the impact on the accounts, not blocking. Blocking should be used to stop communications or contact from that player,
 but should NOT harm the account it is used against. </p>
<p>When someone is reported, the report is reviewed and action is taken. Blocking someone hurts a players reputation but is never looked at or justified. I couldn't care less if someone blocked me to avoid playing against me, but this should not stop me from
 playing other people as it does now (avoid me reputation has pretty much disabled my ability to play any matchmaking games).</p>

<p>Someone blocking you doesn't affect your gameplay itsnthe complaints </p>

    <title>Archive attribute set when joining a homegroup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tore dahl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Archive attribute set when joining a homegroup</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have had severe problems to get my backup to work, the backup software I'm using is making use of the archive attribute on the files targeted for&nbsp;backup.</p>
<p>The problem I experienced was that the daily incremental backup was backing&nbsp;to many&nbsp;files, not only the ones touched sinc ethe last full backup.</p>
<p>Executing a full backup will reset the archive bit on alla files, this has also been verified that it works i.e. the archive bit is really reset by the full backup.</p>
<p>After some research i found the the files that had the archive bit set was all photos, music and video files i.e. all I selected to share via the homegroup.</p>
<p>At this point I left the homegroup (homegroup originates from another win7 box), and since then (early this week) the backup works fine and backs up only the touched files.</p>
<p>Today I joined the homegroup again and immediately all files got the archive attribute set.</p>
<p>This leads me to belive that this is not the designed/desired behviour, I guess the intention with the archive bit is to use it for backup purposes and with the described behaviour a backup will not be correct.</p>
<p>Worth mentioning is also that on the box that defines the homegroup the archive attribute works as expected and hence also my backup.</p>
<p>Greatful for comments or advice how to resolve backup of files shared via homegroup mechanics.</p>
<p>I have also read that similar behaviour is connected to sharing via media center and media player, I have not tried this but it might have bearing.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><br />
I'm not chrystal on how you define the homegroup host, but Ill try an explanation of my setup.</p>
<p>On all computers I backup c:\users\ and all "below" in that structure.</p>
<p>On the machine where I defined the homegroup i.e. also where the password is defined this works fien with no conflicts around the archive attribute.</p>
<p>On the other machine where most of the data resides I joined the group with the password from the other machine, opting to sharing music and video.</p>
<p>This is where the trouble starts...</p>
<p>On&nbsp;this machine most of the files resides in c:\users\public that after joining the group becomes available to the whole group, but also lost control over the archive attribute resulting in around 80-90 GB of unessesary backup every day.</p>
<p>So I'm not trying to use the homegroup for backup, the backup is always local on every machine.</p>

<p>Hi, trying again with a different angle on the same problem and hoping to "hit" some radars :)</p>
<p>I experience a problem with the homegroup in Windows 7, the archive attribute seems to be set on files that are shared via the homegroup.</p>
<p><strong>My setup:</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Computer 1:</span></strong> Here is the homegroup defined, i.e. the password generated and so on, also sharing music, pictures and media files.<br />
This machine works as expected the archice attribute on the files shared via the homegroup behaves as it does on any other file.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Computer 2:</span></strong> Holds about 130 GB mostly pictures and videos. As long as I stay away from the homegroup everything works fine and the archive attribute on all files behaves as expected.<br />
When I join the homegroup around 80GB of the files immediately gets the archive attribute set (verfied by usind dir command with /AA switch from the command prompt). I can "clean" the archive attribute by using attrib -A from the command prompt but after a
 little while it pops back to set.</p>
<p>If I leave the homegroup the archive attribute on the files goes back to "normal" behaviour.</p>
<p>I have verified this behaviour by joining and leaving the homegroup&nbsp;3-4 times and then re-joining, on my computer 2 this leads to the same result every time.</p>
<p>Not knowing if this is desired behaviour or not I would really appreciate som explanation, or acknowledgement that this is an error in Windows 7.</p>

<h2>            Desktop font has changed appearance to shadowed-how to fix&#33;</h2>
                    Today, without being aware I may have made any changes, my desktop icons have become shaded or shadowed. &nbsp;They are difficult for me to read this way. &nbsp;Please give me some specific directions for changing them back to easier-to-read Arial font. &nbsp;I could
 easily have done this with my previous Windows Home Edition but even when I finally located the control panel, thanks to this forum, I still can't locate where/how to change the font appearance from shadowed.

<p>Hi Jan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that the desktop font has changed appearance on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you have installed new fonts or made some changes as a result of which desktop font has changed.</p>
<p>To restore the fonts to their default settings, I suggest you to follow the below steps:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Open <strong>Control Panel </strong>by <strong>right click
</strong>on <strong>Start</strong> Button.<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Navigate to <strong>Fonts</strong> and click on <strong>Font settings
</strong>on left panel.<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Click on the option <strong>Restore default font settings </strong>
and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In <strong>Windows 10</strong>, you can now set <strong>DPI</strong> (<strong>Dots per Inch</strong>) scaling to make text and other items, such as icons, fonts, and windows, to display larger or smaller for all displays or per-display.
</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Windows 10 DPI </strong>scaling improvements are primarily focused on:<br />
</span><span><span>• </span></span><span>Optimizing the usability and readability of high-DPI displays.<br />
</span><span><span>• </span></span><span>Providing a uniform experience multi-display systems.<br />
</span><span><span>• </span></span><span>Empowering developers to optimize app-specific scaling based on display DPI.
</span></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>If you are running a screen resolution of <strong>1366x768</strong> on a tablet, chances are that UI will look good at 100% DPI settings. But what about when you connect that tablet to an external high resolution display? In Windows 10 you can choose either
 100% to optimize the UI on the tablet display or up to 150% to optimize the UI on the external display. You have to compromise.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows 10 </strong>takes care of this issue by supporting per-display DPI scaling to address. By default, Windows 8.1 will choose the optimum DPI scaling value for each display based on the value chosen for overall scaling in the control panel.</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Refer below article for more information on <strong>customizing the display</strong>:</p>
</span></span>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/make-text-screen-larger-smaller/?v=t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/make-text-screen-larger-smaller/?v=t</span></span></a></strong></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>References to Windows 8 also apply to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Old account contcats and credits gone with update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I updated Skype (my mistake) which asked me to create a new account. Now, I have a new account but my old contacts and my credits have gone. What should I do to retrieve them. The support thing here is giving us the run around without ever answering and
 there is no email or phone number to contact Support (if Skype still have such a thing).</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you created a new account, your contacts and Skype Credits will not be carried to your new account. You need to sign in to the application using the previous sign in information you are using for you to see your contacts and Skype Credits.

<h2>            why can&#39;t I change details on a music file&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to change details on music files.&nbsp; I right click on the file, go to Properties and select the Details tab.&nbsp; I replace the information that I want to change (Title, Album artist, etc.), click Apply and then click OK.&nbsp; When the property box closes,
 the new information does not show up in the folder listing.&nbsp; If I open Properties for the file again, it has reverted to the original file name.&nbsp; I'm using Windows 7, Premium Home, 64 bit.&nbsp; I had to do a system reinstall recently.&nbsp; Prior to that reinstall,
 I was able to make changes without a problem.&nbsp; I am the only user for this computer, I am listed as an administrator, and I have only one User account on the computer.&nbsp; I've checked the Permissions in the Security tab, and all of them are checked for "Allow"
 except Special permissions.&nbsp; The "Allow" column is greyed out, and when I go to the Edit option, I cannot add or remove checkmarks in the Allow column.&nbsp; I am able to check boxes in the Deny column, though none of them are currently checked.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We cannot change the details on music files if DRM applied to them, DRM stands for digital rights management. DRM is a technology used by content providers, such as online stores, to control how the digital music and video files you obtain from them
 are used and distributed. Some online stores sell and rent songs and movies that have DRM applied to them. A file that has DRM applied to it is known as a
<span><em>protected file</em></span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span>Since you said that you are able to change the attributes of a media file I would suggest you to check the same on any other computer and check if it works fine or not.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows Activation on a used PC</h2>
                    <p>I bought a used PC from someone about 6-8 months ago. There has been no problems with the hardware or software in this time so I felt like it was a good deal. But recently I've been stuck with the "Activate Windows, Go To Settings to activate Windows." watermark.</p>
<p>What do I do about this? Does this make my copy of Windows 10 illegal to own? I absolutely do not have the money to buy another copy.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe8832ee-3ea4-4c41-958e-523584eb6912?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe8832ee-3ea4-4c41-958e-523584eb6912?upload=true" /></a></p>

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />(Not applicable to you) 
<br />What you need to do is to grab the key using any Software like Showkey Plus, uninstall that key from older PC and use it on another computer. 
<br />
<br />Download Showkey Plus: 
<br />www.thewindowsclub.com/showkeyplus-product-key-finder
<br />
<br />Uninstall the key
<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-windows-10-and-change-the-product-key/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-wind...</a> 
<br />
<br />Use the key by Showkey Plus on the newer computer. 
<br />
<br />Alternatively, there are two more options available other than this: 
<br />(Not applicable to you ends) 
<br />Contact Microsoft at <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/software/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>  through chat support. They would take control of your PC and activate(might need a proof of purchase) 
<br />Use the Activation troubleshooter on the new PC signed in with same MS account. 
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. 
<br />Select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

            Hi SShimon, it looks like you are running Windows 10 Enterprise, which is the volume licence version of Windows and not meant for the general public . . .
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Go to System - About 
<br />
<br />Whet version of Windows 10 is reported there, is it Pro or Enterprise? 
<br />
<br />Then in the Settings App, go to Update and Security - Activation 
<br />
<br />Does Activation report that 'Windows is activated using your Organisation's Activation server'? 
<br />
<br />If so: 
<br />
<br />It is likely that the Windows 10 licence you are running is a volume licence version and is meant to run in a Company or organisation where the activation is re-armed on a regular basis . . . 
<br />
<br />Do you know the history of your PC or version of Windows? 
<br />
<br />If your PC is second hand or Windows was reinstalled, it is likely that version of Windows came from a company environment or it is a cracked version of Windows
<br />
<br />You really should contact the Seller and get them to resolve this issue . . .

    <title>Microsoft TeredoTunneling Adapter Driver not working starting with - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> s.travis-mona  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft TeredoTunneling Adapter Driver not working starting with last Microsoft Updates</h2>
                    This is the question I'm asking because after troubleshooting my computer when my&nbsp; Internet explorer may come up to the 1st screen most of the time (sometimes not at all), a lot of the times it won't go to the 2nd page at all. And sometimes it will work
 for me all day long with no problem (very few and far between).<br />
<br />
The error code that comes up after all the other error codes are fixed (some are not) is as above, 'YOUR MICROSOFT TEREDO TUNNELING ADAPTER DRIVER ISN'T WORKING'.&nbsp; This started happening just after the last Microsoft Updates that included driver updates. I
 tried uninstalling the driver update, but it left me with <span style="font-weight: bold">
no</span> driver for the adapter and I didn't want that. I could have restored my computer to the last update prior, but I'd lose
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">everything</span> that was updated.<br />
<br />
So, what's left, does Microsoft have a different driver Update for my laptop? The other update does not work obviously. Or is there another underlying problem causing the adapter driver to show this error?<br />
<br />
Thank you for you answer in advance.<br />
<br />

                    I have an original version of Windows Vista Ultimate, no SP1 or SP2 included. I would like to be able to roll all the updates, including SP1 and SP2 into a customer Vista disc, as I did with my Windows XP to include SP1 and then SP2 when it was released.
 Can you direct me to where I can find instructions and whatever software I will require to complete this? I just had to redo my installation, and it took about 3 days to do all the windows updates, the service packs, then the rest of the updates.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

                    <p>There are a number of articles circulating on the internet&nbsp;that seem to suggest that&nbsp;changes to the XBox Live policy will now&nbsp;mean that if you type a swear word into a game&nbsp;text chat (or office&nbsp;document???), that Microsoft <strong><em>can</em></strong> remove access to your entire digital games collection.

Do Microsoft&nbsp;refund you all the money you have spent over the many years of purchasing their&nbsp;digital&nbsp;products, or do Microsoft&nbsp;just keep it?</p><p><br /></p><p>Why does typing a swear word&nbsp;in a chat box&nbsp;allow Microsoft to remove access to your single player games, I can understand removing multiplayer communication capability from those people incapable of being reasonable, but what have their single player games got to do with that?<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Should I only buy physical content from now on, just in cas

            <p>That's nothing new. Profanity has always been a violation of the code of conduct. If you swear, you can receive a suspension. Multiple suspensions can lead to an account ban. Once an account is banned, you forfeit everything you had on the account. You do not receive a refund for being banned.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>There haven't been any changes to policy. How can you have been on Xbox Live for 10 years and not know that the policy has always been that the interactions on Live are to be rated E for Everyone? Swearing is swearing.</p>
