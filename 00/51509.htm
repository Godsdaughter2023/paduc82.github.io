            <p>What sort of TV, brand and model, is your TV? I have the Xbox One X and a Sony 43' KDX8000E series 4k HDR TV (which is a 2017 model from Sony), and have no issues. But have HDR mode on Auto as Full HDR10 mode is too powerful but is better for producing better blacks somewhat. My TV has an X-Reality Pro processor and advanced Tri Luminos colour technology with wider colour palate and natural colours. Samsung TV's have a bad OS which has serious security vulnerabilities from my research. Android OS on my TV is more secure and is updated more frequently. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/4/15175124/samsung-tizen-security-vulnerabilities-issues-flaws" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/4/15175124/samsung-tizen-security-vulnerabilities-issues-flaws</a> My TV also has an anti-glare display too, so it won't reflect like a mirror like Samsung TV's which don't have the anti-reflective coating. From sunlight coming through your room windows. </p><p><br /></p>

<h2>            My PC don&#39;t recognize&#47;read any external device</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;My PC came home yesterday after a formatting. Now my PC don't recognize any external memory (USB/MicroSD/etc...) ; and the ones who got read are "blank" without any file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I don't know if this could influence but there are two disks in my PC, both with Windows' files since I don't deleted old folders from previous SO because of TrustedInstaller. (Maybe two files about recognition of devices could annoy one each other?). Also,
 if everythings fails: How could I recover my files? The ones in the PC are of extremely value because they are comercial potos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Thanks, Kevinglas.</p>

            <p>Well, it's not a Microsoft product then?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are presuming Microsoft engineer are omnipotent and all seeing over things that they have no responsibility for. Did you buy it from a Microsoft store?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you not have an FAQ/instructions for this 'app'?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstall it and try again...watching what you are doing when you install, and in particular what it will install if you don't pay attention or what other have said about it...this is a good time to use an online search engine.</p>

<p>
</p><p>what i mean with crash is that it turns off to restart and never comes back on.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
i tried to get it to start in safe mode.&nbsp; &nbsp;it comes on has a few words but they are gone too fast to catch what they are.&nbsp; &nbsp;it doesn't go through the checks that i would usually see in a safe mode start.&nbsp; &nbsp; then it goes to the hp circle for a few rotations
 of the little loading circle and then goes black.&nbsp; &nbsp;nothing after that.</p>

<h2>            Skyrim add ons - can u DL hearthfire and Dawnguard and still play the game normally&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I was just wondering if DL-ing these add-ons makes the game different??&nbsp; As of now I am stalling on killing Alduin so I can check out every place on the map or finish quests I have not completed yet.&nbsp; So I was wondering if the add-ons will prevent
 me from competing my tasks or do they basically just keep everything the same and add a couple more quests?&nbsp; I know Hearthfire isnt so much a quest gig, but still, it seems like Dawnguard would have to be quest oriented.&nbsp; Thanks fellas</p>

<p>I would highly suggest at least getting the Hearthfire DLC. &nbsp;It could easily take you 30+ hours to complete all 3 houses. &nbsp;Plus it gives you almost everything you could ever need all in 1 house.

<p>You may wind up one of the unlucky few if you download Dawnguard and choose not to play it. &nbsp;The increased vampire presence is in the form of attacks on you in the wild, and towns when you visit them which can lead to the deaths of some npc's that offer
 quests for you, or merchants which can lead to you not having some people to buy and sell with. &nbsp;My advice would be to hold off on Dawnguard until you are ready to give it your full attention as otherwise it might halt your progress in your normal game.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">As said above both Dawnguard and Hearthfire begin taking effects in a Game almost immediately. The only exception being that, Dawnguard will not have the Vampire "hit squads" showing up in a New Game until you have at least reached
 Level 10. <br />
<br />
There is kind of a "work around" for Players that either don't want to start Dawnguard or believe their Character might not be strong enough.
<br />
<br />
<em><strong>*Spoilers below*</strong></em><br />
<br />
If you begin and simply go to the point when you get Serana as a "Follower" but you're supposed to Escort her home, simply do not take her home at this time and do not finish that Quest at that time and the Vampire "Hit Squads" attacks go almost to none at
 all. You can be free to travel everywhere else with her and best of, she's pretty much a tank that cannot die. She won't hold your Items at this point though, because she is not truly a "Follower" at this time. She also has some nice things to say about the
 land of Skyrim every now and then. </span></p>

            Hi CarlaDiCarlo,
<br />
<br />Do you remember at what resolution it was before? Hopefully I can help you get back to the right resolution, maybe you've tried this method, maybe you haven't, but I'm hoping the latter is true so that you have more avenues to go on about fixing this issue. 
<br />
<br />Right-click a blank space on the desktop, then click Display settings.
<br />
<br />You can then click "Advanced display settings". Click Display adapter properties for Display x (x is the number, most likely 1).
<br />
<br />Attached is an image of what you should see for your next window. Click List All Modes, and try to find your resolution.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you've already tried this or not, and that if it works, good luck.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/de460318-c416-41a9-9eef-315792d88430?upload=true" />

            Hello, and sorry you are experiencing some "issues" there with your screen resolution. I am just a member of this community. I try to pitch in if I happen to know "something". Lol!
<br />OK. Let's start by parsing your words and see if I understand correctly what it is that needs to be addressed and why.
<br />
<br />"I cannot find a resolution that looks right on my screen" pretty much summarizes it, right?
<br />
<br />Unanswered variables and paths I would explore would be the following:
<br />
<br />Did you try a reboot (the simplest firs attempt)
<br />Is this a laptop or a desktop computer?
<br />Is it a desktop computer connected to an external monitor?
<br />Is it a laptop connected to an external monitor?
<br />Is the laptop stand-alone with no external monitor?
<br />
<br />I believe those are the very first things I want to find out, and set straight in my mind. What type of scenario do we have here?
<br />Did anything change, hardware-wise, after the e-mail issue had been fixed?  Did you swap out monitors? If a laptop is involved, did you make sure the  laptop lid/cover is firmly closed if you are projecting to an external monitor.  If the laptop lid is not entirely closed, the laptop will retain its own native screen resolution,
<br />
<br />OK. Let me go in for a stretch, while you sit and digest this.
<br />
<br />Do you happen to know the following, besides the questions I asked above:
<br />
<br />What was the screen resolution you were working with prior to the incident?
<br />What is the screen resolution now?
<br />
<br />Have you checked the DEVICES tab to see if maybe more than one monitor is retained in the "profile". That is possible. The computer could be defaulting to the wrong, or no longer present, monitor.
<br />
<br />Try rebooting the PC with no external monitor or media devices connected to it.
<br />Write down the screen resolution you get after that reboot.
<br />Compare it to what you had before.
<br />If the two do not match, try moving the slider rule over to match the desired number. If the computer does not allow you to reach that number, then something has changed.
<br />You may try Updating the Video driver for that display card.
<br />But usually the detection and full functionality of a display happens quite automatically and silently in the background.
<br />Mice, keyboard, printers and monitors. All should be easily identifiable by the operating system. Therefore - no human intervention required.
<br />Usually, your computer will start up into the best display mode possible for your experience.
<br />Hope this helps!
<br />Franklin

            Hi Carla,
<br />
<br />Let's go back to basics first:
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop, choose Display Settings
<br />
<br />Set Scale to 100%
<br />
<br />Set Resolution to the one marked (recommended)
<br />
<br />Is there a resolution marked recommended?
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />What make if graphics device is listed there?

            Tried that, but thanks.&nbsp; NO resolution option, even the recommended one, makes it look like it did before the Micro tech tried fixing my email.&nbsp; I was hoping there was a way manually to put in the numbers i want.

            Did all that.&nbsp; Didn't work. If i manually hit the Menu button on my monitor, it tells me to change settings to 1440 x 900 60hz.&nbsp; That is not an option given to me in display, or anywhere else I can see.&nbsp; That's why I was hoping there might be a way to
 enter resolution numbers manually.&nbsp; Thanks though.

<br />I had that problem a few years ago, I had a really nice monitor, nice and wide, but 1400 X 900 is not a standard resolution supported by most graphics cards . . .
<br />
<br />What make if graphics device is listed in device Manager ?

            No, we cannot manually enter resolutions. 
<br />
<br />Resolutions are defined by what the Video Card and driver can support.  Sometimes the windows matches those options to what the monitor can support.  If you select a resolution that is wrong for the monitor you can see effects like you described, or the image runs off screen, or the image is compressed inside of the monitor leaving black borders around the image. 
<br />
<br />Monitors also have profiles, that include supported monitors. Maybe your monitor profile has been messed up
<br />
<br />2018 01 20- WINDOWS 10 MONITOR NOT CRISP - PROFILE
<br />I had a windows 10 update on 19 January 2018. The update took some time, so I guess it was a major update. When my computer restarted, both monitors did not display anything with the crispness they had before the update. I updated drivers for the monitors along with the graphics card. The monitors still look the way they looked after the update. Any ideas? 
<br />
<br />Try this:
<br />.  *  Control Panel (icon view) &gt; Color Management 
<br />.  *  click Profiles button
<br />.  *  select Reset to reset my settings to the system defaults.
<br />
<br />The text and displays are now clear and crisp again.
<br />
<br />Could you please give us screen captures of the problem. Maybe that will suggest a cause, and subsequent fix ...  (you can't simply paste the captures into the reply box, use the Insert Picture button at the top of the input box)

    <title>desktop icons vanish when I log in through a VPN - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jane eyre_0102  say:</h3>
<h2>            desktop icons vanish when I log in through a VPN</h2>
                    <p>On my Windows 7 64-bit Professional, SP1 system, both Auto Arrange and Align to Grid are unchecked.&nbsp; And I don't have problems with icons on a reboot.&nbsp; I have problems when I access my system from my home using a VPN and RDC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes when I log in I find that most of my desktop shortcut icons have disappeared and the few remaining ones are rearranged.&nbsp; It doesn't happen every time and I haven't figured out a common denominator as to when it occurs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I copied all of my desktop shortcuts to a folder on a different drive so I can put them all back after they disappear, but when I copy and paste them to the desktop, they don't go back into the same spots they were in before.&nbsp; Instead, they are aligned to
 the grid starting at the top left and going down, then creating more columns until all the icons have been pasted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I have to manually drag and drop them to where I want them to be.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Like others who have asked about desktop icons, when I right click on the desktop I do not get a ''properties'' link as indicated.&nbsp; I get<em> View, Sort by, Refresh, Paste &amp; Paste Shortcut, Undo Delete, New, Screen Resolution, Gadgets, and Personalize.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried another solution which said "<strong>Right click</strong> an empty space on your
<strong>desktop</strong> and <strong>highlight desktop icons</strong>".&nbsp; When I right click, I get the menu described in the above paragraph.&nbsp; Then when I start clicking the icons to highlight them, the menu disappears.&nbsp; If I highlight all the icons first and
 then right-click on the desktop, the menu appears and the highlighting disappears.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can lock the desktop icons?&nbsp; I agree with the contributor who requested a setting for "Don't mess with my desktop EVER".</p>
<p>

    <title>Getting BSOD while playing game Skyrim. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kingcoleman23  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting BSOD while playing game Skyrim.</h2>
                    I know this BSOD spree is somehow related to one of or all of these programs: Skyrim, Nexus Mod Manager, LOOT and/or SKSE Loader or also possibly a mod for Skyrim. I have had this same problem before and when I just got rid of the game and all the other
 stuff with it, the problem stopped. I don't want to stop playing the game but I know there must be a reasonable way to fix this.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community. I understand that you are getting BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) while playing game&nbsp;Skyrim. I will surely help you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To understand the issue better, let me know what is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue could have occurred due to these reasons:</p>
<p>1. Corrupt graphics driver.</p>
<p>2. Conflict between third party applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
I suggest you to download and install latest graphics driver from the computer manufacturer website and check if it helps.
<span>If Windows&nbsp;10 drivers are not available, I would suggest you to install latest display driver in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To install the
</span></strong><strong><span>display </span></strong><strong><span>driver

<strong>Download </strong>the latest </span><span>display
</span><span>driver&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">from the manufacturer’s website and save it on your local disk.
<br />
b. <strong>Right-click </strong>on the setup file of the driver and select “<strong>Properties</strong>”.<br />
c. Select “<strong>Compatibility</strong>” Tab. <br />
d. Place a <strong>check mark </strong>next to “<strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong>” and
<strong>select latest Windows version</strong>&nbsp;from the drop down list. <br />
e. Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
If the issue persists, </span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I suggest you to install the game in a clean boot state and check if the issue persists.

<h2>            Kinect on original xbox one keeps disconnecting, only reboot fixes it for 1-2 days</h2>
                    <p>I've got an original Xbox One with the Kinect that came in the box. Recently my Kinect started disconnecting after 1-2 days (light goes off, system says nothing is connected).</p><p>I've tried hard resets, checked the Kinect cable, checked the port for dust, everything seems fine.</p><p>I used to be on xbox one preview but now I'm on RTM, both channels had the issue, only fix is to do a full reboot but that fixes it for 2 days tops.</p><p>Anyone else seeing this or knows how to fix it?</p><p><br /></p><p>thanks!</p>

<h2>            ServiceHost UniStack Service Group  - &#63;&#63;&#63;Services&#58; 1122a6 &#38; are they related to Update Failures&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm running a 2 year old Acer Aspire ZC-700G. Preinstalled with Windows 10 (current v1607 &amp; still trying to upgrade...)</p>
<p>OS Build: 14393.1198&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;64-Bit OS X64-based processor. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a confusing, 2ish &nbsp;part question/issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st: My system runs real high on the "Service Host" applications too. </p>
<p>But, recently, it's mega increased and 4 of them are from something ending in "1122a6".</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look online there is absolutely Nothing&nbsp;on them, &nbsp;which has me concerned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I've been fighting for nearly a full month trying to get my system to stop cycling through (and failing) continuously.
</p>
<p>With system auto cycling 4-6 times every day since the Updates hit my system in December.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following what I've learned on here I've tried several "solutions" to fix the installation errors including,&nbsp;to disable my AV which didn't help it install.&nbsp; Neither did&nbsp;any of the 3 variants of deleting/renaming the Windows update&nbsp;files and stopping and
 re-starting files through Admin Command Prompt (I followed them to the dot. Even cut and pasted each entry to be sure they were exactly like they were posted to other users on&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>I've tried them all. But, now I'm starting to get concerned with how much my system is starting to run (per Task Manager)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that my system is getting hungrier and hungrier, currently I'm running 10 "Service Host" instances at this very moment (with a total of 43 services just to Service Host. (see complete list further below...) and there were 5 more running earlier
 today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ones I'm most wondering about are the following 4:</p>
<p>&nbsp; 1) CONTACT&nbsp; DATA_1122a6</p>
<p>&nbsp; 2) SYNC HOST_1122a6</p>
<p>&nbsp; 3) USER DATA ACCESS_1122a6</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;4) USER DATA STORAGE_1122a6</p>
<p>I can't figure out who these belong to. There is nothing to say if they're Microsoft files and since likely not... Who do they come from and why? And, Why not put this information on them unless hiding something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, &nbsp;Concerning because, looking through my Boot logs this morning&nbsp;I see 4 entries that I can't figure out... They look something like this:</p>
<p>BOOT LOAD:ED:</p>
<p>BOOT LOAD:ED:</p>
<p>BOOT LOAD:ED:</p>
<p>BOOT LOAD:ED:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm aware these UniStack Services can affect contact/people/email information, but, I need to be sure, exactly.
</p>
<p>I was left without security while trying to get another set of Windows Update downloaded "again"</p>
<p>They do not say Microsoft (or any other Companies name) anywhere I have looked and there's nothing online that I can find.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have I just made things worse by trying to get the Windows to update and disabling AV/Defender?
</p>
<p>I had made some baby steps&nbsp;after disabling them and removing the update files and net stopping and re starting the specified drivers using my Admin Command Prompt (followed 3 different versions from this site &amp; followed them&nbsp;to the letter)
</p>
<p>My system did seem to go a few percent further yesterday,.</p>
<p>But, today...</p>
<p>It seems the Service Host is growing with each reboot. A few days ago, I'm sure I only had half as many running.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Now, between the current 10 instances of Service Host&nbsp;(43 combined total) just for Service Host, &nbsp;"Plus" everything else
</p>
<p>(Also Listed below...) My systems in continual overload and this last attempt to download &amp; update has been in the process since this morning.&nbsp;&nbsp; Way too long.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know anything about these services ending in 1122a6 and does anyone know if they might be responsible for my system getting such a huge appetite and or the 4 Boot Loaded items that are invisible? &nbsp;Any thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a complete loss. Have tried Everything that's been suggested on here to get this update to go through and now, I'm seemingly worse off compared to a month ago with this heavy load running now too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: the following list is what's left running after I've ended the auto loading ones that have been repeatedly disabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ie: google update( x2), HP Helper, Search and&nbsp;Click to Run MS Office)</p>

<p>I forgot to mention...&nbsp; I noticed that Microsoft Edge has been running all day even though I have not used it
</p>
<p>(&amp; I never use it. I Don't like it...) However it does&nbsp;NOT show up in what's&nbsp;running per my&nbsp;TaskMgr List.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does however, show it's been running in my TaskMsgr's "App History"&nbsp;Tab. And it's been running all day</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I don't know what else is running &amp; hiding from me. I have it set so ONLY Internet Explorer 11 is the ONLY one that's supposed to run. So much for me owning my own computer since it&nbsp;Windows went to v10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its causing so much hassle (because of the brain frazzle... ) but, also,&nbsp;we're 100%&nbsp;solar here &amp; have been diverting everything these last weeks to keeping power to the computer so it doesn't shut off in the middle again because it's continuously starting
 all over, every time it fails (even after it's been disabled not only by me but by the last support tech I was on with...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's going to sound strange, but I'm sure this things come alive. (Kidding..., but, Geesh...)</p>

<p>Hi Momma Bear,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Svchost.exe</strong> is a generic host process name for services that run from dynamic-link libraries. The
<strong>Unistack Service Group </strong>consists of at least 3-4 operating services:
<strong>User Data Storage</strong>, <strong>User Data Access</strong>,<strong> Contact Data</strong>, and
<strong>Sync Host</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When one service in a service host fails, all services in the service host fail. In other words, the service host process is terminated resulting in termination of all running services within that process. Individual service failure actions are then run.
 As you may have noticed in <strong>Task Manager </strong>before, service hosts can contain a lot of services.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Services are organized into logical groups that are all somewhat related, and then a single Service Host instance is created to host each group. For example, one Service Host process runs the three services related to the firewall. Another Service Host process
 might run all the services related to the user interface, and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, it is not bad having too many Service Host processes showing in the<strong> Task Manager</strong>. The number of
<strong>Service Host</strong> process running in your <strong>Task Manager</strong> depends on the number of applications, programs, and services that are running or working on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Too many Service Host process running on your PC is not related to the Windows update installation failure. to isolate the issue with your Windows Update issue, we would like to ask the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you encountered any error messages?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you run the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update Troubleshooter</a></strong>. After running the troubleshooter, try
 running the Windows Update again and install any available updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have other concerns.</p>

<p>Thyank you. Good to know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have been using the rouble shooter everyd day for over a week now.</p>
<p>It says it fixed everything but if I run it again, (back to back) it gets the "same issues" fixed again, and again, and again..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had been running troubleshooter, then Windows update, after a couple hours it'd fail again, so I started running troubleshooter &amp; rebooting inbetween attempts to update.&nbsp; Nothing has fixed the issue, however, I noticed a ltiile bit ago, some things a just
 "slightly different" than theyt were a few huors ago, (WIndows Explorer...) I'm assuming this means it's gotten a lttle further yet again...?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still curious though (1 OF 2)</p>
<p>Does this mean that the 4 services ending in 1122a6 are safe?</p>
<p>and (2 of 2)</p>
<p>The issue is, I've been disabling services left &amp; right so my updating can move along, "without other apps auto running &amp;taking up resources because</p>
<p>like I'd mentioned earlier, I have twice as many services tying up my system resources now thank I did a few weeks ago when I was actually using programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm of the belief that It being My Computer, I should have a say in what it runs and when, but now
 I have none.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>We are a&nbsp;solar home and I can't keep diverting nightly resources to this pc every night just to keep it from shutting down in&nbsp;the middle of some unexpected update or something (and lately, just to get through this 1 long **** update that Windows threw out
 which it also seems... A rather large portion of Windows users are having issues with too but reading the endless pages of requests for help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone and&nbsp;set the times specified for it to be able to do it's thing... but,,&nbsp;when it comes to being a 1st year solar powered home, we're still figuring things out and I can't put a definite time on things like that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wanting to know why so much is running with out me running it and if I can start disabling or closing some if not most of these apps and or services so I can get some of my resources back for me to be abele to use my pc once again...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computers been hovering in a near constant, yo yo, state bouncing in and out of "The&nbsp; Red" and maxed out because of all of these services etc.</p>
<p>It's nearly 40 min for everything to finish loading every time I go to use my pc. Then I spend another 20 min closing out everything I know to be safe... I want to be able to have control of my computer once again, Not it controlling me.
</p>
<p>"If Momma cant use her own computer, aint no one, (or NO Thing) going&nbsp;&nbsp;to use it either... (ha, ha...)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions as to what I can disable or at least close as needed and also..., &nbsp;just to from my previous question...</p>
<p>
</p><p>re: the services that end in 1122a6, they're safe even though they're hiding what they're loading?</p>
<p>

<p>The numbers that is attached in the end of each services that runs in the Task Manager depends on the components that your OS needs to run. That being said, it isn't harmful. Also, forcing to stop a service could make some errors on your PC. So, it is not
 advisable to stop a service from running.</p>

    <title>Shutdown issue with Windows Task Host - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> f1shb0x  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shutdown issue with Windows Task Host</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,<br />
<br />
i thought the well known Shutdown issue with Windows Task Host was supposed to be fixed with win 7 SP 1 ?<br />
Sadly, 2 days ago it appeared again.<br />
<br />
I have all win updates installed. Im running win 7 ult x64.<br />
<br />
The strange thing is, whenever the task-host bug appears, i cannot shutdown windows at all now.<br />
Even when i force windows to shut-down, i get to the "logging off" screen, but thats it - windows will never shutdown.<br />
<br />
If i wait for task-host window to shutdown, same thing, it will never ever close.<br />
<br />
The only solution for me now, before i shutdown windows, i kill the "Taskhost.exe", and then shutdown.<br />
<br />
I checked comp for viruses too, no finds. AV software, is latest Bullguard IS.<br />
<br />
Last apps i installed where:&nbsp;&nbsp; Java 7 latest update version and latest NVidia GFX drivers.<br />
<br />
Whats worse. if i forget to kill taskhost, and the hanging taskhost on shutdown issue occurs, i cant even press the "Cancel" button - nothing happens if i press it....
<br />
<br />
Very strange issue.</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hello, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I understand that you have issues with the Task Host while shutting down the PC.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But, I would need some more information on this issue to help you better.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div><br />
2. What is the exact error message that you receive?<br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>TASKHOST is a generic process which acts as a host for processes that run from DLLs rather than EXEs.</div>
<div><br />
So, please follow the suggestions mentioned below to fix the issue.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: </strong>Firstly, try to follow the link below to get the hotfix installed for this particular issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>There is a delay when you shut down, restart, or log off a computer that is running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2</strong></div>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/975777/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/975777/en-us</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>Method 2: </strong>If the above doesn't help then, I would suggest you to try booting the computer in safemode and them try shutting down the computer. If the comuter shuts down in safemode, proceed with clean boot
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Start your computer in safe mode</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you don't get the error message in safe mode then, perform a clean boot and check because, clean boot will check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.<br />

<p>So what is the ideal upload and download speed for gaming, so that lagging and disconnects are at a minimal level and the registrations of hits is the quickest, on xbox live? &nbsp;</p>
<p>As i understand it Upload speed has to with the ability to host games etc, what else does Upload speed control in the game. How much does the Download speed affect the game and in what areas.</p>
<p>I have long been suffering from 1-2mps upload speed from my ISP and it is very apparent in my MP gameplay and so i need to know what is the ideal upload/download speed for gaming ...................... &nbsp;</p>

<p>I would suggest at least 1 and 1 for optimal performance. I have 4 systems and they can all connect at the same time without any lag, but I have a 30/10 line in my house. You also will want to take into consideration any PCs you have running while they are
 on also if your console is wireless this will effect the speeds too.</p>
<p>One other thing you can try is rebooting your modem/router this will sometimes fix lag issues.</p>

<p>If you have upload speed in the 1-2 Mbps (megabits per second) range, you've got a GREAT upload speed.</p>
<p>Download (or downstream) speed is how fast data gets TO you.</p>
<p>Upload (or upstream) speed is how fast data gets AWAY from you (how fast you send data out).</p>
<p>Most folks have between 0.5 and 2.0 Mbps upload, and have anywhere from 2 to 50 Mbps download. As long as you have at least 5/1 (5 Mbps down, 1 Mbps up) you'll be fine.
</p>
<p>That's not the whole picture, though. If someone else you're playing with has slower internet, they can't send the data as quick - so it doesn't matter how fast YOU are, the game is limited by the slowest person.
</p>
<p>Example: Let's say you drive a Ferrari (=very fast internet). If your friend is coming over to visit, and he only has a bicycle (=slow internet), your Ferrari isn't going to make him get to your house any faster.</p>
<p>The other thing to watch is called Latency. It's the delay between when data is sent and when it is received. Most folks have a "round trip time" (time for a request to get from you, to the other end, and back) in the 50-70 ms (milliseconds; 1/1000th second)
 range. If you live far away from the data center of your ISP, it can go up to 90 ms or more. 100 ms is 1/10th of a second, so that's a noticeable delay. If you have fast internet and live close to the data center, it can be as low as 30 ms or less.</p>
<p>So really, there's not too much you can do - as it depends on the speed of the internet of ALL the people playing. Sometimes you'll be the fast one, sometimes you'll be the slow one. :(
</p>
<p>Getting a faster connection CAN help latency, and can give you an advantage - but for the cost, it's normally not worth it. Doubling your internet connection speed may cost $30-$50 more per month, and may help your win/loss ratio by about 10% - so if you
 were winning 0.5% of the time, you'd go up to winning 0.55% of the time.</p>
<p>I hope that helps clear things up! My connection is 17/0.75, and my ping (the measurement of latency) is in the 60 ms range. I've never had an issue with my connection being the reason I lose. If you've got more upload and similar ping, I'd say you're in
 really good shape.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Most email providers have on-line instructions for setting up Windows Mail. Your provider is whatever is
<br />
after the @ of your email address. So if your address ends in @domail.net your provider would be
<br />
domain.net. For most the email provider is also their ISP.<br />

<br />
You can set it up as a POP client and&nbsp;it absolutely does work now that Hotmail has POP3 service, many still
<br />
think Windows Mail will not support the HTML client which is true however POP3 access is better anyway.<br />
<br />
All these sites tell you how to do it as does the one above :<br />

 at the same time...... On idle dwm.exe uses 2-5% intel with ups and downs sometimes goes to 0....Currently viewed all the forms related to this topic with no solution...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things i have tried:</p>
<p>1- set dwm priority to low</p>
<p>2- turned off scaling for apps</p>
<p>3- installed nvidia drivers again manually and also from geforce experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4- laptop came with window 1803...updated to 1809 same problem..... Then tried 1709 worked well game used 100% intel hd 630 in game and no dwm problem in that version but nvidia drivers does not support that version for my laptop..... I have came to realize
 that the problem is in 1803 and 1809 but myn laptop only supports these versions..... I'm stuck plz help.</p>
<p>5-played with nividia control panel with no solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6-And tried number of options availabe on different forms with no solution.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Hasnat,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In Windows, desktop composition is performed by Desktop Windows Manager. The way applications display pixels on the screen, it is managed by DWM. When desktop composition is enabled, individual windows no longer draw directly to the screen or primary
 display device as they did in previous versions of Windows. Instead, their drawing is redirected to off-screen surfaces in video memory, which are then rendered into a desktop image and presented on the display.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The GPU (NVidia) usage of 35-40% by games is absolutely normal, however at the same time Desktop Windows Manager is using the high percentage of Intel GPU, which isn’t normal and it might be the cause of the low FPS.</span></p>
<p>

<p>- There is nothing inherent in v1803 or 1809 that would cause this issue. Particularly with a new machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"installed nvidia drivers again manually and also from geforce experience. "</em></p>
<p>- Are you back to the ASUS driver ? This <em>should</em> be the most suitable option. The driver from ASUS is likely to</p>
<p>have some modifications to suit their machine.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Have you updated the rest of the drivers</span> and BIOS ?</p>

</p><p><em>"and the dwm.exe is using 40% intel integrated graphics at the same time......"</em></p>
<p>- I don't have a laptop, but I wonder if this sort of thing can happen if you have

<p>Do you have another software running that may be using your Intel graphics when you launch a game ?

            Latest Asus provided drivers are 417.77 and the Geforce updates to 419.35....i have upgraded and degraded multiple times but the issue remains.....Also i have not taken chance with bios update since an update to bios is available for my machine that will
 be the last thing to try since i have never done that.... There is no game mode the only software asus provides is asus aura which only gives access to fan speed..... I have check through intel extreme tuning there is no power throttling.... This is new machine
 and i have just installed 2 games and basic drives require to run and nothing else.&nbsp;

<p>I will follow the steps and see if disabling intel helps and inform you.... I also own dell inspiron 7567 with Gtx 1050 4gb and msi ge63 raider 8rf with Gtx 1070 8gb.....their Gpu usage during game are 95-99% and 85-90% respectively. Both running windows
 10 1709....In my knowledge the amount of GPU usage is bound to the FPS limit which is set... Setting FPS to unlimited causes max gpu usage as it reaches its limit... I have tested it in other machines as well...7567 when set to unlimited provides 160FPS in
 lobby in Fortnite on Low settings with 98% gpu usage... Asus with rtx 2070 is also providing 160FPS in lobby same game same settings which decreases to 100 ingame. Nividia control panel is set to prefer max performance..... No power throttling found in graphics
 stress test... No thermal throttling as well.... RTX 2070 should provide 250+ FPS on low settings based on what is advertised....Any other option for GPU max performance??</p>

<h2>            Giving computer to sister</h2>
                    I am giving my computer to my sister.&nbsp; I have deleted all my personal files.&nbsp; I added her as an Administrator.&nbsp; When I log in under her name I cannot see any of the programs or files that I left for her (photos, music, Office 2010, etc.).&nbsp; How can I, short
 of just letting her log in under my name, allow her access to these program/files or how can I merge the two accounts.&nbsp; Thank you for any assistance.&nbsp; Windows 10 is the operating system.

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
The most up to date information in regards to the Halo 4 Specialization's promotion can be found
<strong><a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/2505/t/402925.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
As far as e-mails being re-sent, that would be a no. If the message was deleted, it's unlikely you'll be able to get it re-sent unless Microsoft re-sends them automatically. You'd essentially need to wait until these specializations are unlocked to everyone
 that purchased the standard edition copy of this game.</p>

<p>So then there is nothing that can be done? There isn't a way to have Microsoft resend the email? If so, what are the steps I need to take?</p>

<p>There aren't any ways for forum support agents to resend the e-mail, or the message if you've already deleted it. It's an automated list message, so if it was sent once it's possible it might be sent again. If not, you might need to wait until these specializations
 are opened up to other people in the coming months.</p>

<p>Shoot, I guess I have to wait for a few months. &nbsp;Thank you Hassassinade.</p>

<p>Microsoft should be able to resend codes to everyone this is ridiculous. Also sending people to the sticky is not really helping anyone.It is just a way to push everyone under rug and make them leave.</p>
