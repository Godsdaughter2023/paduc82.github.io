            <p>If you used to be able to just press the F1 &amp; F12 keys to get their functionality, then go into your BIOS, there is usually a Fn key Emulation setting that can be set to enabled so you do not have to press the Fn key.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise some systems require the pressing of the Fn (Function) key to get the functionality of these keys . . .</p>

    <title>6 Complaints About Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anna de panna  say:</h3>
<h2>            6 Complaints About Windows 8</h2>
                    Dear Microsoft, <br />
<br />
since ages I have been using your system as a happy client. But since a week I have a new laptop with Windows 8, and my trust in Microsoft has fallen deep down. There are several things I don't like about the new version, of which I would like to give you feedback.
 If Microsoft is doing something with it, I am willing to hang on a little longer with Microsoft.
<br />
<br />
- My first complaint is the fact that when you open the apps, they are on your whole screen and you don't have any tools to make them smaller, minimize them or exit them. It proofs that the apps are made for tablets and phones, but not for PC's. And there is
 the problem. I bought a PC to get a PC. Now I have apps (which is basicly fine with me), but PLEASE let me have control over these apps!!
<br />
<br />
- Second complaint: Microsoft doesn't give me any opt-out NOT to connect all my different accounts to one. There are people who don't want that!! Give them their autonomy! It's already the case that FBI and CIA can watch every step I take online, but now any
 stupid citizen can do this as well. <br />
<br />
- Third complaint: I have to do a procedure of 5 steps (5 steps!!!) to shut my computer down. 5 steps!!! Who has designed this?? Just give me a buttom at the toolbar so I can do it in 1 step!
<br />
<br />
- Fourth complaint: I have nothing against these apps. The idea is good. But please don't create a useless extra startpage for it! I want to place those apps-shortcuts on my desktop, so I have my overview. There is absolutely no extra value in having them on
 an extra page, except that it costs me twice as much time to go where a wan to go on my PC. You can ofcourse maintain this idea of extra page for the tablets, for which this program is much beter suited. But NEVER adapt a PC to a tablet! We want smaller devices
 to be able to do more; not bigger devices be reduced to less. <br />
<br />
- Fifth complaint: Microsoft doesn't give me any choice which program I want to download or use documents of which the appropriate program is not yet installed. Instead, Windows Store opens immediately and gives me an app. I didn't ask for that!! You force
 me to use it. Then, the app absorbs the whole screen. I can't do anything next to it, since there are no buttons with which I can make the document smaller, minimize it to the toolbar or exit it. The only way to go out, is to push on the "Start-button" on
 my keyboard. This is so bad, and unthoughtful and stupid and just bad quality...<br />
<br />
- Sixth complaint: Why can't the apps be displayed on the desktop and performed on that screen? WHY on earth do we need a second screen?? It's the cause of chaos. I want to see which programs are running on my toolbar. I only need one screen to see my programs
 AND apps. Don't make it complexer than necessary!<br />
<br />
Overall I conclude that Microsoft is thinking in many ways for me, and pushes me in certain directions in which I DON'T want to go! How difficult is it to give the user some in autonomy in how to use their computer, and how to order their desktop? Microsoft
 is trying to get control over its clients by forcing them to give more and more information of themselves. Instead, you are loosing many many clients in this way.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance. I truly hope windows 8 will become better. Otherwise I will stop with Microsoft.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
<br />
Anna<br />

            <p>Dear Anna it seems like you have not given your self sometime to learn about windows 8. I suggest that you go and watch some videos on YouTube. Then perhaps come back here and see whether you are still suffering from these problems or not.
<br />
This is a good one for a start:</p>

            I agree with every one of your complaints. I can add one more. There is no way to re-start the computer once it goes to the sleep mode. I can only force the shut down and start it again.

            How Come? If I put mine into sleep I can open it again and resume everything. I used to have a problem resuming games with windows 7. Now with windows 8 its part of the past. If your PC have a problem it doesn't mean that you can put on windows. Please
 let me know of your PC model and maybe I can advise you on this.

            Even worse, when it goes into SAFE MODE, I had to do the task of REFRESHING, which entailed the whole computer to scan to Refreshing and return to the beginning of time, when I first started up my computer OUT OF THE cardboard box!&nbsp; :/

            Good!! you save me a lot of comment to do Anna; this is all happening to me too. My firts experience with pc was with windows 98, 2000, Xp (the Best!), Vista (worst till now), W7, but windows 8? all you say is true and when I got in to all the other windows
 Os I didn't have to go to YOUTUBE to take training, they were so friendly to use. And a other detail to go to accesories or any command like disk disfragment, disk clean up, system tools...where are they. I only have two days with this pc and I believe the
 ones who disegn it were some show of tecno kids . AND THIS IS NOT A TABLET OR SMARTPHOEN PLEASE! Make look like a PC!

 to dumb for you to realize common people don’t want junky Operating Systems on their brand new or old computers. You people at Microsoft are the worlds dumbest people the world has ever seen. Bill Gates needs his !@@ right back in Microsoft putting order and
 smart people back in the company. When I buy a new computer. That computer becomes my own personal property, that is very user friendly and very easy to operate in every way shape and form. I don’t give a !@#$ what improvements you think you made to your so
 called Windows 8. Because Windows died after windows Xp. For a fact Windows 98 was the best Microsoft ever produced. What the world and corporations and most importantly the computer companies like, Dell and Hp and the others need to do is refuse to install
 or buy any of Microsoft’s garbage. The fact that you stop supporting Windows 93 through Xp. Is very wrong of Microsoft. Just because Microsoft can afford to keep upgrading doesn’t mean the rest of the world can or even wants to. I love hang onto my old Dell
 with Windows 98 SE on it and this computer I am typing this to your sorry !@@ on I will keep till I die. Which has Windows Xp Pro installed on it. Which come April 14<sup>th</sup> of 2014 you idiots are going to stop supporting is so wrong of you. If I was
 in any part of the United State Government, I would be looking for every way possible to SHUT MICROSOFT DOWN FOR GOOD!!!! The only reason why you updated Windows 8 to 8.1 is the fact people are not buying new computer with your !@#$ installed on it. The only
 computer I will ever buy is this computer I am on right now with the wonderful WINDOWS XP PRO factory installed on it. Words of advice from the common wise one. Start thinking like a common person and not some smart !@@ on the block. And make sure all your
 damn support team is ENGISH SPEAKING. I like understanding very clearly what is being said to me and not a bunch of gibberish. Who knows where I will be tomorrow, for it could very well be in the United States Government. The best thing that could happen is
 a group of down to earth wise ones will come up with an Operating Systems that everyone will want on their new or old computes and put Microsoft out of business once and for all. You don’t deserve to be in business at all for all Microsoft truly cares about
 is the fast buck!! That is my story and I am sticking to it.</span></font></p>

            <p>Windows 8.1 is the absolute worst OS i have used. Those damn charms are annoying and the date and time popping up is annoying also. How do you get rid of this totally.
</p>
<p>I don't believe there was much thought that went into this OS. Microsoft really dropped the ball on this one. Try hiring developers who understand the average persons needs.
</p>
<p>I ceratinly would not reccomend this system to anyone.&nbsp; Next computer I will go to Apple.

            <p>Hi Anna, I'll try to&nbsp;help you with&nbsp;your questions one by one,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- You can make apps smaller, just grab them from the top and move them to the side. Then they will occupy part of the screen and you can have both of them running at once. This is even more flexible in Windows 8.1.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- You don't have to connect all of your apps in one account. You can switch to a local account and then sign-in to each app separately. In Windows 8 open the PC Settings app, go to Users and then click "switch to a local account" or in Windows 8.1 at PC
 Setting go to Accounts &gt; Your Account and click "Disconnect". </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- I know, it could have been easier to shut down. Although, if you are on a desktop you can just hit the power button and your PC will shut down normally. If you are on a laptop and you hit the power button, your PC will go to sleep. You can change that
 from the Power Options in Control Panel clicking the link "Choose what power buttons do". If you upgrade to Windows 8.1 there is a second way to shutdown, just by right clicking on the new (or let's say restored) start button and then navigating to "shut down".
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- I think if you organize in a nice way the start screen it can be really convenient. Just think of it as a full screen start menu. You can put each program in a separate category, such as "internet", "media", "office"&nbsp;etc. - this way you can&nbsp;find what you
 want fast and easy. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- You can use the settings in Control Panel to associate files with programs. Go to the desktop, open the Charms bar, click Setting, then Control Panel and navigate to Programs &gt; Default Programs. Then select "set your default programs" or "associate a file
 or protocol with a program". </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- In a way, Windows 8 is kind of chaotic, but you can make it work in a&nbsp;better way. I think this is because Windows 8 is a transitive operating system and Microsoft hasn't completed the&nbsp;modern&nbsp;interface experience in a way&nbsp;it could work 100%.&nbsp;What I've done,
 is ignore completely all modern apps and use Windows 8.1 as I would use Windows 7. You can do this by&nbsp;setting from the control panel all desktop apps as default. This way, when you open a document, movie or photo you will remain at the desktop without changing
 interfaces. You can also unpin or uninstall all modern apps from the Start screen and just place there the desktop programs in categories, as I described earlier. Additionally, in Windows 8.1 there is an option to boot directly to desktop&nbsp;skipping the start
 screen. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>John</p>

    <title>AMD Drivers crashing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> undershotbutton  say:</h3>
<h2>            AMD Drivers crashing</h2>
                    <p>I have AMD Radeon HD 5670 grapchics card and a few weeks later I played some CS:GO and my screen went off and said "No input. Going to sleep mode" I was surprised. It was just black and my headphones were playing same sound over and over like it was buggy
 or something. Now I have been watching my GPU with MSI Afterburner. Temperature in idle is ~57 celsius and when I start playing something on medium grpachics and windowed mode, GPU usage jumps from 5~18 to around 90 percent and temperature rise up to 80 celsius.
 Now I just did the windowed mode play in Red Crucible Firestorm game. In fullscreen my drivers don't even restart. Screen just goes black. In windowed it goes black and restarts and says (roughly self-translated from Finnish) "AMD Drivers crashed and restarted."
 So it has been crashing all the time but not restarting when in fullscreen game. I tried also in Planetside 2, CS:GO, Dead Island Riptide. It is very old graphics card (2010) and I don't want to really buy new because I have been saving for new processor.
 I wish I could fix this. I have read from other threads and people say it is thermal paste problem or driver but all of them are these newer generation Graphics cards. I don't know about opening the computer to see whats inside. I have never cleaned the fans
 or opened it because I am scared it would break from static electricity. My specs are:</p>
<p>Intel i3 CPU</p>
<p>AMD Radeon HD 5670</p>
<p>Windows 7 Home premium 64bit</p>
<p>4gt ram</p>

<p>If the machine has started running at higher temps than it used to new thermal paste may help, but ...</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>" I have never cleaned the fans or opened it because I am scared it would break from static electricity."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing your temps are a bit higher than desirable because of dust.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Static electricity is over hyped.&nbsp; Don't worry about it too much.&nbsp; Components are shipped in anti-static bags because there is no knowing if a shipment may be subject to electrical charges.</p>
<p>It's not a good idea to use a vacuum cleaner as they are said to create static, but working</p>
<p>on a PC at home is safe enough.</p>
<p>Just unplug the machine and wait until the LED on the motherboard goes out, or 30 sec
</p>
<p>if there is no light (If you have speakers on they should 'pop' when it is safe to work).
</p>
<p>Touch an unpainted part of the case to create electrical continuity between body and machine
</p>
<p>and get into it.<br />
Exercise due care, and remove the graphics card and RAM (I remove the RAM because dust can</p>
<p>get into the slots if you bump them when dusting, which creates a bad connection).</p>
<p>Do not touch the copper terminal strips .</p>
<p>Brush out the case, filters on the fans, (the PCIe slot and&nbsp; RAM slots last) with a soft brush&nbsp;(or use canned compressed air) , and clean the heat-sink on the graphics card before reseating it.
</p>
<p>If the temps don't drop, try applying new thermal paste (after doing a search for a tutorial&nbsp; ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- There are many other potential sources of your problem, which sounds like&nbsp; TDR errors.</p>
<p>If you are using a recent driver, I would be inclined to install an older driver.
</p>
<p>Recent drivers would have little or nothing in the way of optimisations for an HD5000 series card, and it may run better on an older version.
</p>
<p>See how you go with version 12.1.</p>

<p>
</p><p>TDR can be caused by a corrupt driver, so a 'clean' driver install may help.</p>
<p>After uninstalling the AMD drivers and CCC, reboot and run <em>Driver Fusion</em>.
</p>
<p>Driver Fusion will 'clean' any remaining AMD graphics driver files and registry entries.</p>
<p>Reboot again before installing the 'new' drivers.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>That should sort out any possible driver issues, so you can move on to...</p>
<p>Hardware:<br />
- RAM. Run&nbsp; <em>memtest</em> to verify the RAM is not producing errors<br />
- HDD. Run&nbsp; <em>chkdsk</em> to test the HDD for errors<br />
- Inadequate or ageing power supply&nbsp; can cause lock-ups or random re-boots.</p>
<p>- Are your BIOS settings at default, or have you changed any settings recently, especially</p>
<p>the RAM or cpu overclock ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Software...</p>
<p>- If TDR occurs when using the internet it is sometimes due to browser add-ons, or the<br />
version of the browser you are using.<br />
- Anti-Virus software, particularly AV suites that run a number of programs in the background<br />
are another possibility. Running more than one AV program in resident (always on) can also</p>
<p>cause conflicts.<br />
- Malware, Spyware or Virus are possible. Run a full boot-time scan with your AV.<br />
A virus called <em>iehighutil.dll&nbsp; </em>(not sure if it's still a problem) that come as an added bonus from some torrent downloads is one example.<br />
- System 'optimising' software is another possibility .<br />
- Games often cause TDR. Bugs, mods and in some cases using too high graphics settings.</p>
<p>- Did you install anything around the time the crashes started ?<br />
- Conflicts with other drivers can also cause TDR. One such driver comes with Daemon Tools.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also check for conflicts from<em> Startup</em> programs or Windows <em>
Services</em> by running in</p>
<p>Clean Boot -</p>

</p><p>btw - which processor are you looking at ? A cpu for a motherboard from 2010 may be
</p>
<p>difficult to source new. Particularly if it is the first of the i3's with the 1156 cpu socket.</p>

<p>the manual says for X1 it only supports the headset by the 3.5mm connector. if i'm correct.. the 3.5mm only supports stereo..</p>
<p>thabnks a lot!</p>

<p>Unfortunately the Logitech USB to headset connector adapter is not supported/recognized on the Xbox One so that means the 7.1 sound features won't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested this with my Logitech G430 USB adapter + headset which is also a 7.1 surround sound gaming headset. These headset models are intended to be used on PC's as the Logitech gaming software needs to be installed/enabled for surround sound.</p>

<h2>            Older Woman looking for Friends.</h2>
                    
<p>Just recently signed up to Xbox and still in the mist of creating my account. Would love to hear from someone, anyone roughly the same age group as myself who won't be offended by some "adult chat" ;). I hope to find friends, and I don't mean the kind that
 add you then say nothing at all. Or even those who just look to add as many people to their friends list. I'm looking for gamers who chat and play mostly all the time, no catch or anything on the side. Just people who enjoy gaming and talking all the time.
 It would also be really good to find other girl gamers.&nbsp;</p>

<br />Suggest you to run System File Checker scan:
<br />
<br />1. Search for 'command prompt' using Cortana or Windows Search.
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Command Prompt and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />3. Type sfc /scannow command and press Enter key.
<br />
<br />4. Let the command complete and then reboot the machine. 
<br />
<br />If issue still persists, perform clean boot:

<p>Just create a folder on your D drive and call it something like Windows 7 image.&nbsp; Move the Win 7 image folder into that and the Win 10 image Won't overwrite it.&nbsp; I did this on all my systems so that I had a 7 backup incase something bad happened when upgrading.</p>

            <p>What more or less prompted me to make my post was my brother installed win 10, before making the win 10 image he "hid" his win 7 image, the same as you did. somewhere along the way he needed to restore the win 10 image and it failed with a boot record error,
 he then tried to reboot normal and it failed with same error, so there he sat, can't reboot normal and can't restore image. At this point he tried to restore the win 7 image and it also failed with the same error, at this point confusion really set in because
 the win 7 image was supposed to reformat the C: drv. to the same format 7 had when the image was made.&nbsp; He then put his C drv. into another computer and reformatted it then put it back into his main machine and tried the win 7 image again and again it failed
 with the Boot record error ,,,,,,,, we now have 2 big questions here, 1. why could he not wipe the old boot record off that disk with a reformat, &amp; 2. why did the win 7 image not restore the boot record it had when the image was made.</p>
<p>As a last resort he did a fresh&nbsp;installed of Win 7&nbsp;and he is now back up and running.</p>
<p>The moral to all this is all the fancy backups for both Win 7 &amp; 10 completely failed in all respects and now I am as jumpy as a cat on a hot tin roof about depending on them.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> brettbolen  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB audio playback and record device names - device enumeration, device INF file, or device driver required&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My usb audio gadget has two 'playback devices'&nbsp; and one `recording device'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works with the usbaudio.sys device driver, but I'd like to give each channel separate names.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a way in windows 7 to rename the audio device using the user interface actions ( right click, properties, etc), but I'd like to do this through usb enumeration, instead of requiring the user to do this.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>USB enumeration has an 'output terminal device', which has different classes of devices, but these don't map into different names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Is there a way to change the name of a audio playback and recording device using the usb enumeration data?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Can I do this automatically on a usb hotplug?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Will an INF file help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; Or do I need to write my own driver to rename the playback and recording devices?</p>

            <p>Gerry is highly competent but I disagree with him on this matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't bother trying to run any repairs as that just starts the whole process off from scratch again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing wrong with your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lots&nbsp;of people have reported this updating problem.&nbsp; It seems to be caused by a combination of some bug in the last two versions of Windows update itself and, possibly,&nbsp;a lack of Microsoft server capacity.</p>

            <p>As the originator of this thread, I choose Wiki's answer the one that came closest to addressing my query.&nbsp; Eventually the windows update keeps running process resorted back to its original state, which was "Check for Updates". I have chosen for automatic
 updates on a daily basis under Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before providing my response, I did run this same question by a technician at Geek Squad, which was coincidental because I was having a quarterly tuneup on my computer, and during the chat exchange, ask the question. His response was the same one that Wiki
 provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I am still somewhat curious as to why I haven't received more actual updates for my computer, which is run on Windows 7. Would it be worthwhile to contact one of the good people at Microsoft about this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to each one of you who took time out to provide advice.</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Movie Maker Crashing &#91;Solved&#93;</h2>
                    I was working on a video that I recorded using Fraps which records in .AVI. Upon finishing the video I rendered it and when it finished it came up stating that there were some files missing (I checked and there weren't). The video was rendered, though.
 I only had about 9 GB of memory left on one hard drive and it dropped from 9 to 1.27 GB. However, there was no file there. I even have hidden files/folders showing. But it couldn't possibly be saved anywhere else because when I go to click save, it opens up
 the folder in which I originally saved it. That was the first time I tried rendering it. So I freed up some space and tried rendering it again. Unfortunately, my computer crashed mid way with the "blue screen of death". I didn't think it was anything weird
 at the time, but I did notice I went down from 12 GB to 10, so it did create a video file for what it rendered (which still did not appear). That wasn't issue, though. I tried rendering it again after freeing up more space, and my co

    <title>Ipv6 &#34;No network access&#34; Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gavincpa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ipv6 &#34;No network access&#34; Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I've spent a fair share of my day dealing with this frustration on my BRAND NEW PC. I've had it for about two weeks now and this happened this morning when I woke up and tried to log on. I've tried command prompts as an administrator, troubleshooting and
 watching/reading other online posts with no luck. Heres a photo attached of a command prompt that keeps failing. When I troubleshoot for internet connections it says "one or more network protocols are missing on this computer" and it claims that it "fixed"
 them after clicking the box that says it fill fix it on its own, BUT IT DID NOT by my standards otherwise I would have my internet back. I've read that third party anti viruses may play a role but that just doesn't make sense to me on why that would interfere
 with everything and the firewall. There was another command prompt I did to reset, but it gave me the same result - having both "Resetting failed" and "Access denied." Like I said, I've tried other command prompts in regards to the Ipv6 and resetting, but
 I keep getting "Resetting failed" and "Access denied" on EVERY SINGLE ONE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does this happen and why is there no simple fix? I've come from a MAC setting and NEVER ONCE HAVE I HAD PROBLEMS LIKE THIS. If there were problems I was able to simply troubleshoot them and fix them on my own, this problem does not have ONE definitive
 answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Note: this is for both my Ethernet and WiFi*</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE 4/3/16: Spent an hour and half with tech support and conclusion reached was to reset Windows...&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Wallpaper images load oversized cutting off about 1&#34; of original photo.</h2>
                    As stated, the wallpaper images are being cut off about 1" around. The original photos are the right size 1024X768. It seems as if the photo goes from orignal size to 120%. Not sure when this changed on the computer since I don't change wallpaper that
 often , but having someones forehead cut off is somewhat annoying...Any ideas on what has changed on my system and how do I correct it?

<br />
Control Panel --&gt; Personalization, click on Desktop Background. At the bottom of the dialog are options on how the picture should be displayed. Change to one that is not oversized.

<h2>            SfB for Mac This group is too large to show and add to contacts</h2>
                    <p>SfB 2016 for Mac Version 16.17.65</p>
<p>We sync our local AD with O365, and we have a group that has about 55-60 users in it.&nbsp; When I try to add that group to SfB for Mac, it finds the group, then has a yellow triangle on the right side of it that states "This group is too large to show and add
 to contacts".&nbsp; It lets me add these groups easily on the Windows version of SfB, but even if I do that and then log back in on the SfB for Mac, it won't display the users in that group.&nbsp; Is this a bug?</p>

<p><span>As far as I know, there is a
</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/known-issues-skype-for-business-on-mac-494ac5d5-50be-4aa7-8f5a-669c71c98c9a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>known issue</span></a><span> about the limitation of distribution group that a</span><span>dding
 a distribution group that has more than 100 contacts will result to 100 contacts</span><span>. In your case, may I know if all the users aren't displayed or part of users aren't displayed? As the desciption in the above link, the workaround is
 go to Outlook to view the full member list of distribution group. Please confirm it on your side.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, can you provide us a screenshot about the error "</span><span style="font-style: italic">This group is too large to show and add to contacts</span><span>"
 for further analysis? Also, had you added this group to the Skype for Business on Mac client on any older version successfully before?

<p>Hi&nbsp;DCMarkH,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am here to follow up on this case. I thank you for your update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When going through this case, I found that you mentioned that</p>
<p>1. it gives you an notification "<span>This group is too large to show and add to contacts".</span></p>
<p><span>2. It shows no member in this group after you added this group in Windows Skype for Business.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For the above first point, I'd like to know what group you plan to add to your contacts, Office 365 Distribution Group (DG), Office 365 Group (OWA group) or any type of group. Meanwhile, if any other
 Mac user in your organization adds this group, can he add it successfully?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For the above second point, I'd like to confirm whether the members of this group on the Windows Skype for Business client can be seen. If so, my understanding is that the synchronization between the
 Windows Skype for Business and Skype for Business for Mac might have something wrong. So to further check it. please try add another contact or group on Windows Skype for Business to see if the contact or group can be synced to Skype for Business for Mac.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In my test, I can add a DG on Windows Skype for Business and it can be synced to Skype for Business for Mac. By the way, my DG is created in Office 365 not synced from local AD.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,<br />
Alan</span></p>

<p>The group that doesn't work is a synched AD group.&nbsp; It has about 55 members in it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I can search for and find member accounts who are in this group in SfB on the Mac.</p>
<p>I can search and add other groups on SfB Mac that have fewer members (also synched AD groups).</p>
<p>This group gives the same error for all of our SfB Mac users.</p>

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;DCMarkH,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your update.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To further look into this issue, I need to know what kind of this 55 members group, a DG, an OWA grouo or any type of grouu? I will also try reproducing this scenario on my side. &nbsp;In return, you may
 try creating a new group which is the same as the fewer members group and add these 55 members into the created group. After that, you can try adding it to see if that works.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, you can try adding this contact group from Outlook Skype for Business contact folder. After that, you can check if it can be synced to Skype for Business for Mac client. Note: It may take
 some time (24 hours or so) for the performance to take effect.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>We do also have this issue and had it for a few weeks.</p>
<p>I did first see it about two weeks ago when i helped a collegue to install skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that if you've added the group before the issue started you will be able to see the members and number of members in the group (on the right hand pane) but not expanding it.</p>
<p>it will also show the yellow error triangle that says its too large to show and add.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i were to try to add a new group it would either not allow me to add the group or actually once in a while allow me to add it but show up as no members and the yellow triangle showing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works with groups up to atleast 24 members though. (atleast for us)</p>

<p>
</p><p>This group is synced to 0365 from our local AD.&nbsp; It has worked up until recently, which is why I'm wondering if some SfB update introduced a new bug.&nbsp; Smaller groups like this one that have 10-15 users in them can be added to SfB with no issues.&nbsp; I'll try
 to create a new group and sync it and see what happens.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your update.&nbsp;</span></p>

</p><p><span>You may also try adding the contact group via the method I mentioned in the last reply (from Outlook Skype for Business contact folder). Definitely, you are welcome to share the update with us with

<p>@Bolon AB, we thanks for your reporting this issue. Please be noted that the same issue/scenario can be caused by different factors. As a result, I suggest you post a new thread in our forum
 so that we can avoid confusion here and our engineer can better help you. Appreciation on your understanding and cooperation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So I don't have an Outlook SfB contact folder...&nbsp; I could have deleted that at some point.</p>
<p>As for the new test group, I created the group and added 19 users to it.&nbsp; I synced it with O365, and it showed up in SfB Mac about a day later.&nbsp; It let me add it to my contact list and everything worked as expected.</p>
<p>Today I added 11 more users to the group to bring it up to 30.&nbsp; I launched SfB Mac and instantly got the error again that the group is too large to show and add contacts.</p>

<h2>            Windows Audio Control Extra Box</h2>
                    <p>So when I restarted my computer that runs Windows 10 and tried to use volume controls on my keyboard, the control box changed to this.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/882a23f0-6a7c-4e70-b901-57a2e829ae14?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/882a23f0-6a7c-4e70-b901-57a2e829ae14?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Before it was only the left slider without the chrome box. Is it possible to get rid of the right box?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I also want to maintain use of the F9, F10, F11 keys to control things, like say a youtube playlist. Is it possible to maintain this control while getting rid of this box? I was able to do this before, but it now shows this box when I control audio.</p>

            Hi 12tqian 
<br />
<br />Open Chrome
<br />
<br />In the Address bar, paste this and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />chrome://flags
<br />
<br />In the resulting list, look for 'Hardware Media Key Handling'
<br />
<br />Disable that setting
<br />
<br />Restart Chrome
<br />
<br />That should remove that for you . . .

            It fixed the problem, but it worked a little too well. Before I could press the F9, F10, F11 to control my youtube playlist, but with that disabled, it no longer works. Is it possible to get rid of that box while keeping control of with the F9, F10, F11

<p>No it should not, but you should make a good copy before you begin so you can be sure and safe.&nbsp; Sometimes things go wrong, and it is critical you have a backup that is safe and separate from the computer or else you run a (very small, but very real) risk

</blockquote>
<br />
In the Calendar app you need to first create a new appointment/meeting. You can do this by swiping up from the bottom and touching "(+) New" or touching a day to create a new appointment. While creating a new appointment you need to touch/click "Show more"
 on the left hand side and you will see the "Who" text box where you can invite people. This will create a meeting request with whomever you add.

            <p>Hi,&nbsp; As instructed I ran the Repair program during which I recieved the following message
<em>' Sorry something unexpected happened and Windows Live Mail must close. Your recent changes may not&nbsp;have been saved'</em>. However the Repair went on and reported
<em>'Windows Essentials was repaired successfully'.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then did a Restart of my PC. and&nbsp;opened&nbsp;WLM&nbsp; and tried to created a new email message which failed with the original error message
<em>'A problem occurred while trying to open this message.&nbsp; A problem has occurred. Please retry'.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then tried the other&nbsp;option suggested, reconfiguring account.&nbsp; I went in the account as advised and retyped some of the options in General and Security tabbs and Applied.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I again did a Restart of my PC and opened WLM and again tried to creat a new mail which again failed with the same error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure why the Repair reported a successful repair?.&nbsp; Would the next step be to uninstall and Reinstall WLM.&nbsp; My only concern ( unknown) is will I lose my emails, contacts&nbsp;and folders&nbsp; I &nbsp;currently&nbsp;have in WLM?.&nbsp; Or are there other options?</p>

            I have now uninstalled ans reinstalled Windows Live Mail, (using Essentials). However I an still unable to create new email mesages.&nbsp; I&nbsp;recieve the original error message I reported.&nbsp; I don't understand&nbsp; why having installing new WLM hasn't&nbsp;fixed this
 problem.&nbsp; Or is the cause of the problem outside of WLM?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for trying to gather the Fiddler Trace&nbsp;logs as requested by Paul. Before we help you in gathering the logs again, I would like to give you some additional troubleshooting for the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I strongly suggest you to uninstall Windows Live Mail using the CMD line parameter. This would remove all the existing components of Live Mail on your computer, so we can freshly install it using the latest installer for Essentials. Please follow the steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">1. Please uninstall Essentials using the CMD line parameter. Please follow the steps in this
</font></span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/messenger-wlinstall/how-to-uninstall-windows-live-essentials-via-cmd/3d26c7ea-faf0-437a-88b0-c5bdd3dd31ec"><b><span style="color: rgba(0, 68, 220, 1)">link</span></b></a><span><font color="#000000">.</font></span></p>

<br />

            Hi, I&nbsp;followed the suggested cmd deletion of Essentials and WLE reinstalled, but I still have the same problem.&nbsp; I also tried setting up a new clean account on my laptop but again encountered the same problem with WLM in creating a new message .&nbsp; I think
 this is now pointing to a Windows issue?.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
