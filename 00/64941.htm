<h2>            Xbox 360 wont play games &#40;Says play DVD instead&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>So I had an xbox with a broken disc drive. &nbsp;I decided to buy one that was red ringed and try to put that disc drive into mine. The one I bought I am sure the Disc drive works, it is only 2 red rings so it starts up, plays the game then overheats. So i took
 this disc drive and put it in mine with the bad disc drive. It recognizes the drive but all it says is "Play DVD" even though it is a game.. The game is real, the xbox is not modded, what could be wrong?? Ive tried other games and no hope. It is a bare bones
 xbox no hard drive. Any ideas?</p>

<p>If your console is out of warranty, the tamper proof seal is broken, or if you interchange internal parts (in your case, the DVD drive), that is generally considered 'modified' or 'tampered with' equipment.
</p>
<p>According to the Terms of Service, Microsoft, or the voluntary Ambassador team can't offer any assistance.</p>
<p>The best solution, would be to just purchase a new slim console. It will save the hassle, give you a fresh, new warranty and ensure at least 5 years of future gaming. It does cost a bit, but will ultimately ensure peace of mind.
</p>
<p>Hope this clears things up a bit!</p>

<p>It is still considered modded. If it is not repaired by Microsoft themselves and you take it into your own hands to fix it your self by adding hardware to it, even if it is the official drive from another console you are still changing the drive that is
 mapped to your console. Your best bet is to contact xbox support and talk to them to see if they can still repair it but since you already swapped out the drives its a toss up. Might be time to wait for the new console or purchase a used one from Ebay.</p>

<h2>            Daily message limit for sending e-mails in Windows Live Mail &#40;Bell&#58; smtphm.sympatico.ca.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Daily message limit for sending e-mails</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Using Windows Live Mail on Windows 7. E-mail server is Bell (smtphm.sympatico.ca).&nbsp;
</p>
<div>* Sent about 40 messages, each about a page of simple text, NO attachments, addressed to about 10 recipients</div>
<div>* Am now blocked from sending ANY messages, not even an empty test message though am able to receive messages.</div>
<div>* Error 552 reads: "Our daily message limit was meant to stop spammers--we're sorry that it's getting in your way. You can wait a day to send your message." Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x800CCC6D.</div>
<div>* Bell confirms this is indeed the issue and determined that there is no configuration or technical problem at my end. They say it could take up to 15 or 16 hrs to expand my daily message limit.</div>
<div>* NOT nice to encounter this problem for the first time at 12:15 a.m., and with NO warning.</div>
<div>* My questions: &nbsp;For the future, I would like to know (1)-What factors determine the "daily message limit": number of messages? size of messages? number of recipients? (2)-What are the actual numbers for each? (3)-Does "daily" refer to the past 24 hours?
 Or the 24-hour period after midnight?</div>
<div>* USERS NEED TO KNOW IN ADVANCE that the limit exists, what precisely the limit(s) is/are and that they could abruptly, without warning, lose the capacity to send messages for 24 to 48 hrs.</div>
<div>
<p>Please enlighten us. &nbsp;Thank you.</p>

            Ken is there anyway to get this limit raised? I have a friend I am trying to help. She sends out the emails for her Home owners association so she needs a higher limit. They want to use a live.com account vs their ISP's email account so that they can transfer
 the account to the next person to hold this position in a year or so.&nbsp;

<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you want to help your friend to send out many emails to her Home owners association. If she want to increase the sending limit using the Outlook.com account, I suggest her to upgrade the account to
<span><font color="#000000"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/ad-free-outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">“Ad-free Outlook.com</a>”</font></span><font color="#000000"> which has higher limit than the free account.

            <p>I have not received any error messages but I have a group that I send out a weekly email to. Up until this past week I never had any problem, but last week's email was not delivered. I was never aware of limits but I did think that with 43 emails going out
 the program WLM might think I was a spammer and I may need to break up my groups but if we are limited to a specific number or size then it wouldn't work anyway.</p>
<p>Appreciate any light on this...Also is OUTLOOK &amp; WLM the same program...I am confused with all these names.</p>

            <p>Hi golfgal in 9,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me help you with your issue that when sending emails in Windows Live Mail. For us to isolate your issue, kindly verify the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Is the account configured on Live Mail a Microsoft Account or 3rd party account? If it is a Microsoft account provide it on the private message I have created.</p>
<p>-Does the issue happen when trying to&nbsp;send emails on&nbsp;your account using web browser?</p>
<p>-What connection are you using when sending emails such as Wi-Fi, etc.?</p>
<p>-What is the email size of the message you were sending?<br />
</p>
<p>Also kindly try to lessen the senders of your emails to see if issue will persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, about your concern if Outlook and Windows Live Mail is the same program. Please be informed that these two are the same mail client you used to configure your account. You may refer to this
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/wiki/oemail-osend/email-systems-differences-explained/2b2d2a39-a51b-4a15-bec8-436fe385d774">

            Good Morning Vivien in answer to your questions I believe that my WLM is 3rd party. My email provider is Comcast. I checked with them their limit is 1000 messages a day. I am no where near that. I am using IE11 and it is a WiFi&nbsp;&nbsp;connection. The message
 size was 9kb. well within limits. Yesterday I took the time to divide my group into 2 parts.&nbsp; I resent the email from last week that my members told me they did not get and it went through, BUT this morning when I attempted to use my two new groups to send
 the email message I got an error reading that said I had to put a name with an address into either the CC or BC box. Now this is something new.....What is going on here....

<p>Just to hammer this home: Windows Live Mail imposes <strong>no restrictions</strong> on the number of messages sent. Any limit is set by the Email Service Provider (ESP) or, in some cases, by the ISP. If the ESP is Outlook.com, then the information given
 by the Microsoft staff may be helpful. For all other ESPs, enquirers would have to ask the provider what their limits are. The information may be available on the ESP's website.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Earlier this month, the Old files HDD disappeared from my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On disk management the Drive just says Disk 1, on device manager it shows as a code im assuming which is the drive.

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is very conclusive to be driven by a faulty hardware or loose connection. Before we provide you more information regarding the issue and its possible resolution, have you checking if the storage appears in the BIOS of your computer. Also, have
 you tried reconnecting them?<br />

    <title>Missing Fonts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dee bigelow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing Fonts</h2>
                    After having to buy a new computer with Windows 10 and buying the latest Office software (what a joke, more like an activated card with a registration number) for one computer. I managed to recover the majority of my MS Word &amp; MS Excel files from my old
 Windows 7 failing computer.&nbsp; Now, I discover very LIMITED fonts in MS Office/Windows 10.&nbsp;Why?&nbsp; I read all the stuff on missing foreign language fonts and how to get them back, but these fonts were probably TrueType fonts like Curlz(Kurlz), Blippo, Bodoni,
 Boulder, Signature, and on and on.......!&nbsp; Not pleased!&nbsp; I used these all the time!&nbsp; And don't tell me I have to buy them - that went out before XP.&nbsp; The people at Microsoft are paid too darn much to keep messin with the little user of their system!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp; for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are glad to help you with the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you have lost fonts after upgrading to Windows 10. I would like to inform you that Office doesn't include its own fonts.&nbsp; It uses the fonts already installed on your PC.&nbsp; If the font set is not what you'd expect, locate the missing
 fonts online and install them if it's legal to do so. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can remove any changes that you've made to your display settings.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Press <strong>Windows + R</strong> and type&nbsp;<span><strong>control.exe </strong>
and hit <strong>enter</strong>.</span></span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Click on <strong>Appearance and Personalization</strong></span>, and then choose
<strong><span>Fonts</span></strong>.</span> </p>
</li><li>
<p>In the left pane, click <strong><span>Font settings</span></strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <strong><span>Restore default font settings</span></strong>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Hope the information helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if you need further assistance with Windows related issues.</span></p>
<p><span>We’ll be glad to assist you.</span></p>

            <p>Hi, Dee Bigelow</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what you've said, I gather that you found this topic:</p>
<p>
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start/some-fonts-are-missing-after-upgrade/95839dfa-0df2-4bc0-875a-fd6b57e61fe4">Some fonts are missing after upgrade</a>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, I'll assume that you've been able to follow the guidance there to get as many of the fonts that are included in the Windows license as you want. And, if you've installed MS Office, that would (or should) have installed a number of additional fonts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The particular fonts that you mention, however – Curlz (Kurlz), Blippo, Bodoni, Boulder, Signature – are not fonts that are included in either Windows 7 or Office. (Office does include some slightly different versions of a couple of those: Curlz MT and Bodoni
 MT, however.) You must have obtained those fonts from some other source – perhaps you purchased them from a font vendor such as Linotype, or perhaps they were bundled with some other app that you had installed on your Windows 7 system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are still able to read the drive on your old computer, then you should be able to find the files, copy them across and install them on your new computer. If you do this, I recommend that you take care to copy across&nbsp;only those that you're missing;
 otherwise you may be reinstalling an older version of one of the Windows or Office fonts and lose some functionality. The file names will be different that the font names you see in places like the Fonts control panel or Word's font picker list, but you can
 double-click the file in File Explorer to launch the font viewer, which will show you the full font name.</p>

    <title>No signal via Component SCART&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikeythewelsh  say:</h3>
<h2>            No signal via Component SCART&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys, I’m having no signal when connecting my xbox360 via Component SCART to my TV. (It’s an older 2006 xbox360 without HDMI port).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It works perfect via VGA on a PC monitor but my TV doesn’t have VGA or Component HD so until I get a converter I want to just connect SD via SCART.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve tried 2 component cables and 3 SCART Adaptors (official ones) on 2 TVs (tried and tested) and nothing happens (I used the switch on the cables to select between TV and HDTV)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m stuck now. The console seems like the fault but it works perfect on a VGA connection so the graphics hardware still doesn’t seem faulty. Is there anything else I can try?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Mike</p>

<p>Stupid question, but are you putting the TV on the right input setting? Some TVs will switch automatically when you turn the 360 on and some won't. Depending on the scart slot you're plugging into, it should be AV1 or AV2</p>

            <p><span>Hi Ron,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. I am glad to assist you on this.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Ideally, </span>Wireless Comfort Keyboard 1.0A would be compatible with Windows 10. However, if you face any issue you can install the keyboard drivers in a compatibility mode and check.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a. Download the driver from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on&nbsp;<strong>‘properties’</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c. Click on the&nbsp;<strong>‘compatibility’</strong>&nbsp;tab and check the box&nbsp;<strong>‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’</strong>&nbsp;and select Windows 8/8.1 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps. </span><span>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Black Screen after forced Windows update on 2 computers, 1 reset and 2nd has completely failed</h2>
                    <p>One of those forced Windows 10 updates just wiped out both of my Toshiba laptops with Windows 10 . In both cases the computer said it was updating windows, like normal, then when it went to start it went straight to a black screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first computer had a black screen with a cursor and was fixed with a USB recovery disk and a reset and reloading all of my programs (not happy at all). The second, my best computer, just has a black screen. No cursor. (extremely angry right now)</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I tried a restore and it said unable on any restore point. That happened with the first computer.&nbsp;</li><li>I tried Startup Repair and that got a "couldn't repair your PC". Log File: D:\WINDOWS\System32\Logfiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt. &nbsp;</li><li>I tried to reset it and keep files but it said it was unable. Specifically it says "There was a problem resetting your PC" around 5%.&nbsp;</li><li>I tried to reset it and delete files and it still failed around 66%.&nbsp;</li><li>I then tried to Use Another Operating System and when I select that it shows two options, Windows 10 Volume 2 and Windows 10 Volume 2. Neither works. The Volume 2 was a new thing, that had not been there earlier.&nbsp;</li><li>Now everything shows Volume 2 &nbsp;</li><li>I tried to restart this Toshiba pressing 0 and redo the whole thing. It flashed up HDD RECOVERY MODE and nothing else happened.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>I can access the command prompt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a recovery usb I am using. I can access the system via F2 and F12 on start up as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other solutions?&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>We have been seeing black screen issues of several types after upgrading to Windows 10. The main causes observed so far are driver issues, output to unexpected port, and possibly also issues with the Lock Screen app. Please use these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>If you see the black screen or have a flickering screen <strong><span>before sign-in</span></strong>:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Try connecting to different video outputs on the PC. Sometimes a change in driver can cause the video to be sent:
</span>

<li><span>To a different Adapter: from integrated graphics to a discrete card or vice versa.
</span></li><li><span>To a different output: from HDMI to DVI, DisplayPort to VGA, or any other combination.

            <p>1. I tried a different monitor and I still get the Toshiba startup screen and the windows recovery disk all work on the monitor but without it the screen still boots to black.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The video graphics card was up to date this past week, I checked it. The only thing that changed was the windows update and then the screen failed. The update is the problem. It was forced on to the computer and right now it has ruined my computer. I cannot
 use it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I cannot boot up in safe mode as the screen is black. There is no way I can get to the login screen. The screen is flat out black. There is nothing there to work with. Nothing to see. Nothing pops up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>-----</p>
<p>I know the computer is not the issue given the fact the computer I am on right now works perfectly fine in Windows 10 after I rolled back the Windows update forced on it this weekend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am concerned about now is all of the Windows Volume 2 stuff. It shows no restore points, but earlier when I went to recovery mode it didn't say Volume 2 and it had multiple valid recovery points.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do from the command prompt to fix this since the Windows Recovery USB has thus far proven to be useless.&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Unable to view photos after moving from iPhone to Windows PC, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christos k  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to view photos after moving from iPhone to Windows PC, &#40;Files are getting corrupted&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>Today my mum was trying to copy paste files from her phone to her PC hard drive. It's something that should be a standard operation and something which shouldn't go wrong. My mum use cut in order to clear up space on her phone in the process, of course.
 Right out of the gate it was acting very strange, taking around 20 minutes to transfer a few hundred photos from an iPhone 3G. Very few of the files were more than 2 megabytes and there were only a few videos. To my surprise, when checking to see if the photos
 transferred properly, around half of them were not viewable by Windows Photo Viewer. At first I thought it may be a problem with the iPhone's file format, however there were many pictures of the same format which were viewable. When I looked deeper, it showed
 that all of the corrupted photos where 613MB. Yes, 613 megabytes. When opening these files in a hex editor I saw 613MB's worth of 00 bytes, as well as a header that was either overwritten by the 00s or completely corrupted. The phone was connected by USB the
 entire time during the transfer and continued to be connected just fine afterwards. Now the photos, as far as I'm aware, are irrecoverable. If anyone has had this problem and actually recovered their photos I would love some help, but absolutely no file repair
 programs are working (not surprising, given the extent of Microsoft's idiocy) and I have not found anyone with the same problem anywhere on the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>
</p><p>For the past few days I have been attempting (to no avail!) to install Xbox One SmartGlass to my Windows 8 Surface Tablet. On the installs window, it either gets stuck at pending or downloading, with absolutely no progress made. I have attempted this at
 3 different locations with different internet connections, and have restarted my PC. I am able to download other apps. I am getting an Xbox One this week and find it imperative to be able to have this connectivity.</p>

            Thank you, Lavanya. I had actually cleared the windows store cache before to no avail. I called the support line and the gentleman on there was helpful enough to get me past this issue. It turns out, no apps were able to install and I deleted a few things
 out of a folder.

<h3> sciguy77  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t change the default program to open certain file types any more</h2>
                    I have been opening the .package file type for months using a specific .exe designed to handle it. &nbsp;I got up this morning and clicking on a .package file brought up the "Choose a Default Program" screen. &nbsp;I selected the proper program but it didn't show
 up in the recommended program screen, and I can't find any way to make it use the .exe by default. &nbsp; I already tried to change it in the control panel's default programs selection area and hot the same result. &nbsp;I can still open the files by starting the program
 manually and choosing the "Open" option, but that's such a tedious, repetitive task! &nbsp;This program is used to package graphics files into a specific format, and it isn't uncommon to open and close .package files 5 of 6 times in a 10 minute period. &nbsp;I really
 need to fix this ASAP. &nbsp;My productivity has come to a near standstill.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm running Win7 64 bit, &nbsp;The program in question is a small stand-alone that's always been in it's own folder in the downloads library. &nbsp;I tried moving it into the program files (x86) folder, but that didn't help. &nbsp;Windows recognizes the program when
 I make the request to select the default program. &nbsp;When I try to use it however, it isn't an option.</div>

    <title>HOMEGroup - Network discovery and file sharing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carol_937  say:</h3>
<h2>            HOMEGroup - Network discovery and file sharing</h2>
                    <p>I have set up a home group and have a netbook&nbsp; added to the network and working correctly. However when I try to connect a laptop I continually get rejected. The main pc can see the laptop on the network and the laptop can also see the main pc.&nbsp; The laptop
 is invited to join the Home group.</p>
<p>From whichever direction I come, I am told that" Windows cannot set up a Home group on this pc".</p>
<p>From previous discussions I looked at advanced options and see that network discovery/file sharing is unchecked on the lap top, so changed this to discovery/share and saved it. However this save is not actioned by Windows 10 as after each failure I find
 the change has not been made.</p>
<p>I even changed the option and saved it, to then go back in again ( before attempting the HomeGroup joining exercise)&nbsp; but iI sees it back at its original unchecked position.</p>
<p>Rebooting to clear all system error logs does also not help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is most frustrating. I see from a previous discussion a suggestion to disable virus software, and then re-attempt but this seems rather drastic and I would rather not do this as surely the operation to add a laptop to a home group should be simple and
 easily available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should emphasise that pc, lap top and notebook are all at the latest update to Windows 10 so this cannot be a problem.&nbsp;+</p>
<p>Can any one help please.</p>

<p>Hi Kristine,</p>
<p>I had used the network trouble shooter already on a number of occasions. However nothing venturd nothing gainede, have tried again and once more it is&nbsp; &nbsp;of no assistance. It cannot identify the probleml</p>
<p>To eliminate Wi Fi as a potential problem, I have connected the Home PC to a port on the master server via direct Ethernet and also connected the laptop by Ethernet. The two are in adjacent ports on the Main server itself. Both as one would expect are working
 correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However if using the laptop to accept the main pc invitation to join the home group, it fails. Once again the network trouble shooter is of no use.</p>
<p>If you&nbsp;look at the advanced comms &nbsp;( file&nbsp;sharing etc permission is not set by Homegroup software on the lap top)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;If you start the process again but first check the file sharing box on the advanced comms, then save it before accepting the invite . It still fails&nbsp; After failure When you look at the advanced comms you see that the box has not been saved or possibly it
 has been unchecked by the Home pc software following the failure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;It is most frustrating. Perhaps after all, it is the virus checking software on the lap top that is preventing file sharing etc&nbsp; to prevent import of viruses from other machines. However would like your advice please. As a last resort will try &nbsp;deleting
 the virus checker,then try acccepting home group invitation and if OK re-install the vrus checker on the lap top but it seems rather
</p>
<p>messy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
We appreciate your response. There are times that antivirus or malware-prevention software prevents you from getting connected or sharing files. We suggest turning off your antivirus software temporarily and then try to connect to your HomeGroup. Once you’re
 already connected to your HomeGroup, try sharing files.<br />
<br />
The instructions on how to turn off your antivirus software depend on the software you’re using. To learn how to turn it off, check the documentation for your antivirus software. Don’t forget to turn it on once you’ve successfully connected your laptop to the
 HomeGroup network.<br />
<br />
Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need additional assistance.

<h2>            Removing &#34;More Games From Microsoft&#34; from the games menu</h2>
                    How do I remove the "More Games From Microsoft" item from the games menu in Windows 7? I found how to remove items from the games menu, which is nowhere nearly as easy to edit and customize as it was in Vista, but that one item does not appear in the same
 location. I don't use it except on accident, and I'd like to get rid of it.

            <p>Win7 does have a couple of nuisance 'features' such as this. You didn't specify a location so</p>
<p>I'll suggest several options -<br />
Go to your <em>User\AppData\ Local\Microsoft\Windows\GameExplorer</em><br />
</p>
<p>I don't expect this folder would get in your way, but it contains internet shortcuts
</p>
<p>(<em>More Games From Microsoft),</em> and other stuff for numerous games, but not all games I have installed.</p>
<p>I've renamed the folder, and the games seem not to be affected,&nbsp; but the Windows is likely to&nbsp; regenerate a new one at some point anyway (probably after I've forgotten it exists again).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>- I've never seen a "<em>More Games From Microsoft</em>" folder/item anywhere (or it's been that long),
</p>
<p>but Start menu search&nbsp; for the term&nbsp; leads to to those internet shortcuts&nbsp; above being in this folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The <em>Games</em> folder in the <em>Start Menu</em> can also be cleared. </p>
<p>While you&nbsp; will likely get a message that you cannot delete this folder directly from the Start Menu, you can delete the folder, or what lies within via -<br />
<em>C:\ Program Data\ Microsoft\ Windows\Start Menu </em>(A shortcut for this folder&nbsp; pinned&nbsp; to the<br />
Windows Explorer Task Bar icons jump list can be handy for managing the Start Menu).<br />
- This folder may also return at some time, as some games automatically install a shortcut to this location, but if you don't have games that do this it may not reappear.<br />
</p>

<h2>            Alienware M-17X Wireless Problems</h2>
                    Hello All :)<br />
<br />
I've got a pretty new Alienware M-17X (Dell), 3 months old, ***very*** solid under Vista - 64 bit system.&nbsp; I did a clean install/upgrade (format C: - then install) loaded all the Dell W7 drivers for the system and thought I was in pretty good shape.&nbsp;&nbsp; Until
 I tried running the system on wireless.&nbsp; If it's plugged into an ethernet cable everything is good *including* connecting to a wireless connection.&nbsp; However, as soon as I unplug the ethernet cable it seems like the wireless card is going to sleep - because
 everything to do with the wireless card becomes unavailable.&nbsp; No networks at all show up on the card utility -and the connection that was working fine a moment before is now gone.&nbsp; I've done some reading on several forums and disabled the check box "allowing
 the computer to turn this device off to save power" on the Power Management tab of the Network adapter properties - but that hasn't changed a thing.&nbsp; I've got the most current driver for the Broadcom wireless adapter 5.30.21.0 A02 of Oct 14, 2009.&nbsp; The Dell
 Tech Team support which is superb has no clue and is ready to replace the card - but from reading on the forums it seems like the problem runs much deeper.&nbsp; After all under certain circumstances the card runs fine (with an ethernet cable connected - lol -
 or under Vista)<br />
<br />
Come on Microsoft - lets dig for some answers here - you can google the number of hits on disconnected wireless adapters under Win 7 as well as I.&nbsp; I'm a breath away from going back to the Vista 64 backup image for this machine, and probably changing the last
 PC in the house for an Apple.&nbsp; I'd love an answer Kevin - but DON'T stick a canned reply in here.<br />
<br />
Regards,
                </div>

            Hi Abadyn, <br />
<br />
Thanks for posting. What version of Windows 7 are you using? Also is the version 64 or 32 Bit?
<br />
<br />
Thanks!

<div>Guide to properly solve M17x wireless connection problems</div>
</strong>
<div>by Glzmo</div>
<br />
<em>Since many new Alienware M17x All Powerful users, especially those using Windows 7 as their operating system are experiencing various problems with their wireless connection and are posting threads asking how to fix them over and over again, I've decided
 to write this guide to show them how to properly solve these common issues. The solutions in this guide have been created and designed for Windows 7 64 bit, but they may also work in Windows Vista, although these problems have been experienced by Windows 7
 users in the past.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>I. Can't connect to wireless Network and or see the Wireless Adapter when the Ethernet cable is unplugged</strong><br />
<em>If you sometimes or always can't connect to the wireless network, can't connect to the wireless network when the Ethernet cable is unplugged, can't connect to a wireless network unless you reboot once to get it working and other bizarre problems with being
 unable to connect to a wireless network, continue with section&nbsp;<strong>I.a.</strong>. Otherwise, continue with section&nbsp;<strong>II.</strong>.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>I.a. Disable Device sleep on disconnect</strong><br />
<em>Newer Nvidia Ethernet drivers have a feature called Device sleep on disconnect. This is the culprit. Normally, it should only put the Ethernet adapter to sleep when the cable is disconnected, but it's buggy and thus kills the wireless connection as well.<br />
Follow these steps to disable this feature on your Nvidia Ethernet Adapter:</em><br />
<strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;Open the Windows&nbsp;<em>Device Manager</em>&nbsp;by hitting&nbsp;<em>Win+Pause</em>, then click on&nbsp;<em>Device Manager</em>&nbsp;on the left side.<br />
<strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Double-click on&nbsp;<em>Network adapters</em>.<br />
<strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;Double-click on&nbsp;<em>NVIDIA nForce Networking Controller</em>&nbsp;(yes, that's the wired Ethernet adapter indeed).<br />
<strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;Click on the&nbsp;<em>Advanced</em>&nbsp;tab.<br />
<strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;Select&nbsp;<em>Device sleep on disconnect</em>.<br />
<strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;Set the&nbsp;<em>Value</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>Disabled</em>.&nbsp;<br />
<strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;Click&nbsp;<em>OK</em>&nbsp;and wireless should work again (might require a reboot afterwards, but probably not).<br />
<br />
<strong>I.b. Install different (older) drivers that don't have the Device Sleep on disconnect feature.</strong><br />
<em>In case the above doesn't work or you just aren't comfortable with these drivers, follow the instructions below (if step&nbsp;<strong>I.a.</strong>&nbsp;has been successful, you won't need to follow these steps):</em><br />
<strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;Click on the Windows Start Button in the Task bar.<br />
<strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Click on&nbsp;<em>Control Panel</em>.<br />
<strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;Click on&nbsp;<em>Uninstall a Program</em>.<br />
<strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;In the list, double-click&nbsp;<em>Nvidia Drivers</em>.<br />
<strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;Mark&nbsp;<em>Remove only the following</em>.<br />
<strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;In the box below, check only the Nvidia Network driver.<br />
<strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;Click on&nbsp;<em>Remove</em>&nbsp;and follow the uninstaller instructions.<br />
<strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;Reboot the system if prompted to.<br />
<strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;Download a different (older) Nvidia driver.<br />
<strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;Install the older driver.<br />
<strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;When asked which drivers you wish to install, choose only the Network driver.<br />
<strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;Follow the installer instructions and reboot your system if prompted to.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>II. Low or fluctuating Wireless connection speeds</strong><br />
<em>If you have problems with low wireless connection speeds (such as speeds dropping over time, speeds being far lower than they should be and other odd things) or wireless connection speeds fluctuating wildly for no apparent reason, install the&nbsp;<a href="http://support.us.dell.com/support/downloads/download.aspx?c=ca&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;releaseid=R242438&amp;formatcnt=1&amp;libid=0&amp;typeid=-1&amp;dateid=-1&amp;formatid=-1&amp;fileid=350705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Dell
 Wireless 1510 drivers version 5.60.18.8</a>&nbsp;instead of the standard Broadcom drivers. Any older drivers will usually cause sub-par connection speed, even the ones that Dell offers on their M17x driver page (5.30.21.0). Note, however, that you'll have to install
 the driver&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">manually via device manager</span>&nbsp;as the driver has only been released for a different laptop and isn't officially available for the M17x yet - therefore&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">the setup
 program will not work</span>.<br />
Here is a step-by step on how to manually install the driver:</em><br />
<strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://support.us.dell.com/support/downloads/download.aspx?c=ca&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;releaseid=R242438&amp;formatcnt=1&amp;libid=0&amp;typeid=-1&amp;dateid=-1&amp;formatid=-1&amp;fileid=350705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download the Dell Wireless
 drivers version 5.60.18.8</a>.<br />
<strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Extract the&nbsp;<em>R242438.exe</em>&nbsp;file using an extraction utility like WinRAR or simply execute it and abort the installer.<br />
<strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;Open the Windows&nbsp;<em>Device Manager</em>&nbsp;by hitting&nbsp;<em>Win+Pause</em>, then click on&nbsp;<em>Device Manager</em>&nbsp;on the left side.<br />
<strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;Double-click on&nbsp;<em>Network adapters</em>.<br />
<strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;Double-click on the&nbsp;<em>Broadcom 802.11n Network Adapter</em>&nbsp;entry.<br />
<strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;Click on the&nbsp;<em>Driver</em>&nbsp;tab.<br />
<strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;Click on the&nbsp;<em>Update Driver</em>&nbsp;button.<br />
<strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;Click on&nbsp;<em>Browse my Computer for driver software</em>.<br />
<strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;Click on&nbsp;<em>Let me pick form a list of device drivers on my computer</em>.<br />
<strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;Click on the&nbsp;<em>Have Disk</em>&nbsp;Button.<br />
<strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;Click on&nbsp;<em>Browse</em>.<br />
<strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;Select the folder you have extracted the drivers you just downloaded in step&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;into.<br />
<strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;Select the sub-folder&nbsp;<em>DRIVER_US</em>&nbsp;(if you are in the US),&nbsp;<em>DRIVER_JP</em>&nbsp;(if you are in Japan) or&nbsp;<em>DRIVER_ROW</em>&nbsp;(if you are in the rest of the world), depending on the region you are in.<br />
<strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;Click on the&nbsp;<em>Open</em>&nbsp;button.<br />
<strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;Click&nbsp;<em>OK</em>.<br />
<strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;Select the driver that says&nbsp;<em>Dell Wireless 1510 Wireless-N WLAN Mini-Card</em>&nbsp;from the list (you may have to have to scroll down to see it - it shows up as second to last in the list for me).<br />
<strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;Click on the&nbsp;<em>Next</em>&nbsp;button.<br />
<strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;You will get a warning that the driver you are about to install may not be compatible with your hardware. Ignore the warning and proceed with the driver installation.<br />
<strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;Reboot your system if prompted to do so.<br />
<strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;Your new driver should now be installed properly and your wireless connection speed in order.<br />
<br />
<em>Hopefully this guide will help you solve your wireless connection problems and allow you to enjoy full wireless connection speeds on your Alienware M17x laptop.</em></span></div>

            Hello Srinivas,<br />
The issue started a few months ago.&nbsp; It was actually more strange at first.&nbsp; In the beginning after the BSOD the BIOS would not locate the boot drive, I would reboot maybe 3 or 4 times and then it would boot fine.&nbsp; I screwed around with some wires, and haven't
 seen that problem since.<br />
<br />
The BSOD started almost immediately after the PC was put together so, yes there were a lot of changes made to the computer directly before seeing the error.<br />
<br />
Yes, the computer boots fine after the BSOD.&nbsp; Error code <span>0x0000007A</span><span> is present.</span><br />
<br />
I will go through the steps you have recommended this evening and see if they will help.&nbsp;

<h2>            Re-installing original windows 10 after laptop repair replacement of hard disk drive</h2>
                    I had to have my hard disk drive replaced in my HP Laptop recently, but when I got it back it was back to windows 8.1 which is the version that the laptop had when I bought it. I had installed windows 10 when it first came out, also&nbsp;when it was free to
 do so. I LOVED it and want it back. #1. I can't find where to download it from in the Microsoft sites for free or without having to sign up to be some kind of guinea pig tester for the newest latest updated windows 10. #2. If I already had downloaded it on
 this laptop when windows 10 first came out, shouldn't I be able to re-install it without paying for it or becoming some kind of tester for it? I don't recall ever having a key code or anything when I installed it in the first place. They (Microsoft) just kept
 sending me adware for updating to their newer version of windows, so I did. I just clicked on the ad and installed it for free, no muss, no fuss. So I just want to re-install the original Windows 10 that I had been using for l

            When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.
<br />

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Wow Andre, all of those instructions are blowing my mind. I mean, thank you very much for those detailed instructions but I am just a check email, browse a bit, play some games, research a little home user, not an IT Dept. You said go to a working computer
 and download it to a disk as a clean install, ummm, I only have the one laptop HP Notebook with windows 8.1 that I want to download and install it on. I don't have a clean disk to put windows 10 on and then copy it over or whatever to my laptop, wouldn't know
 how to do that even if I had a disk. I just wanted to click on a download/install windows 10 like I did in the first place when it came out 2 years ago or so. It just downloaded and installed itself basically. I may just have to take it back to geek squad
 and have them do it for me. Thank you tho. Wish I knew what half of your instructions meant. Its a bit over my know how.

            You can download it on your computer running Windows 8.1 too. But, if you want something simpler, then you could download the Media Creation Tool then just upgrade again.
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Upgrade this PC now if you want to upgrade right away,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don’t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Anniversary Update on a system with limited space:
<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />If you want to perform a new install or just keep your files click Change what to keep. Once you have chosen the desired options, click Install to begin.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />That’s it, the Windows 10 Creators Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />How to prepare your computer before upgrading?
<br />
<br />Although updating to Windows 10 version 1709 or 1703 is a relatively simple process, similar to a repair upgrade; users should perform some basic pre-requisites before initiating the upgrade.
<br />
<br />If you are finding it difficult to carry out some of the steps described below, please review detailed instructions how to perform them:

            Hi Pippen1, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10

    <title>Resetting Password for Skype in latest version of 2017 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hiba-naseer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Resetting Password for Skype in latest version of 2017</h2>
                    <p>I recently made up a Skype ID in the latest version for 2018, synced with Microsoft. Now for some reason I just forgot my password and trying badly to reset my password by following the password reset procedure. However, even after filling up the entire
 password reset form at the Microsoft website, I am still unable to reset it because Microsoft is asking me numerous questions and despite of providing closest possible answers I receive an email from Microsoft stating that the information provided is insufficient
 to validate my account when its not like that. Its been 2 days and there's no progress on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need to recover my password and hence account asap as I need my conversation history for immigration purposes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me and that too really quick.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Since password reset is not working for you, your last option is to fill out the
<a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Account Recovery form</a>. I know how frustrating it is to fill out the form multiple times and still not able to recover the account. But please be reminded that such form is established
 in the interest of data and account security. This means that the system will only grant access to the person who will be able to pass the verification process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case, the best recourse I would strongly recommend you to do would be to revisit the answers you have provided on the form, change what you think may be inaccurate, and resubmit the form. Should that fail again, I suggest that you create a new account
 instead.</p>

</p><p>If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this post. <br />

Lets say i live in an apartment. and i'm using the apartment wifi/network which is made
to use for everyone who live in the building.

my question is&gt; can anyone see what i send/receive on my personal skype account?

            Hi
<br />
<br />Yes. The encryption can either be made by the application - in this scenario Skype - or the network (e.g. as a VPN does), or both.
<br />
<br />In the scenario you describe - using Skype over a public open wifi, you have encryption at application level (done by Skype).
<br />

<p>Hi Brad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm Uche, writing from New Delhi, India. Prior to your inquiry. . . you absolutely have nothing to worry about if you use the same wifi connection with others. Your IP(s) are all the same but your Skype activities remain private to you unless you get careless
 and allow other people to use your device without you logging out of Skype. I hope this answers your questions.&nbsp;</p>
